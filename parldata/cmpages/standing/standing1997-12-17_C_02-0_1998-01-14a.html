<B>Mr. Tony Baldry (Banbury):</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. During the Christmas recess, various reports in national newspapers suggested that this might be the final sitting of the Committee. I wanted the Minister, if he had graced us with this presence, to clarify whether the Government had changed their position of neutrality. It was suggested in more than one national newspaper that the Government had proposed a deal whereby if the Bill were abandoned, they would undertake to include provisions in a future criminal justice Bill to cover the intention of this Bill. It is relevant to the work of the Committee to know the position because members of the Committee have approached the matter constructively and there is little incentive to continue doing so if this is to be our final sitting and thus our proceedings today are a charade. It would be helpful to know whether the press reports are the result of journalistic imagination or whether there is any substance in them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett </B>(Denton and Reddish): Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Did the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) take the trouble to inform the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) that he would be raising the matter? It is clear that my hon. Friend has been delayed and it seems to me that there is no substance in the newspaper stories, but it would have been better for that to have been put on the record by my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. During the years that I was a Minister, I expected to attend Committees of which I was a member promptly and I do not think that I ever failed to do so. It is a gross discourtesy for the responsible Minister of the Crown not to attend a Committee at the proper and appropriate time. I cannot believe that any matter is so important as to detain him from his proper duty of being answerable to hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I read the reports with interest, predominantly that in The Daily Telegraph, but I confirm that no approach has been made to me concering a deal in which the substance of the Bill would be added to a future criminal justice Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you, Mr. Foster. That point helps me with the ruling that I was minded to make when the point of order was first raised. I have heard no reason to change that view subsequently. Unsubstantiated speculation in the press is not my concern as a legitimate point of order. I have had no communication from the Government and the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) has said the same, so we must assume that the standing of the Bill is the same as when the Committee last sat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I want to make a brief contribution following the recess, in support of amendment No. 18, which I moved. The purpose of the amendment is to put some flexibility into the Bill. Last night, I had a conversation with my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) about the problem concerning the fell packs in the Lake district. He argued that if the Bill applied to the fell packs, the control of foxes on Lake district fells might be made more difficult. He argued that an amendment enabling particular areas to be exempted would be helpful. Much as he disliked hunting and supported the Bill, which he voted for on Second Reading and for which he will vote again on Third Reading if we get the chance, he was concerned that stopping the fell packs might cause problems with controlling foxes. There would be a temptation for people to go to the fells with shotguns to control foxes.
<P>
That would not be a problem in most of the United Kingdom because permission would be required from a landowner--often a farmer--in order to go on to land with a shotgun. The Lake district, however, has a considerable amount of common land and getting permission is not easy there. The concern is that people purporting to be out with a gun to shoot foxes will roam around the fells claiming that they have a legitimate reason to do so. That will cause a hazard to other people using the fells.
<P>
I am not sure whether that argument is valid, but it illustrates the advantage of allowing variation from place to place in future if problems emerge. Will my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester deal with the question of whether there should be an exemption for national park areas where fell packs or other means have traditionally been used to control foxes?
<P>
I am not totally sympathetic to the fell packs and I shall give evidence later that they release foxes to hunt, which is a different activity from merely controlling foxes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> There are two reasons why I must urge the Committee to vote against the amendment. First, as a matter of principle, we should not use secondary legislation to tackle this issue. History demands that change should be through primary legislation and should not be left to the whim of a future Minister. My temporary right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) made that point eloquently in our previous sitting.
<P>
No political party will stand in future on a platform seeking to reintroduce hunting with dogs if the Bill is successful. Even if one did, I do not believe that the House would vote to bring back hunting with dogs. Had it not been invented already, I do not think anyone would suggest it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): Has my hon. Friend had any indication that the Conservative party's future strategy will not favour that policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I cannot speak for any political opponent, but my hon. Friend knows that this is a cross-party matter and that we have many good friends among the Conservatives on it. Any party that does not want a long stay in opposition will avoid hunting in its future legislative programme.
<P>
I have been highly critical of the aim behind the amendment. The Bill is about banning hunting with dogs and that is what the House voted for on 28 November. Licensing or regulation would enshrine in law something that runs counter to the will of the House and the British people. I am sceptical about any regulation or licensing. The Masters' of Foxhounds Association has a code of conduct which, in its opinion, is a form of self-regulation. I have put that to the test. On Second Reading, on 28 November, I mentioned an incident that took place at Wharncliffe primary school in Sheffield. A pack of hounds who were following a fox jumped over a 4-ft fence and went through the playground. Mr. David Rogers, the headmaster of the school, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``had the hounds jumped the fence minutes earlier a group of up to 33 children under five would have been in their path.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wrote to the Masters' of Foxhounds Association to see what it would do about the incident. It kindly replied that a committee of inquiry had considered the issue and had found that the masters were not in breach of rule 1. Rule 1 says that one must make sufficient effort to prevent hounds from hunting a fox into a built-up area, so the masters' conduct was fine. However, they were found to be in breach of another rule for not reporting the incident without delay. In the minds of those who practise self-regulation, it is far more important to report an incident promptly than to stop the incident occurring in the first place. That confines self-regulation to the dustbin.
<P>
At our previous sitting, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. &#214;pik) spoke of the need to license terrier work because of its important role in fox control, especially in his constituency. Most people with some knowledge of fox hunting would accept that terrier work is one of the cruellest aspects of the sport. Sending a dog into a confined space underground, without having any control over what occurs because of the nature of the underground terrain, is abhorrent. If one reads articles in magazines, such as Earth Dog Running Dog, written by people who enjoy terrier work, it is clear that they get pleasure from setting dogs underground to bait foxes. In some cases, dogs have been set underground to bolt out foxes in order to pursue a chase further. We cannot licence that or allow that to be enshrined in law.
<P>
The suggestion that only soft terriers, as opposed to hard terriers, should be allowed underground or that a limit should be imposed on the amount of time that dogs may spend underground is totally impractical, yet those are the sorts of issues that the Secretary of State would have to decide if he had to licence and regulate the activity. I do not believe that can be done. To licence such activity would be an obscene act by the Committee and the House.
<P>
Animal welfare is a central plank of the legislation. The amendment is concerned with defining what species of wild mammal it is acceptable to hunt, but the amendment begs the question of who will make that decision. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), who tabled the amendment, said that stag hunting was unacceptable, yet a Secretary of State could allow stag hunting with dogs to continue. Hare coursing is similarly cruel. Mink hunting is inefficient and totally disrupts the countryside. That only leaves the regulation of fox hunting. I believe that the amendment panders to the fox hunting fraternity, who claim that they can conduct their activities legally, lawfully and humanely.
<P>
I do not believe that a long chase, in which a fox is chased to the point of exhaustion because of its shorter sprinting ability compared with the staying power of a hound, should be regulated because it is inhumane. That is one of the reasons why I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
Then there is the kill itself, which I described on Second Reading. Evidence shows that the kill is quite horrific, and I cannot believe that the Committee could contemplate accepting the amendment and allowing that practice to continue as we approach the 21st century. The amendment would regulate where hunting could take place. If the Committee and the House decide that hunting should be stopped as a matter of principle because it is cruel and inhumane, how on earth could we argue that it is okay to hunt in some parts of the country but not in others? As for the earlier point about allowing fell packs in the Lake district to hunt, if it is cruel for hunting to take place in Worcestershire, surely it is cruel for it to take place in the Lake district.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish mentioned the effectiveness of fell packs in the Lake district. Fell packs are not a particularly effective way in which to control fox numbers. There are far more humane and efficient ways in which to control them. Some evidence suggests that artificial earths have been created in those locations, thus encouraging foxes to breed for a day's sport and pleasure. I do not think that the Committee could encourage such activities.
<P>
As for the times when it is okay to hunt and not okay to hunt, the Wildlife Network's submission to the debate proposes that cub hunting--autumn hunting as it is so quaintly known--should be dispensed with in favour of a shorter hunting season. If we were considering fox hunting simply as a way in which to control the fox population, which I am told is the purpose of fox hunting, I would suggest that killing a vixen when it is pregant is an effective way in which to kill foxes and control their numbers. Killing cubs when they are young and have not gained the skills to evade capture is also an effective way in which to reduce fox numbers. I do not believe for one moment that fox hunting is about controlling fox numbers. I think that it is about sport--pleasure, pure and simple.
<P>
The cynic in me suggests that a shorter season has been proposed because the thought of chasing a pregnant vixen is not especially nice. Perhaps pregnant vixens do not run as fast or for as long as other foxes and the hunters do not get the same day's entertainment and pleasure. Why have a close season to control fox numbers? Shooting would not have a close season. If a fox is a pest or a nuisance, someone could be called out to get it shot quickly, humanely and without fear of breaching a close season agreement. That is why I am against the amendment and urge the Committee to vote against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Martin Salter </B>(Reading, West): I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 1, line 5, after `who', insert `intentionally'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 30, in page 1, line 7, after `hunting', insert `intentionally'.
<P>
No. 36, in clause 5, page 3, line 24, leave out `intentionally'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> The amendment relates to the definition of intentionality, which was discussed on Second Reading on 28 November by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell)--who, I gather, was the Attorney-General long before I was elected to the House. The right hon. and learned Gentleman made several key points, which were subsequently adopted by the Countryside Alliance and the British Field Sports Society. They have helped to alter the public's perception of a matter that should be of concern to all participants in the debate and, in particular, my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester. It concerns an owner who takes his dog for a walk in a public park, if the dog temporarily runs out of control, will the owner be liable under the Bill's punitive measures? There has been considerable scaremongering about that matter. For example, a letter from the Countryside Alliance was published, apparently written by a Mr. E. Mort--I do not know whether that name is genuine as several anonymous letters have been in circulation. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Now that Michael Foster's proposed Bill to ban hunting has been published I wonder how many people realise how far reaching it is? Under its terms, anyone walking a dog off a lead can face prosecution, fines, even jail, if their dog chases a rabbit or a squirrel, whether or not it catches it. How can you prove you didn't encourage your dog?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on in a similar vein. We are all used to the cut and thrust of political debate, but we should lay this matter to rest. In the interests of so doing, we must properly scrutinise the Bill's definition of intentionality.
<P>
John Mortimer--who, I am sad to say, is connected with the Labour party--produced an interesting analysis of the problem. I shall ignore the temptation to quote some of the four-letter words that are contained in his article, which appeared in The Daily Telegraph--
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin McNamara </B>(Hull, North): The Labour party is a broad church. Does my hon. Friend agree that there is at least a ray of hope for that honourable gentleman's political salvation because he is at least a member of the Labour party? We can pray for his full political conversion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I thank my hon. Friend, who may have more experience of praying for John Mortimer's political salvation than I do. I know that my hon. Friend is a deeply religious man, so that mantle falls more naturally to him than to me. I trust that my remarks will be taken with a degree of jest.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> Than I shall also pray for my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I thank my hon. Friend.
<P>
Mr. Mortimer presented his argument in a clear attempt to whip up the public's fears and to alter their perceptions. By way of illustration, I must share with the Committee an event that I witnessed some years ago in my constituency of Reading, West. My then partner was the owner of a particularly unruly Dobermann--in fact, she was the owner of two unruly Dobermann pinschers, but I want to discuss one of them. That dog, which was called Hannah, was off the lead in Prospect park in Reading one day, when she unfortunately mistook a small Yorkshire terrier, which was owned by a fur-clad lady, for a squirrel, a rat or some other small mammal. Sadly, she captured the aforesaid Yorkshire terrier and proceeded to run round Prospect park with it in her mouth, wagging her tail. The Yorkshire terrier was terrified, but not as terrified as the lady concerned. It was a distressing sight. Some of my constituents found it amusing; others did not. I am pleased to report that the Yorkshire terrier was removed unscathed from Hannah's jaws and everyone was able to resume their normal enjoyment of the park. That example is a classic illustration of the problem with which we are presented and the public perception and worry that exists. It is with that in mind that we need a proper and perhaps lengthy discussion of the definition of intentionality.
<P>
<B>Miss Ann Widdecombe </B>(Maidstone and The Weald): I am somewhat surprised at the need for the amendment. Clause 5(1) clearly states: ``In this Act `hunt' means intentionally'', so the word ``intentionally'' is already explicit in the Bill. Although I have no objection to making it even more explicit--if it can be--by repeating it elsewhere in the Bill, it seems unnecessary.
<P>
Those who oppose the Bill have whipped up deliberate scaremongering. Given his profession, I cannot believe that John Mortimer could not read the Bill and understand clearly that the word ``intentionally'' was already in it. Therefore it is a waste of time, but if the other side--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> There was an exchange on the Floor of the House with the former Attorney-General on that very point. Therefore, it appears that quite a few people who have a fair knowledge of the law have found it a difficult issue.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Indeed, but my right hon. and learned Friend the former Attorney-General subsequently confirmed to me that he believed that it was possible, even given clause 5, to put a different construction on other parts. I therefore welcome the fact that the wording is being made explicit. It is nevertheless misleading, because ``intentionality'' is clearly defined. If the matter came before a court of law I cannot believe that clause 5 would not be regarded as an overriding definition, because it says that ``In this Act `hunt'


''--that is to say, wherever ``hunt'' appears--``means intentionally''.
<P>
I thought that I was surrounded by animal lovers on this side of the Committee, so I was appalled by the mirth that was exhibited over the unfortunate experience of the Yorkshire terrier. I do not find that at all funny and it speaks volumes about the increased need for people who own dogs with that sort of disposition to keep them under proper control.
<P>
When we insert the word ``intentionally'' into other parts of the Bill over and above clause 5, we are doing so not because we have got it wrong and not because those who drafted the Bill did not write intentionality in in the first place, but essentially as an almost superfluous counter to a very mischievous campaign that has been whipped up, despite the fact that it was clearly said on Second Reading that intentionality was already written into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I oppose the amendment. With your agreement, Mr. O'Hara, I should like to examine some of the arguments that were used on Second Reading and some of the issues that have since arisen.
<P>
Given the point of order that you rightly ruled out of order at the start of these proceedings, it is sad that the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) is not in his seat. He is a member of the legal profession and I am sure that he would have wanted to debate these points. His right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire, the former Attorney-General, raised the matter on the Floor of the House. The Committee has a duty to examine what the right hon. and learned Gentleman said and to determine whether he was right or wrong. He said that the Bill
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would have side effects which it is hard to believe are intended. I have studied it carefully and found that, in future, citizens who walk their dogs on commons will need to keep them on a lead''.--[Official Report, 28 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 1236.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>Nothing in the Bill makes that so. My colleagues have already said as much today and I reiterate that it is disappointing that we have not heard evidence from Opposition Members to illustrate how such a view has been able to permeate.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
After an intervention from my temporary right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald on Second Reading, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire went on to say that he had not taken his own advice as the former Attorney-General, but that he had taken the advice of two--not one, but two--Queen's counsels. Who were the two QCs who advised the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire? Who can make that information available for the Committee's scrutiny today? Allegations made either on Second Reading or in today's Committee have not been properly scrutinised by those hon. Members who wished to raise them. They are doing the Committee process a disservice by not making known the evidence that the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire raised or the legal arguments given to him by eminent Queen's Counsels, with whom I would not wish to argue.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter)--I was going to call him a temporary hon. Friend on this matter--gave a good example of the kind of action that can and does occur in parts of my constituency. Dogs rightly have the opportunity to run free, and nothing in the Bill reduces that opportunity. The use of that issue by hon. Members who wish to stop the Bill proceeding is tantamount to a slur on the United Kingdom's dog owners. After the comments of the hon. Member for Banbury this morning--who I am sure has important business in the shadow Cabinet, if only he were in it--is it not time for those hon. Members to come clean and say what they mean? Do they agree with the Countryside Alliance? Do they agree that the Bill would make it compulsory for every dog in the country to be on a lead in every park? That is all we want to know. Do they agree with the misinformation and disingenuous information that is being used by those who seek to wreck the Bill? That is a simple question and I hope that we will receive an answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> We have to consider this legislation from two points of view. People who run hunts of various sorts will be able to obtain the best legal advice and examine the legislation in the light of that advice. Such people may receive conflicting legal advice, but at least they can obtain it. Clause 1 especially concerns me because we must consider those people who own a dog but will not be able to obtain such expert legal advice. They should be able to read the Bill and understand it without having to look at clause 5(1) to obtain clarification. All those who draft legislation should learn the lesson that it should be clear and understandable at first reading. A lawyer's training should not be necessary to link one clause with another.

<P>

<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> My hon. Friend appears to be saying that the amendment will make the Bill clearer. Clearly, if I have a Labrador off its lead on a common, I have not deliberately caused the Labrador to hunt. However, if I own two dogs--beagles, say--and I know that they have a predisposition to hunt, and I go for a walk on a common where hares are known to be--
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier (Harborough):</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I do not want to be unfair or deliberately tiresome, but can you confirm that the civil servants in the Committee are there to assist the Minister, not private Members? Notes have gone to and from the hon. Member for Worcester and the Bench to your right, Mr. O'Hara. I do not want to make a personal attack.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can help the hon. Gentleman. The people who are seen but not heard to my right are not civil servants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Perhaps they could be identified so that we can know who they are.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> They are advisers.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. George Howarth): Further to that point of order, Mr. Chairman. For the avoidance of doubt, any notes passed to my hon. Friend the Member of Worcester were not from civil servants. As this is a private Member's Bill, he has the right to have his advisers here and they have passed him notes, which is legitimate and in order. That is why they are there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I was under the impression, Mr. O'Hara, that the people to your right were there to advise the Minister. I am glad to have been corrected and I withdraw any suggestion that those people may be tainted by being civil servants.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I was, if you recall, Mr. O'Hara, at the point of walking two beagles known to have a hunting disposition on a common known to house hares. If I do not keep them on a leash, am I liable under the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> That intervention helpfully raises a point I was going on to. I did not intend to take Labradors, but lurchers. If one goes out with two lurchers to control a rabbit population, what happens if one of them sets off a hare? We have to consider individual intentions. The right hon. Lady suggested earlier that intention was already covered by the definition of hunt.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I want to be absolutely clear about scare stories that anyone who has a dog that has hunting characteristics will fall foul of the legislation and will not be able to take their dogs out for exercise.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): I am interested in the reasoning of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish in support of the amendment. Does he think that there is a danger that Members who are genuinely concerned about an issue already covered by the Bill will over-egg the pudding by tabling further amendments? Would it not be better to persuade people that the point is covered in clause 5?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I accept the argument that the matter may be covered by clause 5, but if the Bill is to be well drafted, anyone who is legally trained should be able to read what it means in one reading and should not need to put a complicated legal construction on different pieces of the legislation. A fundamental principle is that legislation should be easy to read and clear.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I am sorry to keep on at my hon. and temporary Friend, but amendment No. 36 would leave out ``intentionally''. Why take out something that assists clarity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> By rearranging the words, the first thing a person would come across on reading the Bill would be a reference to someone acting intentionally. The Bill then mentions the hunt. I accept the argument that intentionally is included later in the Bill. If it is mentioned twice, the court might have trouble interpreting it. Will the court decide that there needs to be two intents to hunt instead of one? All I am suggesting is that there might have been an advantage in the draftsperson putting in intentionally at the very beginning so that we do not have scare stories going around the country.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I am sorry to interrupt again, but clause 5 is a definition. It says that ``In this Act `hunt' means intentionally''. That encapsulates everything else. Is not that clearer than removing the definition and the word ``intentionally'' and putting them in other odd places which govern specific acts rather than the entire Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am not a lawyer, but I understand that lawyers may argue that there is a neatness in producing legislation that pleases lawyers. Parliament has suffered from that too often. I prefer legislation that is simple and straightforward for my constituents to read and understand. It would be simpler to include intentionally earlier in the Bill because it would be clear to someone without legal training that a hunt has to be carried out intentionally to be illegal. We may hear that in legal terms the Bill as drafted is more effective. All I want is something that is easily understood.
<P>
It is easy enough for people who want to run hunts professionally to obtain legal advice. We want to ensure that people in the countryside are not frightened. Unfortunately, a substantial campaign has been mounted in which leaflets and material have been sent out saying that by walking dogs, whether they are labradors or, in my case, lurchers, people are at risk of being covered by the legislation. In scrutinising the clause, we must allay those fears. We must make the Bill clear, either in a way that is easy for ordinary people to read, which is what I favour, or in a convoluted way for lawyers to understand. It must be clear that the Bill will cover only those people who go out intending to hunt. That does not mean people who take out a dog, whatever its breed, for exercise.
<P>
I will listen with interest to the reply of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester. He was orginally one of the people who tabled the amendment. I suspect that he has kept quiet because he has gone into the fairly complicated legal argument. I plead that if we are to amend the Bill further, the priority is to ensure that ordinary people can read it without having to go from clause 1 to clause 5, and in some cases to other parts of the Bill, to understand it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> This amendment is important. It makes the intention of the Bill's promoters clear. We want the Bill to cover an intent to hunt and not something that happens accidentally. Where I live, many grey squirrels disport themselves and dogs out on a walk might suddenly have a go at them. Obviously, there would be no intent to hunt the squirrels, especially as most dogs cannot climb trees. Most grey squirrels seem to spend time on the roads looking for trouble--sadly, quite a number of their dead bodies can be seen from cars. It was trailed on Second Reading and before that old ladies walking their dogs in the park could suddenly find themselves criminalised purely and simply because of the propensity of their animals to start a hare, chase a rabbit or go after a squirrel. That is a ludicrous idea. The insertion of the word ``intentionally'' at the start is, therefore, of symbolic importance, despite the fact that the word ``intentionally'' occurs in the definition clause.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish raised the question of whether putting in the word ``intentionally'' twice might mean two intents. I think that that is straining those provisions somewhat. Nevertheless, ``intentionally'' is the word used, which is an adverb. The words ``with intent'' would be an adverbial phrase, which would raise the question of intents, but as intents do not exist under ``intentionally'' as an adverb, we do not need to pursue that matter further. What is important is that we say specifically and directly what we mean at the start of the Bill. That should be picked up again in the definition clause, which will reinforce the objectives of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ian Gibson </B>(Norwich, North): It seems to me that the word ``hunt''--which is at the forefront of the Bill--suggests an intention in itself. Does my hon. Friend agree?
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> It is possible that a person might go out without the intention of hunting, but might suddenly find himself in circumstances in which he is hunting, or--in the case of a fox--being hunted. I take my hon. Friend's point, but in such a case we would not be dealing with skilled lawyers but with barrack-room lawyers; the former Attorney-General seemed to be one on Second Reading. In fact, he made that point to my temporary right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald on Second Reading. My concern is for what the public understanding of the Bill will be. The words ``to hunt intentionally'' should be inserted at the start of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> My temporary hon. Friend sounds certain about his cause, but I wish to repeat my question; it must be answered during these proceedings. If it is known that dogs have a predisposition to hunt, and those dogs are then taken for the ostensible primary purpose of exercise into territory where animals that they would normally hunt are present, is that an offence under the Bill? I think that he can see my point. What might be the consequences if I go out with a group of friends with a lot of beagles?
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> I accept my temporary right hon. Friend's point, which is important. However, the general circumstances of a particular case and the evidence produced in court would have to be taken into account before the court came to a conclusion as to a person's primary purpose in taking his or her dog for a walk. That is a question of intent, which will be established after consideration of the evidence produced in court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> In normal circumstances, the argument is that legislation will be tested in the courts. My point was that people should be able to understand it without having to go to the courts. We do not want a little old lady to be brought before the courts because an individual has used the legislation to try to penalise her for some activity that was perhaps part of a feud between two different groups of people. The Bill must be understandable; it should not be necessary for the court to interpret it and to build up case law.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> With great respect to my hon. Friend, my temporary right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald had a point. There is a world of difference between taking a couple of Labradors for a walk in the park and taking a couple of beagles, as she suggested, which have a propensity to hunt. If the word ``intentionally'' were included in the Bill, it could help in the defence of innocent individuals. I agree that this is a difficult matter, but I do not think that we can solve it by discussing individual cases. Intent involves the possibility of a mens rea defence, but that is for the courts to establish.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I understand why my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West moved the amendment. We must ensure that the Bill deals clearly with the question of intent and that no one is brought to court who has not intended to commit an offence. As I said earlier, people have created scare stories and frightened dog owners by putting forward bogus arguments about what would happen if they took their dog for a walk and it chased a squirrel, which is a rodent and is therefore not covered by the Bill anyway. Dog owners should not be frightened into thinking that they have committed an offence in that situation. Whether that misinterpretation was accidental or malicious, it has unnerved and frightened people, as my temporary right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald said. We must ensure that we produce good legislation and allay those people's fears.
<P>
I was worried by one comment that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) made--he said that we must ensure that the Bill is clear and easy to read and to understand. That standard would require us to rewrite every piece of legislation that is on the statute book. I have yet to meet a member of the public--or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey) has said, any Member of Parliament--who can read through an Act and fully understand it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> I do not know a great deal about my hon. Friend's constituents, but my constituents would understand the provision that any person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``who uses, causes or permits any dog to hunt intentionally any wild mammal shall be guilty of an offence.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is how the clause would read if the amendment were adopted.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> My constituents would also understand clause 5, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In this Act `hunt' means intentionally to course, search for, chase, pursue, harry''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>and so on. That clause puts the matter clearly, and it is unnecessary to complicate the situation further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> One problem that lawyers have is the way in which Bills are constructed. Would not it be better simply to say what we mean, rathr than to add a definition clause?
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> My hon. Friend has a good reason for making that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish seemed to suggest that the legal profession might be downsized, but my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) suggested that it might be expanded in order to rewrite the Bill. Our main task is to clear away this scare story at the start without reverting to the use of definition clauses.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. Our debate ends all suggestions that the Bill intends to pursue and persecute little old ladies and anyone else who lets a dog run off the lead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way--she has been very generous in giving way so often.
<P>
The simple truth, which all Committee members seem to accept, is that people who want the Bill to fail have put out information that is clearly not true. I do not see how anyone could possibly misinterpret the Bill. People involved in the campaign against the Bill have lost in the opinion polls, have lost the argument, have lost the vote and have now lost their marbles. We must cope with that. If my hon. Friends are saying that the concept of intentionality should be introduced as early as possible in the Bill, perhaps it should be included in the title so that the Bill becomes the Wild Mammals (Intentional Hunting with Dogs) Bill. That would make the position clear at the very start and there would be no reason to discuss the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must remind the Committee that interventions should be brief and that there cannot be interventions in interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I should be grateful if you would advise the Committee at what point it could, if it wished, amend the long title of the Bill to insert the word ``intentional'', or is it too late to do so?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There will be a point at the end of our proceedings when that might be possible should the Committee be so minded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I shall bring my comments to a close to allow my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon to continue so that my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) may intervene if he wishes.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> It is somewhat difficult to pick up the subject after such lengthy interventions in interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I shall give way for the last time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> What about my lurchers? If I am legitimately rabbiting with two lurchers on a hillside and set off a hare, would it be intentional if I know that there is occasionally a hare on that piece of land? It is not easy to persuade lurchers not to set off in pursuit of rabbits and hares.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. The point was also raised by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald. The intent must be on part of the person. My hon. Friend said that it was difficult to persuade lurchers not to chase hares. Similarly, there is no way in which legislation can say that if people are out with a lurcher which is chasing rabbits, they persuaded the lurcher to leave the rabbit and chase a hare. In that case there would be no question of intent.
<P>
I shall bring my comments to a close before any other hon. Member dares to intervene and I am here for another day--
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> That is a challenge.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> That is not a challenge.
<P>
I would like to hear some legal advice. I am clear in my own mind that clause 5 clarifies the point that concerns us all and the advice that I have obtained is clear that it covers the point. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester would tell me whether his legal advice confirms that and whether there is merit in the argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> The issue of intent was first drawn to my attention in literature that was floating around Buckinghamshire and which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``IF LABOURS' ANTI-HUNT BILL IS PASSED, ALL DOGS WILL HAVE TO BE KEPT ON LEADS WHEN IN PARKS, WOODS AND ON FARMLAND. THE PENALTY FOR CHASING ANY WILD ANIMAL, i.e. RAT, SQUIRREL, RABBIT . . .  IS A &#163;5,000 FINE''
<P>
</UL></FONT>and so on. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``CONTACT YOUR M.P. TO OPPOSE IT, OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES!''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That was pinned to a parish council notice board with no details of who put it up--presumably it was someone trying to be mischievous. What concerned me about intent was when the issue was raised by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire. He is a former Attorney-General so I presumed that he spoke with some knowledge of the subject. We have already heard a quotation from his comments on Second Reading when he said that citizens who walked their dogs on commons would have to keep them on a lead. The right hon. Gentleman went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I have not relied only on my own judgment on this matter, but have taken advice from two Queen's Counsel, who practise exclusively in criminal law, and they confirm the points that I am making.''--[Official Report, 28 November 1997; Vol. 301, c. 1236.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The question of intent is important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> My hon. Friend refers to the point I raised earlier about the advice given by two Queen's counsels to the former Attorney-General. Given the absence of any description by the, now missing, hon. Member for Banbury of what the former Attorney-General meant, has my hon. Friend received any details about that advice, which the Committee can consider?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I confirm that I have received nothing from the former Attorney-General and I have not requested the details of the advice because, once I revisited clause 5, it was clear to me that the Bill was tightly drafted. For example, clause 5(2) states that the definition of hunting,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``does not extend to . . . any wild rabbit or wild rodent''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> On the matter of the advice given to my right hon. and learned Friend the former Attorney-General, will my hon. Friend say what specific legal advice he has taken and at what level because, whatever remarks are made for political purposes, the fact is that my right hon. and learned Friend is an extremely skilled lawyer. If there is any doubt or ambiguity in his mind, it is deeply in the interests of those who support the Bill to sort it out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> That makes the point for debating the amendment in depth. I sought advice from Anthony Scrivener QC, who made it absolutely clear when the Bill was written that by expressly excluding wild rabbits and wild rodents, it will not be a criminal offence for dogs to chase rabbits, squirrels or mice. We must make the point to the public that the scare stories that have been spread for political purposes--not to make the Bill legally watertight--must be nailed as exactly that because they are nothing but scare stories and have nothing to do with the Bill.
<P>
Clause 5(1) defines ``hunt'' as,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``intentionally to course, search for, chase, pursue, harry, bait, attack, injure, or kill''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It could not be clearer. When people want to bring a prosecution under the Bill and need to know whether an offence has been committed, they can look at the definition in clause 5(1), which makes the position crystal clear.
<P>
Initially, I thought that inserting the word ``intentionally'' was a reasonable, belt-and-braces approach on the part of those who wished to clarify the situation, but I fear that to include the word ``intentionally'' or refer to intent twice may result in the prosecution being forced to prove intent twice, which could lead to some doubt in the eyes of those conducting the court case.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lembit &#214;pik </B>(Montgomeryshire): What possible logic is there in thinking that one would have to prove intent twice? The amendment seems to be a simple way to clarify the point, but hon. Members who support the Bill are making heavier weather of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If we insert a reference to intent so early in the Bill, as amendment No. 29 suggests, the Bill will read ``Any person who intentionally uses, causes or permits''. The fact that intent is covered in the definition of hunting means that the Bill is watertight, which will assist anyone who tries to bring a prosecution or assess a case. The legal advice that I have had from Anthony Scrivener QC also makes the position clear. I clarified the position with him again when the amendment was tabled by asking whether people would be certain what offence had been committed and when. He assured me that they would and I am inclined to believe that QC's advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> For clarification, has the hon. Gentleman obtained a legal opinion that one would have to prove intent twice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Yes. The advice was based not on political whim but Anthony Scrivener's legal experience.
<P>
It is important to consider intent, and we have discussed it fully during the past few minutes. The general public should know exactly what we are trying to do. The Bill is intended to stop the cruel and barbaric practice of hunting. Clause 5 covers whether individuals are actually hunting and the matter is clear. When people take their dogs for a walk on parkland, even lurchers that accidently chase rabbits and hares, the question will be whether those people intended their lurchers to chase and harry hares, and that is for the prosecution to decide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Illsley </B>(Barnsley, Central): My hon. Friend mentioned personal intentions, but I have been reading the amendment and the first line of clause 5. I do not want to complicate the issue, but clause 1 states: ``Any person who uses, causes or permits any dog to hunt''.
<P>
However, clause 5 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In this Act `hunt' means intentionally to course, search for, pursue, harry''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>If a dog is hunting as described in clause 1, the intention to hunt, as set out in clause 5, must apply to the dog. That brings us back to lurchers and beagles. If the dog shoots off intending to hunt, damage or injure a wild mammal are we then discussing the intention of the owner or of the dog? The purpose of the amendment is to specify whose intention it is as well as making sure that scaremongering is irrelevant. If the wording
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``permits any dog to hunt''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
remains in clause 1, we have to clarify clause 5. We should perhaps reconsider ``intentionally'' for clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If one reads the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``person who uses, causes or permits any dog to hunt'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and turns immediately to the definition of hunting, it is clear that hunt means
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``intentionally to course, search for, chase, pursue, harry, bait, attack''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is, to my mind, clear that the person using or permitting a dog to hunt is intentionally committing an offence. I am convinced that the Bill should remain as it is and I recommend rejection of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Has the Minister given any thought to that? Although he made it absolutely clear that he was here in a neutral capacity, that neutral capacity must be to ensure that the Bill is as well drafted as possible. Has he taken any legal advice about whether the Bill as drafted achieves what my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester wants it to achieve, or whether our worries about including ``intentionally'' at an early stage would be a better approach?
<P>
I believe that there is a procedure by which the Attorney-General may be asked to attend the Committee--our Attorney-General, as opposed to the former Attorney-General who was referred to earlier. I believe that it is a complicated procedure, but would it not be to the advantage of the Committee to ensure that it has that best legal advice?
<P>
Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley has received that advice and is in a position to give it to the Committee. If, however, he is not in that position, would we not be doing the House a service by asking the Attorney-General to attend the next sitting to back up either the legal advice that has been given, or the doubts and queries of the former Attorney-General? I suspect that the Minister now wants to say a few words, so I will stop; I may try to catch your eye, Mr. O'Hara, later on.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It might help the Minister if I made the Committee aware of the relevant Standing Order. Law officers and other Ministers may attend Standing Committees. If they are Members of the House, they may at their discretion take part in the deliberations of any Standing Committee--other than the Standing Committee on Regional Affairs--without being appointed to membership. They may not vote, make a motion or be counted in the quorum. It is therefore possible for a law officer to be invited. My interpretation is that it is for the law officer to determine whether he accepts the invitation. Perhaps that will help the Minister in framing his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> It is, perhaps, more helpful to the Committee than to me. I should remind my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish that there are two hon. Members for Knowsley present: my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara), who is in the Chair, and me, representing Knowsley, North and Sefton, East.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> As far as I am concerned, it is all Liverpool anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I will not take my hon. Friend down the road of the campaign that resulted when the Boundary Commission tried to say precisely that. Needless to say, my constituents and yours, Mr. O'Hara, wholeheartedly rejected that proposition.
<P>
The advice that I have is not legal advice; I have not sought nor been given any legal advice. The advice that I have from officials is that to insert a definition of ``intentionally'' into the Bill in clause 1(1) and in clause 5, as the amendments seek to do, would clarify the situation, rather than, as has been argued, make matters more confusing. Given that advice, I think that the amendment would be sensible, rather than have a negative effect. It is for members of the Committee to decide whether they choose to accept that interpretation. If the amendment were pressed to a vote, my view would be that it would improve the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I thank hon. Members for a useful, if slightly one-sided, debate. My permanent hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin) rightly pointed out the absence of the hon. Member for Banbury and the lack of any proper debate or scrutiny on the part of the Bill's opponents. They have completely failed to deal with a matter that was important to the debate that raged among the public. In the future, we should hear no more whingeing from those hon. Members who oppose the Bill that there has not been an opportunity for proper scrutiny of an important matter.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The crux of the debate was highlighted during the useful exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish and the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald. The arguments were well rehearsed and I accept the rebuke given by my temporary hon. Friend the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald that I used mirth to illustrate a serious point. However, my hon Friend the Member for Worcester did not answer all the points made about amendment No. 29. It is difficult for him to do so, because he has to find a balance of judgment. Does one accept the legal advice from Scrivener or from the former Attorney-General?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> To clarify the definition of intent, I have been advised that clause 5 could be more tightly written and I intend to table an amendment. We are still in the early stages of clause 1 and that amendment will come before us at a later date.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> Cold my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester clarify the effect of that amendment? In view of what my hon. Friend the Minister, speaking in his neutral capacity, said, it would be sensible to include ``intentionally'' and accept amendments No. 29 and 30, but vote against amendment No. 26, which would perhaps mean three votes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I invite my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester to clarify that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> According to my legal advice, the amendment that I will table later will, if there is still any doubt, put completely beyond doubt the definition of intention. I take on board the Minister's points about his advice from officials, but this is a matter of judgment and I not think that his advice makes a great deal of difference to the Bill. I am inclined to keep intent to clause 5, but to tighten the clause later. I expect to table an amendment today or tomorrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for this clarification. Given that he intends to clarify clause 5, I am sure that hon. Members will vote down my amendments, but I shall press on regardless.
<P>
The debate has been of great interest. We began with my personal friend's Doberman and moved on to beagles and lurchers, perhaps highlighting some sort of class issue. We can be grateful that my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) is not here, as we should have been talking about whippets and ferrets.
<P>
One should not underestimate the ability of the blood sports lobby--well organised in the black arts of lies and deception--to continue to exploit any weakness in the Bill. That lobby would be delighted to organise the prosecution of innocent dog walkers and to continue to scaremonger to denigrate the Bill. The need for clarification is clear. I welcome the intention of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester to amend clause 5. I leave it to Committee Members to decide for themselves whether it is better to accept the amendment and those grouped with it or to wait for my hon. Friend's further clarification on clause 5.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester should clear up this matter once and for all. The Minister said that including the word ``intention'' would make the Bill clearer. I agree--it would help the general reader of the Bill to know where he stands.
<P>
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester said earlier that the amendment was unnecessary and that the problem of having to prove two lots of intent might arise. He must consider carefully whether a major problem would be caused if we included the word ``intention'' in the Bill. If not, we could avoid doubt and confusion by including it--the general reader might also benefit. If valid prosecutions might fail because the word was included twice--doing so might make it necessary to prove intent twice-- I waver about whether to support the amendment or to leave the Bill unamended. Either way, the situation must be clarified.
<P>
My hon. Friend said that he would seek to amend clause 5, which may well be helpful. Is there any chance of his letting us know what sort of wording he is considering in that context? That would help us reach a decision. I realise that it is extremely difficult to handle any private Member's Bill and I must sympathise with him for being the target of such requests. I hope that he has had sufficient time to consult his notes and that he has found an answer to my question. If not, we could adjourn briefly for a minute or two to assist him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for those comments. The wording that I am considering introducing in an amendment to clause 5 is along the following lines: ``In this Act a person hunts who intentionally uses, causes or permits any dog to course, search for, chase, pursue, harry, bait, attack or injure''. That would incorporate some of the provisions of clause 1 into clause 5, which should put the matter beyond reasonable doubt. It would be helpful if my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West withdrew his amendment so that I can consult further. We could return to this matter at a later stage in the passage of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I am comforted by the assurances given by my hon. Friend, but it is in our broader interests to press this important matter to a Division. I must decline his request to withdraw my amendment.
<P>
Question put, That the amendment be made:--
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Could it be placed on the record that the hon. Member for Worcester, having put his name to the amendment, voted against it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is on the record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. May I draw to your attention the fact that it is almost midday on the second day of the Committee and we are still discussing the first line of clause 1?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order. It is for the Committee to make progress as it deems fit. Time has been allocated and full use is being made of that time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 19 in page 1, line 5, leave out `hunt' and insert `kill'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 21, in page 1, line 9, after `protection', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, for the purposes of killing a wild mammal,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 23, in page 1, line 12, leave out `hunt' and insert `kill'.
<P>
No. 25, in page 1, line 15, leave out `hunt' and insert `kill'.
<P>
No. 27, in page 1, line 18, leave out `hunting' and insert `killing any wild mammal'.
<P>
I am surprised that Opposition Members did not feel it worth moving their amendments. Given the comments that were made about the need to scrutinise the legislation to make sure that we got it right, I am surprised that they did not move their amendments. I would have thought that those outside the House who are anxious that the legislation is properly scrutinised will be amazed that Opposition Members did not want to spend--
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I must say that I share my hon. Friend's amazement. None of the amendments that have fallen to the Opposition to move has been moved. It would be helpful to the Committee to know whether the Opposition have adopted a general principle not to move amendments that they have tabled.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not think that that is a point of order.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> No, it was an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Before speaking to amendment No. 19--
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> As a matter of interest, I intend to move amendments at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Liberal Democrats intend to contribute later, but it is amazing that most Opposition Members do not seem keen to speak on the Bill. I understand that they may want to proceed quickly, but I would have thought that they would have a few words to say on the issues. We have a duty as parliamentarians to ensure that when legislation is made, we get it right. That point arose in our previous debate. I firmly believe that we have a duty to ensure that legislation is clear and straightforward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martyn Jones </B>(Clwyd, South): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish will comment on the fact that if opponents of the Bill continue not to move amendments, they will have no right to debate at length--
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I was under the impression--I may have got it wrong--that we were debating the amendment, not our notice or intention.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order. The remarks of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, who has the Floor, as distinct from the hon. Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) who made the intervention, flowed from an earlier point of order. I am sure that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish will come to the substance of the amendment.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I will do so. I may have been a little lazy in my preamble, but I wanted to explain why I want to probe whether we should include the word ``hunt'' or whether it would be clearer to everyone outside if we used the word ``kill''. I was making the point that I was disappointed that more people had not participated in ensuring that the Bill was effective and to the point. The word ``hunt'' is somewhat subjective.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Is my hon. Friend now on his amble, because it is his main amble rather than his preamble that I want to address?
<P>
I was very concerned when I saw the amendments. In a stag hunt, the dogs hunt, the stag turns and is shot. It is not the dogs that kill but the hunters who kill. If we leave out ``hunt'' and insert ``kill'', we will permit stag hunting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Yes, that is probably the interpretation. One of the difficulties with the Bill is the different attitudes that many people have towards stag hunting and fox hunting. We may aggravate that problem.
<P>
Hunting is a subjective activity. Killing, however, is not in any way subjective. If I cannot find something at home, my wife has a different and not very high opinion of my ability to hunt for it. She tends to assume that if I cannot find something, I have not looked or hunted for it effectively, and that someone else may be able to do it better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I accept my hon. Friend's point, but many of us who support the Bill are concerned about the fear in mammals that is caused by the chase. Similar to the point made by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald is the point that if the word ``kill'' replaces the word ``hunt'', an animal could be chased, which would cause stress and fear, without it being an illegal activity--as with a stag hunt. I do not think that that is the purpose of the Bill.
<P>
I do not want to return to clause 5--heaven knows, clause IV has caused us on the Labour Benches enough problems over the years. My hon. Friend said that the word ``hunt'' is subjective, but it is not when one reads clause 5 which explains what hunt means for the purposes of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I still think that even in clause 5, hunting is a relatively subjective activity. I do not want to go back to the lurchers, but there must be a fine line between going out rabbiting with a couple of lurchers and ending up with the lurchers chasing a hare. I do not believe that that would be hunting if it happened to someone on one occasion. However, I suspect that a person who regularly goes to a piece of land where he knows that there are a lot of hares will have crossed the line.
<P>
The question of the behaviour of animals has to be addressed firmly by the Committee. Time and again, the letters that I have received on the Bill contain the misguided belief that only people who live in towns give human values to animals. That is not only done by people in towns; it has been done throughout history. People have regularly used animals and attributed to them human characteristics. Aesop's fables come to mind, but I am sure that there are many other examples.
<P>
It is often assumed that animals behave in the same way as humans and that being chased is frightening and fundamentally bad for animals. I am not totally convinced by that argument. Nature is a cruel process and it can be argued that, due to the fact that the fittest survive, some animals will always have to endure being chased. If that is a feature of nature, it is all right.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a stag is not exposed to being hunted over a distance of 5km and more in its natural environment? Does he not see the difference between a long-distance chase and the behaviour of the wild animal in its natural habitat?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am prepared to concede that there is a difference between artificially created countryside, in which it is made very difficult or impossible for a fox to get underground, and the way in which stag hunting and hare coursing are organised. We must be careful not to draft the legislation so as to make impossible some activities that take place naturally. I am uncertain how to rewrite the Bill, but argue that some chasing may not be totally against the interests of the animals involved. I would not like stags to become farmyard pets. They are wild animals by nature and, by their nature, wild animals are hunted. They may no longer be hunted by hounds--the wolf and other predators have disappeared.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Exactly. My hon. Friend got there in the end. Anything that might in the past have chased a stag has long since disappeared, so there is now no natural way in which a stag can be chased; there is only the unnatural and artificial way created by man, which would still be allowed if the Committee were to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Should we make it impossible for a stag to be chased or should we ensure that, if it is chased, it is done in a way that is more natural than the artificial process that has been developed by hunts? If wild animals are not subject to nature, we may change wild animals. Is it desirable for that change to be allowed to take place? Do we want deer to become nothing more than zoo pets or do we want them to maintain their wild nature as a result of being chased?
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I am grateful to my temporary hon. Friend for the generosity with which he regularly gives way to me, but I cannot make the jump in logic that he asks. Apparently, if hounds do not chase deer, the deer will all become farmyard pets. I cannot accept that. My hon. Friend will know that, if one approaches a deer in the wild, it turns and runs because it has a wild, rather than a domestic, instinct. Deer will not be domesticated simply because they cannot be chased; they will continue to live as wild animals but, mercifully, when the Bill becomes law, they will be protected from the cruelties inflicted by man. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Yes, I accept the argument that deer will be protected from the cruelties now inflicted by man, but we shall also have started to modify substantially the natural habitat. How much more do people expect to change the natural habitat--
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> I am becoming rather baffled. Is my hon. Friend trying to suggest that somehow the red deer of Scotland will become the equivalent of a pussycat?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> The red deer of Scotland are still managed; a fair proportion of them are shot. I do not know how scientific a method culling some and not others is, but that is how they are managed in order to continue to protect them.
<P>
I suggest merely that if we insert ``kill'' in place of ``hunt'' in this particular place, it would be much easier for people to understand. Perhaps elsewhere in the Bill, amendments are required to prevent artificial hunts in which all the circumstances are contrived in favour of the hunters and to achieve a more--it is an awful phrase, and I keep asking for a better one--level playing field, in which the animal has a much more realistic chance of escaping.
<P>
If the animal escapes on most occasions, for some people, the problem would not be resolved because it is not only to the killing that people object. I appreciate that to the hon. Member for Basildon it is the hunt itself that is the obscene and nasty part, rather than the killing.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> My hon. Friend mentioned science and the work that has been done. Does he agree with Patrick Bateson, whose evidence shows that running an animal to the point of exhaustion would occur even if the animal did escape? The biochemical evidence is astounding on that fact. That factor is not part of the natural habitat or the natural ecological development of that organism with other animals in the environment. It is an unnatural, man-made, man-inflicted factor. It has nothing to do with the welfare of the animal itself, which my hon. Friend has not mentioned yet but which should be part of this. Running an animal to the point of exhaustion does not constitute hunting or killing, but would he concede that the animal does have some rights as well--the right not to be persecuted and not to have its biochemistry destroyed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I accept the argument that the animal should not be subjected to unnecessary pain. However, not such a long time ago, deer were hunted by wolves. The animal obviously experienced considerable pain if caught. If it escaped, it experienced--presumably--the same sensations that it is now suggested that the stag experiences when it is part of a hunt. Is my hon. Friend arguing that that should not have happened? Does he want to intervene?
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> indicated dissent.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Is it not the case that the debate that we are now heading towards gets close to the philosophical question that is at the heart of the Bill--the debate about what is natural and to what extent we should engineer the habitat--and which some hon. Members feel shows the flaw in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Our debate certainly gets to one of the issues that causes much anxiety. We need a proper debate; that is the purpose of tabling the amendment. It would make it much easier for people to understand the Bill. The amendment deals with the fears and anxieties of those who object to how deer, foxes and especially hares are killed--by being torn apart. It removes from the Bill the cause for anxieties that have been expressed by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald and others about the hunting process itself. I am trying to suggest that perhaps we should be rather careful about eliminating the hunting process. In the wild, animals are hunted--
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that foxes are a predatory, not a prey, species? Does he agree that it is therefore more cruel to hunt the fox than merely to kill it? Hunting is a deliberate, long-drawn-out chase; it is offensive. That is one of the main reasons for the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I accept that stag hunts, fox hunts and hare coursing have been created artificially. However, those activities can perhaps be reformed so that they cease to be artificial and weighted in the hunter's favour. We could return to something more like nature used to be, where some animals are preyed on by others. We do not want an artificial countryside that is nothing more than a zoo.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I am puzzled by my hon Friend's comments about reforming the activities. Fox hunting is unnatural. How can we reform the activities to make it more natural?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am not absolutely certain that hunting a fox is in itself unnatural. I am concerned that instead of the hounds chasing a fox that has a reasonable chance of going to earth or escaping in some other way, in a lot of fox hunts, the hunters set out beforehand to make it impossible for the fox to go to earth. In addition, they do not use the most efficient dogs to catch a fox. Hunters want a long chase across the countryside. That may be very nice for people who want to exercise their horses, but they do not need to chase a fox to do so.
<P>
An alternative may be to hunt for foxes with hounds with a view to catching the fox quickly. That would not do the sort of harm to the fox that the hon. Lady is concerned about. The problem is that there is a so-called sport that is not about hunting, catching and killing the animal, but is contrived and artificial. A return to the original activity might be more acceptable. We should ask whether we want to stop hunting because of the nasty killing or because of the process. The Committee may feel that both should stop, but we should look for a middle course to show that the offence is killing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I was interested by the interventions on my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is leaving, may I say that his remarks encapsulated the heart of the Bill? Is it about hunting or killing? The point is important and I hope that the hon. Member will stay to debate it. I also welcome back the hon. Member for Banbury who missed our debate about legalities and intent on which, with his background, he would have been able to help. Perhaps he will contribute to our debate on what the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire called the heart of the Bill.
<P>
Is the Bill about the hunt or the kill? I cannot agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. For me, the Bill is about the hunt, the setting out and the kill. Some would have it that the kill does not always take place, but the kill is only the end of the suffering caused to the wild mammals covered by the Bill. There is plenty of evidence for that suffering. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North is more eminent than myself as regards the scientific evidence, especially that given by Professor Bateson. The hunting lobby has never successfully challenged that evidence and has failed to make known any scientific evidence showing that Professor Bateson's work on stag hunting is in any way flawed. Once again, I challenge anyone here who can produce the necessary evidence--just as we asked for the legal advice that the former Attorney General had received--to bring it to our attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> There must have been a natural process in the past in which stags were chased by something. To a certain extent, therefore, being chased is important if we want stags to continue to be the sort of creatures that they are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> My hon. Friend seems to make the point that because there is a natural process, we should change the Bill to encapsulate that process. I do not think that the Bill changes that process.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> I do not want to indulge in a boring lecture about biology and population dynamics, but there is no doubt that nature is red in tooth and claw. Darwinian ecology and evolution are widely accepted within the scientific community and they quite clearly show that animal populations adapt to one another. There are truces and battles, but that is balanced out in the sense that the populations of the organisms relate to each other. Only when human beings interfere in that process is that balance upset. Ecology has taught us clearly that, if left alone, populations adapt to each other--it is in some way related to an increasing food supply. That is why foxes have increased in number--more food is available. Only when the chase and the hounds are introduced is the natural process knocked out of gear.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman proceeds, hon. Members should be reminded that, especially in the case of interventions, it would be helpful if they addressed their remarks forward to the Chair, the rest of the Committee and, most importantly, to the microphone that feeds the recorder.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> It was the excitement of the chase, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his short lecture on the various biological elements that concern us. The intervention of the chase and of the hounds creates the change in nature. That is the critical point on which I would disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. I agree that there is a natural process, but the intervention of the chase and of the hounds changes it.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said that there was a natural procedure and mentioned that stags were chased naturally. Will my hon. Friend the Member for Hove address the point, which was not dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, that fox hunting is a totally unnatural activity? There is nothing natural in hunting a fox. The hunt is as offensive as the kill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I am grateful for that point--I was just about to speak about foxes.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> I would like us to consider the position of the red deer in Scotland. The deer are not subject to a great deal of natural hostility, but to men with rifles. Unless we count men as animals, how does that situation constitute a natural balance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> When asked a question about Scotland, I am always conscious of the fact that my constituency is closer to France than Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman mean closer politically?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I meant that it was closer physically--about 50 miles away.
<P>
My understanding is that any hunting of deer in Scotland is illegal. Any hon. Member who knows that it is going on should make it known to the local constabulary, who would be very interested.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> My point was also made by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish--he suggested that somehow or other there should be a counting system. One could, for example, count the number of dogs or human beings pursuing a fox. Has my hon. Friend considered the fact that there have not been great changes in the number of red deer in Scotland, although the deer are not hunted by packs of dogs? That drives a hole into his argument. My Hon. Friend the Member for Basildon may discuss that matter in greater detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I am sure that she may. My hon. Friend's point drives a hole into the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish.
<P>
With regard to foxes--
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Before my hon. Friend discusses foxes, I must comment further on stags. Stags and deer are naturally hunted in, for example, the ancient forests of Poland by wolves, and the evidence shows that wolves attack and kill their prey using short bursts of running, stealth and ambush--they certainly do not use a prolonged chase. The artificial aspect of hunting is the fact that it is prolonged. Will my hon. Friend comment on the difference between a wolf killing a fox, which is a natural act, and the unnatural act of chasing deer in the course of a hunt?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> That is an interesting example, which returns us to the discussion that we were having before these recent interventions. We asked Opposition Members--excluding the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire--whether there was any scientific challenge to the evidence in the Bateson report. That is critical in our attempt to establish whether hunting is relevant in this context. My view is that the hunt is relevant because of the intervention of people and of hounds and I therefore oppose the amendment. The interesting example of wolves in Poland establishes that there is a natural process that is right and proper and that it is the intervention of others that creates the unnatural process that we are discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Surely this is a dangerous route to pursue, from a philosophical point of view. Abattoirs are not natural and they unquestionably cause fear in animals--some would argue that we should ban the eating of meat because of the fear and pain that is caused. If one is to adopt that line of attack, fox hunting is simply the tip of the iceberg.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> Come on!
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I shall leave my argument there because I have gone on too long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I believe that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will shortly make an announcement in the House on food standards. There has been speculation in the press about that this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> On that point, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire mentioned how standards in abattoirs relate to the Bill. I know that we have already discussed the Bill's title this morning, but I must point out that we are discussing the Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill. Is the hon. Gentleman aware of any abattoirs that use dogs to kill other animals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Before we get too excited about that matter and you rule our discussion out of order, Mr. O'Hara, I must point out that I was trying to help the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire to cheer about food standards. I am convinced that the Bill is not about the use of dogs in abattoirs. The hon. Gentleman may want to try again.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not helped me at all. Earlier, I had a physiological requirement to leave the Committee Room and it has not diminished one iota. So--very briefly--my question was not about food standards, but about the philosophical questions that he raised about pain and the natural process.
<P>
I say again that the abattoir is not a natural process. It probably causes some fear for animals, but not pain. The hon. Gentleman is pursuing a line about fox hunting that could apply equally well to other things that society does that are obviously not included in the Bill. It is a dangerous philosophical route to adopt because one would then have to define what was a natural process, explain why human beings were excluded and ask why we were not considering the whole gamut of activities that cause fear and pain to animals.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If that was a brief intervention, I look forward to some of the hon. Member's other interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I am sorry to have detained the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire from his urgent business which he needs to resolve--fairly shortly, I should have thought.
<P>
Let me try to deal with the issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised. I said earlier that any connection between abattoirs and the Bill is not relevant, and that I was not necessarily making a philosophical point about the treatment of animals. Abattoirs are licenced and tightly controlled premises. If the hon. Gentleman has personal worries about the fear and distress of animals in any part of the food chain, and if he is successful in the next private Members' ballot, he could introduce a Bill to deal with the matter.
<P>
Much of what the hon. Gentleman has said about food standards will be addressed by the Food Standards Agency, which his party supports, and in some of the other ways in which food matters are being dealt with by the Government. However, I am getting off the track. I am conscious of your look, Mr. O'Hara. I saw something like it when I was previously in this Room and before another Chairman, so I shall return to the subject of hunting with hounds and the Bill.
<P>
I have not responded about the intervention about foxes themselves. I have tried to deal with stags. I am waiting for a challenge to be made to the Bateson report now that there are three Members on the Opposition Benches. I would be interested to find out whether Bateson is scientifically accepted by all members of the Committee. It is a very important document--everyone accepts that--and it is of particular relevance to the amendment. It would be good parliamentary practice for the Opposition to say whether they want to challenge Bateson and have the scientific evidence to do so, or whether they now accept it. They should say whether they will challenge it, either in relation to the amendment or to any other part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> It is more than a report now that it has been published by the Royal Society. The society has a high-impact scientific journal, which is subject to peer review and rates very highly in the research community. The report will now be text-book stuff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that information. The Royal Society's intervention is one more reason why Opposition Members should at least formally accept the findings of the Bateson report.
<P>
Hunting foxes is possibly one of the most unnatural activities that there is. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said that the Bill should use the word ``kill'' instead of ``hunt'', but the suggestion that there is always a kill at the end of a hunt is rejected even by the hunters. Hunting--the chasing of foxes by hounds inspired and trained by humans to do so--is barbaric. It should not have the support of the Committee and certainly does not have the support of the House of Commons.
<P>
If we were to change the Bill to say ``kill'' instead of ``hunt'', we would negate the main reason why the Bill received such a large majority on Second Reading. It is the hunt itself--the organisation of the hunt and the chase--that is not welcomed by Members of Parliament and the public. If we are simply talking about a chase, there is no reason why drag hunting should not be relevant. However, drag hunting is always opposed by hunters because they are after a kill at the end of a hunt.
<P>
I had the opportunity to challenge Janet George on television about that question; she did not deny that it is the thrill of the kill that makes the hunt worth while. I cannot support the amendment because it is the whole hunt, not just the kill, that is important.

<P>

<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> I will detain the Committee only for a couple of minutes. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hove; I too oppose the amendment, which would replace the word ``hunt'' with the word ``kill''.
<P>
The long title of the Bill, to which we may return, refers to hunting with dogs--not simply to killing a wild mammal with a dog but to hunting. That is why the Bill received such overwhelming support on Second Reading. It was Parliament's intention that we debate a Bill on the subject of hunting--fox hunting, stag hunting, or whatever. To replace the word ``hunt'' with the word ``kill'' in clause 1 would be to defeat the object of the Bill--and the will of Parliament, as it was so overwhelmingly expressed on Second Reading. We would be doing a disservice to our colleagues if we were to accept the amendment. Parliament has said that it intends to abolish hunting, not simply killing.
<P>
My hon. Friends have made the point that the enjoyment that people obtain from hunting is the key issue. On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester referred to one hunt's boast that it had chased a stag over about 50 miles. When the terrain and the zig-zagging of the hunt is taken into account, that distance is more like 90 miles--equivalent to the length of the M25. It is totally unnatural for an animal to be forced to run such a distance.

I am not sure whether that animal was killed, but the huntsman concerned boasted of the distance he had travelled in pursuit of it. He did not say, ``We had to chase the damn thing for 90 miles before we got to kill it.'' He was happy that they had chased it for 90 miles before the hunt ended. The point is that the enjoyment of the sport comes from the chase, not the killing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> On that point, what was of note, apart from the sheer distance of the hunt, was that several horses died of exhaustion during it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> It is incredible that people who talk about hunting as a conservation measure are willing to see their own animals destroyed in its pursuit.
<P>
Hon. Members have raised the question of abattoirs and other forms of animal killing that we tend to accept as legitimate--killing for food and so on. To use the word ``kill'' in the Bill would introduce the danger of our arguing about food standards, humane killing in abattoirs and so on. For the Bill to progress, we should avoid digressing into issues such as food safety and BSE.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Is not the point that the amendment highlights something that is implicit in the Bill, and forces us to confront that question? We should not run away from the point that the hon. Gentleman has just made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> That is an interesting point. We are not running away from the argument, but saying that the Committee is not the forum in which we should debate it. The Chairman would bring us to order if we digressed--although if he were to allow us, I am sure that we would come up with some interesting points on the subject.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> My hon. Friend made a point about negating the intention of the Bill. It is called the Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill; if the amendment were passed, we should have to rename it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> That is an interesting point. If the amendment were accepted, the word ``hunting'' in the first line of the clause would be negated. The intention of the Bill and the will of the Parliament would also be negated. As my hon. Friend said, we would have to introduce consequential amendments to deal with the title, which would take time and delay us further.
<P>
I agree with the point that hunting is not a natural activity. As has been said, the animals that hunted stags in the past no longer do so. It is unnatural to chase stags over distances of 80 to 90 miles and to hunt foxes. I do not profess to be an expert on fox hunting as I have attended only one hunt in my life--I hasten to add that I was on a fact-finding mission; I was unable to dissuade my hunting pals from taking part in their activity and they challenged me to go on a hunt before making comments that I could not substantiate. I therefore attended one so that I could speak with more authority on the subject. However, something that has always interested me is that it is not a natural activity. The hounds are trained to hunt. They are trained for stamina and are starved before a hunt so that they are in an unnatural state of mind--they are made so hungry they want to hunt for food.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> May I quote briefly from a letter that I received from a Mr. Shaw? He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Hunting normally provides a selective cull of the older and slower foxes and is also a useful method of dispersing any concentrations of foxes, which are the main cause of damage to farmers. The fox is either killed or escapes. The death from shooting, snaring or poisoning is indiscriminate, slower and more cruel than the quick death from a hound.''
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Illsley:</B> That is an interesting point. That view has been put to members of the Committee and to all hon. Members in the run-up to Second Reading. I do not accept that fox hunting is especially designed to cull older foxes. Reference has been made to chases and hunts in which pregnant vixens have been destroyed--surely they are not the older end of the fox population.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Has the age of the foxes that are killed been quantified? We are told that many foxes are killed in this country, but I am aware of no evidence of whether they are young, old, injured or whatever. There is much ignorance about that matter, and the people who are trying to prevent the Bill's enactment are creating much mythology about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> It would be interesting to discover whether a particular age group of foxes falls victim to hunting and whether the intention is to hunt older or weaker foxes. As I have said, the huntsman was boasting of an 80 or 90-mile chase--equivalent to the length of the M25--regardless of the kill at the end. If hunts were to chase older or weaker foxes, the hunt would last a very short time. Unless dogs and foxes had stamina, hunts would not last so long and hunting would be far less popular.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> That may be true, but the substantial number of letters that I have received repeatedly mention the hunter's claim that hunting is a selective process, not an indiscriminate process, that would otherwise be introduced to get rid of foxes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> Logically, the fox that will be caught first is the one that does not run fast enough. Therefore, the guy who wrote the letter is probably right. The intention of the hunt is not to catch and cull the older end of the fox population. That is a consequence of the fact that it is a hunt. One animal is chasing another, and it is a fact of life that the oldest will fall from exhaustion first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I am interested in the theory that old, weak and infirm foxes are culled. Would my hon. Friend like to comment on cub hunting, which specifically takes place when young animals are around?
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am happy to debate all fox-hunting issues. Indeed, hunts have bred foxes to chase, which contradicts the point about culling. Hunts that breed foxes will hunt those animals when they think that they will get the longest possible chase from them, not when they reach a ripe old age and are tottering about the countryside.
<P>
It is a myth that fox hunting is a selective cull of older foxes. When a hunt starts, huntsmen have a good idea where the foxes are and they unnaturally prevent escape by blocking up the earths. It is not a question of culling older foxes.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester said, cub-hunting, which presumably takes place when the fox population is at its highest, is uppermost in the huntsman's mind. It is a question not of humanely culling older foxes, but of simply the love of the chase, the hunt and so on.
<P>
I oppose the amendment. Obviously, if we were to accept it, we would defeat the object of the Bill. Given that the Bill has the overwhelming support of the House of Commons, it should be left as it stands. It will abolish hunting with dogs, not just killing with dogs.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Having interjected several times, I wish to clarify one point so that there can be no doubt about my concern. The constant reference to natural processes assumes that there is an objective natural process that does not involve human beings or a form of hunting. Everything that happens on the planet is interconnected and, naturally, human life makes a big difference to animal life. I am a little worried to hear constantly--at least by implication--that the Bill will restore a natural process. On whichever side we sit in the Room, surely we can accept that that is a false or articifical assumption. To think that the Bill would restore a natural balance is to be intellectually misled.
<P>
I keep hearing about data that show that animals suffer negative consequences as a result of being hunted. I am not a vegetarian although I respect people who are, but I have no doubt that, when I eat meat, it is not good for the quality of life of the animal that I am eating.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that some animals are bred to be eaten while foxes are not?
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Yes, I agree. But I do not understand why that alters a debate that focuses on the suffering of animals. Anyone who has seen animals being taken to abattoirs will be aware that many of them know what is going on and are frightened. Yet, we have a meat-eating culture, which I do not seek to change, and that is tacitly accepted, probably by many members of the Committee while, at the same time, we are debating the suffering of wild animals.
<P>
I do not draw a distinction between wild and tame animals. If one believes that animals have the right to quality of life, a distinction should not be drawn between wild and domesticated beasts. I wish to express my profound concern about the philosophical assumptions that have been made in our debate.
<P>
As many members of the Committee know, I do not shoot and I do not fish but I do not want to stop those who do on the basis of animal fear and pain. Current data show that fish feel pain and that people who angle or fish cause suffering. If we are to ban hunting on the basis of the pain and suffering that we cause to foxes, I should be interested to know why fish should not have the same rights. If the answer to that is to draw an arbitrary distinction between the relative sentience of a fish versus that of a fox, I return to my first point. A cow is comparably sentient to a fox.

<B>Angela Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman is talking about cruelty. Does he not accept that we are drawing a somewhat arbitrary line between badgers, which it is illegal to bait, and foxes that we can still hunt?
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Yes, the nature of law-making must be arbitrary because seeking absolutes is dangerous and can often lead down the path to things that we would not like, such as dictatorships. Where should those arbitrary lines be drawn?
<P>
The amendment would change the Bill more towards what hon. Members voted for in the Chamber and highlights what the public dislike so much about foxhunting. It is not a position that I support personally, but I said that I would be constructive. The cruelty that many people perceive is when the dogs kill the fox. Changing the Bill would eliminate that perceived cruelty while allowing the necessary arbitrary distinction between what is and is not acceptable. Many people hunt to control foxes. They do not necessarily celebrate it or set out to be inhumane to the fox. They are no more rabid in their outlook than members of the Committee, which reassures me that we are dealing with fairly reasonable people. They want to find a humane and sensitive way to control the animals, but it does involve killing and that in itself is a pretty final way of reducing an animal's quality of life.
<P>
Let us be intellectually rigorous and, more than anything, acknowledge that the debate involves drawing arbitrary lines between what we accept in our treatment of animals. It would be more liberal of us to accept that the killing of the fox with hounds is what people object to, not the fox-control process. We should give credit tomany in the foxhunting community who merely seek to control the fox population.
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> I had difficulty understanding the hon. Gentleman's claim that members of the public supported the Bill because it was intended to end killing foxes rather than hunting foxes. On Second Reading, the huge majority of hon. Members who voted in support of the Bill did so because of hunting. Much of my correspondence relates to pets being killed during fox hunts rather than just foxes being killed.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdcombe:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman because my point follows on from the one just made. I should like to know the basis on which the hon. Gentleman claims that members of the public are worried about the kill rather than the hunt. If we were worried about the kill, we would be vegetarians; we would not kill anything. The public already worry about methods of killing in straightforward farming and that is why we have regulations. It is the method that the publc are worried about--the hunt that proceeds the kill.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> That is a good point on which to conclude my remarks. The simple answer to those tow interventions is that the Bill does not seek to stop the killing of foxes; it simply seeks to ensure that it is done as humanely as possible. I should pay tribute to the hon. Member for Worcester for accepting a provision, on which I am very keen, about flushing with hounds. All credit to the hon. Gentleman for recognising the distinction.
<P>
We must make the decision. Is it or is it not humane to use foxes to run an animal to ground? Is it or is it not humane to allow some things that the Bill seeks to ban but to allow other things to proceed? I cannot tell hon. Members that I am right and they are wrong. We must look at our own consciences. It is in arbitrary distinction. I would draw the line somewhere different and the amendment goes some way towards redrawing the line closer to where I should like it to be. Let us not pretend that we are looking for absolutes. We cannot find absolutes without becoming vegetarians or dismantling much of what we as a society regard as necessary and helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I welcome this debate especially because, as other members of the Committee have said, it is an opportunity to have a philosophical debate and discuss the heart of the Bill and to explain why we want the legislation to go through the due process of Parliament. I am against the amendment because we should be trying to end the training of one batch of animals to pursue, hun and then kill another set of animals for no purpose other than the entertainment of human beings. There is no other analogy that falls into that category.
