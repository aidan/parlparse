                           </strong> Good morning everybody. Before we begin, I have a
few preliminary announcements. Members may, if they wish, remove their
jackets during Committee sittings—I see you already have. Would
all Members please ensure that mobile phones, pagers and so on are
turned off or switched to silent mode during our proceedings? I remind
Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. For
example, to be eligible for selection at a Tuesday sitting, amendments
must be tabled by rise of the House the previous Thursday. For a
Thursday meeting, amendments must be tabled by the previous Monday. As
a general rule, my fellow chairman and I do not intend to call starred
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000006">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Not everyone
is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public Bill
Committees, and that includes me, so it might help if I briefly explain
how we will proceed. The Committee will first be asked to consider the
programme motion on the amendment paper; debate on that motion is
limited to half an hour. We will then proceed to consider a motion to
report written evidence and a motion to permit the Committee to
deliberate in private before the oral evidence sessions; I hope that we
can take them formally, so do not get too comfortable in the
Gallery.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000007">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Assuming that
the second of the motions is agreed to, the Committee will move into
private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, witnesses and
members of the public will be invited back into the room, and our oral
evidence session will commence. If the Committee agrees with the
programme motion, we will hear oral evidence today and then revert to
the more familiar process of clause-by-clause scrutiny on
Thursday.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000008">&#160;</a>

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Streeter. This important
and very welcome Bill is the new Government’s first, and it
clearly sets out our attitude to the importance of civil liberties. The
programme motion directly reflects that. We have allowed a large amount
of time for debate on this short Bill, which is clearly relatively
uncontroversial, as it was not opposed on Second Reading. I am sure
that the Committee will be able to scrutinise its details in the time
allocated, so I am delighted to move the programme

Chakrabarti:</strong>
                           </em> From Liberty’s point of view, we
do not rule out the use of biometrics per se in purpose-specific
identity documents, whatever they are, if that is the most effective
and proportionate means of making such documents secure. It remains a
matter of discretion, obviously, for the Government and others in
relation to any particular identity document, be it a driving licence
or passport, whether a particular biometric, or biometrics per se,
would be the most effective method, and proportionate to the purpose in
question; but no, there is no principled or complete objection on my
part, or on Liberty’s part, to the use of biometrics in some
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000028">&#160;</a>

on the context and the biometric. It may well be appropriate to have
biometric identification for, say, airport security—for an
airport worker working in a sensitive part of the airport. On the other
hand, you would not need biometrics for library accounts, I should have
thought.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000029">&#160;</a>

that is the case then, one of the objections about identity cards was
having an identity register, but one of the points about any
register—and we have a passport database, of course—is
that you do need to keep a log of people’s data; otherwise the
card, as a stand-alone card, is less useful. So presumably therefore
you do not have a problem with having a register or a database of
biometrics if they were to be included in a card or a passport in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000031">&#160;</a>

deal with benefits, for example, or the Revenue or immigration; but it
is incredibly important, to Liberty at least, that such databases are
purpose-specific and hold no more information than is strictly
necessary and proportionate to that purpose. One of our fundamental
concerns about the national identity register was that it was a
multi-purpose and non-purpose-specific database, which meant that by
definition the amount of information on it would inevitably grow and by
definition it was not necessary and proportionate to a particular
cause.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000032">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I agree with that, once again. I think a
basic point to make is that the larger any biometric
database—the more material you store and the more
individuals’ data you store—the more liable it is to be
in interference with the right to privacy and the more likely it is
that any breach of that database will have results on a larger scale.
If you have a database that only records the data of, say, 200 people,
and someone hacks into it—which happens—then 200 people
have had their information interfered with. If you have a database with
20 million people’s biometric information and you are storing a
large amount of biometric information—not just, say,
someone’s signature, but also their eye colour, or a retinal
scan or DNA sample—when that database is compromised the
interference with privacy is so much greater. So there are sound
practical reasons to restrain the size of any database, particularly a
public one.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000033">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I find that interesting and a bit puzzling,
because eight out of 10 British citizens currently have a British
passport and there has been a passport database for some time—I
have seen paper records from 1916, for instance. Those data are kept
for quite a long time. It is important to prove citizenship, even after
someone’s death, for their relatives. That data are held and
used for many purposes—for example in the passport validation
service. Someone can ring up and check data against the register. They
are used if you apply for a driving licence. You can get data
downloaded from the passport database and make sure your driving
licence is included. So if we have that database, what is the
particular concern about a national identity register, which had a
number of security measures that were taken very seriously by the
previous Government? In fact, Ms Chakrabarti was invited to be involved
in some of those discussions, although we never got a response from her
office. We were open to hearing such things when we were in Government
and keen to ensure that the new passport database was even more secure
than the old one. I am puzzled. What is the problem with
databases?<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000034">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I can only reiterate that
purpose-specificity is incredibly important to any database, and
purpose-specificity is what the national identity register lacked. In a
nutshell, our three fundamental objections to compulsory identity cards
and this non-purpose-specific database include race relations and
discrimination. Over the years, you will remember, your predecessors
and colleagues offered up many reasons and justifications for the
scheme that came and went. One that kept coming back was immigration
and the suggestion that we in Britain might move from being the kind of
country that my parents came to in the late ’50s—where
border control takes place at the border—to having something
more akin to continental schemes where immigration

			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>
                           </div>control happens on the street. You can imagine the consequences for race
discrimination and race relations if an identity card became required
on the
street.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Second
is the fundamental shift in the relationship between the individual and
the state in a country without a written constitution or very strong
torts of privacy. What we have had in Britain instead, over the years,
is a justificatory principle: the police officer identifies himself to
you, and you are only required to identify yourself to the police
officer or others for specific reasons, such as reasonable suspicion of
offending.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally comes
the issue of personal privacy, which is exacerbated by an identity
scheme of the kind that the world had never seen before—not in
the war and not subsequently—because of the enormous capacity
that computerised databases of this kind have to hold vast amounts of
information that invariably grow over time.

                           </strong> Yes, because I need to counter that. I do not
want to appear rude, Ms Chakrabarti, but that is frankly nonsense. As I
am sure you are aware, in the Act as it currently stands while we are
debating this Bill, that was not allowed. First, the card was not
compulsory, and we had no plans to make it compulsory; secondly, it did
not need to be presented. It is important to get that right on the
record: it was actually not legal to require someone to present the
card for access to any public service. It is important to get those
facts absolutely straight. In terms of race relations, it could not
have been used as a border within the country. That is absolute
nonsense.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of civil liberties, the card would have put the citizen in
control of their data, because no one could have had access to anything
without the permission of the card owner, without the card present and,
crucially, without their fingerprints. I would counter the argument and
suggest that by removing the measures, we are going back to the old
system of multiple databases across Government. We are reducing that. I
wonder whether there are any final comments from the
witnesses.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000040">&#160;</a>

about our database. We first campaigned for the Data Protection Act in
1970. As you will know, we did not have such an Act in this country
until 1984, so we campaigned for quite a long time for that to be put
in place. It stands to reason that we take our obligations under the
Act extremely seriously. I cannot say when the current software that we
use for our membership and contact database was put in, but they are
not connected to the internet, so it is not possible for people to hack
in. You cannot, of course, prevent the fact that someone might break
into your offices. A basic point that we made to the Home Affairs
Committee inquiry on the surveillance state was that if you have
something that is electronically accessible from a number of different
points, you increase the risk of the likelihood that people will be
able to access it. Nothing is perfectly secure in this world, but the
problem with large-scale Government databases is that they tend to be
more vulnerable because they have to be accessed from a greater number
of
points.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000057">&#160;</a>

                           </em> For Liberty at least, it is an area of
residual concern, so I am delighted that the Government appear to be
moving in the direction of making clear that these will be immigration
purpose-specific residence documents. They will not be known as
identity cards for foreign nationals. The language is important. I know
that Ms Hillier and some of her colleagues will say it is just
language, but it is not. The language can lead to limited purposes. In
our view it is and always has been perfectly acceptable as a matter of
immigration control to have visas or residency documents required of
foreign nationals as part of their leave to remain.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000060">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That the UK
Borders Act 2007 and the European legislation that was implemented
subsequently do not contain sufficient safeguards in respect of the
database is incredibly important. We urge the Government to return to
that matter. If that is not possible during examination of this Bill,
we want them to put the database for foreign nationals on a clear
statutory footing, to limit its purposes very tightly to immigration
control, to limit the amount of information on the database and so on.
A lot of that does not happen because such matters were not covered by
the national identity register legislation and, as Ms Hillier rightly
pointed out, various limits and assurances in that legislation do not
currently apply to foreign
nationals.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000061">&#160;</a>

biometric and other information should be retained indefinitely. It
might be quite an important tightening-up exercise to ensure that it is
not just an exercise in

not address it in our written evidence, but we certainly support the
idea of holding as limited an amount of information as is necessary for
the system to be effective. To some extent, the Government are bound by
the existing EU regulations that require third-party residencies from
non-EU nationals. For example, the most recent regulation from 2008
requires only two fingerprints to be taken from a non-EU national. We
are currently taking 10. That is an example of taking more than is
strictly necessary. We are to an extent required to have a system of
residents’ permits in ID-card format, but that does not mean
that they have to be treated as an ID

ethnicity, of any individuals who hold identity cards. So, we can make

national identity register and then being on it for life, those of us
with passports—eight out of 10 British citizens in this
country—are on the passport database for life. I am puzzled as
to what the principle objection is. Ms Chakrabarti has talked about
specificity—I hate that word—and the focused need for
data. The passport database, however, is used in much the same way as
the proposed national identity register. The aim of the register was
effectively to modernise and automate certain transactions that were
open to human error. That remains the case with the passport database,
which is not on a statutory
footing.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000105">&#160;</a>

use my passport when I visit Ministers in the Home Office, but it is a
passport none the less, and the information that can be held on me on
the passport database is no more than is necessary to hold a British
passport. The fact that I visited the Home Office and used my passport
to get past security—yes, it happens—will not go on the

with clauses 4 to 6 and then move on to clause 10. Mr Metcalfe, you
claim that much of clauses 4 to 6 merely re-enacts existing information
from the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981. To what extent are the
clauses a simplification of the long list of

elucidation of the 1981 Act, which is still in force and continues to
be used to combat forgery and fraudulent documents. The 2006 Act spelt
out in more detail that things such as passports, visas or entry
clearance permits could be among the things used as fraudulent
documents. The introduction of provisions that clarify existing
legislation is not a major cause for concern, but our view is that it
is unnecessary and that they were only introduced to bolster up the
identity card scheme in general. You would probably lose very little. I
do not think that there is any ambiguity surrounding the 1981 Act. It
is not a major point, but our view is that you do not really need to
keep those things from the 2006 Act. You may as well get rid of them
and return to the previous law, which, as I have said, is already
regularly used by the police and the Crown Prosecution

deals with relevant information for determining whether to issue or
withdraw passports. I would be interested in some comments on the range
of information listed here. Just as background, I asked around at the
House of Commons Library and there is no statute law that governs what
information can be required in relation to passports. It is a royal
prerogative issue and so, in principle, any information whatsoever
could potentially be used to determine that. I would be interested to
hear your comments on that and whether there should be some way of
defining what information is relevant, because issues, such as tax
records or someone whom one has met at some stage, could in principle
be used. How would you go about constraining the requirements of clause
10, so that it does what it wants to do and does not open up a huge

think that clause 10 is a pretty good data-sharing power as they go. It
is pretty specific in that at least this is limited to the purposes of
the issue of passports. If I may say so, I think your bigger concern is
that you would, I suspect, like to see passports put on a statutory

here, but we currently have a system for foreign nationals of ID cards,
or biometric resident permits—whatever you would like to call
them. Many of my constituents, who are British but not necessarily born
in Britain, were very keen to have an identity document issued by the
British Government that would show very clearly that they are British.
That was, unfortunately, due sometimes to prejudice from other people,
but they were very keen to have one. I wonder if either of our guests
would be keen to comment on that, and the situation we have now with
identity cards, or resident permits, for certain people resident in the
UK but not for others. Is there an inequality there? I know that

                           </em> Your colleague in Hackney, Ms
Abbott, famously said that she feared that identity cards would become
a new pass law in the inner cities. I am afraid that that is a concern
that I very much shared, and it is a concern that is partly informed by
the experiences of French Algerians, Turkish guest workers in Germany,
and so on. But none the less, the residual point remains, and that is
the point we began to open up earlier in the evidence session about the
resident documents for non-EU nationals. I am glad to see the Home
Office moving from the original language—on its
website—that we are keeping identity cards for foreign
nationals. That was not a very comforting thought, because who looks
like a foreign national—Dr Metcalfe, despite his New Zealand
accent, or Shami Chakrabarti? On the street, one of us looks
potentially like a foreign national and one does not. That, of course,
was fed by the argument that immigration controls are what ID cards are
about.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000123">&#160;</a>

where we do not have identity cards, from the requirement of a card
towards a sticker or a vignette. The way we tend, traditionally in
Britain, to do immigration control is via the passport. I would like
the Government to leave open that possibility of renegotiation, but
until that happens, to regulate tightly on a statutory basis the
purposes to which these residency documents can be put and when they
can be required as people go about their

passport. I have always had a British passport—it is one of my

are governed by a very different legal tradition—Roman law, not

have, to put it bluntly, not been white Europeans in the main. Those
who have complained about having their “papiers” demanded
of them are, in the main, Algerians in France and Turks in Germany. Of
all the concerns—the massive concerns about privacy and the deep

know the difficulties that many people face in acquiring some kind of
photo identity. We touched earlier on the fact that you can acquire
either a passport or a driving licence, but I would argue that you
would not seek to acquire a driving licence if you did not intend to
drive. To some people it would seem a bit illogical to get a driving
licence as a form of identity if you had no intention of driving
because you

passports can be high for some people. I know you touched earlier, Ms
Chakrabarti, on whether the Government could consider means-testing or
providing assistance on that. I do not imagine that that will be
forthcoming. Would you like to comment on the difficulties that people
find in proving their identity and, regardless of whether you believe
it is right or wrong, the fact that to do quite a lot of things these
days, such as sign for a house or rent a car, you need photo identity,

alternative to the current

suspect is a fundamental difference between us on the national identity
register and compulsory or voluntary ID cards, you make a good point.
There should be concern on the part of all of us, including the new
Government, to ensure that purpose-specific identification, whether
that is secure national insurance cards, passports or driving licences,
is available to people who need it on an affordable basis, and that
banks and the private sector take an interest in, and responsibility
for, those poor people. We can share that cause even though we disagree
on the monolithic central database and card. I was just concerned about
putting all your precious eggs in one basket. I was not saying that you
should not have different baskets for different purposes, and that
people should not be able to access them, so your point remains a good
one, although I suspect that there is a fundamental difference between
us on the old scheme and the single, non-purpose specific,
multi-purpose and, in my view, dangerous honey pot of
information.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000132">&#160;</a>

demonstrated, we have to share a realistic concern that no database can

from the same concern. If I may say so, you, Mr McCabe, put
your faith in the single database, which will have all sorts of
sensitive material in it that you think you can ensure will be
absolutely safe, or much safer than the multiplicity. I take the
approach that I have just described to Ms Phillipson: I would rather
keep my sensitive information, like my precious possessions, in
different secure places. I think that that is how you limit risk, and I
suspect that that is the fundamental difference between us. However, we

different concerns that have been raised by members of the Committee,
it strikes me that in the quest to abolish, the fear caused by the
potential use of a national identity database is outweighing the
potential benefits, or the difficulties that will arise from not having
the ID card. For example, not having it will cause a more fractious and
less equal society, in the sense that everyone will be card-carrying in
different ways. People on lower incomes who have no other means of
having a form of identity will carry their “I am on a low
income” card; foreign nationals will carry a different type of
card to prove their identity; those with the means will have passports;
and others will have driving licences. The rationale behind the ID card
was that it was a cheap and unifying way for people to prove their
identity. Do you see any weight at all in that
argument?<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000140">&#160;</a>

a multiplicity of identifiers leading to inequality, I want to clarify
a point, because I do not think that people on poorer incomes should
carry the “I’m on a low income card”, as you put
it. The point that I think Dr Metcalfe and I were making is that if
passports and driving licences are too expensive, and it is too hard to
open a bank account, and so on, all those problems should be addressed.
But I am not suggesting at all that there should be a special card for
poor people and, as I hope you heard in my evidence on non-EU
nationals, I do not want non-EU nationals to carry a card in-country
either. While their visa is, we are told, now in card form, I would
like to see legislation on the statute book to severely limit the
purposes to which that card could be put and the purposes for which it
could be required. My ambition in the future, and I think it ought to
be the Government’s also, is to seek to negotiate a return to
secure vignettes or stamps in passports, so that border control happens
on the borders of this country, and not on the streets of
Hackney.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000144">&#160;</a>

there always has to be a single-answer solution for every situation.
The answer that we have been trying to give is that you always have to
look at the particular context, and at what is demanded in the
particular circumstance. It might be that to access housing benefit you
do not need to hand over to a Government official a document with a
chip that, let us say for argument’s sake, gives access to a
database that has your date of birth, height, weight and eye colour.
You do not need to have a database with all that different information
on it for the sake of accessing your housing benefit. It might simply
be enough to know that you are resident in a particular local
authority, and that can be established by a number of different
methods. I share the concern that we all can be required to carry lots
of different forms of identifiers, but I think that that is probably an
unnecessary fear, in just the same way as we have the unnecessary fear
about all the bad things that will happen if we do not have the general
ID. There are,

they can apply for passports and driving licences. If you say that
those are too expensive and too inaccessible to people, the cost must
be addressed in order to achieve the inclusion that you want. That is a
very important point. If national insurance cards are to continue to be
of any relevance to people, they may need to be made a more secure and
more useful form of identity. The point is not that we are against all
identity documents, but that we want them to be fit for their separate
purposes. We want each database to hold no more than is relevant to
that purpose. Our principal position is that it is more proportionate,
particularly in terms of privacy, to have various specific forms of

driving licence only needs to show that I am able to drive, and other
documents only that I am able to meet a specific purpose. If you look
at it like that, identity cards could have been a way for citizens to
choose to give their core data to one place and to then not have to
give them to many other organisations. You could very quickly prove
with your card in your hand, and not necessarily through access to a
database, that your identity was secure; the rest of the data would not
need to be supplied. Have you thought about whether there are better

information on the national identity register, but although you may
only want different parts of that data made relevant for different
services, the main store of data, containing all the different aspects
of your biometric information and all the rest, will still be on the
register. It may not be necessary for a person who is using their
identity card in a particular context to supply all that information;
that may be the mechanism by which an identity card would work,
but—<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000155">&#160;</a>

clarify my point. The way that the scheme was set up meant that no one
could have mined the data. My point was that if I wanted to hire a car
or get a driving licence, an identity card could prove that I was me. I
am not suggesting that other data be added to the national identity
register. My point was about

you. I think it was Edmund Burke who said that liberty lost is rarely
regained. The previous Government always said—and it has been
said several times today—that the proposed scheme was voluntary.
My understanding, from reading the legislation in my previous life, was
that the original purpose was to combat terrorism and improve
international security. What evidence do you have that the voluntary
carrying of an ID card would have become a requirement in the longer
term?<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000159">&#160;</a>

top of my head. Look at how the DNA database has expanded in a
relatively short period of 15 to 20 years. First, we were
just gathering DNA from convicted prisoners, and then it became
everyone who is subject to arrest and charge. Similarly, in the
terrorism context, look at our period of pre-charge detention: 
in 2000 it was seven days; in 2003 it was 14 days. Now it is 28
days.<a class="bkMark" name="10062945000160">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Look at the world war two identity card,
an emergency, exceptional measure that started with just a few pieces
of information on it; that grew, by the end of the scheme, post-war, to
many more—more than a dozen. With modern technology and greater
capacity, the irresistible urge to grow the purposes and the
information is so much greater. Yes, terrorism was offered as a reason
at one stage. Immigration came back many times, which is why I had my
concerns about race relations and on-the-street border control. Benefit
fraud was offered at one stage, as were the issues of entitlements and
social cohesion. At the end of the day, I have never thought that the
arguments really stood up to scrutiny and, I am glad to say, I think
that the public at large ultimately felt the same. Yes, perhaps
financial cost played a part in the decision—let us be honest
about that—particularly in a time of economic crisis, but that
is not such a bad thing, because sometimes when you
