amendments Nos. 103, 107 and 109 to

Simmonds</b> (Boston and Skegness) (Con): I do not want to
rehearse points that the Minister raised this morning and go over old
ground, but I have a couple of questions on the Government amendments.
The first relates to Government amendment No. 65. Will she clarify
whether the expectation under proposed new sub-paragraph (2)(b) of
paragraph 2 of schedule 3 to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act
1990 is that the gametes, embryos and human admixed embryos will be
retained unless consent is withdrawn? Is it a presumption of consent or
a presumption of
withdrawal?</div><a name="08060613000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second question relates to Government amendment No. 67. Of course, I
welcome parents being able to consent on behalf of their children, as
we discussed earlier; otherwise, there would be a class of illnesses
that was never researched in this way, as, due to the illness,
adulthood would not be reached and thus consent would not be obtained.
It is absolutely right that these provisions are inserted in the Bill,
but what will happen if one parent consents and the other does not?
What will happen if one parent disagrees strongly with the consent? Can
parents or a parent ultimately withdraw consent after it has been
given?</div><a name="08060613000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Government amendment No. 82, I have a simple question. Under the law in
Scotland, a child is considered to be under 16, whereas in England it
is under the age of 18. What is the reason for that
difference?</div><a name="08060613000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue to which Government amendment No. 102 relates was debated at
length in the other place. I thank the Minister for tabling this very
long amendment, which I understand supersedes and overrides amendment
No. 7, which stands in my name. I am delighted that the Government have
taken on board some of the concerns that were expressed by me and by
others, but I would like to raise a couple of specific points. One is
the interrelationship between proposed new paragraphs 15C(2) and
15C(6)(a), which limits research on the original debilitating disease.
What will happen if the individual has another disease that is proven
to be scientifically linked to the original disease? That may come
about as a result of scientific advances. Will we have to return and
alter primary legislation or can the change be made in regulations? Is
there a need to alter the Bill?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div><a name="08060613000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
provision in the Government amendment that I am very concerned about is
proposed new paragraph 15D(3), whereby if a researcher
cannot find a carer who is willing to be consulted on the use of an
adult who is unable to give consent in respect of cells, the researcher
can nominate someone to act on their behalf, who may not know the adult
lacking the ability to consent and may not have that adult&#146;s
interests at heart. I am not sure that there are enough safeguards to
ensure that such people, who will not necessarily be related to the
person who cannot give consent, have the necessary ability and have in
mind the interests of the potential patient and person who cannot grant
consent. It is very important that sufficient safeguards are in place
to ensure that that is the
case.</div><a name="08060613000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060613000490"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): As we have
heard, this is an extensive group of amendments, and I have a number of
questions in addition to those that have been asked. I shall try to go
through them in the order of the amendments, but I hope that you,
Mr. Gale, the Minister and the rest of the Committee will
bear with me if my comments end up jumping
about.</div><a name="08060613000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
on Government amendment No. 65, I do not necessarily follow how
proposed new sub-paragraph (2A) links to proposed new sub-paragraph
(2)(c). Proposed new sub-paragraph (2A)
states:</div><a name="08060613000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
consent to the use of a person&#146;s human cells to bring about the
creation <i class="I">in vitro</i> of an embryo or human admixed embryo is to be
taken unless otherwise stated to include consent to the use of the
cells after the person&#146;s
death.&#148;</div><a name="08060613000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems fair enough, but proposed new sub-paragraph (2)(c) states
that</div><a name="08060613000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where
the consent is given by virtue of paragraph 8(2ZA) or
14(2)&#148;</div><a name="08060613000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">it
must</div><a name="08060613000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;state
what is to be done with the embryo or human admixed embryo if the
person to whom the consent relates
dies&#148;.</div><a name="08060613000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new sub-paragraph (2)(c) adds that the
consent</div><a name="08060613000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
(in any case) specify conditions subject to which the gametes, embryo
or human admixed embryo may remain in
storage.&#148;</div><a name="08060613000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
position on proposed new sub-paragraph (2)(b) is straightforward
because the person who gives consent and who then dies is the person
from whom the embryos are taken, but the question is how the provisions
relate to the death of the person who gives consent for that person. My
hon. Friend the Member for Southport raised that question independently
in a message to me, and I hope that I have done his question justice
while raising my own. I hope, too, that the Minister will forgive me if
she feels that she has already clarified how the provisions will work,
but I did not spot her explanation, so it would be helpful if she
clarified the point.</div>
<a name="08060613000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
67 is quite complex. Again, I would be grateful if the Minister
clarified what effect the insertion of proposed new sub-paragraphs
(3ZA), (3ZB) and (3ZC) will have. Those provisions are mirrored in
other amendments, but it is not entirely clear&#151;even reading the
amendment in the context of the Bill and the Act as
amended&#151;exactly what their effect will be.</div>
<a name="08060613000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">My next
question relates to some of the Minister&#146;s other amendments. The
schedule raises another issue, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>but it is a matter for the schedule stand part debate, so it will be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000491"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman assumes that there
will be a schedule stand part debate. I have yet to decide that, but
the way things are going, the debate is becoming very comprehensive
indeed.</div>
<a name="08060613000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000492"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The case that I want to put in that respect is
that there are extensive matters in schedule 3, which is lengthy, that
are not subject to the amendments. I can try to bring those matters
into my remarks,
but&#151;</div><a name="08060613000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000493"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is right that there
are matters in the schedule that are not covered by the amendments, but
it is wrong to assume at this stage that there will necessarily be a
stand part debate.</div>
<a name="08060613000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000494"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I want to express not an assumption, but a hope.
Otherwise, it will be difficult for me to put my points on this
extensive schedule because they are totally unrelated to the
amendments. I will bow to your discretion at the appropriate time,
Mr.
Gale.</div><a name="08060613000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am very grateful to the Government for tabling amendment No. 102 and
other related amendments. As the Minister will know, several scientific
organisations expressed concern when it appeared that the Bill would
not permit the use of existing cells. She will be aware of the letter
to <i class="I">The Times</i> that was signed by a number of Nobel laureates,
headed by Sir Martin Evans, Sir Paul Nurse and Sir John Sulston. It was
supported by Sir Ian Wilmut, director of the Medical Research Council
centre for regenerative medicine; Sir Richard Sykes, a trustee of the
UK Stem Cell Foundation; Lord May of Oxford, a former chief scientific
adviser to the Government; Professor Bobrow; Dr. Robin Lovell-Badge;
and a number of other leading researchers, all of whom expressed
concern.</div><a name="08060613000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current situation is a tribute to the Government&#146;s general
handling of the issue since consultation began several years ago. We
are now in a position to welcome the fact that they looked into the
issue that was raised, consulted the scientific community and came up
with an amendment that seems to answer almost all its concerns. I
recognise what a job of drafting that was, given the length of the
amendments. I know that the Government&#146;s default position might
not be to spend a huge amount of time on drafting, so that shows that
they recognised that the issue is
important.</div><a name="08060613000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
same applies to the provision on children. It was not clear that it
would be permitted, and the Government expressed the importance of
obtaining explicit and specific consent when embryos were created,
because of concerns about people&#146;s autonomy. I understand that,
as do the members of the research community whom I have spoken
to&#151;if I may speak for them&#151;and patients groups. It is
particularly pleasing for the Genetic Interest Group, which worked
extremely hard on the issue and wrote a letter to Professor Lord Darzi
on 25 January, expressing support for the amendment tabled in the other
place and standing in the name of Lord
Patel.</div><a name="08060613000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is welcome that the Government have not only addressed that issue, but
taken the time and made the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>effort to ensure that the same issues should apply in questions of
adults without
capacity.</div><a name="08060613000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have tabled two small probing amendments to Government amendment No.
102. Amendment (a) questions the threshold for research to be
permitted, which is set out in proposed new paragraph 15G in amendment
No. 102. Paragraph 15G(1)
states:</div><a name="08060613000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
licence may not authorise the application of paragraph
15F&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08060613000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is to allow the use of existing cell
lines&#151;</div><a name="08060613000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless
the Authority is
satisfied&#151;</div><a name="08060613000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
that there are reasonable grounds for believing that scientific
research will be adversely affected to a significant extent if the only
human cells that can be used to bring about the creation <i class="I">in
vitro</i> of embryos or human admixed embryos for use for the purposes
of the project of research
are&#148;</div><a name="08060613000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">those
in respect of which there is an effective
consent.</div><a name="08060613000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is with the phrase &#147;to a significant extent&#148;, for
two reasons. First, that is a different measure from the one used in
relation to consent for the use of children&#146;s cells, earlier in
the amendment. For example, condition D in proposed new paragraph
15A(5) is expressed in terms
of</div><a name="08060613000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reasonable
grounds for believing that research of comparable effectiveness cannot
be carried
out&#148;.</div><a name="08060613000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems to me to be a very appropriate test. There is a reasonableness
test, which is important and which guides the licensing committee or
the HFEA in deciding whether they are prepared to license the use of
the cells. Also, its reference to comparable effectiveness focuses the
question on the outcome of the research, not the convenience of
researchers.</div>
<a name="08060613000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I totally
accept the Minister&#146;s statement that she would not want a test
that merely enabled existing cell lines to be used simply for
convenience and because the scientific research might be thought to be
&#147;adversely affected&#148;. I understand her concern about
leaving it at that; it would clearly adversely affect researchers to
have to get consent when they could simply buy in cell
lines.</div><a name="08060613000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister accepts that I accept that my amendment on its
own is not adequate, but I urge her to consider whether she might use
wording such as &#147;comparable effectiveness&#148;, which focuses
on outcomes. If that is not done, it will be hard for the HFEA to
interpret &#147;significant extent&#148;, whereas</div>
<a name="08060613000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reasonable
grounds for believing that research of comparable effectiveness cannot
be carried
out&#148;</div><a name="08060613000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
much clearer. It will be hard for scientists to know what the HFEA will
decide counts as &#147;significant
extent&#148;.</div><a name="08060613000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister recognises that there are two ways of doing this
and that there may be a slightly better way than the one she has
proposed.</div><a name="08060613000457"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="08060613000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
(b) would amend condition B in proposed new paragraph 15G(3). There is
a problem, in that conditions B and C might not capture a frequent
occurrence. A researcher might have reason to believe that P has died
because the cell lines were taken 10 years ago from someone with
cancer, but might not know that P had died, in which case condition C
would not apply.</div>
<a name="08060613000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
three possible situations. The first is that the patient has died, in
which case condition C would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>apply, so that is straightforward. Another is that the researcher has no
decent reason to believe that the person has died, such as when the
cell lines are taken from the biopsy of a healthy person, an umbilical
cord or whatever. A third scenario is that the researcher has reason to
believe that the person is dead, but does not know. I understand fully
the Minister&#146;s point that researchers must take reasonable steps
to ensure that they can identify a relative if the person has died. It
would not be good enough for the researcher to take the view, &#147;I
don&#146;t know if the person&#146;s died, so I&#146;m going to
treat them as simply uncontactable, not worry about contacting a
relative and press on.&#148; I accept that she made a valid
point.</div><a name="08060613000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first aspect of condition B specifies that the researcher must
have</div><a name="08060613000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;taken
all reasonable steps to contact the
person&#148;.</div><a name="08060613000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
could be possible to resolve the problem that I have identified by
adding a further provision that the researcher must also have taken
reasonable steps to establish whether the person has died. If they had
done both those things, it would be reasonable for the researcher, even
if they had a reason to believe that the person may have died, to treat
the person as uncontactable, not necessarily dead. I hope that the
Minister will accept that that is a concern in the research community,
and I hope that she will deal with it in her response, if not
now.</div><a name="08060613000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to a couple of other
aspects of the amendments. One of them specifies the condition that the
person must be likely to regain capacity, but I want to probe whether
that is the appropriate test. There may be a situation&#151;I am
talking about an adult, not a child who is likely to gain the capacity
to consent at some point&#151;in which someone has a clinical
condition that makes it possible that they might regain capacity, but
difficult to argue that it is likely that they will. I do not want to
spend the Committee&#146;s time identifying specific cases, but it
would be useful if the Minister considered whether there would be a
better test that would enable the provision not to be quite so
tight.</div><a name="08060613000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to amendment No. 8, which I tabled. Unlike amendments Nos. 9 and
10, its purpose is not dealt with by the Government amendments. Under
the Bill as it stands, it will be possible to store the gametes of
children who are about to undergo chemotherapy or some other medical
research that threatens their future fertility. Under the quite
reasonable provision in paragraph 12 of schedule 3, the tissue could be
stored without the explicit specific consent of the person on the basis
of that person&#146;s best interests.</div>
<a name="08060613000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">That all
makes sense. The problem is, however, that for this to be effective, it
is important that the storage techniques are correct. The basis of new
paragraph 9 is that the gametes are lawfully taken and that their
storage is in the best interests of the child. It is hard to meet that
test&#151;or certainly more difficult&#151;if the storage procedure
that is used fails to meet the requirements of that test. Let us take
the example of a biopsy of testicular tissue taken from a child without
the capacity to consent, such as a prepubertal boy. If that storage is
not done correctly, the procedure is not going to work, even if the
clear intention is to provide something that will help the child retain
his fertility and thus meet the best interests of that child.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div><a name="08060613000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, freezing such gonadal tissue is a tricky business.
Amendment No. 8 would provide grounds whereby it would be
possible&#151;again, under the same best-interest tests&#151;to use
part of the tissue that had been taken, frozen and stored to test
whether the freezing technique successfully met the purpose for which
the tissue was taken: preserving
fertility.</div>
<a name="08060613000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think the
Minister understood that that was the intention of the amendment. She
made the very fair point that this really ought to be a last resort and
that when there was a decent alternative, one would not need to do
this. She said that the alternative would be to wait for the child to
gain capacity, when he could consent to the use of stored gametes to
test the freezing. The problem is that we might be in a position in
which it would take some years for that situation to arise.</div>
<a name="08060613000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
if the tissue that was frozen was taken from a six-year-old boy with
the hope of preserving fertility and, at the age of 14, the child
acquired capacity&#151;essentially, competence to consent to research
being done, including testing, albeit only for the purpose of research,
the fertilisation ability of the sperm, which would not be allowed at
present&#151;one could test whether the storage of the
six-year-old&#146;s sperm was being carried out correctly. That,
however, would be some way done the line, and if it turned out that the
storage was done incorrectly, nothing could be done to help either that
person&#151;whose tissue had been taken but was not going to be
useful&#151;or any other child whose gametes were stored and frozen
under the same procedures in the intervening eight
years.</div><a name="08060613000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
might be a small gap in which some provision is needed to allow this to
take place. If, under Government amendment No. 102, it is legitimate,
in the best interests of the child, for a child&#146;s cells to be
used to create an embryo for research into a disease from which the
child and other people are suffering, is there a significant difference
between that and using another cell&#151;a gamete cell&#151;to
create an embryo by fertilisation for research under the 14-day rule,
also in the best interests of that child, even though one could
probably do it eventually in a number of years time when the child
gained capacity? I would be grateful if the Minister would consider
that question.</div>
<a name="08060613000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
number of other related points that are specific problems with the
schedule. They are not substantial issues, but I would like to save
them for a stand part debate, as I have focused all my remarks on this
group of amendments. However, if it is your understanding that there
will not be a stand part debate, Mr. Gale, I will try and
deal with them in the next
group.</div><a name="08060613000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000495"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Let me clarify the position. If I have caused
the confusion, I will resolve it. There are issues contained in
schedule 3 that are not covered by amendments. If any hon. Member
wishes to raise those issues, they may of course do so. What we cannot
do is find ourselves in a situation in which we have thoroughly debated
acres of text that we will then debate again during a stand part
debate. The hon. Gentleman referred to specific amendments and said
that he wanted to discuss them later. I think that that is what he
said, but if I misunderstood him, I freely apologise. By the time that
we get to the stand part debate, we cannot go back over ground that we
have already covered. I think we all understand
that.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div><a name="08060613000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060613000496"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): I wish to seek a
small assurance from the Minister regarding the Government amendment
No. 102, which is complicated. Proposed new paragraph 15D(2) will
require a researcher to</div>
<a name="08060613000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;take reasonable
steps to identify a person
who&#148;</div><a name="08060613000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
caring for
P</div><a name="08060613000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;otherwise
than in a professional capacity or for remuneration&#148;.</div>
<a name="08060613000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am particularly
concerned about the phrase &#147;or for remuneration&#148;, because
a very close person could be caring for P who was receiving
remuneration from a number of sources. For example, the remuneration
could be compensation for an accident. I am particularly concerned
about what would happen if the carer of P was receiving benefits. Would
that regarded under this amendment as
remuneration?</div><a name="08060613000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060613000497"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tom Clarke</b> (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill) (Lab): I
shall try, Mr. Gale&#151;as we all will&#151;to stick to
your guidelines and be specific, but some of the points that I want to
raise follow from the point made that my hon. Friend the Member for
Bolton, South-East, as well as some of the points raised by the hon.
Members for Boston and Skegness and for Oxford, West and Abingdon,
although perhaps I will make them from a different
perspective.</div>
<a name="08060613000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I begin
by posing the question that the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness
asked about Scotland? I am a little confused about that one, and I
cannot quite understand why, with some of the issues that we are now
addressing, we start at 16 in Scotland. Perhaps the Minister will
clarify that.</div>
<a name="08060613000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Government
amendment No. 65, may I concentrate for just a moment on proposed
sub-paragraph (2)(a)? I am slightly puzzled by the Minister&#146;s
use of the word &#147;storage&#148;. It seems to me that this
particular provision reaches well beyond that. It is assumed that,
after we die, the cells can be used for various purposes unless we
state otherwise. This seems to me to be presumed consent. For the sake
of posterity and those who read <i class="I">Hansard</i> closely, may I say for
the record that I would not wish my cells to be used for such research
after I am gone? It is wrong for all of us to assume that our
constituents take the same view on the matter. I would be interested to
hear, for example, how the British Medical Association has advised the
Minister on this issue?</div>
<a name="08060613000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought
that the rules on consent in the Bill&#151;I recognise that consent
is the essence of what we are discussing&#151;were very tight and
that they formed one part of the Bill that was pretty secure. However,
Government amendment No. 102 seems to widen things
considerably&#151;frankly, beyond what I had anticipated. To go from
the tight, robust provisions in the original Bill to around 260 lines
on</div><a name="08060613000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Cases
where human cells etc. can be used without the consent of person
providing
them&#148;</div><a name="08060613000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">seems
to me to be changing the ball game
somewhat.</div>
<a name="08060613000458"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="08060613000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
to draw on something specific, proposed new paragraph 15D in amendment
No. 102 refers to how R&#151;the researcher&#151;can nominate
someone who only has to fill the criteria of
having</div><a name="08060613000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no
connection with the
project&#148;.</div><a name="08060613000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a massive loophole. Conceivably, a researcher could appoint a
different researcher on a different project to speak as an advocate for
the person who has died. If 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>that is not the case, I would welcome clarification from my right hon.
Friend. If that is the case, we all know what the consultation will
lead
to.</div><a name="08060613000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister knows, I am committed to advocacy, as I was at the time
that I was fortunate enough to steer a Bill on disabled persons through
the House. Advocacy is of the utmost importance when we consider all
Government Bills. However, it is essential to remember that the
advocate is not speaking for himself or herself, but for the person. It
is not for the advocate to express a view, which might not necessarily
be that of the person, and I would like my right hon. Friend to
underline that
point.</div><a name="08060613000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me put a specific question in that context. Does the Minister recognise
that there seems to be a clear conflict of interest in having the
licence holder for the research project nominating the person under
proposed new paragraph 15D(3) who is to be consulted on behalf of the
person lacking capacity? There is no indication that the person to be
consulted on behalf of the person lacking capacity has even to see the
person lacking capacity. A lot of clarification is called
for.</div><a name="08060613000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I conclude, I remind Labour Members about the letter dated 25 March
that we all received from the Prime Minister. He
wrote:</div><a name="08060613000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
will have a free vote on the three new ethical issues on which the
house has not previously taken a view&#148;</div>
<a name="08060613000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Government
amendments are accepted, which I anticipate will happen, we will have a
new profound ethical issue to discuss. I hope that the provisions will
receive close scrutiny on Report and that my right hon. Friend the
Minister will agree that they, too, would thus be the subject of a free
vote.</div><a name="08060613000098"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000498"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Dawn Primarolo):</b>
I will try to deal with the questions asked during our debate on
consent. I start by responding to the general points made by my right
hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill and my
hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East about the appointment of
a representative when a carer is not available. I remind them that the
1990 Act has requirements on effective consent and what that
constitutes. Effective consent is required on the use of embryos, and
the Bill seeks to put in place the same. That will cover what the
embryo can be used for, the maximum periods of storage for gametes or
embryos, what should be done with the embryo or gamete after death, and
any other conditions that are wished to be placed on embryo use. That
picks up the point that my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge,
Chryston and Bellshill made about consent. While there can be general
consent&#151;we can agree to the use of our embryos or gametes for
all research&#151;we can also specify, if we choose.</div>
<a name="08060613000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">To take my
right hon. Friend&#146;s example, he might agree to research on
particular areas that might be connected with a condition he does not
have, but go on to say that he wishes to withhold consent for other
areas of research. That can be done, and it is done under the aegis of
effective consent in the 1990 Act. With regard to the operation of that
consent, the Bill seeks to make sure that for human gametes used to
create a human admixed embryo, the use of the embryo and its storage
are brought into the same regulations and given the same
protection.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div><a name="08060613000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
amendments deal with the exceptions we are discussing with regard to
how consent works and being able to specify the consent, which has to
be given. That includes, for instance, counselling and discussions. In
this hierarchy, in the particular circumstances mentioned by my right
hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill and my
hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East&#151;in circumstances
in which an individual is incapable of giving consent&#151;the carer
is the correct person to go to. The question is if there is not a
carer, what happens?</div>
<a name="08060613000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process
in that case follows the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.
This picks up the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill about what he described as an
advocate, which may be somebody who is charged with a responsibility
under that Act. He also made the specific point that the views
expressed have to be those of the individual who they are representing.
Clearly, those provisions need to be spelled out in discussion about
the safeguards and how they operate between the relevant
authorities&#151;in this case the Ministry of Justice and the
HFEA&#151;to make sure that is absolutely the case. There is an
absolute protection there.</div>
<a name="08060613000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">That also
covers the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East
made with regard to remunerations. A carer could be in receipt of a
payment such as independent living allowance, but that must not
interfere with the rights and protections clearly conveyed in the 2005
Act. That is where we are locating ourselves to ensure that we follow
through with the same rights that the House has already identified as
being necessary in cases where the individual does not have the
capacity to provide consent. I hope that that clarifies those
points.</div><a name="08060613000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
on to the points made by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness about
how Scottish law differs&#151;which, as this is a devolved matter, it
does quite a lot&#151;I do not feel sufficiently competent to give
him a specific answer. I wonder whether he will allow me to get the
Scottish Law Officers to give us a proper answer as to how the laws
interact, particularly, as he mentioned, around the age of
18.</div><a name="08060613000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000499"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Of course, I will be more than content with the
Minister&#146;s promise to get more detailed advice. However, my
understanding of the Bill is that there are parts of it that cover
Scotland, so the power is not devolved. It is relevant for the
Committee to understand why there are differences between Scotland and
England.</div>
<a name="08060613000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000500"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman. May
I refer to my experience as a Treasury Minister? The Finance Bill makes
legislation for the whole UK, but, nevertheless, at times it has to
interact with Scottish law as it has evolved. This is such a case. I
will be happy to get that information for the hon. Gentleman so that he
is satisfied that there are not any difficulties
here.</div><a name="08060613000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked questions about consent, the child, and the
interaction of parents. I think he is looking for where the crossover
is between the parents and the child&#146;s point of competence. The
consent would endure unless it were withdrawn or varied by the
parents&#151;I shall come on to the point about what happens when
both parents do not agree&#151;or when the child became competent to
consent themselves. I do not know whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>the hon. Gentleman wanted to know whether it was set for all time or
could not be varied, but it can be, under the restrictions that are set
out by the Bill.</div>
<a name="08060613000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents can
withdraw consent, or vary it, but that would be subject to the limits
that apply to all effective consents under paragraph (4), given how far
the research might have progressed. That is one of the issues, because
there might have been a great deal of work and expenditure. We must not
talk about destroying all that, and that is a general caveat&#151;can
one talk about a general caveat?&#151;and, more, a general
requirement within the
provisions.</div><a name="08060613000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there were a dispute between the parents, they might have to go to the
courts to resolve the matter because that does not fall under the Bill.
Parents&#146; responsibilities and their joint responsibilities are a
difficult area, and it would be difficult to legislate on a dispute in
a partnership where further use may be disputed. I am afraid that there
is no other way, in such limited and regrettable circumstances, that
such a matter can be
resolved.</div><a name="08060613000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000501"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful for the clarity that the Minister
is putting on this area. Does that mean that the consent of one parent
is sufficient in this particular
case?</div><a name="08060613000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000502"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I think that the consent of one parent without
the other parent dissenting would be considered to be the consent of
the parents, so yes, technically, one parent could be deemed to be
speaking on behalf of both. The obligation would be to ensure that the
other parent would have to say to the contrary. I think that that is
how the law would operate under such
circumstances.</div><a name="08060613000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about whether the provision limits research to the
original debilitating disease, or whether it could be extended to
linked disorders. If the research into the condition was linked to the
original condition, it would be permitted. Research could be into the
condition suffered or a similar one. Clearly, any provision in that
area must be about either a disease or disability that the child has,
or its treatment and
care.</div><a name="08060613000459"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="08060613000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman raised the point about someone who might be unable to
find a carer and what the appointment of the other person means. I have
answered, clearly I hope, that that falls within the confines of the
Mental Capacity Act 2005 and the guidelines there. The same answer goes
to my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and
Bellshill and my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East. I have
answered the Scotland
point.</div><a name="08060613000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
point was raised about whether a researcher can nominate another
researcher&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge,
Chryston and Bellshill touched on that. The answer is no, as it will be
governed. It will have to be an appropriate person as set out in the
Mental Capacity Act, acting and speaking on behalf of the
patient&#151;the individual considered not to have capacity, as my
right hon. Friend said. This is a delicate area and it is clearly dealt
with in that
Act.</div><a name="08060613000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that I have dealt with the issues raised by the hon. Member for
Boston and Skegness, so I will attempt to answer the questions asked by
the hon. Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>Oxford, West and Abingdon. If I do not deal with them all, it is because
I did not necessarily understand them, so forgive me. However, I will
try.</div><a name="08060613000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the point that the hon. Gentleman again made about the issue
of &#147;significant extent&#148;. As I said in my opening remarks,
together with all the consultation and advice that we have had, the
Government are trying to weigh the scientific burden of being unable to
use existing cells against the rights of the person who donated those
cells. I am not convinced by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s alternative
wording&#151;he accepts the principle, but is not keen on the word
&#147;significant&#148;. I do not think that the wording he
suggests is a high enough hurdle for researchers. It is important that
&#147;significant extent&#148; is the appropriate test to comply
with and it should not be lowered. The heart of his argument seems to
be that it is too high, but we have set it there because we think it
should be
high.</div><a name="08060613000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000503"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b><b class="B"> </b>I accept what the Minister says and that
simply taking out those words is not satisfactory. I suggested that she
might consider using the same wording about the research not being of
comparable effectiveness, which she has deemed satisfactory. I agree
with her about the other provisions that relate to patients without
capacity and children who do not yet have capacity, where there is a
different threshold. My concern is not that &#147;significant
extent&#148; makes the threshold too high, but rather that it is not
easy to interpret. I am at one with her on where she wants to be, but I
wonder whether she will consider the alternative wording.</div>
<a name="08060613000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly, I
received a message from the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome
Trust saying that they support the thrust behind amendment (a) to
Government amendment No. 102. Unfortunately, I do not have that in
writing, so I accept that at the moment it is hearsay, although it
might give the Minister pause to consider the matter, or at least to
agree to think about it a little more.</div>
<a name="08060613000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000504"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am absolutely prepared to accept the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s word about who supports the amendment and, of
course, I always take note of those illustrious bodies. However, here
the difference is clear as to why we are not using exactly the same
wording. The wording that is used elsewhere refers to cases that
involve consent from others. We want to connect that with cases with no
consent and have included a worthy higher test for that
reason.</div><a name="08060613000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, and I am always happy to
reflect on any view held by members of the Committee, but this is an
important principle and I am not convinced that other words could be
used or that we should lower the
test.</div><a name="08060613000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked questions to clarify the effect of interactions
between sub-paragraphs (3ZA), (3ZB) and (3ZC). Sub-paragraphs (3ZA) and
(3ZB) clarify the fact that, in the limited circumstances referred to
later in the schedule, the consent of a parent will be treated as
effective consent of the child. That means that all the provisions of
schedule 3 that are attached to effective consent apply to the parent.
For example, the parent is given the opportunity for counselling and
they can vary or withdraw the consent, which is what I said in my
opening remarks.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div><a name="08060613000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sub-paragraph
(3ZC) clarifies the fact that if a child becomes competent to consent,
their parents&#146; consent is treated as if it were their own, which
enables the child&#151;now competent, which is the point made by the
hon. Member for Boston and Skegness&#151;to choose with consent at
the appropriate time whether they consider it necessary to vary
matters. That will ensure that the embryos are not automatically
destroyed if the child does not want that to
happen.</div><a name="08060613000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the interaction starting with parents and
crossing over into a competent child or adult, and the issues of
storage. He also asked about the intentions of proposed new
sub-paragraph (2)(c) in amendment No. 65. The intention is that the
parent, at the outset, will specify what should happen to the embryo
created using the child&#146;s cells if the child dies and if the
parent died later. The consent would have already been given, so
further provision is not needed is such a
case.</div><a name="08060613000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come to amendment (b), tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon to Government amendment No. 102. I took advantage of the break
between the morning and afternoon sittings to discuss matters further.
I am sure that he appreciates that the Government want to ensure the
protection of the rights of the deceased person&#146;s relatives in
cases where their relatives have been identified and the researcher
wishes to use the tissue. However, I understand that there may be an
important point that he is making about when relatives cannot be traced
and whether there should be some qualification on whether relative
consent is
required.</div><a name="08060613000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to make a hasty decision on the basis of today&#146;s
discussion. I am sure that members of the Committee appreciate that we
are discussing a complex set of exceptions that try to take into
account all human rights. However, I want to reflect on our views on
the provision, along with what the hon. Gentleman said about it, to see
whether a slight problem needs to be tidied up. I shall, of course,
keep all members of the Committee informed of the outcome in relation
to our decision. I hope, therefore, that he will not press the
amendment to a Division, but will give us time to consider the
matter.</div><a name="08060613000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
last point goes back to that made by my right hon. Friend the Member
for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill about nominating somebody if
there is not a carer to represent a person who is without capacity.
This incredibly important and I bow to his extensive knowledge and
experience in this area. It is crucial that we get this right. We would
expect and require the HFEA to be satisfied that the appointment was
done correctly, that they were representing the individual concerned
and that the researcher had undertaken all the checks possible before
reaching that stage of appointment. I say to my right hon. Friend that
that makes the exceptions very tight indeed and ensures that the
concerns that he and the rest of us rightly hold have been properly
dealt
with.</div><a name="08060613000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that I have answered all the questions to the best of my ability,
and if I find that I have missed anything when I check the record, I
will be more than happy to write to members of the
Committee.</div><a name="08060613000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000505"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I confirm that, as far as I am concerned, the
Minister has addressed all the points that I raised on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>the amendments and I have no further comments to make on them. I
apologise if I mis-spoke or confused the situation earlier in respect
of issues relating to the
schedule.</div><a name="08060613000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also like to thank the Minister for considering amendment (b) to
Government amendment No. 102, and I repeat that I do not intend to
press either that amendment or amendment (a) to Government amendment
No. 102. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
reflections.</div><a name="08060613000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment (a), the Minister has confirmed that the test is a higher
one. It is helpful that that is understood, unless one is a researcher
who now feels that he will be disadvantaged, so there are mixed
blessings to these Committee
debates.</div><a name="08060613000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister says the test is a higher one because, in the case of the
child who does not yet have capacity or the patient without capacity,
there is a substitute consent involved, whereas here there is not such
a substitute consent. That is the first time that that has been
explained, and I will, if I may, reflect on whether it is therefore a
rebuttal of the argument that the tests should be the same. I hope,
however, that I can reflect on whether there is an alternative wording
that would retain a higher test but was not as open to
interpretation&#151;and possibly misinterpretation&#151;or as
difficult to interpret as the current wording. However, I am grateful
to the Minister for her responses to the points that I
raised.</div><a name="08060613000131"></a>

Simmonds:</b> I join the hon. Gentleman in thanking the
Minister for her extremely comprehensive responses, both to my
amendments and to the questions I subsequently asked. In that context,
I am happy not to press my amendments, which have been superseded by
the Government

thank the Minister again for tabling those amendments, and I look

There are some differences in the Bill, and there is certainly some
confusion among those who are concerned with it&#151;not just in

parts of the United

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000507"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in
schedule 3, page 61, line 32, leave
out &#145;12&#146; and insert
&#145;36&#146;.</div><a name="08060613000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000508"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 31, in
schedule 3, page 61, leave out lines 35 to
39.</div><a name="08060613000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000509"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> We have spent a long time discussing schedule 3,
so I will be brief. The amendments are probing and relate to the
storage time of the embryos. Under the Bill, storage of the embryos is
legal for 12 months. I welcome the Government&#146;s
introduction of a cooling-off period, when one person seeking treatment
or the gamete donor withdraws consent. Why only 12 months?
If there has been a disagreement between 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>two people applying for treatment, lawyers occasionally become involved
in an attempt to dispute the decision and it could take much longer
than 12 months for the process to be resolved. A longer cooling-off
period before an embryo is destroyed may well be necessary&#151;at
least the option of an extension to the cooling-off
period.</div><a name="08060613000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 31, which is probing, expresses concern about the cooling-off
period. The explanatory notes say that the cooling-off period allows
the embryos to remain lawfully stored while a resolution is reached,
but proposed new section 4A(4)(b) in paragraph 7 of schedule 3 allows
the embryo to be destroyed before 12 months have elapsed if both
parties consent. That appears to be a slight
contradiction.</div><a name="08060613000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
time is a difficult one for both partners, and decisions could be taken
that are subsequently regretted. Removing the provision and instead
having a mandatory cooling-off period of 12 months would give both
parties an opportunity to reconsider their initial
decision.</div><a name="08060613000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000510"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I note the interesting points made by the hon.
Gentleman, although I do not want to comment directly on their merits
or otherwise. I want the Minister to confirm whether it is her view, as
it is mine, that the courts made the right decision in the case of
Natalie Evans. It was difficult for the lady concerned, and there was a
great head of steam built up about whether it was right that she was
denied the right to use the stored gametes or embryos when the consent
had been
withdrawn.</div><a name="08060613000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
view is that in 1990 Parliament was clear about its intention in such a
case, and I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that the Bill
does not change that provision. Despite everyone&#146;s sympathy for
people in the position of Natalie Evans, the decisions of the courts in
that case were right as far as Parliament had
intended.</div><a name="08060613000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000511"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I can confirm that. At all stages, the
principle of importance in the last question is that the consent of
both gamete donors has to be there. That is what the courts upheld,
which is absolutely right. It has not changed. The Bill does not
propose to move away from the principle of consent of both parties in
such cases. However, we are trying to recognise the fact that, if one
party withdraws consent to storage and use, it is only fair that the
other should be informed. When that withdrawal of consent occurs, the
Bill places a duty on the clinics to inform the second gamete
provider.</div><a name="08060613000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clinics also have a duty to keep the embryos safely stored for one
year, until agreement has been reached by both parties with an interest
in the embryo. That comes on to the point that I will deal with in a
minute&#151;the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second amendment&#151;which
is that if both parties say &#147;destroy&#148;, the consent is
withdrawn and that happens. That is what it means and that is what the
principle is. That is the principle that has been upheld by the
court.</div><a name="08060613000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill introduces a one-year cooling-off period for the storage, which
will be activated immediately in the case of one party withdrawing
consent if written notification 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>is received by the clinic storing the embryo that one of the gamete
providers is withdrawing consent to continued storage and
use.</div><a name="08060613000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
cooling-off period will ensure that the embryo remains legally stored
for a maximum of 12 months to allow the other gamete provider to be
informed of the decision and to allow time for reflection on that
decision, with the possibility that both parties might reach a private
agreement on the future of the embryo. Clearly, that would be a better
solution than ending up in the courts, which we have discussed in
relation to other examples. The question is how far any statute should
reach into the private relationship between two individuals.</div>
<a name="08060613000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 12-month
period recognises the distress that such a situation can cause to the
couples involved, but ensures that the process of reaching a conclusion
is not allowed to drift and that clinics can deal with storage. The
provision also deals with the fact that the individuals concerned have
to recognise the importance of both individuals&#146; consent and
recognises the fact that both can withdraw that consent. I understand
the point of amendment No. 30: why should the period not be longer? Yet
if the situation cannot be resolved in 12 months, why would
we expect it to be resolved in a longer period? These are important and
direct issues that should not be left for long before
resolution.</div><a name="08060613000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 31, where both parties have consented to the destruction
of the embryo, that would run completely counter to the whole point of
consent, which is about the individual&#146;s responsibilities in
coming to those decisions. They cannot be transferred or given a
cooling-off period. They are the responsibilities of those two
individuals, and once both have said in writing that consent is
withdrawn, that is it. That is the right way to
proceed.</div><a name="08060613000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the desire of the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness to
probe this area, which is difficult, but the Government have moved as
far as is reasonable, given that in the end&#151;particularly given
the circumstances of such treatment&#151;the two individuals have to
continue to consent. In distressing circumstances, when one person
withdraws consent for a short period, there is at least the opportunity
to inform the other donor and for final decisions to be taken. I
therefore ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his
amendment.</div><a name="08060613000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000512"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I thank the Minister for her response. Of
course, I agree that consent of both gamete donors is essential and it
is right that one of the consenters is informed if the other withdraws
consent. It is also right that speed is of the essence in resolving
these matters. The point I was trying to elucidate with amendment No.
30 is that a dispute, potentially involving lawyers, could last longer
than 12 months, and there does not seem to be any option to extend that
period. As I understand the Bill, even if such a dispute were still
going on at the 12-month cut-off, the embryo or gamete would ultimately
be
destroyed.</div><a name="08060613000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000513"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> But that happens now. Where there is legal
dispute over the requirement to defer the decision, I do not think that
that has changed. We are talking about a new, specific cooling-off
period that was not present in that
circumstance.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div><a name="08060613000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000514"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am aware of that, but I do not think it
addresses the point that a dispute may be going on that could be
resolved one way or the other and which, obviously, becomes
hypothetical once the embryo has been destroyed. Nevertheless, I think
the discussion has been
useful.</div><a name="08060613000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000515"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Perhaps I was not clear enough. Where there is
a legal dispute and the courts are involved, the HFEA can defer a
decision. I have referred to that before with regard to one of the
cases we talked about. That position has not changed. This is not about
where there is an interaction with the courts, so it is not an
absolute. This is where there is not, and we are hoping that two
individuals will simply sort it out
themselves.</div><a name="08060613000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000516"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> That is an extremely helpful intervention, if I
may say so. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000517"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I have six brief issues to raise. I apologise to
the Committee for having read the schedule, which is where I went
wrong. I was hoping that the Committee could get away
earlier.</div><a name="08060613000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
first question relates to the provisions on page 60 of the Bill, which
amend paragraph 2 of schedule 3 to the 1990 Act. I was hoping that the
Minister would explain the purpose of that measure and, in particular,
whether it conflicts with a later paragraph&#151;paragraph 6(4) of
schedule 3 to the Bill, which is also on page 60 of the Bill and which
introduces new sub-paragraph (3) to existing paragraph 4 of the 1990
Act. It
states:</div><a name="08060613000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the terms of any consent to the use of an embryo...include consent
to the use of an embryo or human admixed embryo whose creation may be
brought about <i class="I">in vitro</i> using embryo A, that consent to the use
of that subsequent embryo or human admixed embryo cannot be varied or
withdrawn once embryo A has been used for one or more of the purposes
mentioned in sub-paragraph (2)(a) or
(b).&#148;</div><a name="08060613000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sub-paragraphs
(2)(a) and (b) relate to treatment services and projected
research.</div>
<a name="08060613000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Substituted
sub-paragraph (5) on page 60 of the Bill
states:</div><a name="08060613000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the case of a consent falling within sub-paragraph (4)(b), the terms of
the consent may be varied, or the consent may be withdrawn, in
accordance with this Schedule either generally or in relation
to&#151;</div><a name="08060613000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
a particular embryo or particular embryos,
or</div><a name="08060613000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
a particular human admixed embryo or particular human admixed
embryos.&#148;</div><a name="08060613000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
just want reassurance. I do not have significant doubts that the Bill
as amended is correct and that the Act will be correct, but it is not
obvious&#151;nor was I able to find it in the explanatory
notes&#151;why it seems that people can pick and choose their consent
and withdraw consents around embryos, whereas elsewhere it says that
they cannot withdraw once the process has been
started.</div><a name="08060613000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can understand why people do not want the expense of a research project
doing something and consent being retrospectively withdrawn in the
middle of the project. It just seems to me that there may be some
inconsistency. I hope that I have explained
that.</div><a name="08060613000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000518"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Has the hon. Gentleman noticed in the
explanatory notes the phrase &#147;chain of consent&#148;, which
relates to paragraph 14 of schedule 3 to the Bill? It may go some way
to shining light on the area he is
discussing.</div><a name="08060613000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000519"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for suggesting
that this issue is more complex even than 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>that. That may be the solution or it may be an extra complexity. I am
sure that some reading will have to be
done.</div><a name="08060613000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
next point relates to the concern around proposed new sub-paragraph
(5), which is inserted by paragraph 6 of schedule 3 to the
Bill. It can be found at the top of page 61, in line 5. The distinction
is between the way that this is dealt with for embryos and the way it
is handled for human admixed embryos. Paragraph 4(2) of schedule 3 as
it will be amended
states:</div><a name="08060613000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subject
to sub-paragraph (3), the terms of any consent to the use of an
embryo&#148;</div><a name="08060613000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;that
is, not human admixed
embryo&#151;</div><a name="08060613000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;cannot
be varied, and such consent cannot be withdrawn, once the embryo has

in providing treatment
services&#148;,</div><a name="08060613000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
clearly does not apply to human admixed embryos, which is why it is a
different construction in sub-paragraph (5) of the measure
as it will be amended,
or</div><a name="08060613000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(aa)
in training persons in embryo biopsy, embryo storage or other
embryological techniques&#148;,</div>
<a name="08060613000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is the
problem.</div><a name="08060613000461"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

Ian Gibson</b> (Norwich, North) (Lab): Could the hon.
Gentleman take it more slowly, please? It is impossible to follow, and
we are trying hard to do our
job.</div><a name="08060613000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000521"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I will try to oblige. I would like to refer to
paragraph 6 of schedule 3, in particular to draw attention to the
impact of sub-paragraph (3) in amending paragraph 4(2) of the schedule
to the Act, because the schedule to the Bill amends the schedule to the
Act. I would like  to contrast that with what paragraph 6(5) of
schedule 3 to the Bill does to the same paragraph&#151;that is,
paragraph 4 of the schedule to the Act&#151;when it
inserts sub-paragraph (5). This can be found near the top of page 61 of
the Bill. It deals with human admixed embryos.</div>
<a name="08060613000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point was
that paragraph 4(2) of the schedule to the Act, as amended, would say
that</div>
<a name="08060613000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the terms of
any consent to the use of any embryo, that is, not human admixed embryo
(&#147;embryo
A&#148;)&#148;</div><a name="08060613000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;that
is, not &#147;human admixed
embryo&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08060613000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;cannot
be varied, and such consent cannot be withdrawn, once the embryo has

in providing treatment
services&#148;.</div><a name="08060613000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">That,
rightly, does not appear for the human admixed embryos in paragraph 5,
because there is no question of human admixed embryos being used for
treatment
services,</div><a name="08060613000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(aa)
In training persons in embryo biopsy, embryo storage or other
embryological
techniques,&#148;</div><a name="08060613000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is not covered in sub-paragraph (5) and which I am suggesting could
usefully be done,
and</div><a name="08060613000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(b)
for the purposes of any project of
research.&#148;</div><a name="08060613000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
5(4), which is shorter, now
states:</div><a name="08060613000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the terms of any consent to the use of a human admixed embryo
(&#147;human admixed embryo A&#148;) include consent to the use of
a human admixed embryo or embryo whose creation may be brought about
<i class="I">in vitro</i> using human admixed embryo A, that consent to the use
of that subsequent human admixed embryo or embryo cannot be varied or
withdrawn once human admixed embryo A has been used for the purposes of
any project of research.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div><a name="08060613000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may be wrong, because
that deals with a chain of embryos and &#147;any embryo&#148; may
cover &#147;human admixed embryo&#148;, but what concerns me is
that there does not seem to be provision for human admixed embryos to
be used for training people in the handling of blastocysts, if it is
possible to create a blastocyst, and in things to do with embryological
storage. One of the reasons for introducing human admixed embryos is a
shortage of eggs, and it may well be that there is no better use of a
human admixed embryo than for training, since it preserves the use of
eggs and precious embryos, which should be used in treatment services,
for those purposes.</div>
<a name="08060613000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
feel that there may be something missing, which relates to the third
point I want to make. I may be wrong&#151;I usually am, when it comes
to questioning Government amendments to complex pieces of
legislation&#151;but amendment No. 66, which I will not be speaking
to, does not seem fully to amend the schedule. The Committee will
notice that amendment No. 66 inserts &#147;(ba)&#148; into line 12
on page 62 of schedule 3, but it does not amend line 8, and line 8
would appear to have an amendable part&#151;that is, the insertion of
&#147;(ba)&#148; into line 8. The effect of not amending paragraph
6 in schedule 3 to the Act as amended is that:</div>
<a name="08060613000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person&#146;s gametes or human cells must not be used to bring about
the creation of any embryo in vitro unless there is an effective
consent by that person to any embryo, the creation of which may be
brought about with the use of those gametes or human cells, being used
for one or more of the purposes mentioned in paragraph 2(1)(a), (b) and
(c)&#148;.</div><a name="08060613000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
does not include testing. However, the Government are seeking to amend
the Act with the amendment to schedule 3:</div>
<a name="08060613000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
embryo the creation of which was brought about in vitro must not be
received by any person unless there is an effective consent by each
relevant person in relation to the embryo to the use of one or more of
the purposes mentioned in paragraph 2(1)(a),
(b)&#148;</div><a name="08060613000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;it
is now (ba)&#151;&#147;and (c)&#148;.</div>
<a name="08060613000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps for training
purposes it is a matter of receipt rather than use, but I am not
certain of that. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify
whether that is an omission.</div>
<a name="08060613000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">My fourth
point is to ask the Minister whether she can explain what is meant by
paragraph 10 of schedule 3 on page 62. It is about the use of embryos
obtained by lavage. The explanatory notes specify that its purpose is
to prevent embryos taken from a woman being used in research, but
perhaps the Minister could explain why it was felt necessary to have it
in the Bill now. Was there a gap? What was the impact of that gap? What
could have happened had the provision not been introduced? It was
mentioned briefly in the other place, but on reading it in
<i class="I">Hansard</i>, it was not entirely clear what it meant.</div>
<a name="08060613000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">My fifth
point is one that I raised incorrectly in consideration of the
amendments, and the Minister did not address it in her comments. On
page 64, paragraph 10(3)(b), there is a provision to ensure that
consent is not required for storage. It states that the position meant
is one
where</div><a name="08060613000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
patient is likely to regain that
capacity&#148;.</div><a name="08060613000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
point was whether &#147;likely&#148; is the right test given that
it suggests a greater than 50 per cent. chance, two thirds of a chance,
that capacity will be restored. Sometimes it is impossible to say
whether it will be restored; in some circumstances it is possible but
unlikely. Where is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>that dividing line to be drawn? It would be helpful if the Minister
could give some indication, now or at a later stage, about what she
means.</div><a name="08060613000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point is to draw an issue to the attention of the Minister. This
is for information only&#151;I do not expect her to respond. On page
65, proposed new paragraph 13(1) at line 16, the discussion about human
admixed embryos describes them as being used for the purposes of
&#147;any project of research&#148;, and it is the same in line 21.
That provides a mismatch, which we discussed earlier with respect to
the earlier part of the schedule in the first group of
amendments.</div>
<a name="08060613000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">A similar
problem arises in schedule 2 about the issue of testing on human
admixed embryos. I do not believe that schedule 2 has been amended to
provide for the use of human admixed embryos in the testing of embryos.
Obviously, I cannot talk about schedule 2 now as it was considered in
Committee on the Floor of the House, but I draw attention to the fact
that if the Government are right, they are right in both places and if
there is a problem, it may apply in both
places.</div>
<a name="08060613000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000522"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am sure that hon. Members who thought that
they understood how consents were going to work are now completely
confused, as indeed am I.  I wish to make three succinct
points, the first of which is about written consent that will be
rightly retained and also the consent that must be signed under the
Bill. Can the Minister say whether there is evidence that written, but
unsigned, consent&#151;as under the 1990 Act&#151;has led to
misuse, or inappropriate use or storage of gametes and embryos? My
second point relates to paragraph 4(3) of the 1990 Act and
the withdrawing of consent. I see no mention in the Bill of those who
are physically incapacitated who wish to withdraw and direct another to
sign on their behalf. If I have interpreted the Bill correctly, such
people can do so in respect of consent, but not for withdrawal. Why is
that the
case?</div><a name="08060613000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
third point follows that made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the
specific nature of consents under paragraph 8. Are separate consents
required for the storage of gametes and for the embryo created by the
gametes, as they are for admixed embryos? Such matters might be
explained by the phrase &#147;the chain of consent&#148; that is
used in the explanatory notes, which&#151;to be fair&#151;is why
the hon. Gentleman could not find it. The reference to that is in
paragraph 89 of the explanatory
notes.</div><a name="08060613000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000523"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I had no idea that the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon aspired to be a parliamentary draftsman. If that is
the career he is heading towards, he has demonstrated his ability well
this afternoon, although one of the enormous skills of parliamentary
counsel is&#151;thank goodness&#151;to listen carefully and have
specific instructions about intent and what is expected under the law,
and make sure that it is covered. As the hon. Gentleman progressed
through his questions, he answered
them.</div><a name="08060613000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman said that the schedule is about enabling a person to
give either general consent about how an embryo may be used or specific
consent in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>relation to a particular embryo. Consent can therefore be specific. The
provision needs to reflect all of that and show that, having given
general consent, a person can vary it or withdraw any of their
consents. However, that is limited by paragraph 4 under which consent
cannot be withdrawn when an embryo has been used and has progressed a
long way into a research project. All the references that the hon.
Gentleman made to the schedule picked up each one of those interactions
and reinforced them. That is the only way in which to handle matters
and I am sure that the parliamentary draftsmen will be fascinated to
read how closely he has followed the accuracy of their drafting. Many
people with fantastic qualifications, along with the hon. Gentleman and
his considerable skills, have examined the Bill to see that that is

deliver.</div><a name="08060613000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman thought that a reference was missing in respect of
training. He is not right. If he passes his mind back to our earlier
debate, embryos cannot be created for the purpose of training. The
reference is not missing because such action cannot take place. The
Government do not intend embryos to be created for training alone; they
can be used for training and that is covered under paragraph 6(3).
There is no omission there either. Of course, training is part of a
treatment licence. It is not possible for a licence to be granted for
training in connection with human admixed embryos under schedule 2.
That is reflected in schedule 3, which is why there is no
consent provision; it cannot be done in the first
place.</div><a name="08060613000462"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30

that there will therefore not be a problem training new researchers in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000525"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I thought that I had made it clear during a
previous debate that the Government see training as an integral part of
research. We do not see the necessity for a licence for training only
and we do not permit that.</div>
<a name="08060613000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to the point made by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness, I am not
aware that there has ever been an issue about unsigned consents, so I
cannot specifically reassure him on that point. I suppose that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>is a bit of a reassurance to say that there has never been such an
issue, but I will go back and double check on that
point.</div><a name="08060613000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000526"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> If that is the case&#151;I am sure that the
Minister is correct&#151;it gives rise to a question about the
necessity of adding a signature to a system that is working perfectly
well
already.</div><a name="08060613000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000527"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would accept
that if a signature were made explicit, most of us would sign consent
automatically. However, I cannot tell him whether we have ever had a
consent that has not been signed. The point is to make it explicit.
However, in this matter, we would all ensure that we signed it,
particularly bearing in mind that that could have implications for
future research. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge,
Chryston and Bellshill said, there might be areas of research to which
we would not want to consent. I will return to the matter, but I am
unable at the moment to give the hon. Gentleman specific details at the
moment.</div><a name="08060613000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000528"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I raised six points. The Minister has said that
the first one arose due to a misunderstanding of intention and I shall
look at what she has said. I accept that she has dealt with the second
and third points in respect of training
matters.</div><a name="08060613000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
asked whether the Minister could give an explanation on the provisions
on lavage, and the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness, who can speak
for himself, indicated that he was also interested in that answer. I
have also raised substantively&#151;twice&#151;the threshold for
the patient being likely to regain capacity in respect of amended
paragraph 10 of schedule 3 to the 1990 Act. I would be grateful if the
Minister could respond to those two issues only, having had her amusing
fun with my asking questions about the
schedule.</div><a name="08060613000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000529"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I have answered the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
questions specifically with regard to consent and to that point. I put
all his points together by explaining how they interact in the
schedule. If the hon. Gentleman is still dissatisfied after reading
<i class="I">Hansard</i><i class="I">, </i>I will be more than happy to correspond with him
and make sure that the letters are circulated to every member of the
Committee. I am not trying to avoid answering his questions, but if he
wants complex answers about the interaction of a whole range of things
with which he can be satisfied, he could always give me notice. That
would ensure that I understood before he said it, as well as when he
said it, exactly what was his intention so that I would not
misinterpret it.</div>
<a name="08060613000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness raised a point about the amendment to
paragraph 4 of schedule 3 to the 1990 Act concerning whether people who
are physically incapacitated can withdraw consent. Yes, they can.
Provision is made in paragraph 3 of schedule 3 to the Bill, which
amends paragraph 1 of schedule 3 to the 1990 Act. I hope that he will
be able to reflect on that after the Committee, and if he is still not
satisfied, I would, of course, be happy to come back to
him.</div><a name="08060613000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000530"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The record will show that I made no criticism of
the Minister either in my opening remarks 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>or in my intervention. I accept that the first point that I raised was
about a complex interaction, and I did not expect her necessarily to be
able to satisfy me on that.</div>
<a name="08060613000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the Minister for explaining the position with regard to testing,
which was not immediately apparent to me in respect of human admixed
embryos. More importantly, she explained that under this regime,
training was very clearly going to be permitted on human admixed
embryos and that it was part and parcel of the research licence. I am
not the only person who has expressed concerns about this&#151;people
working in the field want clarification&#151;so I am grateful to her
for that.</div>
<a name="08060613000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not
think, however, that it was unreasonable to ask for an explanation of
paragraph 10 of the schedule. The explanatory notes merely
say:</div>
<a name="08060613000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Paragraph
7 of Schedule 3 to the 1990 Act is amended by paragraph 10 of Schedule
3 to the Bill to prohibit the use of an embryo taken from a woman to
create an embryo in vitro or to create a human admixed embryo in
vitro.&#148;</div><a name="08060613000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
merely asked whether this was just tidying up, or whether there had
been a problem or a concern expressed and what was the mischief that
this was seeking to amend.</div>
<a name="08060613000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000531"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> And I did answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point. I say again that this relates to the question of consent that is
in the 1990 Act regarding women and lavage. Paragraph 10 simply makes
it clear that that has not been superseded. It makes it clear that the
embryo taken from the woman is tied up with questions of consent, in
general or specifically. It cannot be used to create a human admixed
embryo, so the consent on that issue in the 1990 Act is linked to this
schedule. That is the answer that I gave
him.</div><a name="08060613000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000532"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> If that is the case, I am grateful to the Minister
for reiterating that and I will go away and study
that.</div><a name="08060613000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I have raised three times now the position of a patient likely to
regain capacity and whether we have the correct threshold. I do not
think that this is a question of interaction or of how the consent
arrangements fall. There is a specific provision. I wish to ask whether
there will be patients in certain conditions in which it will be very
difficult to judge whether &#147;likely&#148; is the right test. I
think that that will create problems, and it struck me that it might be
possible, before the Bill completes its passage, to provide clarity on
that.</div><a name="08060613000252"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000533"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I have one or two questions for the Minister
about counselling and the circumstances in which it should be offered.
I certainly do not believe that counselling should be mandatory, but it
should be offered and it should be effective. It is important that
counselling is provided by skilled professionals who are experienced in
such matters, so I have some questions.</div>
<a name="08060613000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
counsellors working in this field have specialised training or
expertise, or are they counsellors in other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>areas as well? Is there a division between counsellors who work with
people undergoing treatment and counsellors who work with those who
have donated gametes? Are they different kinds of counsellors who
require different training, or do they come from the same generic group
of individuals? Is there any charge for the counselling service? If so,
is it merely a charge to recoup the costs, or is it a
revenue-generating exercise as well? Finally, are the guidelines set by
the HFEA, or is it up to each individual clinic to set its own
guidelines?</div><a name="08060613000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000534"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> On the question of the fee, the cost of
counselling is covered in the cost of the treatment services&#151;it
is all wrapped up. On the question of who sets the guidelines, a code
of practice is set as guidance for clinics on how to offer counselling.
The code states specifically that patients need to be aware of the
offer, that it needs to be routine, that it should include written
information and that it should give the names of qualified counsellors
in the area, who may also have wider qualifications. The
counsellor&#146;s role needs to be explained, as well as when they
are available and how to access the service. Obviously, there should be
no pressure to accept counselling, but sufficient time should be given
to consider the
offer.</div><a name="08060613000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am afraid that I do not know the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question about the division of counsellors&#146; roles, so I will
have to write to him. The HFEA sets the code of practice, counselling
is included within the cost of treatment, and counsellors need to be
specialised. I will respond to his last point as soon as I
can.</div><a name="08060613000259"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="08060613000537"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b><b class="B"> </b>Amendment No. 34 is a consequential
amendment to amendment No. 5, so I shall concentrate on the latter. It
is, I acknowledge, a further probing amendment, which relates to how
long gametes and embryos can be kept in storage. At the moment, embryos
can be kept for five years, and then for five years beyond that, if the
couple chooses. Will the Minister put on record what evidence exists
that embryos and gametes are of sufficient quality after and up to 10
years? For how long afterwards does she believe that embryos can be
kept in storage without deteriorating, if there is indeed evidence to
support
that?</div><a name="08060613000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the Minister concerned that removing the five-year break will result in
fewer couples giving their embryos for research as they will not
necessarily be reminded of the possibility after the five years? As the
1990 Act 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>lasted for 18 years, I think that the general view in the Committee is
that we wish this Bill, after it becomes an Act, to last similarly
long. Is it possible to change the time period under regulation if
future techniques allow longer storage?</div>
<a name="08060613000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that a recent case forms the basis of an amendment that has been
tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. A young girl,
because of treatment she has received, will not be able to have
children later on in life. However, she is of such a young age that
even if her mother donates an egg for her now, after the 10-year period
has elapsed, she will still not be old enough to have a child.
Regulations might allow that situation to be changed as scientific
techniques develop and, again, it could be amended by new
clause 2, which was tabled by the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="08060613000463"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000538"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I recognise that limits on the storage of
gametes and embryos can cause some concern. The length of storage needs
to ensure fairness, while also taking into account the safety of
freezing. I believe that the statutory 10-year period for gametes, with
extended storage for medical reasons, remains appropriate. I also
consider that the same limits should be applied to embryos. Therefore,
the Bill brings storage limits into line with each
other.</div><a name="08060613000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Warnock report proposed a 10-year period. I suppose that the hon.
Gentleman is quite right about which years one picks&#151;it is
arbitrary. Five years was the decision of Parliament. In the 24 years
since the report was published, there has been no body of evidence to
suggest that using embryos that have been frozen for 10 years endangers
a mother or child. There is a possibility of change&#151;the hon.
Gentleman pointed to the regulating power&#151;enabling an extension
beyond 10 years in specific circumstances, but that is something that
would need to be considered later. At this point, because we can see
that there is an application to go further, it seems sensible to go for
10 years. I suppose that his guess might be as good as anyone
else&#146;s. That is the reason for settling at 10 years, but
allowing variation under specific circumstances and having the
regulatory power in place, if it is necessary to extend it further in
the
future.</div><a name="08060613000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000539"></a>Mark

explanation and for the confirmation that there are regulatory powers

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000541"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I wanted to draw attention to something that has
already been touched upon: a problem with not only the current storage
legislation, but the regulations. The Minister will be aware of the
case that I am going to cite on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for
Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell), who has been assiduously pursuing the
issue for one of his constituents. He raised it on Second Reading and
wrote to the Minister on 14 May to set out the problems. I
thought that it would be useful to summarise the situation and to quote
from that letter, with the permission of my hon.
Friend.</div><a name="08060613000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that the regulations for storing gametes were set by the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Statutory Storage Periods)
Regulations 1991, which could, in theory, be amended under the current
Bill. In this case, there is a woman whose daughter suffers from Turner
syndrome. That is not life-threatening&#151;a relatively normal life
can be led with treatment&#151;but one of its features is
infertility. In this case, the mother wishes to donate her own eggs so
that her daughter will be able to have children by IVF treatment in the
future. The problem is that the time limit for storing gametes is set
at 10 years. Regulations state that gametes must be donated before the
donor reaches the age of 36, which creates a problem in this family
and, presumably, others. If the mother donated before the age of 36,
the 10 years would expire when her daughter was still only 18 and
therefore extremely unlikely to be ready to use the eggs.</div>
<a name="08060613000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will be aware that the current regulations provide for an exception if
the gametes are stored for the use of the donor. However, according to
a letter received by my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove from the
HFEA, the reason for the 10-year limit is that it is best if clinics
are not overburdened by the number of samples in storage. I accept that
there is a regulatory issue, so the question is whether there could be
exceptional circumstances in which samples might be permitted to be
stored for longer than 10 years, for example if donated eggs are
intended for another family member who is infertile, which is the case
that my hon. Friend has made in a number of forums. Would new clause 2
achieve that? If not, might an amended
version?</div><a name="08060613000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is discretion on retrieving eggs after the age of 36. In exceptional
circumstances, clinics can use eggs from women over the age of 36, but
I think that everyone is aware&#151;the Minister is, of
course&#151;that fertility and thus the efficacy of the treatment
diminishes rapidly after that
point.</div><a name="08060613000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
if the drafting of new clause 2 is not perfect&#151;if there are
imperfections, it is through no fault of my hon. Friend&#151;I hope
that its intention is clear. It states that an exception can be made
when a person</div>
<a name="08060613000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has given
written consent for them to be used by another person...(a) who is
a blood relative of the person providing the gametes...(b) whose
fertility was, in the written opinion of a registered medical
practitioner, significantly impaired on the date on which the gametes
were provided, and...(c) who was aged under 45 on the date on
which the gametes were provided.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div><a name="08060613000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not a
unique case&#151;I am conscious of the fact that we should not
legislate to provide for an individual case&#151;and I wonder whether
an amendment could be made. Obviously, we do not need primary
legislation, so I would understand if the Minister said that the
Government wished to consider the matter themselves and introduce their
own regulations to allow for an
exception.</div><a name="08060613000278"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000542"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b><b class="B"> </b>My concern with new clause 2 is about the
extremely broad nature of the phrase &#147;blood relative&#148;.
Has the hon. Gentleman thought about narrowing it down to a sibling,
son or daughter of the donor to exclude third cousins twice removed and
so
on?</div><a name="08060613000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000543"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That is a fair point. There are questions about
whether the wording is broad. I am not wedded to the wording of the new
clause, so I accept that it might need further work. I have never
claimed to be a parliamentary draftsman, despite what was said earlier,
and I do not seek to be one. My cup overflows
already.</div><a name="08060613000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to make a further point about surrogacy. I have not tabled an
amendment on this, but any provision would be very similar to new
clause 2, so the matter relates to this debate. The Human Fertilisation
and Embryology (Statutory Storage Period for Embryos) Regulations 1996
specify the period for which gametes and embryos respectively can be
stored in cases where the patient is, or will become, permanently
infertile. In extending the normal five-year storage period, the
regulations enable patients to preserve their last chance to conceive
their own genetic child until the female patient in question is
approximately aged 55. Although the Bill extends the normal embryo
storage period from five to 10 years, which I think is a good idea, it
does not amend the special regulations for extended storage. I think
there is a case for the regulations to be updated to benefit patients
conceiving their own children through surrogacy. Surrogacy patients are
explicitly excluded and, in practice, it seems to me&#151;and to
those advising me&#151;that it is utterly arbitrary that a woman who
has had her ovaries removed due to cancer can store her eggs and
embryos until she is 55, but a woman who has had a hysterectomy due to
cancer can store her eggs or embryos for only 10 years. That seems to
be somewhat unfair, so I was wondering if the Minister would consider
there to be scope to bring the situations more into line&#151;if not
in this Bill, through
regulations.</div><a name="08060613000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000544"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press new
clause 2 to a Division because I think that he raises a number of
difficult issues with regard to some aspects of the regulation. As he
has pointed out, there are regulation-making powers under the 1990 Act,
and the Bill allows changes to regulations, such as those relating to
statutory storage periods of gametes.</div>
<a name="08060613000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made the point that it is not always wise to make primary
legislation on the basis of one case. Perhaps if I could tell him when
the regulations will be available for consideration, he might rightly
feel&#151;as I do&#151;that that would be the appropriate place to
raise these considerations. New policies will be proposed in
regulations and they will need to be consulted on. The timetable for
those regulations is such that the drafts will likely be available
toward the end of this year.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div><a name="08060613000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the points that the hon. Gentleman raises could be appropriately dealt
with in that consultation and the consideration of those regulations,
rather than through new clause 2, because there will be other points to
consider. For example, the hon. Gentleman touched on surrogacy, which
is not addressed by the new clause. There might well be other
exceptional circumstances, but it would be wise to address them all in
one place in the
regulations.</div><a name="08060613000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove accept that
the Government see that this issue needs to be addressed and intend to
ensure that that happens during the consideration of the regulations,
which will take place before the end of the year. That will be the
appropriate point of the consultation to add in some of the points that
the hon. Gentleman is
suggesting.</div><a name="08060613000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000545"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I thank the Minister for that response, although
she did not necessarily say that she agreed that there should be a
solution. I think she did accept that there was a problem in this
case.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000548"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> No, no, with respect, I do not know whether
there will be a solution. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it would
be desirable to find a solution and the appropriate vehicle for this is
the regulations. At this time, I do not know, so that is my only
point.</div><a name="08060613000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000549"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I apologise to the Minister. I am satisfied that
she recognises that there is a problem and that she suggests that
rather than trying to amend primary legislation through new clause 2,
or another version of it, the appropriate time would be either during
the drafting of regulations, or their redrafting following the
consultation. I am delighted because she has confirmed that there will
be a consultation on drafts, which we discussed earlier. That is always
good when regulations are being considered because once they are laid,
it is impossible to amend them unless the regulations are
withdrawn.</div>
<a name="08060613000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the Minister for indicating that she hopes that the drafts will
capture, if possible, a solution to a problem that she acknowledges. I
am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove, who might be
listening to the debate using new or old technology, will share my
gratitude&#151;and, I suspect, that of his constituent&#151;to the
Minister for her positive response.</div>

the premises would have been inspected before the licence was granted
or renewed, it is also important for the person responsible to ensure
that the right equipment and parts of the premises are used for each
procedure, and that there is no risk of cross-contamination between
admixed embryos and IVF embryos, for example. On my visit to the Centre
for Life in Newcastle I saw that it undertakes different types of
medical research or treatment in separate parts of the same building.
It is obviously the responsibility of the licence holder to ensure that
there is no transfer or confusion between the
two.</div><a name="08060613000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an inconsistency. There is no mention of equipment and premises in
clause 17, yet in clause 18(d) and (e) they are mentioned as specific
reasons for the potential revocation of the licence. Will the Minister
explain that
inconsistency?</div><a name="08060613000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000551"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The amendment would add a requirement to
section 17 of the 1990 Act to ensure that it would be a duty of the
person responsible to secure appropriate premises as well as equipment
in which to carry out activities as they are licensed under the Act.
Furthermore, the requirements of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
(Quality and Safety) Regulations 2007, which incorporate the European
Union tissue and cells directive into the 1990 Act, would apply to any
embryos that are intended for human application. The directive made
various extensions to licence conditions, which are set out in schedule
3A to the Act and incorporated by section 14A. The provisions ensure
that appropriate equipment and materials are used as well as suitable
facilities and premises. It means that any licence that relates to
gametes and embryos intended for human application must satisfy those
conditions. If they do not, they will be in breach of the
licence.</div><a name="08060613000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have put the hon. Gentleman&#146;s mind at rest. The HFEA
always ensures that the person responsible will secure the appropriate
premises as part of the licence application. The suitability of the
premises is already part of the HFEA inspection process so the twin
arrangements are catered for and, if that were not the case, it would
be a breach of the licence,</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000552"></a>Mark

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000553"></a>Mark

amendment relates to the variation of a licence. Under section 16 of
the 1990 Act, the initial applicant had to satisfy the licensing
committee that the character, qualifications and experience of the
applicant were suitable. My understanding is that, under this Bill, the
person to whom the licence is transferred will not need to satisfy the
authority that they are anything more than suitable. There is a
difference between those two definitions. One could have a suitable
character without the required qualifications and necessary experience.
Is the Minister happy with that difference? Would she not prefer a more
robust system, with a new inspection under the person responsible or
the licence
holder?</div><a name="08060613000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister also clarify whether there is a prohibition on the sale of
a licence? Can a licence effectively be bought and sold within the
context of the criteria I have just mentioned?</div>
<a name="08060613000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
further issue with regard to this amendment. In proposed new section
18A(3), a very clear distinction is made between</div>
<a name="08060613000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the person
responsible&#148;</div>
<a name="08060613000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div>

the Minister say how many licences have been granted where the person
responsible and the licence holder are not the same person? In the
revocation categories, again, it refers only to &#147;the person
responsible&#148;, not the licence holder, which implies that one,
&#147;the holder of the licence&#148;, is a subset of the other,
&#147;the person responsible&#148;. If they are different, why are
they not different in the revocation categories, and if they are the
same, why is there a distinction in the first part of clause
18?</div><a name="08060613000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000554"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The hon. Gentleman has indicated a rather broad
range of questions, which effectively constitute a stand part debate. I
am perfectly content with
that.</div><a name="08060613000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000555"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The Bill simplifies provisions in order to
allow the HFEA to determine applications by a licence holder in a more
flexible manner. However, this does not change the strict criteria for
determining whether people are suitable to be the person responsible.
That remains the same.</div>
<a name="08060613000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005, the
HFEA, in consultation with stakeholders, took a decision to revise its
assessment process for the person responsible, and there are now formal
assessments to ensure that the designated person is proficient in their
role and up to date with the latest developments in their field. This
process consists of various assessments that the person must satisfy.
For a research licence, for example, the assessment consists of three
workbooks that must be completed by the designated responsible person.
One is on the regulatory framework, one is on quality management and
risk, and the third covers research regulations. The workbooks also
include  details outlining certain person specifications,
including 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>qualifications. They state all relevant medical, biological, scientific
or professional healthcare qualifications, and require the applicant to
demonstrate experience, including experience and extensive knowledge of
fertility-related management, clinical and scientific developments and
treatments, including ethical
viewpoints.</div><a name="08060613000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Boston and Skegness went on, as he did before, to ask
about the process and refusals in varying or revoking a licence. All
the decisions relating to granting, revoking, suspending or varying a
centre&#146;s licence are taken by the licence committee of the
authority, based on inspection. Inspections need to assess quality,
effectiveness of the clinical management, and a whole list of things
that I will not read into the record. I will write to him about
them.</div>
<a name="08060613000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">He asked
specifically whether a licence could be sold, passed on or transferred
to another responsible person. It could be, but the HFEA must approve
any transfer of licence, and it would need to be satisfied that the
transfer would go to a responsible person and under all the conditions
that I have outlined, as agreed after the 2005 consultation
process.</div>
<a name="08060613000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last question about whether
there is a difference between a responsible person and a licence
holder. I have a feeling that there is not, but I do not want to commit
myself unnecessarily to that and I will come back to him. I hope that
he is satisfied that measures are still there to ensure that the
responsible person is properly qualified and experienced in the
relevant fields, and that the HFEA will scrutinise the licence and the
responsible person very closely.</div>
<a name="08060613000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000556"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that reply.
The only outstanding issue is the one to which she referred at the end.
It would be helpful if after the Committee I could explain to her in
more detail what I feel is not consistent. Perhaps I was not clear
enough in my explanation&#151;I will not go through it again now, but
it is something that should be looked at. I am happy to receive a
response from the Minister after she has had a chance to discuss it
with her officials and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000559"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Again, I shall be brief; these are probing
amendments. Perhaps the Minister could clarify why on page 15 there
seems to be some duplication. In clause 19A there are four distinct
categories:</div><a name="08060613000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the case of a decision to grant a licence, the Authority shall give
notice of the decision to&#151;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div><a name="08060613000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) the applicant,
and</div> <a name="08060613000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) the
person who is to be the person
responsible&#148;.</div><a name="08060613000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
those seem to be exactly the same for the four categories: granting,
revocation and the two types of variation. I understand that in clause
19A(7) a distinction is drawn with subsections (2) and (4), but I
cannot see why it is broken down into four distinct categories under
19A and not two or three. The people who must be notified after
decisions are taken are exactly the same. That is the purpose of
amendment No. 144.</div>
<a name="08060613000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
145 has been tabled because there are clearly delays that can be
damaging both to business and research&#151;particularly the latter
as research grants elapse after a certain period of time. Under the
current provisions, the authority can take as long as it chooses to
decide whether to grant or refuse a licence. The amendment would ensure
that the authority understands that it would be helpful if a specific
time period&#151;specified in the regulations after
consultation&#151;could be set out to help provide clarity. Perhaps
the Minister and her officials could give that some thought.</div>
<a name="08060613000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most public
bodies have specific time scales within which they must respond. For
example, the Department of Health is supposed to respond to
correspondence from MPs within 20 days. I am sure that the Minister
will be the first to acknowledge that that is not always the case, but
attempts are always made to ensure that the time scale is met. There is
concern within the industry&#151;if I can call it that&#151;that
there may have been unacceptable and unreasonable delays in specific
circumstances. I would not seek to specify the time period in the Bill;
that will have to come through discussions and be put through
regulations after consultation. However, it is a key point and requires
addressing.</div>
<a name="08060613000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000560"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
perfectly and the reasons why he seeks to set a time limit, or at least
to get an indication of one. This issue is often raised. I accept that
the HFEA should respond in reasonable time, and recognise that
regulations would allow a suitable period to be determined in
consultation with interested
parties.</div>
<a name="08060613000465"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="08060613000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">However&#151;the
hon. Gentleman touched on this, so I think that what I am about to say
might help&#151;setting out such a time limit in statute would
restrict the HFEA in having the added flexibility that might be needed
in certain situations in the more complex licence applications. I can
reassure him and the Committee, however, that the HFEA is committed to
notifying the applicant of its decision either to grant or refuse a
licence within set time scales. It has a self-imposed target of three
months for licence applications, and four for any new treatment and
storage licences. It is right that we allow it that
flexibility.</div><a name="08060613000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over
the past 12 months&#151;I accept that this would not necessarily
apply to the more complex applications&#151;the HFEA has received
three applications for research licences, all of which were processed
and decided upon within the required three months. That indicates that
currently it is processing applications in a timely fashion, although 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>we would expect it to be thorough as well. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman accepts that his probing amendment on time limits is dealt
with.</div><a name="08060613000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 19 provides that reasons must be given for certain
licensing decisions and provides an opportunity for representations to
be made before a decision is taken. It sets out the person to whom
notice is to be given when the decision is made. The new provisions set
it out that if the HFEA agrees to an application from a licence holder
or person responsible to vary or revoke, it does not need to give
reasons for its decisions when giving notice to the specified persons.
That makes sense, because the HFEA is granting what was requested. That
measure is aimed at reducing the unnecessary bureaucratic measures that
have also been mentioned. When a decision goes against a request,
proposed new section 19A(5) will require the applicant to be given
reasons for the refusal. I think that that provision satisfies the
concerns raised in relation to the
amendment.</div><a name="08060613000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman then asked about the reason for the different
categories. It is to cover the different areas&#151;granting,
revocation, application or any other variation&#151;so that they are
all covered by slightly different notification requirements based on
the relevant application. I accept that that might appear more
complicated in the Bill, but in practice it will speed up and make
clear what applies in the case of different decisions. I hope that that
deals with his
questions.</div><a name="08060613000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000561"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Again, I thank the Minister for her response.
Amendment No. 144 is really a probing amendment on which she has
clearly satisfied me. I hear what the she says about amendment No. 145,
but I urge her and the relevant officials in the Department to monitor
the situation carefully, because there is concern among those applying
for
licences.</div><a name="08060613000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am intrigued that the Minister says that there has been no delay in
applications in the past 12 months&#151;that is not what people have
been telling me. What was the point of Tuesday&#146;s debate on
delegated powers to speed up the process, if it does not need speeding
up? From what she has said today, the process seems to be working well.
I suspect, however, that because of the additional potential licence
areas with which the HFEA will have to cope when the Bill is enacted,
it will receive more licence applications than it has to date. The
situation therefore needs to be monitored
carefully.</div>
<a name="08060613000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000562"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I hope that I did not convey any complacency in
explaining what has happened in the 2007-08 period. I accept that
comments have been made, and the hon. Gentleman is right about needing
to be vigilant and ensuring that the process continues to be accurate
and timely&#151;without unwarranted delay&#151;unless there is
complexity.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000563"></a>Mark

give the impression of complacency on this particular occasion. On that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000564"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 146, in
clause 20, page 15, line 38, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2A) No more
than four consecutive suspensions under subsection (1) can be granted,
totalling a maximum period of twelve
months.&#146;.</div><a name="08060613000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to the number of consecutive suspensions that the
HFEA may allow. Of course it is right that the HFEA should have the
power to suspend a licence quickly and efficiently if it has reasonable
grounds to believe that the terms of the licence might be broken. It
also has the power to renew such a suspension
indefinitely.</div><a name="08060613000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment will either place an upper restriction on the number of times
that a suspension may be renewed to a period of up to one year or
establish why that is not acceptable to the Government. Clearly, a
suspension for even a short period could be damaging to a business or
research project that had a licence up to that point. In my view, it is
correct that a decision should be made within a year. By then, the
appeal process should have been gone through, if appropriate, and the
authority should have had sufficient time in which to investigate,
clarify its concerns and rectify any problems.</div>
<a name="08060613000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to make an additional point if I may, Mr. Gale, about the
timing of the appeal procedure. How quick will it be? Will it be dealt
with within the three-month period, or is that one of the main reasons
why there is no limit on the number of times that a suspension may be
renewed? Clearly, if appeals can be heard and clarified expeditiously,
that will benefit the authority and those who previously had a fully
operational, licensed business or research
facility.</div><a name="08060613000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000565"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Proposed new section 19C retains the right of
the authority to suspend a licence, where it considers there are
grounds to do so, for a period of three months and for further periods
of three months after that, if it sees fit. In my view and in the
experience of the authority, given the work that it has undertaken,
that is the correct way to proceed and there should be no specification
of the number of times that a suspension period has been
repeated.</div><a name="08060613000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Boston and Skegness touched on a case from June 2007 in
which the HFEA used its powers to suspend a licence for three months,
and then suspended it for another three months while it considered an
updated report. He will be aware that there was interaction with the
High Court in that case and a judicial review of the decision. I am
sure he accepts that it is quite difficult to have a maximum period in
such circumstances, because the suspension is needed until a decision
is taken and there might be external factors to consider, such as
judicial appeal or a High Court
judgment.</div><a name="08060613000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
we are is right. The period should be three months, with an option to
suspend again. Clearly, we expect things to be speeded up&#151;part
of the flexibility given in the appeals procedure and the structure of
the licensing committee is to ensure that matters are dealt with in
that period. That will further reduce the time involved. However, to
pick an exceptional case and then argue for a limit given those
exceptional circumstances is incorrect. I hope the hon. Gentleman
accepts that.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div><a name="08060613000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman then asked about the period for the appeal. The new
provisions permit an appeal to be made within 14 days. Within the new
framework for appeals, that will be set out in regulations. Safeguards
remain in place to ensure that the suspension continues pending
resolution of the appeal in order to protect public safety. It is right
that we do not have a maximum period because of other interactions. It
is right that we give the HFEA, as we have elsewhere in the Bill, the
opportunity to speed up those considerations wherever possible.
However, it would be unwise of us, with sometimes complex cases, to set
a maximum period when the right resolution could not be achieved. We
are talking about patient safety and quality of care. I hope that the
hon. Gentleman accepts my
comments.</div><a name="08060613000346"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000566"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I thank the Minister for that response. I accept
her arguments, particularly on judicial review and the time that those
often complex cases take. I also take her reassurance on a focus on
speeding up the decisions and considerations wherever possible. It is
right that safety and quality of provision have to be fundamental to
everything that happens under the
Bill.</div><a name="08060613000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
that explanation from the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

clause 20, page 16, line 4, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(6) During a
period of suspension all necessary, suitable and appropriate steps must
be taken by the Authority to ensure there is no damage to the cells,
embryos and gametes that were the responsibility of the licence holder
or person responsible when the licence was
suspended.&#146;.</div><a name="08060613000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to the authority having the power to suspend a
licence quickly and efficiently in cases where there are reasonable
grounds for the terms of a licence perhaps having been broken.
Obviously, for the authority to have that right is correct. However, is
it right that during the suspension the people undergoing treatment at
that centre could suffer or, worse, lose their embryos or
gametes?</div><a name="08060613000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure from either the 1990 Act or the Bill whether there is a
duty on the authority to ensure that clients are unaffected during a
licence suspension and can continue treatment at other licensed
premises. Therefore, there is a crossover in how that impacts on the
confidentiality of information going between the
two.</div><a name="08060613000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also,
what happens to the gametes and embryos stored in a facility that is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000568"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that the HFEA,
within its requirements when it suspends a licence, has to issue
special directions. Those special directions allow for the continued
storage of gametes and embryos at the clinic. The HFEA would also
expect the clinic to make appropriate arrangements for the continued
treatment of its patients if a licence were revoked. Furthermore, it
would expect gametes and embryos to be moved to another licensed
clinic.</div><a name="08060613000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
with suspension, the HFEA would also expect the clinic to make
appropriate arrangements for the continued treatment of its patients.
The HFEA already has the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>power to do that, so I do not think it necessary to give it further
powers under the
Bill.</div><a name="08060613000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman has raised a series of important questions, but I hope
that in each of those circumstances continued treatment of patients,
safe storage and/or transfer of gametes and embryos will all be dealt
with under the special directions, which are part of the licensing
requirements.</div><a name="08060613000466"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30

Primarolo:</b> The clause provides for regulations to ensure
that membership of the appeals committee is made up wholly or partly of
persons who are members of the authority. Regulations relating to the
appeals process will be forthcoming to deal with consideration under
the affirmative procedure, and they will come into force at the time of
the commencement of the relevant provisions in the Bill. In conjunction
with the HFEA, we are considering the details of those regulations,
which will be the subject of public consultation prior to consideration
by both Houses. The issue that the hon. Gentleman raises with regard to
appeals committees, who sits on those committees, and their connection
or otherwise to the original decision, will be addressed at that point.
I therefore hope he does not feel the need to press the amendment to a
vote.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div><a name="08060613000363"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000572"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am pleased that the Minister has confirmed
that the matter will be addressed in regulations. It is clearly a very
important part of the appeal process, and there has to be confidence
that this is a fair process among those applying for licences or
appealing against the revocation or variation of licences, which is not
driven by themselves. Regarding future consultation, the Government had
an enormous amount of time to consult before the Bill was introduced in
Parliament, and in many cases they did so extremely thoroughly, and
with extreme diligence. Why has consultation about this particular part
of the Bill not taken
place?</div><a name="08060613000364"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000573"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> To remind the hon. Gentleman, the 1990 Act
prevents anyone who took part in proceedings resulting in the appeal
from taking part in the appeal. That is already the case. By ensuring
that the appeal is heard by different people, it reduces the potential
bias and makes certain that the process is impartial. Under the 1990
Act, members of the appeals committee would not have heard the initial
proceedings, although they would all be members of the authority. The
new power will enable the committee to be comprised, wholly or
partially, of non-authority members, thus allowing for further
improvements in the impartiality of the appeals committee. For those
reasons, and because of the difficulty of getting the balance that we
need, careful consideration is required. With respect, if we were
presumptuous and consulted on draft regulations, even though the House
had not agreed we had the power to do that before the Bill received
Royal Assent, that could cause confusion and difficulty. It is partly
about process, but also about the difficult and complex issues that we
need to take in a steady fashion.</div>
<a name="08060613000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000574"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful for that clarification and
explanation, and I understand the Minister&#146;s points about
consulting on draft regulations before the Bill has completed its
passage through Parliament, but she will also be aware of the concerns
expressed earlier by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon and
me that draft regulations are rarely amended in that sense when they
come before Parliament. However, I accept that they will have to be
debated under the affirmative
procedure.</div><a name="08060613000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000575"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that they will be
thoroughly consulted on in draft form. It is such an important issue
that I would hope that we would reach consensus before Parliament has
its final approach under the affirmative procedure in both
Houses.</div><a name="08060613000367"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000576"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. Of course,
we all hope that consensus can be reached on such important issues, but
the Minister will certainly be aware from the passage of the Bill that
consensus on such complex issues is sometimes difficult to achieve.
None the less, I listened to what she said. I am pleased that the
matter will be clarified in future regulations and will undergo
detailed consultation. I hope that when the regulations come before
Parliament under the affirmative procedure, the issues will be
addressed specifically. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="08060613000368"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000577"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 149, in
clause 21, page 17, line 32, at
end insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;within 28 days of the appeals
committee
meeting.&#146;.</div><a name="08060613000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
the issue is the time scale. It concerns the appeals committee and the
appeals procedure. Any case that reaches the appeals committee is
likely to be lengthy and indeed costly, so it is right that the appeals
committee should give its judgment as swiftly as possible to resolve
the case either way, prevent undue delay and produce clarity. I do not
stipulate that 28 days is the correct figure&#151;it may well be
longer than that&#151;but I want to put on record the concern that
the appeals procedure could take too long. Will the Minister inform the
Committee how long appeals committees take from start to finish? What
gap exists between the time when it is clear that somebody wants to
appeal and the time when the process starts in
detail?</div><a name="08060613000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister also confirm whether the regulations could be changed so
that during the appeals committee, the appellant and the HFEA can give
both oral and written evidence, and that that evidence can be made
public so that people can see exactly what the process is in a
transparent and effective way? Why will written and oral evidence be
given and made public only at the initial licensing committee stage and
not at the appeals
stage?</div><a name="08060613000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000578"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> On the question of time limits, the limit of 28
days, from the meeting and the point of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment, is a reasonable period, to be perfectly honest, within which
an appellant should be informed of a decision. However, we understand
that in practice, it is likely to occur much sooner than that. Of the
two recent appeals, one took seven days and one took 18 days.</div>
<a name="08060613000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
appreciate that the amendment would guarantee that the decision was
communicated within a specific time frame, given that practice is
already better than that, it is not an issue that needs to be put into
primary legislation. In the two cases concerned, when a decision was
reached, I am informed that the appellant was informed within 18 days.
In the appeals process, the whole decision is considered, and the
decision is challengeable. That means that the appeals committee would
have to be provided with the same information, and it is on that basis
that it needs to look at the information in a particular form. If the
hon. Gentleman is not satisfied with that
answer&#151;</div><a name="08060613000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000579"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> May I finish my sentence? I am certainly
prepared to go back and clarify with the HFEA the point that the hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness is making.</div>
<a name="08060613000375"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000580"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but it is
difficult to catch her attention, and I wanted her to finish her
remarks. Are the regulations under this section, and proposed new
sections 20A and B, under the affirmative or negative procedure? I did
not think that they were listed under the affirmative list on page 34
of the Bill, or relevant page of the Act as it will be amended,
although I may have missed something, and I apologise if I have done
so.</div>
<a name="08060613000376"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000581"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am happy to confirm for the hon. Gentleman
that they are the regulations would fall under the affirmative
procedure, and that they would be produced in draft for consultation. I
said in response to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>a previous amendment that, although there is not always consensus on
some of the issues in the Bill, I hope to ensure, as the consultation
would, that before the draft regulations came to the House and the
other place for consideration under the affirmative procedure, there
was a great deal of agreement about their
provisions.</div><a name="08060613000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000582"></a>Mark

had been led to believe that they were affirmative

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000583"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I missed a little bit of the debate in which the
timing was discussed, but neither page 34 of the Bill, nor the Act as
it will be amended, includes the new section. Although I do not doubt
the Minister&#146;s intention&#151;it is right that the affirmative
procedure should be used&#151;perhaps I have not quite understood
where affirmative regulations are listed.</div>
<a name="08060613000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000584"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, but when
the hon. Gentleman momentarily left the Committee Room, the Minister
confirmed that the regulations would be introduced on an affirmative
basis, as she has just done again in response to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intervention. I am prepared to take the
Minister&#146;s word for
it.</div><a name="08060613000380"></a>

That is why I tabled the amendment&#151;to try to understand where
the Government have got to in their thought process with regard to that
point. I accept that it is a complex issue, and indeed I see why the
Government, after due consideration of the reading of the Bill in the
other place, have decided not to make an appropriate amendment in this
area.</div><a name="08060613000389"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000588"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I want to raise questions about some of the
assertions made in respect of this matter. While I do not oppose the
provision of information to people who are interested where that
information is held, and it is quite clear in advance that the donor
understands that information might be made available, one has to
consider the privacy of parents and individuals who do not want their
children&#151;that relates to the point raised by the
amendment&#151;or people more generally to know that they were
donor-conceived.</div>
<a name="08060613000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to identify the key points. My understanding is that it is
clearly of benefit to know whether there is a genetic issue in terms of
health, that the Bill already provides for that, and that we are
talking in these provisions about identifying information generally
speaking. The amendment at least is about getting more information and
identifying information. Obviously, it is important that people
understand that they are not seeking to marry or enter a sexual
relationship with someone who is related to them.</div>
<a name="08060613000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">One has to be
careful, however, before one asserts for sure that there is significant
benefit from knowing one&#146;s genetic background, because there may
a disbenefit from discovering a family secret: for example, that there
was infertility and donor insemination, that that had been kept secret
from the person concerned, or that there may have been infidelity
involved. It is not clear to me from looking at what little evidence
there is in this area that it has been established that someone will
always benefit from being able to know their genetic identity and to
establish their genetic background; or, for that matter, that people
have an absolute right, or even a very strong arguable right, to have
that
information.</div><a name="08060613000392"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000589"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to make those
points, and that is why it is important that the amendment can apply
only to those whose parent is deceased. I think that that makes a
significant difference, certainly with some of the &#147;family
secrets&#148; that the hon. Gentleman seems to be mentioning. I think
that they start to dissipate once the person involved has
died.</div><a name="08060613000393"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000590"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I do not want to get too heavily involved in the
generational issue here, because the provisions are prospective, but
one can envisage a situation whereby the grandparents of the person
seeking the information did not want it known in their family that
infertility services had been used. I think that the provision will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>have to be prospective since a couple of years ago, so we are talking a
number of decades hence, but the amendment would provide that those
people do not have any opportunity to prevent not just the child who
was conceived from finding out&#151;as is the right under the Bill,
regardless of whether I think it is a strong right or always
beneficial&#151;but a third party, and it is a third party from their
point of view. I will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s
response to the amendment. I understand the basis upon which the hon.
Gentleman has tabled amendment. One can imagine that it would be of
real interest and significance to an individual. That was said in the
House of Lords and I do not dispute the sincerity of people who believe
that, but I think that what is left out of these debates all the time,
especially in the House of Lords, is the right of the people who were
patients receiving fertility treatment to have some privacy.</div>
<a name="08060613000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am a great
believer in people who are having fertility treatment telling their
children, at an appropriate age, that they were conceived through donor
insemination, but it is not my view that they must do that and it is
clearly not the Government&#146;s view, because the Government are
not forcing them to do so or automatically releasing
information.</div>
<a name="08060613000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the Government are absolutely right, because family dynamics are
complex and it is not right for the state to wade in in that way. While
the amendment is relatively modest in that respect, here and in other
debates I urge consideration for the privacy and memory of the parents
and patients. If they have not told someone, the fact of it being found
out means that they have, essentially, concealed it. That has
implications for all sorts of things, including people being written in
and out of wills regardless of their legal entitlement to inherit. A
can of worms exists here, and I think that that is why we must have
caution in all these
areas.</div><a name="08060613000396"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000591"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I agree with the points that the hon. Gentleman
has just made. I will answer specifically the questions I was asked by
the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness regarding the
Government&#146;s position. The Bill allows for donor-conceived
people, on reaching the age of 16, to contact the HFEA to find out
non-identifying information about their donor. This information is,
rightly, accessible to donor-conceived people, and has a direct impact
on them.</div>
<a name="08060613000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of allowing donor-conceived people access to information about their
donor is to fill a gap in the knowledge that they have about
themselves. Many donor-conceived people feel they are missing important
information about who they are and where they came from, because one
set of genetic information is missing. Information, including
identifying information about the donor, is intended to help to address
that, and it is for those reasons that provisions are made to allow
such people to find out about their donor. Donors sign up to donate on
the understanding that such information will be available.</div>
<a name="08060613000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
behind the amendment is to shift down a further generation, to allow
children of donor-conceived people to contact the HFEA to obtain
information from the register regarding their parent&#146;s donor, in
a situation where the parent has died and did not make contact with the
HFEA. The amendment would allow the child of a donor-conceived person
to find out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>whether they are related to someone with whom they are having, or intend
to have, an intimate relationship. In effect, it means giving a child
access to details of their parent&#146;s donor conception that the
parent had chosen not to access. We can envisage that a parent may well
have decided quite intentionally not to access that information, and
may have regarded it as personal and highly sensitive. It also raises
the question of situations in which the donor-conceived person is not
dead but is incapacitated. What do we do then? Should their children be
able to go to the HFEA?</div>
<a name="08060613000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government said that they would give the issue very careful
consideration since it was raised in another place. We remain of the
view, having looked again and considered the issues, that access to the
HFEA&#146;s register should continue to focus on those directly
affected, and that it should be up to the donor-conceived person to
decide whether to access the information available to them and who they
subsequently choose to pass that information to&#151;including their
own offspring.</div>
<a name="08060613000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we
realise that there may be compelling circumstances, it would be
difficult to limit access to that specific situation, and wider access
to the register would raise broader issues around access to sensitive
and personal information. I am also of the view that, on donating, a
donor is able to prepare for possible contact from a donor-conceived
child, and to envisage the time span in which that may occur. I do not
think that it is reasonable for the donor to be much older and unable
to expect at what point in time a possible contact might be
made.</div>
<a name="08060613000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
understand the point made by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness,
we must allow a donor-conceived individual to decide to whom they pass
on information if they have accessed it. No one else should have the
right to access that information. I hope that that clarifies the
Government&#146;s view for the hon. Gentleman. We consider this to be
fundamental in terms of the rights of the individuals concerned and I
hope that he will not press the
amendment.</div>
<a name="08060613000402"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000592"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I rise briefly to say that I wholly endorse what
the Minister has said, the reasons that she has given and the thinking
behind it. The Government were right to say that they would reflect on
this as it was raised with a great deal of support in the House of
Lords. However, as I said, I do not think that the other place
considered some of the points that the Minister has just mentioned. It
was quite reasonable for the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness to
raise the issue, but the Minister&#146;s comments apply not just to
this amendment, but to the whole area. I hope that we will have a
chance this afternoon, albeit briefly, to discuss the implication of
what she has just said for some of the other
arrangements.</div>
<a name="08060613000403"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000593"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I thank the Minister for her response. Sometimes
if one moves probing amendments in Committee, one tends to agree more
with the response rather than the initial amendment. At least the
Minister has kindly put on the record that detailed consideration of
the debate took place in the House of Lords, and she comprehensively
set out the reasons for the decision that the Department, and she as
the relevant Minister, have made in not changing the Bill. On that
note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="08060613000404"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000594"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in
clause 24, page 23, line 42, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(10) In this
section &#147;reasonable period&#148; means a period of no longer
than 3
months&#146;.</div><a name="08060613000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to the definition of &#147;reasonable
period&#148;. In this section there does not seem to be any
definition of what is deemed to be a reasonable period, despite the
phrase being used in subsections (6)(b) and (7)(b). I would be grateful
if the Minister could clarify her perception of a reasonable period,
and whether it will be specified and set down in regulations or whether
it will be interpreted as and when appropriate by the
HFEA.</div>
<a name="08060613000408"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000595"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> We believe it right that if donors wish to ask
for specified non-identifying information about the child, they should
be able to do so. That right should be made clear in the Act. The
clause sets out two possible routes for finding out that information.
Information about the number, sex and year of birth of children born
from donations is held on the HFEA&#146;s register.</div>
<a name="08060613000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where donors
have donated through a licensed clinic or regulated sperm donation
service, the most obvious route for their inquiry will be through that
clinic or regulated service. Subsections (6) and (7) provide that the
HFEA need not comply with the request from a donor if the clinic or
regulated sperm donation service where the donor donated is still
operating. That is unless the donor has asked for the information first
and the clinic has failed to respond within a reasonable time period,
or if it has notified the donor that the information is not held. In
such cases, the donor can seek the information from the HFEA, which
must comply if it has the information.</div>
<a name="08060613000468"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="08060613000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would specify a reasonable time period, which would not
exceed three months. If the clinic had not provided the information to
the donor within the specified time period, the donor would be able to
go straight to the HFEA. I recognise that three months might be
considered a reasonable period in which to receive the information, but
to specify it in the Bill would be over-prescriptive and bureaucratic,
and would not allow the HFEA to determine the policy in the flexible
manner that we have set out. I am sure that the hon. Member for Boston
and Skegness can understand that it might not always be able to comply
with three months, given the access points, the types of information
that might be held and the different places that donors might have to
go to. We would expect that to be done without unnecessary delay, but I
would ask him not to press for a three-month limit to be put in the
Bill.</div><a name="08060613000411"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000596"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I thank the Minister for that clarification. I
tabled the amendment to ensure that she and the HFEA understood the
importance of the speed of provision of information and of putting
pressure on clinics to provide it as quickly as possible. However, of
course I understand her sensible points about being over-prescriptive
in the Bill and thereby reducing flexibility.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>I very much hope that the HFEA will take on board comments made and
perhaps even set out in guidelines an initial time scale for providing
such information wherever possible. On that basis, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08060613000412"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="08060613000413"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000597"></a>Lord
Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury (Steve McCabe):</b> I
am advised that we will probably not be able to complete the clause

Consequently, I beg to move that further consideration of the Bill be
now adjourned.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060613000598"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Let me make the position plain. These are
extremely complex issues and require a very high level of
concentration, if we are to do them justice. I speak for nobody other
than myself in saying that I find this quite difficult to follow, and
the Chair needs to follow it very carefully. I believe that three hours
in one sitting is long enough. I am perfectly happy to suspend the
sitting and come back, but it seems that we have covered a great deal
of ground today. I think that a period of reflection might refresh us
all and allow hon. Members to have a good stand part debate on Tuesday
morning.</div>
