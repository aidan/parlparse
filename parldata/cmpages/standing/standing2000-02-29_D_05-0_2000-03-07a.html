Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
Question again proposed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold):</B> Before we adjourned for lunch, I was speaking on clause 7 stand part, and especially on new section 75L(2)(b), which requires that the barrister or solicitor who is to be appointed as a judicial officer should have at least five years' experience. I was drawing a comparison with the magistrates system, in which non-professional magistrates sit in magistrates courts.

<P>
I am advised by the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), that such magistrates would have had at least years' training. Nevertheless, they are lay people, not paid professionals. Someone with perhaps three of four years' professional training, who would require a further five years' experience before he or she could be appointed a judicial officer, would be at a senior stage in his or her profession by then, if he or she were any good.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Jane Kennedy):</B> I want it to be clear that I said that lay magistrates would sit more than one to a Bench, so that people with a mix of experience and training would hear a case, even a custody case.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful for that maiden intervention from the Minister. With her experience, she must be right. Nevertheless, I have known many magistrates in my time, who—even with three years' training, and even if they sit with others—are of variable ability. I would not, of course, wish any of my friends to draw any inferences from these remarks. Some magistrates are excellent; some are not quite so good. I would expect a solicitor or barrister who had passed the relevant professional exams to be of sound ability, especially after five years' experience.

<P>
We are setting up an increasingly judicial system, and we are perhaps setting ourselves too high a hurdle in expecting to employ highly qualified people who are sought-after and expensive. I do not want to dwell on this matter for long. I have put down a marker, and perhaps the Minister and his team will consider the issue in next year's consolidated Bill.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr. Lewis Moonie):</B> We have covered most of the points already on clause stand part. I shall just point out again that lay magistrates not only sit in groups, but have legally qualified clerks working with them to provide the legal advice that a lay person would need. That is also the case for officers appointed to courts martial, although a judge advocate is responsible for ensuring that legal points are properly answered in those cases.

<P>
We could talk all day about the question of time. We could suggest a period of three years, as Lord Renton did in another place; we could propose ten years, although we do not intend to do so. We believe that five years' experience will demonstrate a reasonable level of familiarity with the law. I shall defend that stance against all comers.

<P>
</FONT><B>Custody rules</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Crispin Blunt </B>(Reigate): I beg to move amendment No. 118, in page 30, line 21, after ``rules'', insert—

<P>
who satisfy an appropriate test of independence under the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights.

<P>
Once again, I ride to the Government's rescue with an amendment. I seek to make this flawed and unwelcome Bill slightly less flawed and to give it more defences against future depredations from the European Court of Human Rights.

<P>
The Armed Forces Act 1996 proposed changes to the way in which courts martial were carried out. General officers commanding carry out administrative functions—they serve as the focus of appeal, and are responsible for setting up and for administering the court martial. In the Findlay case—I hope that I have not muddled up that case with the Hood case—the European Court found that the administrative function of general officers commanding was indefensible.

<P>
The amendment would give the Bill greater bomb profability—the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell) may have noticed my earlier use of that word—and defences against future judgments that the European Court may reach on independence.
Mr. Crispin Blunt
<P>
What effect will clause 8 have? It states:

<P>
Rules under this section may in particular make provision with respect to
various conditions, and it refers to a statutory instrument. When the Minister for the Armed Forces appeared before the Select Committee on Defence to give evidence on the clause, we said that we needed to see the statutory instrument before we could agree to the Bill, and we made the same point on Second Reading. The matter is central to the way in which the Bill will work. We have to consider the practical application of the provisions, including the way in which video links will work—that was dealt with in an earlier clause.

<P>
My amendment deals with administrative matters. It is unclear whether the Bill or the regulations that will be made under it can survive a test in front of the European Court of Human Rights. The statutory instrument will be of central importance in that context. The basic issue is one of independence.

<P>
If the amendment is agreed to, new section 75M(2)(i) will refer to

<P>
the appointment of persons to discharge administrative functions under the rules who satisfy an appropriate test of independence under the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights.
That would make it clear that there should be a test. People may appear to be independent when they are not. We need to consider the way in which the European justices interpreted the Findlay case in that context. The Government may experience further problems when they attempt to define that test of independence, but they have to do so.

<P>
The amendment makes it clear that it will be difficult to be independent from the convention. The system is designed to be administered by the armed forces. How will the Government deliver that test of independence? They must have a test of independence to administer functions under custody rules. That system must be managed, and the clause deals with the appointment of people who will administer those functions. When one considers who will administer custody, one discovers the real difficulty that the Government face. The provost-sergeant and the regimental sergeant-major will be in charge of day-to-day custody. They will report to the commanding officer, who is legally responsible for administering custody of accused persons detained in the regimental guardroom, on a naval ship or at a Royal Air Force station.

<P>
When they produce the statutory instrument, I invite the Government to demonstrate how they will meet the challenge of making those people independent. How will they satisfy the test of independence in administering custody? A soldier, sailor or airman could say, ``Well, the chap who administered my custody was not independent at all. He was under the commanding officer, to whom I was responsible in the chain of command, and that was not reasonable.'' Justices of the European Court may take the same view as they took in the Findlay case.

<P>
The amendment would make the Bill even more fireproof against the European convention, but it would also test whether the Government, who will have all manner of problems drafting the statutory instrument required under the clause, can deliver an independent administrator of the rules of custody.

<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell </B>(Tatton): I apologise, Mr. Benton, for my absence this morning. I was attending another Committee.

<P>
I do not agree with every proposal advanced by the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt), bu in this case he is on the right side. I continually study the idea of independence. Indeed, the independent group in the House has recently doubled its strength, and we look forward to a leadership challenge. I see great advantage in any proposal that strengthens the rules and reduces the likelihood that they will become a beanfeast for barrack-room lawyers or any other lawyers. Under the amendment, decisions of courts martial would be less likely to be challenged and, most important, the rights of the accused would be safeguarded, so I have great pleasure in supporting it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Viggers </B>(Gosport): The Bill is driven entirely by the European convention on human rights. It has been made clear that it includes only essential matters; other matters will stand over until consideration in Committee of next year's armed forces Bill. Given that we are debating only the distilled essence, it is important that we get matters right. My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate pointed out that, in the Army, the administrative function in respect of court procedure will normally be carried out by people such as the regimental sergeant-major. However, I note that the Bill elsewhere bans provost-marshalls from participating in courts martial. Perhaps those normally responsible for the administration of Army, Navy or Air Force personnel would not be appropriate in that regard, and it would be necessary to select independent people.

<P>
Given that the Committee's sole purpose is to satisfy the European convention on human rights, it is probably right to get in the pre-emptive cringe proposed by my hon. Friend, so I support his amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> It is a great pleasure to speak to the Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton. Committees are always good-tempered and enjoyable under your chairmanship, and I am sure that this afternoon's proceedings will be no exception.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
The hon. Member for Reigate has tabled an amendment that he suggests would be helpful. I hope that my response will satisfy the concerns that he raised and persuade him that it is unnecessary.

<P>
Prior to 1996, the Government lost the Findlay case at the European Court of Human Rights and the post of court martial administrative officer was subsequently made independent. It involves wide responsibilities, which are far more extensive than those of the custody administrative officer, to which the amendment refers. The functions of the custody administrative officer do not have to be performed by an independent person, as is required by the functions of the court martial administrative officer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Before the Parliamentary Secretary continues, will she clarify exactly what kind of person the Government envisage the custody administrative officer to be?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I was about to come to that point, which I think that the hon. Gentleman will find helpful. It is proposed that the court martial administrative officers will perform the functions of the custody administrative officers, wearing two different hats. In their role as custody administrative officers, the Bill does not need to include a requirement that they satisfy the definition of independence that the hon. Gentleman argues would be necessary to satisfy the European Court of Human Rights. They will play a back-room administrative role, and will not be involved in judicial decisions or the selection of members of a judicial panel. Their role will not even be comparable to that of a justice's clerk. It will be administrative—probably akin to that performed by court service officers in civilian courts. If matters were different, and the role of the custody administrative officers were greater, along the lines of that of the court martial administrative officer, the hon. Member for Reigate would be making a good case, to which we would listen. However, the Bill satisfies the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998, and the amendment is unnecessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Can the Parliamentary Secretary assist me? I left the services six or seven years before the 1996 Act came into force. Can she explain who is usually the court martial administrative officer in the Army, Air Force or Navy, so that we can see how those functions dovetail together?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I am advised that the court martial administrative officer will be retired officer—in other words, a civil servant—based at Upavon. He will be independent and outside the chain of command, with a staff of civil servants who will help him to administer the courts martial. That person will be asked to take on the functions of the custody administrative officer, but the role is different. We do not believe that the custody administrative officer's role requires him to be entirely independent of the structures in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests.

<P>
Therefore, we shall resist the amendment, which we do not believe is necessary. I hope that, given my assurances, the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr Blunt:</B> Before the Parliamentary Secretary sits down, may I press her a little further to see whether I can agree to her request to withdraw the amendment?

<P>
Will the statutory instrument say that the appointment of the custody administrative officer will be that particular appointment in Upavon? If so, will the required officer or civil servant with those responsibilities in Upavon have responsibility for all three services? If not, perhaps he should, as part of the process of bringing together the justice system in advance of a tri-service discipline Act.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The details of the custody administrative officer's role have yet to be fully worked out. It is a matter of regret to the Government that we do not yet have the detail of the statutory instruments. They are being drafted and we hope to have them in the near future. It is not for me to say when the statutory instruments will be ready, as the Lord Chancellor's Department does not lead the work on that aspect of the rules; nor can I give the hon. Gentleman a detailed response about the way in which the three functions would work together.

<P>
In response to the amendment, all I can say is that, although the detail of the role has yet to be finalised, we expect the custody adminsitrative officer to be responsibble for setting up custody hearings before the judicial officer: his role will be limited to that. As I tried to stress earlier, he does not, therefore, have to be independent in order to meet article 5 of the convention on human rights.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Could the Parliamentary Secretary be little more helpful about the timing for the statutory instrument, even if it is in draft? We are being asked to vote for a pig in a poke. We are being asked to vote for a clause that gives the Government power to introduce regulations, but we have no idea what they have in mind regarding those regulations. Are we likely to see a draft copy of the regulations before, for example, Report?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I am sorry to have to advise the Committee that that is not likely. Rules must be in place and understood by all those who will operate the new procedures. At present the timetable for laying instruments under the Bill is May. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary would have liked to be able to show members of the Committee the rules in draft to help them in their deliberations on the Bill, but they are not yet ready for publication. The detail of functions like those that we are debating now will be ready when the statutory instruments are ready for publication.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> This is the first occasion on which the Parliamentary Secretary has replied to an amendment in this Committee and I listened to her carefully. I am not wholly happy about the detail, because we do not have any. Therefore, we do not know what importance we must attach to the custody administrative officer's independence. However, I accept her advice that it will be dealt with by the statutory instrument, crucially relying on the fact that the custody administrative officer will be the same person as the court martial administrative officer, whose independence must be established by virtue of the Findlay judgment. Independence in the custody arrangements will be met because the Findlay judgment requires the person concerned to meet the test of independence to administer the court martial and if it is to be the same person, that test of independence will already have been met.

<P>
I have further concerns, which I want to put on the record. If the office must administer directly all the custody hearings—and there seems to be doubt about how many custody hearings there will be—the administrative burden could be considerable. Extra costs may arise beyond those of the lawyers sitting as Mr. Bluntjudical officers in custody cases and the layers who will be part of the statutory appeals process. A considerable increase in the number of civil servants may be necessary to take on the duty of organising custody hearings. That work was previously carried out by the regimental chief clerk with the regiment's orderly room where all the administration was done in a straightforward way with no additional expense. More civil servants will be necessary to organise matters and to ensure that the judicial officer is in the right place at the right time and that he is paid the right amount of money on thousands of occasions during a year. I fear that the Ministry of Defence did not take that calculation into account when introducing the Bill.

<P>
I hope that I shall not disappoint the hon. Member for Tatton if I withdraw my amendment, but it is open to him to oppose leave to withdraw it. If he comes gallantly to the charge, I shall support him. I have one slight concern: I thought that he said that the number of independent Members had just doubled. I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) is part of the group of independents—

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> And the hon. Member for West Renfrewshire (Mr. Graham).

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Indeed. The butchery of real Labour being expelled from the Labour party continues daily and the group of independents is increasing. The hon. Member for Tatton will soon be the leader of a substantial group. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I suspect that this will be one of the most interesting debates on the Bill. I shall concentrate on new section 75N(2)(h) to the 1955 Acts which covers live television links and similar arrangements. I want to preface that, perhaps with weary cynicism, with a comment on new section 75M(3) which states:

<P>
Rules under this section shall be made by statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.
That is known as the negative resolution procedure and it is what all Governments desire and all Oppositions loathe. For those who are not used to the procedures of the House, the provision may look good and dandy, but we know that around 50 statutory instruments go through the House every week and that Oppositions sometimes pray against them—that they be annulled. Even if they do so, it is not automatic that the statutory instruments come upstairs to a Standing Committee because that depends on negotations through the usual channels and we all know what that means. If a big enough fuss is made in smoke-filled rooms and there is a trade-off here or a deal is done there, it may slip Upstairs. Even if it goes Upstairs and is debated, the vote is not for or against the annulment—it is simply that the Committee has considered the statutory instrument. Clearly, if we have spent an hour and a half talking about it, we have considered it. The remotest possibility exists that an almighty fuss will be made, and it will be agreed, through the usual channels, that it should be debated on the Floor of the House. Even if that were to happen, it would only be a question of whether the House had considered it. Again, if the House has debated it, it has clearly been considered. No mechanism exists whereby Parliament can change the rules. Those are the rules, and that is that. It is precisely because we cannot change those rules that we must be as sure as possible that those rules will work. That is the spirit of my remarks.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
We are certainly not being Luddite. As politicians, we all use video links. We use them from Westminster to our local television stations. We see reporting to commercial standards from all over the world. Every time there is a good sports match or a terrible crisis, such as that in Mozambique, high-quality video links are available within hours. That is beyond question. Such highly professional systems are extremely expensive to purchase and operate. However, such systems can break up or break down, depending on how you look at it.

<P>
I am well aware that video teleconferencing facilities are available throughout the services. I have seen them at land command in Wilton, and at Permanent Joint Headquarters in Northwood. There is no argument about whether the technology exists; we know that it does. It remains important to consider the down side, because we are considering not merely technology but justice. That is a serious matter. We must not let down any of Her Majesty's forces in terms of the basic justice that they receive. We are considering human rights, so we must make sure that we do not cover up the human rights element in the guise of an argument about technology.

<P>
We are concerned about practicalities. It is interesting that the clause was amended in Committee in the other place to broaden the use of the technology to all custody hearings, and not just those brought before a judicial officer. The amendments made in the other place also aim to clarify the fact that live television links and visual transmissions could be undertaken by other media such as the internet. That is another possibility, which we touched on earlier. I do not know whether the Minister is considering providing internet facilities. If the Bill was amended in the other place so that he could, it is presumably in the back of his mind anyway. That is an interesting new element.

<P>
On the practicalities of using video equipment, the Minister for Defence Procurement, Baroness Symons, said in the other place:

<P>
I hope to offer the Committee some reassurance on that point. I shall refer to the Army in particular, since it is likely to have the greatest number of personnel in remote locations. The Army would seek to use video link technology where operational or training circumstances mean that a face-to-face hearing is not possible within the required time-frame.

<P>It is important to remember that time moves on. The services are fully capable of exploiting successive advances in technology, which they already deploy with great success. Video technology is in day-to-day use. It was in constant use throughout the recent crisis in Kosovo. The armed services see no reason why that technology should not be deployed equally successfully in other operational environments and for purposes such as those envisaged in the Bill.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 December 1999; Vol. 608, c. 351.]
I was slightly surprised that the forces were using video link equipment in Kosovo. Why were they using it? Was its use equivalent to that envisaged in the Bill? That is an important point. I accept that it is available for military purposes, but was it for interrogation or for making statements, perhaps either way?

<P>
On Second Reading the Minister gave a slightly less robust version of events. He said:

<P>
On video links  we are currently trialling video equipment to ensure that the quality of the equipment is suitable for the purpose for which it will be used. The equipment currently used operates at 28 kilobytes. The equipment is capable of showing a wide-angle picture of an entire room or of zooming in on an accused in fine detail, just as it is used in court hearings, especially those involving children. Although we can use Inmarsat—the international maritime satellite—commercial links, there is no question that commercial television satellites would be used, because we have access to other means of communication.
He also said:

<P>
I do not intend to get into a nerds' debate with the hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant), because we can do that in the comfort and quiet of somewhere where other people do not have to listen to us.—[Offical Report, 17 February 2000; Vol. 344, c. 1200–01.]
The Committee is clearly such a place. I hope that the Minister will consider those concerns.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I want to point out that there was a misprint in Hansard. It should have been 128 kilobytes, not 28.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I thought that it was a bid odd. That correction is helpful.

<P>
It was interesting to note the difference between the two ministerial statements. Baroness Symons gave the impression that the system was already up and running, while the Minister said that we are still at the trialling stage, with all the teething troubles that that entails. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us what the problems were.

<P>
The Defence Committee was also intrigued to be told about video conferencing. The director of personnel services for the Army explained to the Committee that video conferencing took place already. Apparently there are daily video conferences to Pristina. He had himself spoken to a judge advocate on a video conference facility as part of a trial. I read that evidence with some care several times, because it did not say whether the facility was in the next room or in Pristina, Belize, on board an aircraft carrier or wherever. It would be interesting to know where the trial took place.

<P>
The director of personnel services said that the judge advocate will have a portable system at home with him so that he can be dialled up at almost any time. There will also be static video conferencing suites and portable systems that can be taken home. There will be a duty judicial officer, who can be wired up to pretty well anywhere in the world because, as he said,

<P>
IT-wise now, wherever our soldiers go, we have the IT systems.
I immediately thought of Bowman and wondered whether that was really the case. Therefore, there is a great deal of confidence about the use of video conferencing and we are concerned that it should not be over-confidence. We remain unconvinced that the potential for video conferencing measures up to the judicial task in hand.

<P>
The Minister may feel that we are being unfair, but we need to be better than 100 per cent. sure that the new systems will work. I should be grateful, therefore, if he would go into more detail about the way in which the systems will work and how secure and clear they will be. Ministers have clearly placed much faith in modern communications to circumvent the logistical difficulties of bringing the accused before a judicial officer.

<P>
With regard to the reliability of the links, one has only to think of the recent concern expresed by the Army about the reliability and security of its battlefield communications in Kosovo to understand that the Government may be a little complacent. It has been well documented that the Serbs could have listened to our radio communications.

<P>
In the modern television war, where visual propaganda can prove an immensely effective weapon, as has been so ably demonstrated by the Iraqis and then the Serbs, one dreads to think what would happen if a disciplinary visual feed were to be intercepted. My hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant), who is an expert in communications technology, said on this issue on Second Reading:

<P>
When a broad band link is used, it is not easy to encrypt it in such a way that it cannot be decoded by others. We know that in Kosovo  the signals were intercepted.—[Offical Report, 17 February 2000; Vol. 344, c. 1191.]

<P>
The use of video link technology also raises other questions about the military disciplinary process. In its report on the Bill the Defence Committee noted that it had been told:

<P>
The technology was sophisticated and would allow the judicial officer to see the accused's face and demeanour as well as to hear his words. Regulations would be put in place to ensure that the accused's superiors, who might in the room but off camera, did not apply undue pressure on the accused to say the right things while he was on camera.
It appears that we shall need not only an extra raft of judicial officers, but skilful, trained individuals telling people where to stand, making sure that the lighting is correct, and so on. This must not be just a matter of amateur photography, if we are to make it into a proper judicial process.

<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Am I right in thinking that prosecution and defence representatives might take part in such a video conferencing inquiry, assuming that it was at a preliminary stage at that point? If so, where will they be? Will they be on separate video links, or alongside the judicial officer or the defendant?

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The Minister must answer that question. I raised that point earlier, when I said that if this process Mr. Keyhad been undertaken in the United Kingdom, the accused would have had his solicitor beside him. Presumably, it is impossible to have a solicitor beside the accused in theatre. That will not happen. My hon. Friend's point is pertinent to that argument, and we need an answer to his question. A double system, with separate links for the solicitors or counsel, would entail tremendous additional costs. We must, therefore, consider all the additional people who would be involved in that system.

<P>
The Defence Committee followed up its observations with a recommendation. It said:

<P>
We remain concerned that the legislation should cover all eventualities, and look forward to the government clarifying this issue during the Committee stage of the Bill.
That is a further reason why it is worth spending time today examining the matter in detail. The Defence Committee expects it, and this is the appropriate time and place—as the Minister implied—to do it. Much clarification is needed. The Government decided that it was in the interest of justice and compliant with human rights legislation that video links should be used to enable hearings with judicial officers. We challenge that on a number of counts.

<P>
The Bill does not say exactly how the new system will work. Clause 8(2) proposes that the Secretary of State will make the rules. However, he will have to do more than that. He must start by addressing the technical challenges involved. In answer to a recent parliamentary question, the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department confirmed that:

<P>
Videolink technology is used occasionally in the Crown Court to enable witnesses to give evidence from abroad. The installation is arranged locally by the party whose witness is giving evidence in this way. No information is held centrally on the suppliers used or the arrangements put in place to prevent interception. A pilot is currently in place to provide a videolink between Strangeways Prison and the Crown Court in Manchester.—[Official Report, House of Commons, 1 February 2000; Vol. 343, c. 546W.]

<P>
Despite what the Ministry of Defence says, there is not much evidence of a tried and tested system operating over long, even intercontinental, distances. Even the Lord Chancellor's Department has no links with any commercial companies in this field. However, there are people who work with the military on satellite links.

<P>
The company that manages the satellite transmission for the British forces broadcasting system handles many permanent educational feeds from all over the world. They include live sports feeds from Zimbabwe, which are received and sent on to both London and New York, and similar feeds from Hong Kong which are re-transmitted to latin America. On behalf of other clients, they have received news feeds from all the areas in which British forces operate. That company produces broadcast quality results based on a transmitted data rate of eight megabits a second.

<P>
If Her Majesty's forces were to rely on Inmarsat, which has not been ruled out, the maximum data rate would be a mere 128 kilobytes a second. That could support low-quality video conferencing, which is bi-directional. To achieve broadcast quality links, a second path would have to be booked if bi-directional pictures were required. The lower power gives a poor and jerky image quality with feeds costing several pounds a minute. If one wants broadcast quality live pictures to capture faithfully the sort of visual nuances that we have mentioned, the existing technology requires that a portable satellite news-gathering terminal—an SNG—be set to the source of the feed, which could be a military unit somewhere in the world. SNG units cost about £350,000, can be operational within a few hours of arriving on site, and are used by news broadcasters worldwide. Normally, an engineer can travel with the unit and build it with unskilled assistance. The cost of renting an SNG terminal is approximately £1,500 a day, including one engineer. A second engineer costs £250 a day, excluding travel and accommodation expenses. The cost of the space segment of the link depends on the region. It varies from £350 to £400 an hour for Europe and the middle east, to £500 or £600 an hour in remote regions such as East Timor.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
How do those quotes compare with the cost of trials established by the Ministry of Defence? The defence budget must ultimately bear those costs, which, on initial examination, appear very burdensome. How much equipment will be needed to set up existing video links? Does it need to be transported in a couple of suitcases, a car, a lorry or a fleet of lorries? If the load is substantial, we should think carefully about the priority that should be given to the carriage of such equipment in an operational scenario, where demands on supply vehicles will be high.

<P>
The second concern goes deeper. As I have said, we are talking about justice. In parallel circumstances in civilian conditions in the UK, a solicitor would be sitting in court with his client. If proper advice is to be given, such proximity is essential. That could not be achieved through a remote interview by video link with a unit in theatre. Moreover, many judges and lawyers would argue that the interests of justice could not be served by a poor quality, jerky video link. It could not give a judicial officer who is thousands of miles away a proper feeling for the circumstances and demeanour of the accused.

<P>
I was grateful to the Minister for the Armed Forces for his answers to my parliamentary questions. I asked:

<P>
(1) what use experience of video conferencing exists in (a) the Army and (b) the RAF; and what were the locations linked and the bandwidth used.
I also asked a similar question in respect of Royal Navy ships. The Minister replied:

<P>
Video TeleConferencing (VTC) is used both operationally and for normal business across Defence.
I accept that. He proceeded to list a number of Her Majesty's ships that are fitted to receive Video TeleConferencing, but the terminal equipment is not carried routinely unless the ship is fulfilling a flagship role. He continued.

<P>
The Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) is the main sponsor of deployed, operational VTC. VTC was first deployed on operations in 1997 in the form of a capability trial. The trial was successful and VTC is now routinely deployed on operations to provide the Chief of Joint Operations with one of his primary command tools.
I have seen VTC in Northwood, and I am not arguing about its existence. He continued:

<P>
In addition, HQ Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps, for which UK is framework nation, is in the process of being equipped with VTC.
That is good news, but can the Under-Secretary give us any more? Time is marching on. When will it be fully equipped?

<P>
The Minister continued:

<P>
Secure high quality VTC links also exist between the PJHQ and the Defence Crisis Management Centre that are used to conduct crisis planning and to provide operational updates to Defence chiefs.
That is good, but what follows is extraordinary. The Minister said:

<P>
It forms part of the overall information exchange requirements package for a deployed formation which takes account of the operational requirement, whether or not the end user is in a mobile or static environment, and the available capacity in the overall communications planning scenario.
There are so many conditions in that one sentence—almost every statement is qualified—that it does not sound terribly confident. I do not want the Ministry of Defence to find that it has oversold the technology.

<P>
The Minister for the Armed Forces told me:

<P>
Within the Royal Air Force, VTC systems exist in the main Headquarters of Strike Command and Personnel and Training Command among other locations.
His answer goes onto say that there are many examples within the Army,

<P>
including communication between the main locations of the Adjutant General's staff in Upavon, Glasgow and London and also within Headquarters Land
and at a number of unspecified garrisons. It states:

<P>
Initiatives are currently being studied to extend this connectivity to provide VTC facilities.
I am not sure whether that means, ``Yes, we have got there. This works to a degree which will satisfy the judicial process involved''.

<P>
The answer continues:

<P>
One specific application under investigation is the use of VTC in support of Custody Hearings and Summary Appeal Courts under the control of the Courts Martial Administrative Office (CMAO) to support the processes set out in the Armed Forces Discipline Bill.
That is good news, but will the system be reliable by October, when it is due to be introduced? Much training remains to be done, although we were told earlier that it is in hand, which is welcome.

<P>
We do not even have a trial report yet. I was told that the trial report on the scheme in support of custody hearings

<P>
is expected to conclude that the aims of the study were achieved although some processes and procedures would need to be refined.
Even if the aims of the study have been achieved, it is recognised that refinements will still be necessary. The answer states that

<P>
The report will recommend that a detailed Statement of Requirement be prepared for a VTC system to be procured and installed later this year.—[Offical Report, House of Commons,{**JU**}
1 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 268W.]
We all know what happens to procurement processes. Under this deadline, the Government are committed to introducing the system in October. However, that is only a few months away and they are still talking in terms of a recommendation from a trial report. I remain concerned about that. We are not trying to be destructive—far from it—but require an assurance that the Ministry of Defence is on top of the matter, and has sufficient resources, time and expertise to ensure that the system works.

<P>
It would have been a good idea for there to have been some pre-legislative scrutiny, given that the Defence committee on the Bill used that process. I challenge the Under-Secretary to convince us about the video links, and thereby prove his own point. Bearing in mind the Ministry of Defence's claim that this is a matter of routine technology, would he, between now and Thursday, arrange the setting up of a video link between the Committee Room and Pristina in Kosovo, so that members of the Committee can see the technology in action? We have been told that the system is so easy to use, small and portable that the judicial officer on duty will be able to take it home at night. Let us therefore see it in this Room, or somewhere else in the House, or, if necessary, down the road at the Ministry of Defence, which is a mere five minutes walk away. If the Under-Secretary's claims are correct, that should be technically feasible. We ask to be connected for only a few minutes, to see how the system works and assess the quality of the pictures and sound. That is not a foolish suggestion, but a very serious one, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider it. If the system works, it will be of great benefit to the armed forces, but if it does not, it will hole the Bill under its water line.

<P>

<B>Mr. Martin Bell:</B> Over the years, I have had some experience of this line of work. I have worked with the best equipment, the best camera crews and the best commercial satellites but, as often as not, I ended up looking shifty.

<P>
Appearances matter, and not only in television. They will certainly matter in relation to this pioneering video conferencing proposal. The accused soldier—the person who is under charge at the far end of the link—will feel very lonely. In my experience, he will be just about the loneliest soul on the entire political planet. I had a call this morning from a solider who has only very recently escaped from under the shadow of suspicion, 872 days after he was first arrested. I believe that the Minister is aware of that case.
Mr. Martin Bell
<P>
Although we must strengthen the rights of the accused, I am not sure that the clause is the right way to do it. It will increase the pressures on the soldier, sailor or airman—or airwoman—who has been arrested. He or she will have an increased sense of isolation and feel abandoned by the system. The duty of care may have gone.

<P>
Will the Government's approach be considered in relation to the extreme and exceptional cases that are at the sharp end, or will its use become routine? If the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) presses the matter to a Division, I shall vote entirely on the merits of the case and in response to the assurances that we are given.

<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I am a great admirer of video-link technology, which is, to use a military expression, a force multiplier. Computer-aided design, for example, enables individuals in different parts of the world to work simultaneously on a design. They can examine separate aspects of the design, including its front, back or sides, and they can turn it upside down and in every other direction. Computer-link technology can be immensely valuable and it can be used in many ways.

<P>
I do not have the experience of the hon. Member for Tatton—dare I call him my hon. Friend?—but the camera can lie. Everyone puts on a few pounds in weight in front of the camer. People whom one knows to be fair and of great integrity appear to be shifty, and people whom one knows to be shifty appear to be fair. One may know about that from one's immediate experience. The camera can mislead and the technicians behind the camera can create different impressions, although I do not suggest that they are anything other than impartial. Much depends on the lighting and the angle of a shot.

<P>
I remember—this is not entirely irrelevant—that when the House of Commons television trial first began, the technical people told us that only the hon. Member who was speaking would be televised, but they deviated from that approach almost immediately. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury will recall that during the passage of the Armed Forces Act 1996, the Select Committee on Defence was followed by a television crew who gave assurances with absolute integrity, although not all of them were followed.

<P>
Video-link technology has its advantages, but I am not sure that it would be advantageous in this context. The European convention on human rights forced the Government to deviate from the system of immediate personally administered justice, which Conservative Members feel has great merit. Bearing in mind the number of cases that have been involved, the present system has had few faults over the years. It involves the trust of the commanding officer and of the other officers who are responsible for troops. We are being forced to focus on the so-called independence of the judicial officer, who must know the accused and who must be completely impartial. The judicial officer may not be present, and information technology may be needed. In that situation, we would lose the personal touch. Theoretically, the system involves independence, but it is administered through an infotech sieve, which might be distorting. Where will the lawyers who maintain the case against the accused, and those who defend him, be?

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
The story that I am about to relate is one that I have told before, and, although it may sound extraordinary, it is a true personal experience. When the video link was set up between London and Northern Ireland, I quickly discovered that if I was sitting alongside the person I was trying to impress with a point, I would not impress him as much as the individual at the other end of the video link, to whom the Secretary of State and other Ministers were looking. Therefore, if one wanted to make a point in two or three hours' time, even if one were in the next office, one would fly to the other end of the link so that one was looking straight at the people one was seeking to impress. I know from personal expereince that that works. If the accused is at the far end of a video link, and the defence lawyer is sitting beside the judicial officer and trying to influence him, I suspect that the judicial officer will be looking at the accused down the video link, and not looking sideways. Who will the accused be looking at? Will he have a chance to look at his defending lawyer? I find it all very confusing.

<P>
Perhaps it might have been better, given the unusual circumstances and uncertainty, if we had invited the Minister to give a detailed presentation first. If he is able to take up the invitation of my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury, and allow us to experience this for ourselves, I would feel much more reassured. It worries me, as I said before, that the Committee will not have the opportunity available to the Defence Committee to go to the locations where the operation will take place, discuss the issue in detail and personally experience the video link. I am concerned that a system that has been local and based on personal knowledge of the circumstances of the individual will be replaced by a system that is remote, technically uncertain, and prospectively unfair. I am willing to be reassured by the Minister, especially if he can demonstrate the technical links, as my hon. Friend asked him. However, I remain deeply concerned about the issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Our consideration of this clause is profoundly unsatisfactory. The clause is largely implemented by regulations, but the Government have not provided us with a clue about their thinking on them. We know that from Mr. Betteley's evidence on page 8 of the Defence Committee report. At paragraph 57, he said:

<P>
We are going through the particular parts of the regulations at the moment. That is being considered in draft as we speak.
In reply to the Chairman, he said:

<P>
I do not think they will be in any form ready for the committee stage of the Bill. There is a need for them to be done as soon as possible but we are not at that stage yet.
It is extraordinary that the Government have scheduled the Bill at a time when they have not given us a clue about what is in the regulations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I will give way to my hon. Friend and to the Minister in a moment.

<P>
The video links would cover hugely important areas, but the Government have not given us an indication of their thinking. Perhaps the Minister will provide some illumination?

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The hon. Gentleman will be disappointed again. I merely wanted to ask him how many times he voted for such provisions during the previous Parliament.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> During the previous Parliament, parts of legislation were built in by statutory instrument. I served on numerous Finance Bills, and, by and large, the regulations, even in draft form, were ready for the Committee. I have served in this House for eight years, and it is a courtesy to the Committee that, wherever possible, draft regulations should be laid before the Committee, so that it may consider whether it wants to vote for the clause and the Bill. We are being asked to vote for a pig in a poke. We have no idea what is in the Government's mind. When the Parliamentary Secretary replies to the debate, perhaps she will be able to give us some illumination. I hope that she will, because whether proper justice is being applied to the people who are charged is a serious matter that goes to the heart of the Bill. We cannot say whether it is, because we do not know what the regulations are.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I would not want my hon. Friend to mislead the Committee, even on a minor matter. It was in response to me rather than to the Chairman of the Committee that these questions were being put to Mr. Betteley, which I hope reflected Conservative Members' interrogation of Ministers and officials on the detail of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I apologise to my hon. Friend. He is absolutely right. I was looking at the preceding section and imposing that on the section where he was asking questions. Nevertheless, the import of what I said is as strong as it would have been had the Chairman been asking the questions.

<P>
What will the regulations bring to the proceedings that we are discussing under the clause? The way in which the proceedings will be carried out will be covered by secondary legislation. New section 75M(2) sets out some of the things that will be covered by regulations:

<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) arrangements preliminary to the proceedings;

<P>
(b) the representation of the person to whom the proceedings relate;

<P>
(c) the admissibility of evidence;

<P>
(d) procuring the attendance of witnesses;

<P>
(e) the immunities and privileges of witnesses;

<P>
(f) the administration of oaths
and so on.

</font></ul>
<P>
Unless the Government get this right, any clever barrister will be able to drive a coach and horses through the proceedings, because he will be able to say ``We could not see on the video, as it was set up, what was happening in the rest of the room''; or he will say that the proper procedure was not followed. The Parliamentary Secretary is a lawyer; I am not, but if the demeanour and reactions of the accused and witnesses cannot be seen together—I do not see how that can be done by a video camera—how can the judicial officer make a proper decision?

<P>
That is presumably precisely what is going on in the present trials, but, even in domestic cases, this central plank of the Bill is only at the trial stage. If in domestic cases it is only at the trial stage, how is the whole Bill supposed to work? It is unsatisfactory. I hope that the Government will not bring the Bill back on Report until we have had a chance to see the draft regulations. It would be a tragedy if, because we had not considered and amended the Bill properly, its purpose of complying with the ECHR judgments was negated because judicial procedures of this kind could not be carried out in remote locations.

<P>
Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree that, instead of relying on remote video links as the norm, they should be used in only exceptional circumstances? For a number of reasons that I and my hon. Friends have proposed, there may be omissions in the procedures, so it would seem sensible not to rely on this technology, however fast and good its is. It would be better to rely on the tried and tested procedure of cross-examination in the same room in front of all the judicial officers.

<P>
I look forward with interest—but not with great hope—to hearing what the Parliamentary Secretary will say. I do not think that she will be able to tell me what is in the parliamentary draftsment's minds with regard to secondary legislation. If she cannot, I renew my plea that the Government should not schedule the Report stage until she can give us that information.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> In addressing my remarks to the clause, I want to focus, as other hon. Members have, on video links. I want to break my consideration of this issue into what might be described as the routine use of electronic links and their use in operations covering the gamut from relatively peaceful missions through to full-scale war.

<P>
First, I want to deal with routine use. I differ slightly from my hon. Friends because I see that, if the use of video links can be made to work properly, it is a way of saving a considerable proportion of the overhead that the Bill imposes on the armed forces. If a large number of video conferencing centres can be set up and it is easy to get the accused to, say, each district or divisional headquarters in the United Kingdom, or brigade headquarters if the technology in the UK is easy to use, or to each of the major RAF stations or naval bases scattered around the country, one could then build up a relationship with those appointed as judicial officers. They could be given the burden of work that would mean that they were constantly going through their duties judging the thousands of custody proceedings that I believe will be a burden to the Ministry of Defence. Most of them are quite regular occurrences, with people being kept in close arrest in their unit Mr. Bluntguardrooms, be they on RAF bases, in barracks or at naval stations. If this system worked, people who were almost nothing but judicial officers exercising custody proceedings could go from one centre to another. A few people would be organised by the civil servants at Upavon, who will administer the scheme. They will then be able to set up the links all round the country, so that instead of people—

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> There is some import in what my hon. Friend says, particularly in relation to fairly minor cases, but will he accept that in more serious offences it would be far better if the norm were for those people to be brought back, wherever practical, to one central military court where all the facilities existed and the proper procedures could be followed without the use of this technology, which might fail on occasions?

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I understand where my hon. Friend is coming from, but I do not agree with him, because I believe that in the armed forces justice should be administered reasonably close to where the unit is stationed and where the offence has taken place. For example, summary justice is justice administered by the commanding officer. Justice must be seen to be done within the units, so that people can see the commanding officer's writ runs within the unit that he commands. The later provisions of the Bill will undermine that, but that is what we are trying to protect.

<P>
Equally, just as one of the tenets is that justice must be seen to be done, I believe that district and general courts martial should take place relatively close to the unit involved. For example, someone who is stationed in Tidworth, as I was would go to the court martial centre at Bulford, which is where courts martial took place. Equally, because most people are stationed in garrison towns, each of those towns will have court martial facilities. That is where the justice should be administered, so that it does not become a remote issue once people are shipped off into the justice system, which would be a severe problem. I believe that custody should be administered by the units and that, as far as possible, people should be remanded by their units on their air stations, naval stations or ships in the period leading up to the trial.

<P>
As has been said, there is an argument to centralise custody and say that everyone who is remanded in custody should be shipped off to Colchester, where the whole thing would be administered. That would not be right, because people would be sent to the military corrective training centre in Colchester and, effectively, begin their punishment before the trial had started. Accused people should remain in their units with the military support system around them. They should remain within the military family because they are innocent until proven guilty. The support network is important to the maintenance of morale in the armed services and, if it can be avoided, it should not be removed, even if people have been remanded in custody. That would happen if accused people were shipped to Colchester and treated in the same way as remand prisoners in the civilian sector. The circumstances are different and accused people should remain with their parent unit.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
There is an opportunity to use video conferencing in routine cases in a way that will make the administration of the system more efficient once the capital costs of the video equipment have been met.

<P>
In the time available, the Government will have difficulty in drafting rules and regulations covering the use of video conferencing that will stand up to legal challenge. That is why the system cannot be brought forward.

<P>
The Bill, with clause 8, was introduced in the other place in November. It is now March, five months later, and still the Ministry of Defence has been unable to introduce even a draft statutory instrument. There are now less than seven months before the Bill comes into effect on 2 October. To make it work is a real challenge, but it presents an opportunity to save some of the overheads. A complicated cross-benefit analysis would be necessary on the capital cost of the equipment and the time taken for links to be set up. However, for routine cases in which video links might be used, landlines will be available. Expensive satellite link technology to remote locations will not be necessary if prisoners are in the United Kingdom, having been taken off their ships or away from their units, or for run-of-the-mill offences that have taken place during normal peacetime activity.

<P>
I agree with my hon. Friends who referred to difficult issues such as legal representation of the accused, particularly at custody hearings. The rules could be set up for one lawyer—the judicial officer—sitting in judgment on a custody hearing, but what about the defendant's lawyer? Will he be able to work within the video conferencing link? The purpose of video conferencing is to deal with the problem of people who are stationed at remote locations. We are tyring, rightly, to keep people in those locations and, if the costs are to be reduced, the legal representation of the accused must also be remote so that we can reduce the burden on the armed forces who will have to pick up the tab for the operation of the system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend believe that, if the accused, the witnesses, the prosecution and the defence are to be seen on a video link, it may be necessary to have two video cameras operating simultaneously? If so, does he have the technical knowledge to know whether the band is wide enough to take two cameras at once?

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> No, I am afraid that I do not. I know that there is some dispute about the band that is required and whether the technology exists to make the system work. It could probably be made to work in the United Kingdom or Europe, where people are normally stationed in peacetime, because landlines could be used. I presume that greater band width is available through cable than from using satellites, so I presume that the technology is available to make the sytem work in those circumstances.

<P>
I want to consider the use of technology on operations. We are trying to draft a Bill that will work for normal peacetime operations and deployment, as well as for operations. We are not setting up two systems; it must be robust for two situations. The first overlap is within the Royal Navy, on deployed operations. A different approach was taken earlier in the Bill in relation to the rules about custody before charge and the role of judicial officers. Will the technology work in normal naval circumstances? When we considered new section 47B, under clause 1, the arrangements for custody before charge included an interesting exemption for the Navy, which clearly has a special problem in terms of obtaining judicial officer access to someone who has been arrested at sea. In relation to reports of detention, subsection (2) of the new section states:

<P>
Until such a report is made
to the commanding officer

<P>
the person may be kept in naval custody without being charged, but only if the person who made the arrest has reasonable grounds for believing that keeping him in naval custody without charge is necessary 
That will be a ``Don't tell the captain'' clause. If the arrest is not reported to the captain of the ship, there will be no responsibility to provide access to a judicial officer within 96 hours, as the Bill stipulates, if the individual has not been charged. That puts an amusing slant on the consequences of the Bill.

<P>
Ships in routine operations will have to use video links in order to meet the 96-hour requirement to put someone before a judicial officer, if he is not charged. If a ship is on a covert mission, and does not want to give away its position by broadcasting electronic signals and communications, the use of a video link would not be possible. If the arrest has been reported to the commanding officer, or the person has not been charged, there will be a duty on the commanding officer to establish a link in order to meet the legislative requirement. Videoconferencing cannot overcome that loophole, because of the difficulty of trying to make the technology work during operations.

<P>
I want to discuss the difficulty and the duties imposed by this part of the Bill. It may have seemed a good idea at the time, especially in circumstances in which people are deployed on operations around the world. I imagine that the draftsmen considered those circumstances when they drafted this provision, in order to meet the expense and logistical problems of enabling a judicial officer to sit in judgment on custody hearings.

<P>
No one wants to arrest someone, and detain him, while on operations. That is absolutely clear. An arrested person has to be guarded and taken out of the line of battle, so he is of no use. It is never done lightly. If it has to be done, however, one does not want a further burden to be imposed. The only way to meet the requirements of the Bill might be to contact a judicial officer by an electronic link, because the Bill takes away the powers of a commanding officer to remand a person in custody after 96 hours. There could be operational difficulties involved in taking someone out of theatre because the lines of communication had been affected by enemy action, or because one might be surrounded or isolated in circumstances such as those in which our forces found themselves in the Gorazde pocket in Bosnia, to take a recent example.

<P>
If one had such technology, one would not want to spend the limited time available using electronic communications to administer a custody hearing under the rules that will be contained in the statutory instrument, if it can be satisfactorily drafted. One would not want to take up all that time administering the justice system by getting a judicial officer into a position to make a video link.

<P>
One can imagine a situation in which one was trying to take the minimum time to communicate with one's headquarters, and in which the provost-marshal would pop up, saying ``I'm sorry, I have to have a video link now. I know that you are busy, but I have to communicate with a judicial officer in order to conduct these custody proceedings.'' Never mind the fact that that bandwidth might be needed, not necessarily for videos but for other communications about re-supply, for orders coming through or for the mass of communications involved in the operational side. One would find these links being used for the G1 side rather than the G3 side. The armed forces should not have to face such decisions. A priority would be imposed on the use of these links for administrative matters, because the powers of the commanding officer had been taken away. That would be a problem.

<P>
I shall briefly address the question of when a live link is not a live link. There was some discussion on Second Reading about the time that it takes for satellite links to work. Clause 8(2)(h) refers to

<P>
the use for the purposes of the proceedings of live television links or similar arrangements.
The issue here is the word ``live''. If it takes three or four seconds to bounce a signal round all sorts of satellites in order to maintain contact between one station and another, would that constitute a live link? That could be a legal question. At what point does the link cease to be immediate, if one has to wait for the communication to take place because one is using satellites? After how many seconds' delay does it cease to be a live link for the purposes of the Bill? That question must be addressed.

<P>
I shall now do what I should have done at the beginning of this morning's sitting. I have not declared my interest in the Bill under your Chairmanship, Mr. Benton. During an earlier sitting, which was chaired by Mr. Malins, I declared that I shall be subject to the provisions of the Bill, under section 131 of the Army Act. I must now declare that interest again to you, to ensure that it is on the record.

<P>
I hope that my comments will influence the statutory instrument when it is introduced, and that the Government will take notice of them. I also hope that I have made clear my grave reservations about whether the clause can be made to work.

<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I shall deal first with the points made by the hon. Members for Salisbury and for Cotswold. They made much of those issues, although the hon. Member for Salisbury had the good grave to acknowledge that those who are in opposition often rail against the use of the negative resolution procedure. That happened in Standing Committees on which I served when I was in opposition. Governments use the Jane Kennedyprocedure, although the previous Government's use of it was markedly increased.

<P>
Amended section 103 of the Army Act 1955, which outlines the way in which courts martial should be conducted, was not drafted until after Royal Assent had been granted. Very few of the previous Government's actions are worth copying, and we do not intend to make changes that late in a Bill's passage through the House, if we can avoid doing so. I apologised earlier and said that we intend to bring our proposals before the House as soon as possible. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary wants to do so. We intend no discourtesy to the Committee.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Did the Minister say that she intended to bring forward the proposals before Royal Assent?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I did not say that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The Minister said that she hoped that that would be done. Does not the Committee have a more pressing duty in that regard? We shall later discuss amendments that would introduce necessity in this context. That is central to the way in which the Bill will work. We will not need to move those amendments if the Minister says that we shall see the statutory instrument before the Bill receives Royal Assent.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> As I said, we hope that the rules will be ready for publication in May. Obviously, I cannot guarantee that that will happen, but it is our intention—we do not want to mislead or to obfuscate the issue.

<P>
We have taken note of the report on the Bill by the Select Committee on Deregulation, and we are grateful for the fact that, as usual, it carefully considered the Bill's rule-making powers. That report accepts the use of the negative resolution procedure in this case. It also commented on defence counsel regulations and on the possibility of certain fees becoming subject to parliamentary control. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland) who is a technology buff—I struggle to set the time controls on my video recorder at home.

<P>
Will the use of video technology deliver justice to the armed forces and to the individual whose case is being handled? It may reassure Opposition Members who are concerned about the delivery of justice if I spend a couple of minutes describing the results of the pilot in which we trialled the use of television conferencing in the civilian courts. Between November 1998 and March 1999, a series of pilots linked Manchester, Bristol and Swindon magistrates courts to their respective prisons. Those links continued beyond the pilot period and have run for almost a year. Everyone involved has benefited greatly, and it has been agreed in principle that the arrangements should be extended to other magistrates courts and prisons, with a view to linking all remand prisons to the majority of magistrates courts during the next few years. Committee members might want to consult the report on those pilots by Joyce Plotnikoff and Richard Woolfson, which has been published. They found that although some parties felt some self-consciousness at first, it did not take them long to get used to the presence of the cameras and monitors. The accused did not feel isolated from what was happening in the courtroom. Lack of body language, which was discussed on Second Reading, was not felt to be a problem for the accused or the court. Reports have been received that the absence of body language helped the court and the accused by aiding concentration on the facts. There were few technical difficulties and no court business was lost through technical failure.

<P>
In respect of magistrates courts, the link enables the Prison Service to make savings. The defendant's movements are restricted to the prison, so far less processing and searching is required than for a court appearance. Significant savings can be made, and the cost to magistrates courts of introducing the technology is neutral. Reference was made to the pilot scheme, which linked Strangeways prison with Manchester Crown court. It is being evlauated and the report should be available in April, but it has proved successful. The scheme benefits the accused, who do not need to be dragged from their beds early in the morning and driven to court to wait all day for their cases to be heard, thereby losing that day's visiting rights.

<P>
I am responding to this debate because, in general, the scheme has been well received and I may be able to reassure Committee members on the issue of justice.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I welcome the reassurance given by the Parliamentary Secretary on the peacetime use of video links, which I support, but what is the motivation behind the clause? Is it intended to deal with largely peacetime administration of custody hearings, or the problems associated with getting judicial officers to conduct custody hearings in operational conditions? I suspect that it is intended to deal with the latter. The Parliamentary Secretary must understand that we have grown up believing that we win all wars, have total control of the skies and the electronic ether, and that our intelligence can be accessed only with difficulty. However, a half good enemy of any form would listen to activities carried out in operational scenarios and gain intelligence. On operations, such an electronic link may prove vulnerable and deleterious to a commander's objectives. With that in mind, what is the clause trying to achieve in respect of judicial officers?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> That was a long intervention, and I was about to deal—tentatively—with the way in which the technology will work. On the use of this technology in peacetime and on operations, it is clearly needed in custody hearings where the accused is outside the country. It would be remiss of the Ministry of Defence not to consider its potential benefits in peacetime and in the UK.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary's explanation of the pilots' success has proved very helpful. In the light of that success, and given the Government's and the judicial system's considerable knowledge of this technology, why will the regulations not be introduced until May?
 
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> Simply because of the volume of work that is involved in preparing the regulations. Statutory instruments are drafted by parliamentary counsel, who are working extremely hard on a challenging Government programme. We shall introduce the measures as soon as it is possible to do so. I cannot help the hon. Gentleman any further on that point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I should like to raise a matter with the Parliamentary Secretary before she moves on. What she told us about the pilot schemes is good news. However, when she told me, in a parliamentary written answer on 1 February, that

<P>
No information is held centrally on the suppliers used or the arrangements put in place to prevent interception
and that the installation of video links is

<P>
arranged locally by the party whose witness is giving evidence in this way.
why did she not mention the trials, which had been completed by that time?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> If I remember correctly, without having the text in front of me, the hon. Gentleman's question specifically concerned the security surrounding the technology. If I can add in any way to the response that I gave, I shall seek to do so after the Committee, but I believe that I fully answered the question that he asked.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> My question was as follows:

<P>
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, if he will list the companies which supply, provide and service secure videolink technology for use in British courts; and what arrangements are in place to prevent the interception of transmissions by third parties.
To that broad question, the Parliamentary Secretary replied:

<P>
No information is held centrally on the suppliers.—[Official Report, House of Commons, 1 February 2000; Vol. 343, c. 545W.]
That cannot be the case.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> A comprehensive list could not be provided because we are in the process of expanding and rolling out the use of the technology. We are doing that because its benefits are obvious to those who have used it so far. To provide a definitive list would therefore have been to mislead the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
I turn, with some trepidation, to how the technology will work. Generally speaking, video conferencing is up and running, but it needs to be trialled for the purposes of the Bill. The hon. Member for Salisbury invited us to consider the rather colourful suggestion that we set up a video link in the Committee Room to allow members of the Committee to see it work. We do not intend to make those arrangements. However, I understand that the hon. Gentleman has already seen video conferencing work, and he should therefore be satisfied.

<P>
Conservative Members raised several points about whether the technology will be robust enough, so I shall spend a few moments describing how it will work in operations. All UK operations, and all Her Majesty's ships, are supported by military communications, which are generally provided by military SATCOM. My guidance notes include a glossary of such terms, which is unusual, but I hope that hon. Members will accept that they are in wide use. It has become routine for video conferencing to be provided as an integral part of the communications fit. It is used at 64k, and using new CODECs provides an adequate picture for command operations. It is true that the picture can be jerky, but recent advances in technology have largely overcome that problem. If the bandwidth is available, 128k will be used and that provides a better picture.

<P>
Video conferencing has been, or is being, deployed to the overseas command in Cyprus, Gibraltar and the Falkland islands and provides the local commander of British forces with a video link back to headquarters. That is the routine use of the equipment, and there is generally no question that it works. The fundamental issue is picture quality, which is extremely subjective; the arguments about technology should not detract from that.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
Permanent links for use in courts martial will set up in the courts martial centres and in the judge advocate general's department. Portable equipment, however, which is approximately the sixe of a suitcase, will be selfl-contained. It will be valuable to those who are interested in new technology, like my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge.

<P>
The video link will be used only for the custody hearing. As an example, there might be a three-way link between a judicial officer in London on a static permanent link, the accused's lawyer, who can attend the nearest courts martial centre in the UK, and the accused, who would be linked by portable equipment. That may answer some of the hon. Gentleman's questions about where the defendant's brief would be. On many occasions in the trials that I referred to earlier, where the accused and his reepresentative were not physically in the same room, the system was found to be highly satisfactory.

<P>
The judge advocate general and his staff have been involved in the trial of video conferencing equipment for this purpose. They must be satisfied that the equipment will be suitable. The judge advocate general has said:

<P>
I am satisfied that the equipment that I have seen demonstrated is adequate for hearings to be conducted in a fair and safe manner.

<P>
The final issue raised by hon. Members was security. The interception of video conferencing links is possible, but all the Ministry of Defence's operational links are protected by cryptographic systems. Although we do not intend to use encryption devices for custody conferences, a point-to-point link with a narrow beam width will provide adequate protection from casual Jane Kennedyhacking and eavesdropping. Because the transmission is digital, there is a low chance of interception.

<P>
I hope that my response has satisfied the Committee's concerns.

<P>

<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The hon. Lady must understand that it is not simply a question of whether the electronic signature can be intercepted and decoded by someone else so that they can understand what is going on: the electronic signature itself betrays people's presence. I grew up—this reflects my military experience—at a time when one spent as much time as possible on electronic or radio silence, because operations had to be conducted covertly. We are now putting in regulations where we assume that the world is our oyster and that we can make signals as we wish, but there may be times when we cannot do so.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> During my sojourn on the Standing Committee I have come to respect the hon. Gentleman's knowledge of this subject. The only answer that I can give is that the use of this technology would be underpinned by the words ``where practicable''. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is right that there may be circumstances where it is not practicable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The hon. Lady said that the judge advocate general is satisfied that the equipment will give a fair hearing in judicial cases, but the European Court of Human Rights has traditionally always incrementally increased the standards. Bearing in mind the Secretary of State's declaration in the Bill, is she satisfied that the equipment will be fully compliant with the ECHR regulations?
 
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> That is a good question. There is clearly concern that the technology that we introduce should enhance the protection of individuals' rights.

<P>
As the trials in the civilian courts showed, so long as we can guarantee that when the accused needs to consult his representative privately, that can be arranged—we know that it can be, using this technology—we believe that we satisfy the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I hope that, before the Parliamentary Secretary sits down, she will address my request for the Commitee to see a trial of this equipment.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I addressed that point when I said that we would not offer that trial. The technology is widely used in the services, and I know that the hon. Gentleman has seen it in use. We are talking about extending its use to custody hearings. In spite of the restriction that the hon. Member for Reigate hinted might apply, the Committee should be confident that this method of conducting those hearings will work and will not be in breach of the Human Rights Act, although time will tell. I invite the Committee, for once, to allow the clause to stand part without a Division.

<P>
<B>Bail in proceedings for illegal absence</B><P>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moonie:</B> To aid the Committee, I shall give a brief explanation of the clause. If members of the Committee wish to raise any points, I shall try to answer them.

<P>
The clause inserts new provisions into the discipline Acts to deal with deserters and those absent without leave who are taken into custody by the civilian police. It gives civil magistrates the power to remand such persons into custody or on bail, using the criteria that they would apply in other cases. This amendment to the general powers gives magistrates an additional power to remand on bail. Without such a provision, magistrates' powers would not be compatible with article 5 of the convention.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to ask the Minister one or two probing questions. I pursued the clause through some parliamentary questions and I asked particularly about the number of personnel in each of the armed services who have, for example, been arrested by civilian police, taken before a magistrate, and then released into the custody of the Royal Military Police. The answer from the Minister for the Armed Forces on 20 December was:

<P>
There has been no historical requirement to compile statistics across the three services in a way which would enable this detailed information to be provided.—[Offical Report, House of Commons, 20 December 1999; Vol. 341, c. 358W.]
They had no information along those lines.

<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> We had exactly the same problem in the Selected Committee that considered the Armed Forces Bill in 1996. Ministers were able to say how many came in and how many went out. They could provide a profit and loss account, but they could not provide a balance sheet. We could not believe it. Is my hon. Friend seriously telling me that the armed forces do not know how many people are absent without leave?

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The answer is that it depends whom one asks. My hon. Friend is absolutely right—it is almost unbelievable.

<P>
When I received the written answer, I immediately sought professional advice from solicitors, some of whom were former Army officers. They said that the information is held at various levels in the armed services, but it is never collected centrally by the Ministry of Defence. The Minister for the Armed Forces said that there has been no historical requirement to compile statistics in a way that enables detailed information to be provided. My hon. Friend is a former Minister, as am I, and he will know that there was no denial that the information existed. I suppose that we were saved by the disproportionate cost argument, but we have been told that that will be remedied and that the statistics will be collected.

<P>
When I asked about the number of deserters, the answer was:
 
<P>
There were no deserters from the Royal Navy or Royal Marines within the last three years. Figures are not held by the Army. RAF records reflect the year in which an individual was convicted at court-martial.—[Official Report, House of Commons, 20 December 1999; Vol. 341, c. 360W.]
The figures for the RAF were: 3 in 1996, 1 in 1997, and 2 in 1998.

<P>
I also asked how many personnel in each armed service went absent without leave or deserted in each of the previous three years. The figures are surprising and show why the clause is important. I touched on the RAF, but the figures for the Army were as follows: in 1996, 1,345 soldiers went absent without leave; in 1997 that figure had increased by 10 to 1,355; in 1998, the first year of the new Labour Government, it had leapt by 27 per cent. to 1,722. I am jesting in drawing any link, but that is a staggering statistic.

<P>
The clause slipped through the other place, largely unscrutinised, but did not escape the notice of my noble Friend Lord Attley who said that the clause would allow a deserter to obtain bail after he was apprehended. That is exactly what it does and I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the matter. The clause provides for bail in proceedings for illegal absence and it amends the service discipline Acts. The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Hood case was an important factor in motivating the review of the arrangements.

<P>
It worth remembering the case of David Hood, which arose on 27 November 1994. He was a soldier with the British Army who was arrested for being absent without leave—his fourth such absence. He was later sentenced to eight months in prison and dismissed the service. He went absent without leave prior to his detention three times in Germany and remained absent for almost two and a half years before giving himself up to the civilian police in December 1993. That case led to the situation in which we find ourselves today. It also provides a prime example of why the provisions in clause 9 may be deeply impracticable and have a negative effect on military discipline. If the unfortunate Mr. Hood had been brought before a civilian magistrate, he would now not be obliged to turn him over to military custody. There is every chance, under the new provisions, that an absconder or deserter would be given bail and, having gone absent without leave once, it is likely that he would do so again. Those who are familiar with the Hood case will be aware that it was arguable that there were mitigating circumstances in his favour which might conceivably have given a sympathetic magistrate reason to grant bail. I am not sure why that provision is the Bill. Will the Minister clarify the reason? I suspect that it is gold plating. Before we accept the clause, I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm my understanding, and assure me that we are not making it too easy.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I intervene briefly to assist my hon. Friend in his interpretation. Coming back a few hours late can constitute absence without leave. That explains the high number of charges. If hon. Members were charged with absence without leave every time they came back late, the number of offences would be considerable. Most of the offences will not be serious, but the difficulty for a magistrate lies in understanding the difference between desertion—which is an extremely serious offence, and usually carries a long prison sentence—and absence without leave at the top end of the spectrum, which carries a prison sentence of up to two years. The prosecuting authorities within the armed forces have a difficult decision to make on what charge to bring—desertion or absence without leave. A danger exists that the magistrates who will decide will not have a duty to ensure that the accused is received into military custody without the option of remand on bail. My noble Friend Lord Burnham advanced convincing arguments that the Bill should impose stricter duties on magistrates. Magistrates who are unaware of the difficulty and seriousness of the difference between desertion and absence—if an offence is being considered by him, it is likely to be serious—might have an opportunity to remand on bail people who should not otherwise be so treated.

<P>

<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I am worried that the so-called footprint of the armed services, in the community as a whole, is not as well understood now as previously. Many civilians do not understand the special rules that apply in the armed forces. In his brief intervention at the beginning of this debate, the Minister referred, I think, to the fact that bail would be granted on the usual criteria. It might be a mistake to apply the standard civilian procedures to bail for those who have deserted the armed forces. Will the Minister elaborate on exactly what he mant?

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I agree that the lack of central information appears slightly odd. I cannot guarantee that I can provide that information. However, I undertake to examine the matter, and find out why it is not kept centrally. It is all too easy just to say, ``That is not done.''

<P>
On the right to bail, a right is a right. Somebody who appears before a civilian court on the basis of suspicion of being absent without leave or a deserter has the same rights as anybody else who goes to court. He is therefore entitled to have bail at least considered. When making a decision a magistrate will be required to take into account the possibility of an individual absconding again. It is therefore a technical provision that allows the possibility of bail, to which anybody who appears before a civilian court is entitled. There is no guarantee that it will be granted, and, if there were a chance of the individual absconding, I would expect a magistrate to refuse bail.
Dr. Moonie
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Amendments of 1955 Acts and 1957 Act relating to custody</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 119, in page 48, line 38, at end insert—

<P>
2A. In section 82(2) of each of the 1955 Acts after ``charged with'', insert ``, or in custody in connection with.''.
I hope that the amendment will be helpful to the Government and improve the Bill. I looked at paragraph 2 to schedule 1, to which I hoped to add an additional paragraph 2A, and then read across to section 82(1) of the 1955 Act. Then I saw the proposed amendment in schedule 1 to section 82 of the Army Act 1955 and section 82(1) of the Royal Air Force Act 1955. My concern was that there appeared to be an inconsistency, which I hope that the Minister will be able to explain.

<P>
The sections in the Acts say:

<P>
In this Act the expression ``commanding officer'' in relation to a person charged with an offence, means such officer having powers of command over that person as may be determined by or under regulations of the Defence Council.
The amendments to the Bill and the schedule say:

<P>
In this Act the expression ``commanding officer'', in relation to a person charged with, or in custody in connection with, an offence, means such officer having powers of command over that person,
and so on. Section 82(2), which is not amended in the Bill without my amendment, goes on to talk about appropriate superior authorities. It says:

<P>
A person may act as appropriate superior authority in relation to a person charged with an offence if—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) he is a general officer, flag officer, air officer or brigadier, or

<P>
(b) where the Defence council so direct, he is a colonel or a naval or air force officer of corresponding rank.
An officer or warrant officer who is being dealt with under summary proceedings is disciplined not by the commanding officer but by the appropriate superior authority, as I understand it, who would be the brigadier or the general.
</font></ul>
<P>
The misfortune of relaying my experience to the Committee is that I shall then sound as though my old regiment, the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, had so much experience with discipline that it turned me into an expert. However, there were occasions when brother officers of mine, who were then disciplined by the general officer commanding and not by their commanding officer, got into difficulty. The powers of remand are then exercised by the general rather than by the lieutenant colonel commanding the unit, to respect the fact that they are of senior rank. When I saw this provision, it occurred to me that it may simply have been an oversight by the draftsmen and that it should say

<P>
A person may act as appropriate superior authority in relation to a person charged with, or in custody in connection with, an offence,
and then go on to say what an appropriate superior authority is. If that provision is not included, a person may not have the necessary authority vis-à-vis officers and warrant officers and any others wo do not come within the ambit of a lieutenant colonel or equivalent commanding the unit, because he does not look after the summary disposal of justice of officers and so on.

<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the reason why officers are not usually allowed to drive military vehicles is that the resulting accidents take too much of the brigadier's time?

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. The circumstances in which brother officers and I got into trouble were usually connected with driving motor vehicles, on one occasion trying to out-race the Royal Military Police in Herford—successfully, I might add. Those involved got away, but regrettably were identified by other means. That incident resulted in those involved going in front of the general and receiving punishment. I simply ask the Minister to say whether the amendment should be accepted to make the Bill proof in all circumstances or whether there is a reason why the words are not in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> The amendment would make appropriate superior authorities share in the responsibility for custody provisions introduced in the Bill in the same way as commanding officers.

<P>
Appropriate superior authorities have a role in the discipline system, in being able to deal summarily with cases that the commanding officer is not empowered to hear. Thus, they would hear cases against officers and warrant officers. Essentially, appropriate superior authorities are senior officers, in the chain of command above the commanding officer. We do not believe that there is a need to involve them in custody decisions. The service discipline Acts do not involve appropriate superior authorities in these matters at present, nor would the amendment on its own provide procedures to enable them to do so in future. Whatever the rank of an accused within a unit, we consider that the commanding officer should be capable of deciding whether there is a need for custody prior to charge or trial, subject, where necessary, to the supervision of the judicial officer. That is contained in the new provision. There is no need for anyone other than a commanding officer to make that initial decision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> If it is accepted that a major's custody, for example, could be properly administered by the commanding officer, what would happen if a brigadier had done something wrong? How would he be dealt with under the provisions?

<P>
I shall take the example of a divisional headquarters, in which the administration is undertaken by a lieutenant colonel of a signal regiment. If the desire was to remand a brigadier in custody, it would be rather peculiar if that task fell to a lieutenant colonel, as commanding officer. It would surely be preferable if it fell to the general officer commanding that division, in which case the amendment might be necessary. If not, I shall be happy to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Not being a lawyer, I always remember thinking that good cases make bad law. I think that that is the way that is phrased.

<P>
The case of the brigadier would depend on whether he had been taken into custody, or recommended for custody, because of the technicality of whatever he was alleged to have done, or because his continued liberty was considered to be a danger to himself or others. In an emergency such as the latter case, it would clearly be up to the commanding officer to make that decision, because the degree of urgency would have a bearing on the circumstances. There is a difference between emergencies and normal situations. However, for more senior officers, the standard procedure would involve a commanding officer being appointed specially for the purpose of taking him into custody. I am happy to say that that does not happen very often.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> On that basis, I am content with the Minister's explanation that a commanding officer would be appointed for that purpose. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 49, leave out line 14.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 121, in page 49, leave out line 23.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> This issue is rather more important than the previous one. On reading through the Bill in detail, I came across the provision in schedule 1(5), which states that:

<P>
In section 225(1) of the Army Act 1955 (general provisions as to interpretation)—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the definition of ``arrest'' is omitted,
Amendment No. 120 refers to that proposal. Amendment No. 121 covers the similar proposal contained in section 223(1) of the Air Force Act 1955.</ul></font>

<P>
If one examines the relevant sections of those Acts, one discovers that the definition that is being removed from that Act includes the words ``arrest includes open arrest''. I am concerned about that, because open arrest is an immensely useful way of dealing with offenders when on military duty. After an arrest has been formally made, and the person concerned has been detained for the purposes of the law, certain restrictions can be imposed on him if the circumstances are such that it is not desirable actually to detain him in the guardroom under close arrest. Open arrest allows him to be under arrest, but operating as usual. He can carry on the usual duties that one would wish soldiers to carry on, even when under investigation and under formal arrest—for example, on the tank park doing vehicle maintenance. When one is on operations, the last thing one wants is to have someone being guarded by other people. However, it may be useful to have available the concept of arrest whereby someone is formally under arrest, but, given the exigencies of the situation, is allowed to be under open arrest so that he is not actually being guarded.

<P>
I cannot see any reference in the Bill to the concept of open arrest having been dropped, so what is the consequence of removing the definitions of open arrest in section 223 of the Air Force Act 1955 and section 225 of the Army Act 1955? I imagine that the concept of open arrest is unknown in civilian life, where one is either under arrest or not. It is a halfway house whereby someone is able to soldier on—or sailor on—and continue to perform his normal duties and play an important role in the military team. That is why the concept is so important. Every time that someone is taken off the tank park, or away from other duties, that has a deleterious effect on his mates, who have to pick up the burden. Will the Under-Secretary explain what is behind the deletions of the definitions of open arrest from the Bill? I hope that that does not mean that it cannot continue.

<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I am happy to provide that reassurance. Because of the changes to the definition of custody, arrest is now automatically followed by custody under the provisions of paragraph 5. Although we have taken away the concept of open arrest, we are not abolishing it; we are merely calling it something else, which is described as imposing conditions on liberty. That was mentioned in clause 5 with regard to the restrictions that might be placed on the individual concerned. Clause 5(2)(b) states that a person may be

<P>
required to comply, before release or later, with such requirements as appear to the judicial officer or judge advocate  to be necessary for the purpose of securing his attendance at any hearing.
In practice, we are merely replacing open arrest by imposing conditions on liberty. Because that is not a restriction on liberty as defined in paragraph 5, it does not require the application of any custody provisions, and can therefore be left out of the consideration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> Will the Minister guide me to the relevant part of clause 5? I cannot find it.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> It appears at the top of page 24 in subsection (2)(b). Although it does not specifically refer to imposing conditions on liberty, that is what it does.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> The problem with subsection 2(b) is that it refers only to people who are ``subject to military law''—such as me—

<P>
only by virtue of section 131—
of the Army Act 1955, or to members of specialist groups, such as Territorial Army officers, which are referred to in new section 205(1)(ea), (eb), (g) or (h). If I were arrested for an offence, it is likely that it would be for a serious offence and I would be remanded on bail Mr. Bluntor in custody. However, I would not be serving in uniform at the time, which might mean that the provisions would not apply to me. Will the provisions apply only to members of the regular forces?

<P>
The amendment has identified the relevant issues and stressed the importance of the concept of open arrest. I hope that, if the provisions of custody will abolish that practice, the Minister and his officials will consider the matter—

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Will my hon. Friend say whether the concept of open arrest is normal in the Royal Navy? These days, all the crew on a minehunter, which is a small ship with a complement of about 35, are key to its operation. It is inconceivable that any of the crew would be locked up in part of the ship—an offender who was under open arrest would be unlikely to jump ship into the briny. If open arrest were abolished in principle, that would have a serious impact on the Royal Navy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend.

<P>
Between now and Report, the Minister and his officials should consider the importance of open arrest. Will it be affected by the Bill's proposed changes to custody arrangements? On Report, the Minister should add a definition of the concept to the schedule.

<P>
Although the concept of open arrest is understood by the armed forces, the Minister may want to change the phrase that is used in the Bill for legal reasons. However, the schedule should contain a definition of open arrest, and specify the restrictions that will be involved because that useful term reflects current military and naval practice. We must protect that vital concept. When people are charged and remanded for trial, the circumstances in which the military operate may mean that they are kept under open arrest. We should sustain that arrangement, and we should not inadvertently place duties on people. If the concept of open arrest were no longer defined in legislation, commanding officers might say, ``The concept of open arrest has gone; we cannot use it any more. We can either use arrest or release people on bail.'' I hope that the Minister will consider the matter and come forward on Report with appropriate amendments to place a clear definition of open arrest in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance that, to the best of my knowledge, the concept will be retained but a different term will be used. I shall write to Committee members explaining exactly how we shall achieve that continuation. I am confident about the situation, but I am not absolutely certain of the relevant mechanism. We may have to return to this important matter on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Blunt:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that reassurance. We should link whatever legal phrase is needed in the Bill with the phrase ``open arrest'', which is understood in the armed forces. We have to protect that concept. With those caveats, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Schedule 1 agreed to.

Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Clelland.]
