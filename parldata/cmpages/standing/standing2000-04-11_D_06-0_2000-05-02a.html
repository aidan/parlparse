<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The amendment is, in effect, a paving amendment for the new clause. Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 and new clauses 1, 2 and 3 and new schedules 1 and 2 are a set, and therefore to be considered accordingly. Clause 7 relates to the same issue and goes some way to meet the concerns addressed in the amendments.

<P>
First, I wish you, Mr. Sayeed, and my colleagues a happy Easter time; it may seem a long while since Easter, but it is still Easter time for another five weeks or so. I wish everyone a happy May day and a happy new term. May it go swimmingly for all of us until the summer holidays-[
Interruption.] Before some of us get the wrong idea, there is much Home Office work to be done.

<P>
The amendments propose a positive statutory duty to promote racial equality and good race relations. Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 provide for the implementation by public authorities of that duty, for the preparation of a draft code of practice relating to its implementation and for consultation with the appropriate bodies before it is drafted.

<P>
It is no secret that the Commission for Racial Equality suggested the substantive proposal in new clause 1, that a new duty to promote equality should be substituted for section 71 of the Race Relations Act 1976. The central proposition is that there should be a duty on public authorities to have due regard to the need, first to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and, secondly, to promote equality of opportunity between persons of different colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national origins.

<P>
How are public authorities to be defined? We have been once round that course already and we will need to debate whether the general definition, which the Government accepted in principle at our previous sitting, can be used or whether the individual public authorities to which the proposal applies should be listed. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) and I have said, we do not have a problem with there being a checklist, so that people know that they are covered; but we are glad that the Government accept that there should be a general definition of public authority. We hope that that will apply to this clause as it does to clauses discussed earlier.

<P>
We set out in new clause 2 the positive-duty provision, that every public authority shall carry out its functions with due regard to the need to avoid unlawful racial discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups.

<P>
New clause 3 would establish a mechanism for ensuring compliance. Government new clause 7 remains different in one important respect from our new clauses, which contain the provisions for which the CRE argued. As I understand it, the Government have no compliance provision yet, and there should be one. If it appeared to the commission that a public authority had not taken appropriate steps to comply with all or any of its duties under the section that places a positive duty on an authority, our new clause 3 would allow the commission to serve on the authority a notice in the prescribed form, which would contain statements on the non-compliance and other matters.

<P>
That measure follows the normal procedure that the CRE uses regularly for serving notices, which allows it to have teeth as well as a voice. Ensuring that public authorities do not discriminate directly or indirectly on racial grounds is the Bill's core proposal, and a compliance function would rightly ensure that authorities also comply properly with their positive duty to promote racial equality. The procedure that the CRE has used over the years seems right; there is no need to invent a new procedure. That would be complicated and confusing, and the current procedure seems to us and the CRE to work well.

<P>
New schedule 1 provides 10 general descriptions of the relevant Departments and public authorities. [
Interruption.] I shall just turn off my turned-off pager, which is none the less bleeping. New schedule 2 would insert new schedule A3 into the 1976 Act and set up racial equality schemes to assess how well people are doing. The schemes would place a duty on local authorities to assess their compliance with the duties under section 71 of the 1976 Act, to consult on matters relevant to those duties, to assess and consult on the likely impact of policies and to monitor any adverse impact of policies adopted.

<P>
I shall briefly set out the arguments for the proposal, because the Government, not least because of debate in the Lords, are seized of the appropriateness of imposing a positive duty, which they have adopted in part. The debate is therefore more on the detail than on the general proposition.

<P>
A positive statutory duty would ensure that authorities not only react to people who test their racial equality policies, but accept that promoting racial equality is a public benefit and is good service and employment practice. We seek to establish a culture change by inculcating the responsibility of being not passive, but active, particularly because public authorities are role models. The police were the central authority examined by the Lawrence inquiry, and if they can be a good role model and clearly accept their duty to promote equality, there will be a knock-on effect on society and on all those with whom they come into contact. The same applies to central and local government and all other public agencies. Under new clause 3, ``racial equality'' would be defined as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>equality of opportunity irrespective of membership or perceived membership of any racial group.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That definition would avoid any narrow categorisation and would apply to any public authority in the conduct of its business.

<P>
The amendments, including the new clauses and new schedules, draw on the experience gained from the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the Scotland Act 1998. As the Minister will know, the duty in relation to equality is much more advanced in Northern Ireland. As we have discussed previously in Committee, that is the one place in the United Kingdom that has a human rights commission that gives additional support to those who argue for equality of opportunity.

<P>
Under new clause 2, the duty would apply to every public authority not only in the exercise of its powers, but in the formulation and implementation of its policies and strategies. Every public authority would publish the scheme by which it sought to carry out its positive duty, so that people could have access to it for comment and criticism, to bring about improvements. It cannot be just tokenism: the scheme by which public authorities seek to secure compliance must be worked through and owned, as it were. People understand that that would work a little like a mission statement.

<P>
There should be a scheme that works out the impact of measures. It is no good having a scheme if it is not tried, tested and evaluated. Public services are becoming much better at doing that in a way that is not burdensome, but gives people regular review opportunities and criteria by which to review. That also allows people to learn lessons: if a policy is having an adverse impact, people can see that it is amended.

<P>
There should be regulations for secondary legislation. That must be the right way to proceed, so that we do not create clutter by leaving too much to primary legislation, while having the ability to take important measures through the parliamentary process.

<P>
It is proposed that information should be collected and published, which is necessary to facilitate the public authority in doing its job and to ensure that it is not acting unlawfully. The provision for an annual report is the normal proposal, with which we are all familiar. That could be the annual check, which is published. The report would set out the measures that have been taken, assess their impact and propose measures that might be taken in the year ahead.

<P>
In the implementation of the duty, public authorities would be subject to the same external audit and inspection proposals as are all other public authorities in the exercise of their duties. I am sure that the Government are happy about that proposition in principle. As I said, public services are becoming much more used to audit and inspection and benefit from it if the right procedure is implemented and works well. I hope that my colleagues do not find that controversial.

<P>
Under new clause 3, we have suggested a compliance proposal, which follows traditional CRE practice. Public authorities would have the ability to challenge compliance notices, although my experience is that they are served after quite a long process, which normally consists of correspondence, discussion and opportunities for people to amend practice if the CRE thinks that something may be wrong. Notices are very much the weapon not of first but last or penultimate resort. As far as I am aware, they have always been used responsibly and carefully, never precipitately. In addition, a procedure would allow the courts to get rid of notices, if the Scottish courts or the appropriate courts in England and Wales find that that is appropriate.

<P>
A number of issues could be covered by regulation: the scrutiny process, consultation, ethnic monitoring, inspection and audit, annual reporting and compliance notices. Lastly, a code of practice could be available to public authorities as a good model of how people should proceed.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The reservations about the Government's new clause-it is welcome as far as it goes-which I understand are felt particularly by the CRE, are that, first, it provides for arrangements to be made, but does not go far enough for some in terms of the measures to be included, and, secondly, it does not give the Secretary of State a power to impose specific duties on public authorities.

<P>
I have thought a bit about this, and I begin from the proposition that we should legislate as little as possible. I recall the regular tour guide story told by my late colleague, David Penhaligon, who used to take his constituents through the No Lobby and past the volumes of Hansard. There is a two-volume collection of the statutes in force. The first dates from 1260 to 1963 and the second from 1963 to 1999. David used to say to his constituents, ``There is something wrong if we have passed as many laws in the past 50 years as we have in the past 1,000.'' There is some truth in that. I am not sure that we should be adding extra layers of bureaucracy. On balance, though, it struck me that this provision is desirable to allow Government to intervene to regulate a public authority. Across the range of authorities that the legislation will encompass, there may be a specific type of action governing the police service, public services, local authorities or education authorities that may be entirely inappropriate to others. As I see it, the only way of dealing with that is through a power allowing the Secretary of State to direct that local authorities act in a particular way. Such a provision should be included in the Bill.

<P>
There is an old debate about the exemption in respect of the immigration and nationality directorate, which I understand is still covered. There is exemption under the Government's new clause but not under the new clauses and schedules that my hon. Friends and I tabled. This requires a view in the round about the place of the IND in the system of things. During our substantive debate about that matter some weeks ago, I said that we would need to return to it. I should be grateful for some elaboration on the system and on this power, which will be incorporated in the legislation for Scotland, Wales and England. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine may wish to intervene at some point. My understanding is that different powers and procedures will apply in the three countries of Great Britain, and that there will be a consultation process in Wales that will not apply in Scotland. I do not claim to be an expert on this, but I believe that, if they are to be different, it is important that the difference is justified. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine will judge more quickly than I can whether that fits the Scotland Act 1998 arrangements.

<P>
I have already touched on compliance notices. Of all the ways that we could choose, I prefer to have provision now for a compliance notice, rather than legislation later. It would be better to have that now, even if regulations were implemented later. I ask the Minister to reflect on the successful history of the compliance notice provision. The Government may not want at this stage to introduce a compliance notice provision to promote equality because they think that it might be the least tangible element of the Bill and the least enforceable in law. That is true to some extent, but if the Bill's purpose is to bring race relations legislation up to date as well as improve the attitude to racial equality-to the extent that this improvement prevails in all public authorities-compliance notices appear to be a useful way forward.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> Proposed new section 71D in new clause 7 sets out our provisions for compliance notices. The hon. Gentleman may have missed it in passing. We also think that a compliance notice procedure is necessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am turning that up. I stand corrected by the Minister. I now see it on page 328 of the amendment paper. That is one less criticism and I withdraw it unreservedly. The Government are much better than I thought-[Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.'']-in this area. I am glad that we have had the debate and that the Government have accepted the propositions from the other place. The issue is now about the mechanics and detail, rather than the broad picture.

<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): I shall briefly take up the cue presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) on new clause 7, which lays down that certain provisions shall be taken to be pre-commencement enactments within the meaning of the Act. It would be useful if the Minister would remind us of the consequences and of the way in which it will work. For the lay person outside, the wonder of Parliament is that, long after the Scotland Act has come into force, there can still be such a thing as a pre-commencement Act.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey for the way in which he spoke to his amendments. There is very little between us on this matter. Most of the hon. Gentleman's proposals are in our new clauses, although perhaps our approach on the detail differs slightly in some respects.

<P>
The Bill is one of the most significant steps that the Government will take on race equality in Britain, and is probably the biggest step taken since the Race Relations Act 1996. The Bill will create a positive duty on all public authorities to promote race equality. It will be a major change in law. The Government see this new duty as a way of trying to eliminate discrimination in public services, not only in the internal organisational structure of public authorities but in the delivery of services to ethnic minorities.

<P>
The Home Office already promotes racial equality. It has set targets for the recruitment, retention and progression of ethnic minorities within our Departments. The public sector agreements have cut right across Whitehall, creating mechanisms for driving forward race equality within Government as a whole. A series of other policies are in force in an attempt to promote race equality, which is being mainstreamed in all Government policy. In considering any new element of Government policy, a Minister must consider the implications for ethnic minorities and race equality generally.

<P>
The Home Office has also set up an ethnic minority network to ensure that ethnic minority staff will be supported and have access to promotion opportunities and other opportunities from which they have all too often felt excluded. We want other public authorities to adapt their ways of promoting race equality. We do not want to be too prescriptive about the precise mechanisms that they use, but we want to ensure that there is a real change in the way in which we perceive our role of creating a successful multiracial society. The public services must recognise that it is no good simply paying lip service to race equality: they must ensure that race equality is at the heart of their organisation's considerations when providing services-it should be part of the mainstream of policy consideration. The new duty will be a significant step forward.

<P>
On 30 November, the Government issued an equality statement in which we said that we wanted to create a broad statutory duty throughout the public sector to promote equality. Equality is important in the delivery of services to all the people of this country and should be pursued in a way that is consistent with our belief that we must become a successful multiracial society.

<P>
We want to create such a duty in the Bill, and it is important to do so. However, we also want to leave room for consultation on the detail of how the duty will operate, so that we can get it right. The way in which new statutory duty operates in large and small organisations may differ, and those organisations will have to work out how they comply with it. They will have to do so in a way that enables them to be efficient and to deliver their services effectively, while meeting our national aim of being a successful multiracial society. The Government have therefore set out some compliance mechanisms in the amendments and new clauses. However, we have also left room to consider the detail of how we would proceed in practice. Anyone who is caught by the new statutory duty will want to take advantage of guidance from the Commission for Racial Equality or Departments on how they should comply. We have set in place the mechanisms to enable us to provide that guidance.

<P>
The Liberal Democrats have set out their proposals. There is not much between us, and I shall come to the differences in a moment. First, however, I shall speak to the Government amendments and new clauses. In the new framework, we set out a general duty on public authorities. We then set out ministerial powers to impose further duties and give details of those duties. We do that not to extend the scope of the provisions, but to detail them within the scope set out in the clause. The provisions also give the CRE the right to draft codes of practice and guidance for public authorities. We also set out compliance and enforcement mechanisms. As I said, the detail will follow consultation. Finally, we set out provisions to enable the courts to enforce the statutory duty, should that be necessary.

<P>
I should apologise to colleagues. New clause 7 is important, and I want to take the Committee's time to set out the details. The provisions will have a profound effect on our society, and it is right that we should consider the nature of the duties in detail. Proposed section 71(1) imposes the general duty on public authorities. It places such authorities, as specified in a new schedule, under a duty to make arrangements to secure that their functions are carried out with due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons from different racial groups.

<P>
I should tell the Liberal Democrats that, although their new clause contains a more detailed approach to racial groups, our version would include broadly the same terms. The wording of the duty largely reflects the wording of section 71 of the Race Relations Act. However, the present duty, which is only on local councils, can effectively be ignored by a council that considers it ``inappropriate''. As a result, it has had a limited and uneven impact in practice. We have tried to avoid that in the new general duty.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
New section 71(2) provides that the Home Secretary shall make orders to impose specific duties on public authorities to ensure the better performance of the general duty. Much of the detail of how the general duty will operate in practice will depend on the content of those orders, and the Government want to consult on what should go into them. We have in mind, for example, duties to produce and publish equality plans and to be aware of the delivery of services and the ethnic origin of staff, perhaps by monitoring them.

<P>
I must stress that proportionality and flexibility will be important. It may be appropriate to place a particular requirement on a major Department of State or a local authority, but inappropriate to place it on a small public authority. That is why new section 71(3) allows orders made under new section 71(2) to be made in relation to some public authorities, but not others. It also allows different requirements to be placed on different public authorities or categories of public authority.

<P>
New section 71(5) makes provision to allow the schedule of public authorities to be amended.

<P>
New section 71A deals with immigration and nationality functions. Public authorities that carry out such functions will be subject to the general duty in so far as it pertains to eliminating unlawful racial discrimination and promoting good relations between persons from different racial groups. However, they will not be subject to the duty in so far as it requires the promotion of equality of opportunity between persons from different racial groups. That is because immigration and nationality policy, by its nature, denies opportunities to some nationalities that are offered to others. That is a basic requirement of immigration law, and we could not have a requirement to give people with British passports the same rights as those with passports from another country.

<P>
New section 71B deals with devolution issues. Under the Scotland Act 1998, the subject matter of the Race Relations Act is a reserved matter, with two exceptions: the encouragement, other than by prohibition or regulation, of equal opportunities and, in particular, the observance of equal opportunity requirements; and the imposition of duties on Scottish and cross-border public authorities in relation to Scottish functions. The new general duty may, therefore, impact on devolved areas of responsibility. It is proposed that the order-making powers in relation to the duty should be conferred on Scottish Ministers in line with the devolution settlement. I shall go into that in more detail if the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine wants me to do so.

<P>
In relation to Wales, the new section provides that the Secretary of State shall consult the National Assembly for Wales before making regulations relating to cross-border authorities and make regulations relating to Welsh authorities only with the consent of the Welsh Assembly.

<P>
New section 71C makes provisions relating to codes of practice. The CRE already has the power to issue codes of practice that are approved by the Secretary of State in relation to employment and housing. The new section gives the CRE the power to issue codes of practice that have similarly been approved by the Secretary of State to provide guidance to public authorities on carrying out their duties to promote race equality.

<P>
The procedures for preparing, issuing and consulting on draft codes are based on the existing procedures for codes on employment and housing. So, too, are the procedures for Secretary of State approval of the codes, and for laying them before Parliament. The only difference is that the Secretary of State will be under a duty, in view of devolution, to consult Scottish Ministers and the National Assembly for Wales in deciding whether to approve or reject such codes.

<P>
Codes of practice will be able to give guidance to public authorities about how to fulfil their new duties. It is envisaged that they could provide examples of what public authorities might do to fulfil their duties, and encourage best practice. A breach of a code would not be actionable as such, but a code would be admissible in evidence where it is relevant to any issue in proceedings before a court.

<P>
New sections 71D and E make provision in relation to compliance and enforcement. Subsection D gives the CRE the power to issue a compliance notice if it is satisfied that a public authority has failed to comply with any duty imposed by regulations made by the Secretary of State under section 71(2). A compliance notice would require the public authority to comply with the duty and to inform the CRE of the steps that it had taken to do so. It could also require the public authority to give the CRE other information to verify that the duty had been complied with.

<P>
New section 71E gives the CRE the power to apply for a court order requiring a public authority to provide information required by a compliance notice if that authority has failed to do so, or if the CRE has reason to believe that it does not intend to do so. It also provides for the CRE to apply for a court order requiring a public authority to comply with a requirement of a compliance notice, where the commission considers that that public authority has not complied with it within three months of the compliance notice having been served. The court may grant the order in the terms applied for, or in more limited terms. The fallback position is that the court will be the final arbiter in terms of compliance, but the CRE can initiate action, if necessary. There is a great deal in this new clause, but I shall turn now, to the remainder of the Government amendments in the group.
 
<P>
New schedule 3 inserts new schedule 1A into the Race Relations Act. The schedule lists public authorities for the purposes of the duty to promote race equality. It lists Ministers, Government Departments, the armed forces, NHS bodies, local government bodies and the police. It makes provision for Scotland analogous to provision for England and Wales.

<P>
Colleagues may have noticed that the new schedule does not include educational bodies. There are some difficult technical legal points yet to be resolved in relation to educational bodies because of the overlap between the existing general duty on schools and local education authorities under section 19 of the Act and the new general duty. However, we hope to be able to resolve these problems before Report and that educational bodies will be appropriately included.

<P>
The new schedule also does not list all non-departmental public bodies or private bodies carrying out public functions. However, an order-making power is provided under subsection 71(5) to enable these bodies-or those bodies in so far as their functions are of a public nature-to be added to the schedule. It is intended that where such bodies carry out public functions, they will be added to the list by order.

<P>
Marshalled amendments Nos. 57 to 63 are largely technical amendments, consequential on the main provision that we have just been discussing. Amendment No. 57 makes consequential provision to align the references in the Local Government Act 1988 with the new schedule. Amendments Nos. 58 to 62 repeal now-redundant provisions in other legislation providing for particular public authorities to be subject to the duty to promote race equality. Amendment No. 63 provides, for the avoidance of doubt, that no amendment of an enactment by this Bill is to be taken as a pre-commencement enactment within the meaning of the Scotland Act 1998 unless the amendment explicitly says so.

<P>
The Government are committed to achieving a real change in race equality in this country. We believe that these amendments will create a strong, clear, effective and enforceable duty on public authorities to promote race equality. They take the legislative framework considerably further forward than the current duty under section 71 of the Race Relations Act and should help to place public authorities where they should be-at the forefront of the drive towards race equality, setting the pace for others to follow. The duty underlines the Government's strong commitment to race equality, and will mainstream that commitment into the day-to-day work of public authorities. I hope that hon. Members from all parties will support the amendments, which I commend to the Committee.

<P>
I shall now deal with the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. The Government will resist them, for reasons that I shall outline in a moment, but we agree with a great deal about them.

<P>
The Liberal Democrat amendments offer a menu of two alternative approaches. The Government amendments to which I have just spoken incorporate many elements that are based on one of those alternatives, so we hope that they will find favour.

<P>
I shall set out the common ground. First, we broadly agree on the terms of the general duty-that it should relate to the elimination of racial discrimination and the promotion of equality of opportunity and good relations between different racial groups. Secondly, we agree that to some extent the specific duties that underpin the general duty should be set out in regulations, although we differ about the extent to which these matters should be left to subordinate legislation-a point to which I shall return.

<P>
Thirdly, we agree that compliance and enforcement of the duties should be achieved through the CRE. The second alternative offered by Liberal Democrat Members, in common with the Government amendments, envisages that the CRE should be able to issue a compliance notice where a public authority is not complying with its duty; and that, ultimately, it should be possible for the CRE to apply for a court order if a public authority fails to comply with a compliance notice. The first alternative offered by the Liberal Democrats envisages a similar procedure for court orders.

<P>
Fourthly, we agree that the CRE should be able to issue codes of practice containing practical guidance to public authorities about implementing the duty; and that, where a provision of such a code appears relevant to a court in relation to a particular question, the court should be able to take notice of the code.

<P>
However, the Liberal Democrat amendments depart in some ways from the Government's thinking. The Government's main objection is that the Liberal Democrat alternatives are too detailed and prescriptive. We wish to allow more room for consultation and to secure greater flexibility and proportionality on account of the different public authorities that will be subject to the general duty. Our minor differences relate primarily to the need for consultation, flexibility and proportionality. For example, although new clause 1 leaves a great deal to regulations, it imposes a requirement that all specified public authorities be inspected and monitored.

<P>
There are many public authorities, ranging greatly in size from Departments of State and local authorities to small rural schools and advisory NDPBs. The proposition of inspecting every one of them is neither practically achievable nor proportionate. Nor is it necessary, as existing inspectorates and auditors-the Audit Commission, the Office for Standards in Education, Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary and so on-will include all mainstream inspection and monitoring of action relating to the new duty. It will be part of their inspection and auditing work. We wish to create, not a new inspectorate or new mechanisms, but a new duty, which will be accountable to existing inspectorates and auditors.

<P>
Similarly, new clause 2 prescribes, where we would rather consult. The Liberal Democrats are pre-judging the need to prescribe. Consultation should come first: if prescription is necessary, it can be applied in the light of consultation. New clause 2 states that all specified public authorities shall publish racial equality schemes, the content of which is then further specified in a schedule. It also requires these public authorities to collect and publish information and to publish annual reports, the content of which is then further specified.

<P>
The Government are sympathetic to the thrust of these provisions. The collection of information about how services are impacting on members of different racial groups, or about the racial composition of the work force or the annual publication of information about how public authorities are complying with the duty are some of the issues that the Government would want to consider for inclusion in the orders under new section 71(2). The Government believe, however, that it would be right to consult both with the CRE and other interested groups and with the public authorities before laying down detailed requirements.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Home Office is currently consulting on a basket of indicators that it wants to use to measure the delivery of its services to ethnic minorities. I do not want us to prescribe now something on which we are currently consulting. It would be better to wait for the outcome of that consultation than to move forward too quickly. Once that consultation is completed and we have the results, we will have a basis for starting to move forward. There will not be a massive change overnight. It will take some time to develop the mechanisms to get the orders in place, but the end result will be a significant change in the way that our public authorities operate. The current legislation contains a worthy section that says that local authorities have a duty to promote race equality, but there is no mechanism to ensure that that is done. We are creating a mechanism here that covers all public authorities and will ensure that it is done in due course in the light of proper consultation and discussion.

<P>
There are some other objections to the Liberal Democrats' proposals. Their second proposal would impose a duty on all public authorities, without specifying what those public authorities are. That brings us back to the general debate about whether we go for the approach in the Human Rights Act 1998. We have thought about this carefully. It is possible to set out in the Bill an obligation not to discriminate and to say that it will apply to all public authorities. But when one imposes a positive duty to comply with a requirement or a set of codes, one must specify which public authorities will be caught by it. There is a qualitative difference in terms of the nature of the law.

<P>
After considerable thought, we have decided that it is better to prescribe the public authorities that will be caught by the new duty rather than leaving it to the courts to decide what ``a public authority'' is and what a duty of a public nature is. We want to be very specific from the start. Our goal is to have a strong, clear and enforceable duty on public authorities to promote race equality, helping to place public authorities in the forefront of the drive towards equality. Given that there is a great deal of agreement between Liberal Democrat Members and us, we hope that they will support our proposals and withdraw their amendment. I also hope that the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman will support us.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): I am grateful to the Minister for setting out the Government's proposals at length. The Committee needed to be taken through the details of his proposed additions to the Bill. I was particularly grateful for the stress that he repeatedly gave to the need for proportionality and the need to have regard to the particular responsibilities, size and geographic location of the public authorities that would be subject to this new duty.

<P>
I agree with the Minister and with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about the overall objective. I am sure that the aim of mainstreaming racial equality throughout the public sector is right, but I am sceptical about the extent to which that can be achieved by the passage of Acts of Parliament, however well intentioned that is. Can legislation, however voluminous the statute book, ultimately change culture more effectively than the myriad decisions taken by individuals and organisations, acting and thinking voluntarily? But the proposal is before us now.

<P>
My first thought on reading the Government amendments was whether we needed a statutory duty. It had always seemed to me that most of the agencies of the state had thought a great deal about their recruitment and promotion practices, particularly in view of the duties imposed by the 1976 Act. The annual reports of most Government agencies and local authorities contain references to equal opportunities policies. While it is probably true that local authorities have acted differently in respect of the duties imposed on them under section 71 of the 1976 Act, local authorities with significant ethnic minorities in their areas, irrespective of the party that happened to be in control, have taken their duties seriously and sought to introduce the concept of equality of opportunity for people of every ethnic origin into their policies.

<P>
I can see why the Government, particularly in the aftermath of the Macpherson inquiry, concluded that something more is needed, but I wonder how much the new legislation will change what public agencies do. Nobody's interests will be served if we build up expectations of some sea change in the culture of public authorities, with enhanced equality of opportunity for British citizens from ethnic minority backgrounds, if public sector managers feel that they are discharging their duty by simply compiling the right sets of statistics each year and setting up committees or task forces with a racial equality badge. We should not regard the establishment of new committees and the publication of additional statistics as an answer, as that will not help the people that the Bill is designed to help.

<P>
I can see the clarity of the Government's amendments. They make it clear that every arm of the public sector should regard the promotion of equality of opportunity as central to its policy-making and the shaping of its services. I can see too that new schedule 3 will widen the vires of public bodies, enabling them to spend money on promoting racial equality in a way that they might feel inhibited from doing now. That leads us on to questions about the judgment of individual arms of the public sector and how they might choose to exercise that freedom to spend public money. The public sector bodies that will be listed in the new schedule will be liable to orders made by the Secretary of State under proposed new section 71(2) and liable to the procedures of the Commission for Racial Equality via the codes of conduct and compliance orders under proposed new sections 71D and 71E.

<P>
I wish to put a couple of questions to Ministers about the powers included in the Government amendments. Under proposed new section 71(2),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may by order impose, on<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the organisations listed in schedule 1A
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such duties as he considers appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State can also impose them by order on the persons listed in schedule 1A to ensure
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the better performance of their duties under subsection (1)-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in other words, their new duties to promote racial equality. The Secretary of State also has powers under proposed new section 71(5) to amend schedule 1A and, under proposed new section 71(6), he can repeal primary or secondary legislation in amending that schedule. These are far-reaching powers, which apply right across the public sector, not just to Home Office-related bodies or to Whitehall Departments and related agencies.

<P>
Ministers wish to give the Secretary of State-the Home Secretary in the first instance, but the powers could also be exercised by another Secretary of State-the power to issue orders to elected local authorities, to parish councils, to the armed forces, to hospital trusts and to family doctors either through primary care groups via health authorities or through primary care trusts. The powers apply to a wide range of public authorities, some of which are small scale and comprise only a small number of people who have to manage on limited budgets.

<P>
In recent comments about the education sector, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment hinted at the prospect of bringing school governing bodies within the scope of the schedule in due course. It would then apply to a small group of unremunerated volunteers.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Schools are already covered by a duty to promote. The issue is how best to integrate current provisions about the current duty to promote with the new provisions. That is what we are debating now-a technical issue. We are not talking about creating and imposing a new duty on school governors. The duty has existed for some time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The duties are there, but I am worried about the power conferred on the Secretary of State to determine whether the duties were being performed adequately. According to the Minister, new section 71(2) is about allowing the Government to set various targets or objectives for different parts of the public sector. However, it could also be read as permitting central Government to criticise local authorities for failing to carry out their duties adequately and to prescribe the objectives that must be followed. The Secretary of State effectively has the power to write the plan for an individual agency or arm of the public sector and to specify in great detail exactly how it must carry out its responsibilities. I acknowledge that the Minister said that that was not the Government's intention and that a much more light touch was preferred. It remains the case that the proposed new section opens the door to an extremely prescriptive approach.

<P>
It is unclear from the wording exactly how Parliament will be involved in the order-making process. Section 74 of the Race Relations Act 1976 provides for negative procedure in connection with orders made-with a few exceptions-under that Act. Will the Minister explain whether that procedure will also apply in respect of orders made by the Secretary of State under new clause 7 and whether Parliament will be involved in amending the schedule that lists the organisations that are subject to the new duty? Or will that remain an executive decision for Ministers without recourse to Parliament?

<P>
Finally, let me say a few words about the Commission for Racial Equality. Whether the new provisions are beneficial in practice will depend enormously on the CRE's ability to approach its duties with good judgment. Much of the commission's work has been beneficial, although that side never gets into the newspapers, but every member of the Committee will know that the commission has sometimes been accused of acting in a heavy-handed and overbearing manner. Some complaints have emanated from individual commissioners about the competence of the commission's own management and its approach to the duties conferred on it by Parliament.

<P>
The CRE's new chairman is about to take up office this month. It is crucial that he and the commission take seriously the Minister's words on the importance of implementing the legislation in a proportionate way. The diverse nature of public authorities in this country must be respected. If we simply impose additional burdens on the public sector, we shall distract managers and professionals from their primary responsibility to deliver services to the people whom they exist to serve. If the legislation is branded as an example of overweening political correctness, it will not help the mainstreaming of racial equality or improve community relations in this country. I want the Bill to improve race relations, just as the Government hope that it will.

<P>
I remember having a conversation with the outgoing chairman of the CRE, Sir Herman Ouseley, in which he told me that his ambition in life would have been achieved when the Commission for Racial Equality was no longer necessary because equality of opportunity was a reality and it came as no surprise or shock to anybody when British citizens of Asian, Afro-Caribbean or other ethnic minority origin achieved great things in the private and public sector, and in the professions. My party supports that objective. I have expressed scepticism about some aspects of the amendment, but I hope that the Government are proved right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall respond to the Minister's intervention. First, he was right to say that there is considerable freedom, not least in the definition, which is the key part of the proposal. For the positive duty, I heard warm potential support-or at least not opposition to it-from the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington). I understand his desire to see how it works out, and his hope that it works out for the best.

<P>
I acknowledge the fact that the Government have established some processes for investigating evaluation by indices and other methods for monitoring and regulating public authorities. I am happy to await that general assessment, and I take the point that one can be over-prescriptive with different formulae and different attention for each individual. The Minister gave the example of primary schools, which are obviously self-governing to a degree. We need a system that works without over-providing and allows both reference and self-regulation.

<P>
Proposed section 71(2) gives the Secretary of State the power to impose by order appropriate duties to secure best performance. Is that provision formulated correctly? As I understand it, it is not a par with the Northern Ireland legislation or with other Acts. I do not need an answer now, but perhaps the Minister and his officials could examine that. If there are duties on racial equality and its promotion elsewhere in the United Kingdom-we had a similar provision included in the Greater London Authority Act 1999-the UK-wide legislation should parallel them.

<P>
Secondly, the Minister dealt only generally with the exemption for the immigration and nationality directorate. I will not force votes at this stage, but the Government should be aware that, although we all understand that specific circumstances govern the working of the directorate and require it to deal with different people in different ways, excluding the directorate from the duty to promote good race relations and to eliminate unlawful discrimination might be throwing the baby out with the bath water, to use the clich. Many IND activities, such as decisions about internal staffing and management, need to be governed by the duty.

<P>
I am willing to be persuaded that the Home Office, all its employees and all its agencies are bound by the duty to promote good race relations, as that would cover the IND for the extent to which it is not exempted. If that is the case, Ministers should examine the definition of what is excluded-even by their light, which would exclude more than we would. There should not be a blanket avoidance of obligation to consider equality of opportunity when nationality is not an issue.

<P>
Does the Minister want to intervene?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I will deal with the matter generally.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I shall try to respond to what he said on the subsidiary point, because I was inadvertently concentrating more on the compliance notice.

<P>
Thirdly, the provision relating to the enforcement of compliance notices in proposed section 71E(4) in new clause 7 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The sanctions in section 71D and this section shall be the only sanctions for breach of any duty imposed by an order under section 71(2), but without prejudice to the enforcement under section 57 or otherwise of any other provision of this Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Would proposed section 71E(4), as drafted, preclude a racial equality council or a faith group, for example, taking a matter to court under the European convention or to judicial review? It appears that it would. As such action is not excluded under compliance notice procedures elsewhere, it should not be precluded under the Bill. If my assumption is right, the Minister should reconsider the new schedule, which should not preclude people's access to the courts. The matter is difficult because the proposal might be in conflict with the statement on the front page of the Bill that it complies with the European convention. I am not seeking a final view; I merely give an interpretation of the drafting. The three matters that I have mentioned remain as difficulties between us.

<P>
Liberal Democrats and Conservatives accept that it may be better not to impose on Government the duty to make the pronouncements in proposed section 71(2), namely, setting out the way in which they will implement them. It would be helpful, therefore, if the Minister would say when he expects the internal assessments to be concluded. If the measure is to have general support, those who are affected should know when they are expected to comply with the proposal. A measure that we agree to, but whose implementation provisions have no target date, expected enforcement date and so on lacks a motivating force. If we really want to bring about a change of culture in the public authorities, it would be helpful to know the completion date. It would be helpful to have a one-for-all inclusion, a date by which as much of the Act as possible comes into force, to avoid the piecemeal implementation of bits and pieces of it. People would then understand that they were expected to comply with the law from the date on which the Bill was enacted.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We have had a good and useful debate; it has taken time, but we may be able to make progress more quickly now. The Bill is one of the most important measures involving my Department, and I thank the officials, the lawyers and especially the person who led the team for their complex and difficult work in preparing the provision. I place on record the Government's thanks to them for their hard work.

<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury said that he would wait and see. I had hoped for a warmer welcome for the proposal, and a little more than that lukewarm comment. I note that the hon. Gentleman was sceptical about legislation changing culture, despite the record of the 23 or 24 years since the enactment of the Race Relations Act 1976, which has undeniably changed the culture. Legislation is necessary to take a lead in changing culture and attitudes; things that might have been acceptable in public discourse in 1975 are not acceptable today. Some would wish to change that, but I hope that it will not be changed.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury talked about not distracting managers from their primary responsibility to deliver services to the people whom they serve. That is what the proposal is about; they serve ethnic minorities in the same way as they serve other citizens. The hon. Gentleman must accept that mainstreaming requires that we keep at the core of our thinking how those who receive services will receive them equally, in a way that is fair and responds to their needs. The hon. Gentleman is concerned that there should be no overweaning political correctness. Treating people with respect, ensuring that they receive a proper service for the taxes that they pay even if they are of the ethnic minorities is not about political correctness, but about ensuring fairness and equality in our society.

<P>
The tone of the hon. Gentleman's comments was not quite right. He made a good closing speech on Second Reading, in contrast to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), and he got the tone right on that occasion. Today, he seemed a little uncomfortable with equality, but perhaps that is because Tories are often a little uncomfortable with equality. I accept that the hon. Gentleman, at least, has come a long way on these issue; I would not have been as charitable to other members of the Conservative Front-Bench team.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister's end-of-term report on performance.

<P>
To make it clear, and for the avoidance of doubt, I agree wholly with what the Minister said about the obligation of public sector organisations to deliver services to people, whatever their background. The risk is that, when a measure is introduced and targets and codes are laid down centrally in Whitehall, the organisations concerned might try to meet the targets and the centralised rule book's requirements rather than considering their individual clients or customers, the people in their local community whom they look after. That is my worry.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We want to ensure that all members of the local community receive the services that they need and that race equality issues are taken into consideration in ensuring the effective delivery of those services. It is possible that the hon. Gentleman wills the end but is reluctant fully to endorse the means, but no doubt he is speaking for his party.

<P>
This has been a friendly Committee, so I shall move on to specific matters. Local authorities, and schools, have had a duty to promote for some time. It has not caused them any great difficulty. However, we want to ensure that best practice is followed throughout. Some public authorities do that with great skill. We also want to non-engage in micro-managing how that duty is undertaken. It is all about listening to the various public authorities covered by the duty to ensure that they practise flexibility and proportionality in the provision of services. We want to ensure also that Ministers do not become too involved in the detail of how things are done. To that end, the process of making orders will not be over-prescriptive, although we will want to ensure that results are achieved.

<P>
The order-making power under section 74, about which the hon. Member for Aylesbury asked, applies at present to all codes under the Race Relations Act 1976, and will apply to any code made under the new clause. Amending the schedule by order will also be dealt with through the same provisions. Ministers will not be able to add by edict. Public authorities will have to go through the negative resolution procedure in much the same way as they do with other codes under the 1976 Act.

<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey for the tone of his comments and for his warm endorsement of the principles that we share. I shall reflect on what he said about proposed section 71E(4), although I think that we are all right with it. The immigration and nationality functions of the immigration and nationality department will be covered by the general duty insofar as it pertains to eliminating unlawful discrimination and promoting race relations between differing racial groups. The exemption in proposed section 19C protects only acts of discrimination required by specific immigration and nationality legislation, or those authorised by Ministers. Other acts of discrimination by immigration staff would be unlawful under the Bill and the Government would take firm action to eliminate acts of such discrimination. In addition, the duty to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and promote equality of opportunity would apply fully to the Home Office as an employer.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked whether a person has to go through the Commission for Racial Equality to enforce the duty. The answer is no. Nothing in the Government's amendments prevents a person from seeking judicial review in respect of the general duty to promote race equality. Specific enforcement arrangements are provided in respect of specific duties imposed on public authorities. I have explained that these involve the CRE having new powers to issue compliance notices and obtain court orders. That regime of compliance notices and orders will be restricted to the CRE, but there will still be a general statutory duty which a person may seek to enforce by way of judicial review in the usual way. The hon. Gentleman was concerned that the wording of the clause might interfere with that. I shall look again at the provision.

<P>
What the Government are doing with the Bill is important. I hope that it will ensure that in the longer term the work of the Committee which, by and large, has been undertaken in a friendly and constructive way, will result in something positive which will help to create and promote a successful multiracial society in this country.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I thank the Minister for his comments. Like him, I shall reflect on the matters that are between us. I am grateful for his considered response to the issues that he will take away to reconsider. It is important that we achieve maximum agreement. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 56.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> These are technical amendments. Schedule 2 inserts into the Race Relations Act 1976 the definition of ``criminal proceedings''. This is needed for the provisions of the proposed section 19D in the Bill in relation to decisions not to prosecute and for the provisions in clause 4 which provide safeguards for criminal proceedings. The current definition of ``criminal proceedings'' in schedule 2 includes, by reference, military proceedings. The amendments adjust the reference to military proceedings to take account of proceedings on summary dealing and proceedings before a summary appeal court which are to be introduced into the Armed Forces Discipline Bill which is currently awaiting Royal Assent.

<P>
Question proposed, That the schedule, as amended, be the Second schedule to the Bill.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I want to raise a matter that may not be quite as uncontroversial as some. It arises through some of the pronouncements from people in the Conservative party in recent times that schedule 2 will, by the time that we have finished our deliberations, include the positive duty to promote racial equality and will have amended various Acts as set out in schedule 2, including the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. I am conscious that the Bill, by its long title, will achieve the extension to public authorities generally of the Race Relations Act 1976. We have debated the importance of public authorities acting in a way that promotes race equality.

<P>
The Bill will simply ensure that the way in which we treat people of different race in our community is changed where it has been adverse and unhelpful. Our debates will therefore be conducted positively. But how do we ensure that we do not leave currently a large legislative gap in provision? We are all aware that we can have the best-governed public service but there is no obligation on political parties.

<P>
There are two possible vehicles for such a change. One would be an amendment to legislation such as the Bill-in this case, we could amend schedule 2, although there are other places where an amendment could be made, The other possibility would be to amend Neill-type legislation, which governs elections and referendums. As colleagues will be aware, I have been here long enough to know that the behaviour of political parties-I am not saying that my own has not been included historically-sometimes offends people. They sometimes use words and actions that clearly undo much of what the Bill seeks to do.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I raise that issue now because, last year, during the passage of the Immigration and Asylum Bill-I was not looking after home affairs them-party leaders signed a declaration. My party leader has changed since then, but my then leader, the Prime Minister, the leader of the Conservative party and the leaders of the two nationalist parties signed. The declaration specifically included the following undertaking
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to publish, cause to be published, or in any way endorse any material which incites hostility or division between people of different racial, national or religious groups, or which might reasonably be expected to stir up or incite such hostility or division.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There was a second undertaking
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ensure that in any dealings with the public no words or actions are used which may stir up racial or religious hatred, or lead to prejudice on grounds of race, nationality or religion.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
A complaint has been made publicly, outside the House, to the effect that it is not only language that is being misused: facts are being misrepresented, and misleading or untrue facts have been propounded. That could clearly have the effect cited in the declaration. My colleagues and I would like there to be a mechanism whereby such complaints could be taken somewhere and adjudicated on. To the extent that the current remedy can be invoked, it is helpful. It involves going to the bodies that drew up the document-the Refugee Council, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the CRE-to ask them to remind parties of their obligations. They have done that, and the Government responded positively, for which I am grateful. The Conservative party has not responded, and I am not grateful for the fact that its leadership, at least, continues to speak in the same terms. Could the Government therefore think about-I am trying to do this as quietly and gently as possible-a way of referring complaints somewhere where there is a power to adjudicate, whether through the Bill or other legislation?

<P>
I have one PS. I understand that it would not be possible to regulate every word that was uttered and every document that was issued by every political party in the hurly-burly of political life. However, when it comes to the manifesto for a local election and to posters, television broadcasts and official speeches that are press-released, there are ways of ensuring that there is regulation. I say that not to inhibit freedom of speech-that is always the allegation that is thrown back-but to ensure that the declarations to which people sign up are worth something. I want to ensure that political parties do not ignore the policies that we impose on public authorities.

<P>
I should be grateful if Ministers would reflect on whether, having put the Bill on the statute book and applied the new positive duties in relation to the Acts in the schedule-including the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and the Race Relations Act-it would be anomalous not to apply the same provisions to political parties in their most formal, public and visible pronouncements. We have been ill served by announcements that have been made and which are still being made. We shall not achieve the ends that we want for as long as that continues, and the sooner we do something about that, the better.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am sorely tempted to indulge in a reprise of the debate that we had on the Floor of the House a couple of weeks ago about asylum policy, but I want to avoid your strictures, Mr. Sayeed, and to maintain the character of the Committee's proceedings, which, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, have largely been good-humoured up to now.

<P>
I simply want to place on the record the fact that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, in his recent speech on asylum policy, was giving voice to the genuine concerns of many of our fellow citizens. Neither he nor my party has anything to apologise for as regards his words on that occasion.

<P>
The proposal towards which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey appeared to be moving is extremely dangerous. If the day ever came when democratically elected politicians in this country felt that they could not speak out on a subject and articulate the views of the people that they represented, the electorate would be encouraged to abandon any faith in the democratic system.

<P>
I do not concede the hon. Gentleman's criticisms of my party, but there is a central issue of principle, which goes beyond the argument that he and I have over my right hon. Friend's speech and the present issue. Clearly, there must be restraints in law on the absolute freedom of speech, and we find those in defences against slander and defamation and in laws against incitement to racial hatred. However, I would strongly argue that the law and the political system should always carry a presumption in favour of freedom of speech and not impose inhibitions or restrictions.

<P>
Many years ago, when I was a student, I opposed policies that sought to deny a platform to people because they could be branded as racist or fascist. Some of the people whom it was proposed to ban had views that I held in absolute contempt and horror, but I believed then and I believe now that such views are best challenged in open debate and exposed as hollow and worthless in an open and democratic forum. We should not move towards the suppression of freedom of political expression.

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Politicians have freedom of speech, but abstinence from abusing it is important. We live in a society where there is great concern about racial discrimination. Yesterday, in Birmingham, a man was set alight. A few weeks ago someone was stabbed there. We have had a series of racial attacks. We have ethnic minorities, some of whom are in increasing fear. Given all that, abstinence from abuse of the freedom of speech by party political leaders is important. They must not use provocative language that might lead racist people with a propensity to violence to believe that their views and behaviour are supported by political leaders. The debate on asylum must be conducted sensitively and reasonably.

<P>
There is a clear difficulty with the asylum system that we inherited. We are seeking to deal with it. I do not want to go into that debate now, but the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spoke about the tone of the debate as it affects race issues. It is important that we get that tone right. That is why the various Church leaders and the Refugee Council decided to approach the party leaders; I knew that they were going to do so and I discussed it with them. They got an endorsement of a proposition that the language to be used to discuss asylum should be such that it could not reasonably be considered to encourage racial disharmony.

<P>
I do not want to go into the detail of what has been said, but many of us are concerned about the tone of some of this debate. We have seen this happen in a number of countries in Europe and it is happening in an African country at the moment. A politician in trouble has used provocative language about farm redistribution to seek to get votes by targeting a particular ethnic minority. He claims that racism is not part of his agenda. He seeks to secure electoral advantage by encouraging the majority ethnic group in that country to take a view about minority farmers. That approach is cynical, opportunist and contemptible.

<P>
We would not want to see any politician in trouble in this country using provocative language to encourage people to think that they should vote for him because he articulated the views of that small minority of people in this country who hold racist views. A politician who took that view might get some publicity and the support of some tabloids, but the electoral advantage that he sought to secure would be illusory. The country has moved on so much in the past 25 years. His comments would be recognised as being cynical, contemptible and opportunist. Playing the race card in Britain should be held in contempt.

<P>
The Bill and the schedule create a new mood in Government, in public services and, indeed, in this country. The country must recognise that it is a multiracial country and that it fails or succeeds as such. The tone of our debate is therefore enormously important. Those who use provocative words and seize on short-term advantages that may do long-term damage are not contributing to the success of our country. I do not want to get into the particulars of any debate, but it is important that we get the tone right. I hope that the tone of the debate will improve, partly as a result of this Bill, and that all of us, of all political parties, can show that we will play our part in making this country a success at being what it is-a multiracial country.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand that the hon. Member for Aylesbury will defend his leader's position. I have been encouraged by his attitude and tone and the support that he has given to the general propositions that this Bill and schedules like the one before us seek to advance. The Minister's speech set out clearly the right way forward; it was worthy of him. I hope that it is read widely. I hope that his comments and mine will be heeded by Tory Members more clearly in future.

<P>
I will not press the Minister in detail now, but I should be grateful if he would give considered reflection to this issue. I raised it because we are seeking to raise the standards in our public service and if we do not simultaneously raise the standards in our political service our failings, such as the attack in Birmingham yesterday, will be clear for all to see. As someone who represents a multiracial constituency, I have no doubt that the more people raise the stakes about racial problems, the more it incites some people to react adversely and sometimes violently. There is a link, although it is not direct or immediate and it is not necessarily measurable. In the end, it does nobody any good to go down that road.

<P>
I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the matter. I hope that we can return to it on Report, if appropriate, or elsewhere. If we sought to look at the political parties in the context of a Bill such as this, I should be grateful for the Minister's guidance on where that would fit best, given all the other pieces of legislation.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There is a different between racist and other politicians. Every politician seeks to promote a particular concept but seeks to do it in an inclusive way. The Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, the Labour party and, indeed, most of the parties from the right to the far left, seek to convert others to be included in a project for the future of their country. Racists are different because they seek to exclude a certain proportion of the population from that project. Their project includes only those belonging to a certain racial category and excludes all others. That makes them very different.

<P>
The argument that racists and racist politics should be treated differently has some foundation, but we should be cautious about going as far as having some sort of oversight that would regulate the freedom of speech of the leaders of political parties. We have laws that prevent the incitement of racial hatred and the most extreme language that urges violence. However, we allow a great deal of freedom of debate in this society. It is right that we have that freedom, but politicians, in exercising that freedom, must abstain from abusing it, as I said at the start. My worry is that some people may have gone close to the edge of what is legitimate and proper debate. Whether that line has been crossed is a matter for each of us to determine ourselves. Once the local government elections are over, the tone of the debate will no doubt improve. The heat can be taken out of the situation, and perhaps a more sensible, rational, less emotive discourse, with less provocative language, will take place.

<P>
I hear what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey says about political service. I am not sure whether it is possible to have a regulator of political leaders' comments. It would certainly be difficult in this place for anyone other than the Speaker to regulate what hon. Members say. It is a matter for the House to regulate that and inform hon. Members either to speak alone or to try to command the support of the House.

<P>
We have already seen the difficulties of regulating political parties. Regulation is possible in relation to finances and organisation, but it is much more difficult in relation to the tone of debate that should be undertaken. However, our society is changing, which will regulate that far more effectively. Whatever people's short-term emotions are, they know in the long term that this society must succeed. They will not thank politicians who seek short-term advantage but cause long-term pain, because that pain will be felt by all of us and our children.

This, too, is a technical amendment that will amend the extent provision of the Bill. As it originally stood, its extent to Northern Ireland was limited.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move, That the clause
 be read a Second time.

<P>
This is a straightforward, one-issue clause. When the Human Rights Act 1998 went through Parliament, it was proposed that Acts of Parliament should have printed on the front page a certification of compliance with the Human Rights Act 1998, as we can see on the Bill. The new clause is a probing amendment, which proposes that Ministers should make a similar statement on future Acts, saying that they are compatible with the Race Relations Act 1976 as amended by the Bill.

<P>
I pray in aid the fact that we increasingly seek to give parliamentarians various information about compliance. We tell them about a Bill's financial and manpower implications. There would be a logic-not necessarily the only logic-in ensuring that Bills were seen to be compliant with race relations legislation. I believe that the general practice in local government-as far as I know, it applies in local councils in all parts of the United Kingdom-is that when officers write reports to members, they include a declaration on any policy implications for equal opportunities. Certainly, my local authority includes such a declaration on all its papers, which applies to disability as well as to race and gender. There is always such a certification on paperwork dealt with by members. I do not pretend that that is the perfect formula, but one might argue that colleagues should know that someone has gone through the process and checked that, in the opinion of those who advise the Government, the Bill passes the test. That is the basic of the new clause.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> This is an interesting and probing new clause. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey rightly emphasised the certification of compatibility with the Human Rights Act 1998, so I need not remind the Committee of that. However, the Race Relations Act 1976 operates in a different way. I refer the hon. Gentleman to section 41 of the 1976 Act, which recognises that Ministers need to retain the flexibility occasionally to introduce discriminatory legislation. Indeed, that theme has run through the Committee's discussions. The hon. Gentleman believes that we have not gone far enough, but section 41 enables Ministers under order to make policies that appear to be discriminatory, and the new clause is incompatible with that Act.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister is right, except that subsection (1)(b) provides for that. Although I did not mention it in my little speech, that subsection would allow for a declaration to be made, either to the effect that the provisions comply or that they do not comply, and to give the reason why.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I accept that but, even so, following amendments to the Bill made earlier in our proceedings to ensure the promotion of racial equality and good practice, the legislation places an obligation on Ministers to mainstream policies. Indeed, mainstreaming policies was the essence of the hon. Gentleman's remarks about local government. It is a long time since I was involved in local government, but I remember the days when a paragraph was included at the end of committee reports to put in place equal opportunities provisions, which gave the committee an assurance. However, now that there is a duty to promote equal opportunities across the whole range of services, the new clause is unnecessary. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will want to reflect on the matter, and he said that we might return to the issue at a later date.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I seek an undertaking from the Minister that he, too, will reflect on the matter. He might have good reasons for his opinion, but perhaps there will be an opportunity to consider whether such a proposal would be appropriate in relation to other legislation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Of course, one of the Committee's themes has been that we are keen to work together to make progress. While we consider the issue, the Liberal Democrats could reflect on the duty to promote. I suspect that the new clause was tabled before we tabled our new clause on a duty to promote. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider my explanation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister knows that Liberal Democrats are the model of co-operation and collaboration. I understand that the Government's decision to include a duty to promote good race relations changes the picture. On a technical point the new clause was not tabled before the Government's new clause. We did not ignore the fact that the Government had tabled a new clause. However, as we are happy for the Minister to reconsider the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>New Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>CRE powers to assist complainants under the Human Rights Act 1998<p8>`.-(1) Section 66 of the Race Relations Act 1976 (Assistance by Commission) is amended as follows.</center></H4>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) After subsection 66(1) there is added-

<P>
``(1A) Subsection (1) shall also apply to proceedings or prospective proceedings under the Human Rights Act 1998 in which the complaint or claim includes or will include discrimination on racial grounds by a public authority.''.'.-[Mr. Simon Hughes.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move, That the clause
 be read a Second time.

<P>
The new clause is designed to give the Commission for Racial Equality the power to assist complainants under the terms of the Human Rights Act 1998. I have been mildly rebuked by my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine for not giving the Committee the opportunity to vote, thus losing the chance of having an overwhelming victory. It is possible that that might still happen. It would be inappropriate for the Committee's last debate on the Bill not to be initiated by Liberal Democrat Members because we also initiated the first debate. It is, however, a consolation that we are coming to an end.

<P>
A constituent came to see me, not for the first time, at my surgery on Saturday to ask me to help him persuade the Commission for Racial Equality to support his complaint of alleged discrimination against the Home Office, for which he previously worked. He also wanted assistance from the legal aid fund. People come to us to obtain formal backing by the relevant statutory body in pursuit of such cases. The CRE, the Equal Opportunities Commission and other bodies have taken many cases through the courts. They have acted as an individual's banker, adviser and friend and have provided encouragement and support to proceed with a case. The new clause would confer statutory authority on the CRE to offer advice and assistance to individuals who want to pursue a complaint of racial discrimination under the Human Rights Act. It has that power in relation to other legislation.

<P>
The main purpose of the Bill is to prohibit racial discrimination by public authorities that perform functions in relation to law enforcement, criminal justice and immigration control that are not specified in the Race Relations Act. It would be logical to give the CRE the same power to assist in relation to the Human Rights Act. There are likely to be challenges at law, but we hope that those will be few rather than many. If a public authority discriminates on racial grounds, that might be illegal under the Race Relations Act, the European convention on human rights and, therefore, the Human Rights Act. The new clause seeks to bring those rights on to the same footing and to allow proper assistance to be provided.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> We are moving towards the end of our work, so I hope that it will not be necessary to press the new clause to a Division. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has tabled an interesting proposal. Although I suspect that its day has not yet come, I believe that it may come in future. The hon. Gentleman will recall our discussions of the establishment of a Joint Committee to consider the Human Rights Act 1998. He asked about our thinking on that subject. Draft standing orders are currently being formulated, and we firmly intend to have the Committee up and running before the Act comes into force on 2 October. The Government expect that the Joint Committee will want to consider early on whether a human rights commission is necessary. I know that that issue is of some concern.

<P>
The Government have committed themselves to considering whether the Disability Rights Commission should have power to assist individuals in bringing proceedings under the Human Rights Act 1998, and it is important for the Joint Committee to consider the need for a human rights commission. The Government have said that they want the Joint Committee to consider the Disability Rights Commission in this context, and we have no objection in principle to the commission taking similar powers to those that we advocate in relation to the CRE. If we have given that commitment in terms of disability, the appropriate time to consider the new clause is in relation to the human rights commission and the Joint Committee.

<P>
The new clause is interesting and may be before its time, so I suspect that we shall return to the issues that it raises. In that spirit of co-operation, which has prevailed from the beginning to the end of our deliberations, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister's words are beguiling. The pill has been sweetened by his commitment, which is more developed and slightly firmer than that which his colleague gave before the Easter recess. I welcome that progress, as it is logical and helpful that the Joint Committee should be in place by the end of the current Session and, therefore, before the relevant date. The Government could simply have accepted the new clause, but I understand that there is some logic in using a common method of assisting people making complaints under human rights legislation, as such an approach can apply to disability rights and other similar rights. Although it will take a little time to negotiate the parliamentary procedures needed to establish the Joint Committee, it is possible to do so. That is an appealing prospect, and I had not expected that bat to come from Nottinghamshire to my Glamorgan bowl-I could call it a Glamorgan and Surrey mix, although that is a little confusing. In the spirit of co-operation and collaboration, and in the belief that we will make some progress on the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> On behalf of the Committee, I thank both you, Mr. Sayeed, and your colleague, Mr. O'Hara, for the firmness and fairness with which you have run the Committee. To be truthful, you have not had that difficult a job-the Committee has been broadly constructive and the exchanges have been by and large good-natured.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, has throughout been constructive and considered in his comments, and has broadly supported the thrust of the Bill. The hon. Member for Aylesbury, who speaks for the Conservatives, has been probing and often thoughtful in his approach. I hope that we shall see much more warm-hearted support for the Bill on Report.

<P>
I thank my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office, who has carried much of the burden of the clauses. I thank him for his support and for the way in which he has been able to deal with the clauses and master a brief. He took the task on at somewhat short notice but handled it with great skill. I thank my other colleagues on the Committee and, in particular, my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) for ensuring that Government Members were kept here, kept in order and kept in support of the Bill. They all support it and, if they did not support, my hon. Friend would ensure that they did. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) for acting as parliamentary private secretary during the Committee.

<P>
Thanks, too, to the officials from the Home Office and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for their contribution. One of the officials came to lead the Bill team and has done an enormously important piece of work in developing the Bill and the way in which it will, I hope, make a substantial and important change to race equality. Ministers are responsible for the faults, such as they are, in the Bill; the officials are responsible for the good parts. I hope that we are able to report the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I add my thanks to you, Mr. Sayeed, and to Mr. O'Hara for the way in which you have chaired the Committee. I thank our Clerk, the Hansard staff, the police and the Doorkeepers for their work on our behalf. Like the Minister, I believe that the series of debates has been good-humoured and constructive. We have disagreed from time to time about the detail of the measures proposed but, despite those disagreements, we have spoken from our different party perspectives with a common objective in mind. The objective has been to secure improvements in community relations between the different ethnic groups that make up our nation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> First, I thank you, Mr. Sayeed. The Committee has been an easy first sortie for a person joining the Chairmen's Panel. We have been glad to have had you chairing us; we thank Mr. O'Hara as well. Secondly, like other colleagues, I would like to thank our Clerk, the Hansard staff and others who have, as always, been helpful both inside and outside the Committee. I also thank the police on duty. Thirdly, I join the Minister in thanking his team. I wish that they were my team, but I will have to wait a little longer for that. Civil servants who do their job well are important; they are public servants for all of us at the end of the day. On such a Bill, it is important that they feel committed.

<P>
If we measured the person hours put in by Liberal Democrat Members and those put in by Tory Members, the Liberal Democrats would be shooting past the Tories in terms of Opposition performance. That is just a sign of things to come-on Thursday, hopefully, although we will have to see about that.

<P>
The serried ranks of Labour Back Benchers have not been notable for the great level of their intervention and participation. That could mean all sorts of things; I leave it to others to interpret. We are grateful for the supporting role of the Parliamentary Secretary and for the help of the hon. Member for Islwyn. We are glad that a good piece of legislation has been improved as a result of our work in Committee. It might be even further improved on Report.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On behalf of Mr. O'Hara and I, I thank the Committee for making our life easy.
