							<a name="07070354000495"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forthe Home Department
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Good afternoon,
Mr. Benton. Welcome back to the Committee. You will notice
that there is a bit of a change of membership, but we shall still be
proceeding in good heart and with good
debate.</div>
					<a name="07070354000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to turn
to the point made by the hon. Member for Hornchurch in response to my
formally moving the various Government amendments. He referred to what
the applicant authorities will give consideration to when deciding
whether it is in the public interest to make an application for the
winding up of a body. To put the matter in context, I wish to emphasise
the two-part nature of the winding-up process&#151;as the hon.
Gentleman did. When an organisation has been convicted of the offence
of a breach of an order, the applicant authority will consider whether
it is in the public interest to petition the court to have it wound up.
It is then up to the court to consider separately whether it is also
just and equitable for the organisation to be so wound up. I did not
mean to refer to the director of the applicant authority this morning.
I apologise.</div>
					<a name="07070354000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the clause is to deal with instances, even though they might
be few, when an organisation is being used effectively as a shell or
front for serious criminal activity, is producing or doing little or
nothing of worth and is being used to cause harm through serious crime.
The applicant authorities will be considering that when looking at the
public interest and, effectively, whether the organisation is still a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>legitimate concern and working towards a legitimate legal end or whether
it is simply a vehicle for criminal
purposes.</div>
					<a name="07070354000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I made
clear, when the latter is the case, it will still be for the courts to
make a separate determination whether it would also be just and
equitable for the organisation to be wound up. That will include a
consideration of what effect the winding-up will have on third parties,
such as the customers or creditors of the organisation. We believe that
it is an effective sanction with adequate protections in place to
ensure that it occurs only when
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07070354000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
amendments are technical and would improve the Bill and, now that I
have answered the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific points, I hope that
the Committee will support
them.</div>

							<a name="07070354000496"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> In asking the Committee to support the clause, I
hope that it will be helpful if I respond to the hon. Member for
Hornchurch who asked, in reference to &#147;a person&#148; under
clause 26, about orders against corporate bodies. I had promised to
return to that issue this
afternoon.</div>
					<a name="07070354000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a body
corporate is given a serious crime prevention order&#151;as set out
in clause 30 and other clauses&#151;it will be capable of being
prosecuted for breach if it does not comply with the terms of the
order. Therefore, the reference to &#147;a person&#148; under
clause 26 includes not only an individual, but a body corporate, a
partnership and an unincorporated
association.</div>
					<a name="07070354000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the hon. Gentleman was also interested in the position of officers or
employees of a company. For example, clause 32&#151;as does clauses
31&#151;provides that, if an offence under clause 26 is committed by
a body corporate, with the consent or connivance of an officer of the
body corporate or a person purporting to act in that capacity, the
officer as well as the body corporate is guilty of the offence under
clause 26 and is liable to be prosecuted. In that context,
&#147;officer&#148; means a director, manager, secretary or other
similar officer. There are similar provisions in relation to
partnerships and unincorporated associations in clause 31(8) and clause
32(7) respectively. I hope that that answers the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
question.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000498"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> There is a small technical point about
unincorporated associations. Again, this relates to the circumstances
where a serious crime prevention order has been taken out against an
unincorporated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>association. The clause makes it clear that actions
are to be brought in the name of the unincorporated association, rather
than any specific individuals. It also makes it clear that if there is
a fine attached to an offence, it should be paid out of the funds of
the association, rather than by any specific individual. The Minister
refers to the possibility of connivance having relation to the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07070354000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, an
unincorporated association, by its nature, is a group or a body of
individuals who make up that association. Its membership may change
from time to time. The Minister may not be able to answer this question
immediately, but a thought that crossed my mind in relation to fines is
that the Bill says that fines will be paid out of the association, but
if the association does not have such funds, in those circumstances
normally one would look in terms of individual liability that would
attach to the members. I know that there are specific provisions that
govern when someone is deemed to be a member, or when the membership
changes, which are contained in the earlier part of the clause, but I
seek clarification or assurance from the Minister as to whether the
situation has been envisaged where a fine has been levied but there are
insufficient assets from the unincorporated association to meet such a
liability, and what would happen in such
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07070354000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000499"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I reiterate that persons, or whoever is connected
with the unincorporated association, will be liable only if they have
conducted a conspiracy that did not meet the serious crime prevention
order conditions. That gives me the chance to stress that that would
not be so if someone were negligent. That is the important point.
Subsection (7) states:</div>
					<a name="07070354000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If an offence under
section 26 committed by an incorporated association is proved to have
been committed by the consent or connivance of an officer of the
association, he (as well as the association) is guilty of the offence
and liable to be proceeded against and punished
accordingly.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070354000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">What one
would have to look at in terms of the individuals who may have connived
or conspired to subvert, is whether it would be appropriate for them to
be held liable. That would be a decision for the court, and it would be
a matter of whether that would be reasonable or
not.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000500"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> To assist the Minister about the terms that I
was making, I entirely accept his point about the connivance argument.
I was looking at subsection (6), which deals with the fine
imposedon the association and what might happen in
circumstances where the funds of the association were not sufficient to
pay the fine if it was levied at a high level. I was seeking
clarification on that matter. I entirely accept the Minister&#146;s
point in relation to connivance.</div>

Brokenshire:
						</b> I fear that we may be going over some old
ground, but I hope that, at least, we will do so in a slightly
different way, rather than simply repeating some of the arguments that
have probably been rehearsed in great detail in relation to this issue,
which centres on whether the orders that are to be sought under the
Bill are of a civil nature or otherwise.</div>
					<a name="07070354000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 34(1)
states:</div>
					<a name="07070354000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Proceedings
before the High Court in relation to serious crime prevention orders
are civil
proceedings.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070354000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
obviously debated previously the issue of the standard and burden of
proof associated with these orders and reference has been made to the
McCann judgment as it applies to antisocial behaviour orders. In
particular, we debated whether the McCann judgment would operate in
relation to the orders that are envisaged under this Bill, and
therefore whether what has been termed the heightened civil standard
might apply.</div>
					<a name="07070354000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note
that the Minister and his colleagues have said that that is the
intention behind the drafting of the Bill&#151;that although it is
stated as being a civil order and although it is stated that the court
should apply a civil standard of proof in relation to serious crime
prevention orders, it is understood that, following the McCann
judgment, in essence a higher standard would, notwithstanding, still be
applied in accordance with the terms of that judgment.</div>
					<a name="07070354000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose that we come back to
some of the fundamental issues and also to trying to provide some sort
of certainty in relation to the Bill, to understand very clearly what
is intended. The judgment of Engel <i class="I">v.</i>
						<i class="I"> </i>The Netherlands
(No. 1) in the European Court of Human Rights effectively established
three standards to determine whether proceedings are regarded as
criminal for the purposes of the European convention. That judgment
said that there are effectively three tests: the domestic
classification, in other words what the domestic law classifies the
proceeding as; the nature of the offence, and finally the severity of
the potential penalty that the defendant risks incurring. The Engel
case was referred to in the leading judgment in the McCann case, when
it was suggested that the third factor&#151;in other words, the
severity of the potential penalty&#151;was the most important factor
in determining whether a matter was regarded as criminal.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>
					<a name="07070354000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are saying that a higher
standard is being applied in relation to ASBOs and one then looks at
the potential impact of orders under this Bill, I thinkthat it
is accepted&#151;even if there is a difference asto whether
such orders are a punishment or a prevention&#151;that they are
potentially very significant, in terms of their ambit, scope and
impact. Therefore, if the suggestion is that the potential penalty is
the relevant factor in deciding whether a matter is regarded as
criminal or not, I would submit that there is a very strong argument
for saying that this matter should be regarded as
criminal.</div>
					<a name="07070354000464"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07070354000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the context
of the McCann judgment and those relevant tests, for the sake of
certainty and clarity about the standards that we seek to adopt, it
would be better to include a measure in the Bill to make absolutely
clear the burden of proof and the expected standards. Although I note
what Ministers have said, there is still the potential for a legal
argument about whether McCann applies, and if so, the way in which it
applies in a given circumstance. The Bill is being introduced after the
McCann judgment, and we do so in conscience and knowledge of what we
are doing.</div>
					<a name="07070354000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Bill says that the proceedings are effectively civil proceedings, and
that as a consequence, the standard of proof that the court will apply
is the civil standard of proof, notwithstanding the McCann judgment, it
could be argued that, because of the decisions and wording in the Bill,
we as Parliament are consciously determining that the McCann judgment
should not apply. The Minister may say that that is not the intention,
but it is better to be clear in law about what we are talking about,
hence the reason for the amendment to clause 34 and the amendment to
clause 35, which would state that the proceedings should be treated as
criminal proceedings, and delete subsection (2) on the burden of
proof.</div>
					<a name="07070354000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
those arguments and issues have previously been debated differently,
but it is right and proper that we are as clear as possible about the
requirements for proof, particularly as a consequence of the potential
penalties that may arise. To use the words of my right hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, if it looks like a
duck, perhaps it is a duck. If that is the case, and we are considering
a criminal issue, let us put it in the Bill, so that the courts are
certain and we are certain about what we are
discussing.</div>
					<a name="07070354000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07070354000505"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): I rise to
support the amendments in my name, and to reinforce the speech that my
hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch made. It is worth considering
what the clauses say. Clause 34(1) says that the proceedings are
&#147;civil proceedings&#148;, not criminal proceedings. Subsection
(2) states that</div>
					<a name="07070354000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
standard of proof to be applied by the court in such proceedings is the
civil standard of
proof.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070354000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall pause at
that point. Anybody who comes to the Bill afresh, and without any
background knowledge at all, will conclude that clause 34 means what it
says, namely that for all purposes the proceedings are to be deemed
civil, and that the standard of proof is to be that of the civil court.
That is what it says.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>
					<a name="07070354000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is of course true that the
courts will approach the matter in the context of the McCann judgment,
which is the judgment of the House of Lords. However, let us begin by
reminding ourselves that the House of Lords determined that approach in
a particular fact-related case, namely McCann, and it construed an
ASBO, not a serious crime prevention order. It is possible&#151;it
may even be likely&#151;that the courts would apply to the serious
crime prevention orders the kind of reasoning that they applied to
ASBOs, but there is no certainty that they would. Why should we assume
that the courts will give to the phraseology in clause 34 a different
interpretation from that which appears in the Bill? There is no
certainty of that, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch makes a
very sound point. The courts will take into account the fact that
Parliament is acting against the background of knowledge of the McCann
case&#151;in fact they might assume that we are putting this clause
into the Bill so as to disapply the approach that was taken in relation
to that judgment.</div>
					<a name="07070354000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07070354000506"></a>
							<b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): Is not the
point&#151;perhaps this goes back to this morning&#146;s
debate&#151;that for this to be a criminal proceeding, a crime must
have taken place, and we must be considering a criminal case? In fact,
this is about a prevention order, so it must be a civil matter. Surely
I have not
misunderstood.</div>
					<a name="07070354000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000507"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Our primary concern is with the consequence of
stating that the matter is civil rather than criminal. Looking just at
the Bill and leavingaside McCann and the underlying judgments,
the consequence is that the standard of proof is different&#151;it is
the balance of probabilities, not beyond a reasonable doubt. Also,
although less so than before the Criminal Justice Act 2003,
fundamentally different rules are applied to hearsay and there are
other differences between the jurisdictions. Once we assert in the Bill
that it is a civil proceeding, if we do not apply McCann we have a
different standard of proof. That is what is objectionable having
regard to the severity and the onerous effect of the orders and
everything to do with renewal.</div>
					<a name="07070354000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07070354000508"></a>
							<b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Would my right hon.
and learned Friend agree that it is more complicated even than that?
Not only do we have the indication of the McCann judgment compared with
what the clause says, but there is also what the Minister has said
during our deliberations in Committee, namely that the standard of
proof should be almost identical to the criminal standard. There is an
extra layer of confusion, which we ought to resolve by changing the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07070354000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000509"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> That is true. Similar language was used in the other
place, where the Minister said &#147;virtually the same&#148;,
&#147;nearly the same&#148; and so on.</div>
					<a name="07070354000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another important point, which
has been made in this Committee before and which partly answers the
hon. Member for Colne Valley, is that we need to look at paragraph 3.4
on page 32 of the Green Paper, which was published after the McCann
judgment. It says:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>
					<a name="07070354000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We believe
these...standards usefully reflect the different levels of threat
posed to society by terrorism and anti-social behaviour. In the case of
organised crime, the potential harms are somewhere between, and we
would envisage stating on the face of the legislation that to impose an
order the courts should be satisfied on the balance of probability that
the test is
met.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070354000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
pause there; this is very important. We appear to be putting in the
Bill precisely what the Government say in page 32 of the Green Paper
that they want to put in. The motive for that is stated explicitly. It
is in order to impose a test and
that</div>
					<a name="07070354000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the courts should
be satisfied on the balance of
probability&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070354000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">that that
test is made. When the courts come to construe this, they will start by
looking at the language of the Bill. They will see that the burden of
proof is a civil burden; then they will ask, &#147;What about
McCann?&#148; They will then go&#151;or feel able to go&#151;to
the Green Paper, because it pointed, at least at one stage, to the
Government&#146;s intention.</div>
					<a name="07070354000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">They will see that the
Government have taken account of the McCann judgment and have decided
that they want to disapply it, and that they intend to do so in the
Bill. Lo and behold, there is language in the Bill that purports to
have that effect. I should have thought that the courts would be very
constrained not to hold that the standard of proof was that
requiredin the ordinary civil case, namely the balance of
probability.</div>
					<a name="07070354000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000510"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I have often been asked by the right hon. and
learned Gentleman to read things into the record because, he says, that
is extremely importantin terms of how the courts will
interpret the Government&#146;s intentions behind legislation. The
right hon. and learned Gentleman has heard me say on numerous
occasions&#151;Baroness Scotland said this in the House of Lords as
well&#151;that we expect the civil standard of proof required under
clause 1(1)(a) to be as close as to be virtually identical to the
criminal standard of proof; in other words, beyond reasonable doubt. We
have said that the McCann judgment will be applied on a sliding scale;
the standard here will be &#147;beyond reasonable doubt&#148;, but
in other parts of the Bill, it might be &#147;on the balance of
probability&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070354000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000511"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I have no doubt that, when appropriate, the courts
will listen carefully to what the Minister has said. It is important,
however, to keep in mind that the courts, as a general rule, look only
to the words of Ministers when there is ambiguity in the language of
the statute, but it is far from clear that there is ambiguity in the
language of the statute before us; the language is clear and the
statute is being enacted post-McCann. In other words, it could well be
argued that we are seeking explicitly to depart from the consequences
of McCann. That was the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Hornchurch. I think that he is
right.</div>
					<a name="07070354000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise the
alternative argument: the concept of the civil standard of proof being
applied on a sliding scale to such cases approaching criminal ones.
However, that arises, first, if the court thinks that the language is
not plain, and secondly, if it thinks that the principles set out in
McCann apply to a different class, but not wholly dissimilar kind of
order. We are making some assumptions about that. That takes me to the
real 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>point on which I want to focus. Given that the Minister&#146;s
purpose, as I understand it, is to depart from the language of the
Green Paper and to assert the criminal standard, why on earth are we
not saying so? I come back, time and time again, to my underlining
theme&#151;I am sorry if I am being a bore&#151;that it is the
business of Parliament, of which this Committee is a part, to state
what it intends. If it intends to protect the citizen, it should say so
in terms and not leave a cloud of ambiguity and uncertainty hovering
around such matters. I ask the Committee to think
again.</div>
					<a name="07070354000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally,
if I had had the opportunity, I would have made this point during the
Prime Minister&#146;s statement: if we are giving authority to
Parliament over the Executive, it is all well and good, but actually
none of his proposals will be of much relevance, unless or until
Members of this House begin to assert their independence from their own
Whips Offices. I did that years
ago!</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Geoffrey Cox</b> (Torridge and West Devon) (Con): It is in the
spirit of asserting my independence as a Back Bencher that I disagree,
with diffidence, with my right hon. and learned Friend. The Minister
will no doubt tell us that the courts are likely to apply a higher
standard of probability to the findings of fact in fraud or criminal
cases, for example. I concede that almost certainly that will be the
case. Under the common law, the courts have long operated a sliding
scale of probability, depending upon the nature of the allegation. I
would be astonished if the courts decided, under clause 1, to apply a
different test.</div>
					<a name="07070354000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the risk, however, of having already gone too far in disagreeing with
so venerable a colleague as my right hon. and learned Friend, I am
about to add a &#147;but&#148;. I agree with him that a standard of
probability is still a standard of probability, but whereas a jury
would be asking, &#147;Are we sure that this man is guilty of this
crime? Are we certain that he has done what the prosecution says he has
done?&#148;, a judge will ask himself or herself an entirely
different question: &#147;Even though this is a serious allegation,
do I have a high degree of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>confidence that it is more likely than not that he has done what the
director of the Serious Fraud Office, for example, has
said?&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070354000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
test cannot be converted into the test of reasonable certainty that a
jury applies in a criminal case. It is simply playing with language, a
matter of pure semantics, to suggest that the test adopted in McCann is
equivalent or analogous to the test adopted by a jury in a criminal
court.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000517"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> My hon. and learned Friend is entirely right, but
the test could be put slightly differently. In a criminal case it is,
&#147;Are you sure?&#148; In this case, a judge would be saying
&#147;Am I virtually sure?&#148; Those are not the
same.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000518"></a>Mr.
Cox:
						</b> No, because in one case the High Court judge can say
to himself, &#147;I am not sure that this man has done what the
director has said.&#148; The directors of Revenue and Customs or the
Serious Fraud Office are the type of people who will come to a judge
asking for an order. The judge will be able to say, &#147;I am not
sure that he has done it, but I am confident that it is highly likely
that he has,&#148; and that will be sufficient. That will be the
test, and I concede to the Minister that, at least when making the
final inference on criminality, a judge is likely to consider whether
the person in question is highly likely to have done what the director
says, not whether he is sure. That is not the same test, and, with
respect, whatever the Minister reads into <i class="I">Hansard</i>, which will be
looked at only in extremely rare cases under Pepper <i class="I">v. </i>Hart, I

Not being a lawyer, I had understood that there was a civil test and a

proof beyond reasonable doubt. The Minister has referred to a sliding
scale and my hon. and learned Friend says that that concept exists. My
concern about the Minister&#146;s remarks and the comments in the
Green Paper is that the sliding scale works in reverse of what one
would expect, so that the more serious the offence, the more likely it
is that a lower standard&#151;</div>

considering the criminal aspects of an allegation the judge will ask
himself, &#147;Is it highly likely that this man did it?&#148;
However, he will not ask himself, &#147;Am I sure he did it?&#148;

sure he did it beyond reasonable doubt?&#148;&#151;is to avoid the
many terrible miscarriages of justice that have been brought to the
public&#146;s attention during the past 20 or 30 years.
Certainty&#151;being sure beyond reasonable doubt&#151;eliminates
the prospect of injustice, especially when the penal consequences of
such a finding are so serious. It is important to understand that there
is a genuine difference.</div>
					<a name="07070354000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The contention is made that the
order is not a penal statute. It is suggested that it is a civil order
and that it would be an exercise of civil jurisdiction. The Minister
needs to consider closely the advice that he receives. The reality is
that the European Court of Human Rights will limit the number of
consequences ordinarily following upon conviction that can be imposed
as a part of a civil process. There will come a point when the Court
will say, &#147;You are doing so much to this person, based on the
civil standard of proof, that although you call it a civil process it
is in truth penal.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070354000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The European Court of Human
Rights has already said that about the legislation of other European
countries. In my judgment, there is a real risk that the Bill will be
determined to be a penal statute because of the number of consequences
that could flow froman ordinary conviction.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Before the Minister or the hon. Member for Colne
Valley intervenes&#151;in fairness, I should give way first to the
hon. Lady&#151;may I make a final
point?</div>
					<a name="07070354000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consequences of conviction would ordinarily mean restraint upon
one&#146;s liberty and peril to one&#146;s assets, which can be
seized. Those consequences will flow also from the order. It is often
said in court that imprisonment has two purposes: a punitive and a
preventive one. One could therefore apply the civil element to
imprisonment. One could provide in statute that although the court
would be allowed to imprison a person, it would be a civil
proceeding.</div>
					<a name="07070354000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we
went that far, I have no doubt that the European Court of Human Rights
would say, &#147;That is just playing with language. That is applying
the civil term, whereas in substance, this is a criminal
penalty.&#148; I believe that this provision is in danger of a
similar finding, because in substance it is penal. Every sentence of
imprisonment has a preventive element. This has a preventive element,
but it also has penal consequences.

						</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. and
learned Gentleman. I do not want to curtail the debate and I want to
allow hon. Members to exercise as much freedom as possible, but it
occurs to me that we are going round the houses a bit. Points are being
made over and over again. I appeal not only to the hon. and learned
Gentleman but to the entire Committee to try not to be repetitive,
because it is clear to me in the short time for which the Committee has
been sitting this afternoon that some of the points being raised were
raised on previous occasions when I was in the
Chair.</div>
					<a name="07070354000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000529"></a>Mr.
Cox:
						</b> Forgive me if I have sounded repetitious,
Mr. Benton. I was not in Committee this morning, so I do not
know what you covered; I was merely answering the hon. Lady&#146;s
question. She is labouring under the misapprehension, as I see it, that
somebody would have to have a criminal conviction first; however, they
do not. That is why the clause with which we are dealing, on the burden
and standard of proof, is in my judgment so dangerous. It allows
somebody to be open to one of these orders&#151;which are classed as
civil and said only to be preventive, but which are really penal in
nature, because of the potential consequences that would flow from
them&#151;on the civil standard of proof, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>which, however one may strain to approximate it to the criminal, simply
falls far short of
it.</div>
					<a name="07070354000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee is
invited to pass in the clause a provision that allows somebody to have
their liberty essentially removed and their assets stripped from them
when a judge is not sure that they have done what they are said to have
done, or that they will go on to do anything else like it. That is a
very grave step. I say to the hon. Lady and to other Government Members
that that has not, in 300 or 400 years of the development of the law,
ever been deemed to be wise. It has always been regarded in the past as
a step utterly inconsistent with the principles of the common law that
guarantee our
liberties.</div>
					<a name="07070354000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
Members must be certain in takingthis step that it is
justified by proper arguments advanced by the Government, but what are
they? The consultation paper does not reveal compelling arguments, in
my judgment, for the imposition of so grave and so significant an order
as this on the slender basis of a judge thinking that it is more likely
than not, or even highly likely, that a man has done something like
this.</div>
					<a name="07070354000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the hon.
Lady, for whom I have the greatest respect, to reflect. Suppose that
she puts herself in the position of a friend, cousin or
neighbour&#151;somebody whom she knows well&#151;who is subjected
to an application of this type because, at some time in the past, they
may have acted in a way that was likely to facilitate the commission of
a crime by another. The evidence is put forward and the judge has only
to say, &#147;Well, it&#146;s more likely than not that he has
acted that way.&#148; I think that the hon. Lady is likely to be very
concerned about that. Merely because it is the policy of the Government
whom she supports does not mean that we should not question it, as my
right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham
said.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000530"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> When the Minister responds, I shall want to be
clear on the issue of the sliding scale. I approach the issue not as a
lawyer, having understood until I became a member of the Committee that
the burden of proof was either the criminal one or the civil one that
is based on the balance of probabilities. We have debated the sliding
scale, but I would like the Minister to make clear to me, a non-lawyer,
exactly what it means. As I understand it, it was introduced by
McCann.</div>
					<a name="07070354000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000531"></a>Mr.

that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000532"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> I might be wrong&#151;it may have existed before.
Nevertheless, I should be grateful if the Minister gave us some
guidance on the meaning of the sliding scale and tell us where it comes
from in the Lords. It is a new concept to me. If the sliding scale
comes just from McCann, the Minister can say so, and if there are other
underlying sources I should be grateful for an explanation of
them.</div>
					<a name="07070354000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to
have a sliding scale, we need to consider in which direction it goes.
Does it mean that, the more serious the offence, the closer the burden
of proof 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>comes to the civil standard&#151;the balance of
probabilities&#151;and that for less serious offences the burden of
proof is the higher, criminal one? Serious potential offences might
justify a lower standard of proof because of the threat that they
present to society. That is where I understand us to be at the moment.
Terrorism prevention orders are assessed on the balance of
probabilities, whereas, under the McCann judgment, antisocial behaviour
orders require a higher standard of
proof.</div>
					<a name="07070354000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Minister to try to ensure that, when we come to a decision, I as a
non-lawyer am no longer unclear about the situation, because I suspect
that one or two of the more learned hon. Members in the Committee might
share my lack of clarity. I am quite certain that the Minister will be
able to give an explanation that will be clear to a
layman.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000533"></a>The

						</b> Before the Minister replies, let me say that it
will be in order for him to do so, although the matters in question
have already been referred to. I ask the Minister to keep his replies
brief in relation to those matters on which he has already
responded.</div>

							<a name="07070354000534"></a>Mr.

						</b> I will try to do that, Mr. Benton, and
if I do not you will no doubt quickly call me to order. Let me thank my
hon. Friends and Opposition Members for their contributions to the
debate, because they went to the heart of this aspect of the Bill. We
have been over much of the ground already, but it is relevant to clause
34 and indeed clause 35. Let me see whether my remarks can help,
although at the end of the day it might well be that there is simply a
difference of view in the Committee. I say that as someone who is a
non-lawyer as well. Sometimes people make judgments rather than having
scientific views on whether two plus two makes four.</div>
					<a name="07070354000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have already discussed the
civil nature of the orders at some length, so I shall not go into great
detail on amendments Nos. 18 and 22, which would change their nature.
Suffice it to say that the orders are preventive, not punitive, so that
making the proceedings criminal would be hugely
inappropriate.</div>
					<a name="07070354000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point made by the hon. Member for Reigate goes to the nub of the matter
and I shall come to it in a moment. The appropriate standard of proof
is the flexible civil one, which we expect&#151;in relation to the
first element of the test in clause 1&#151;to be the same as the
criminal standard established by the House of Lords in
McCann.</div>
					<a name="07070354000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07070354000536"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I just need to develop my explanation, and then I
shall give way to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. The sliding
scale was not introduced by McCann. I know that he did not mean to do
so, but, with respect, the hon. Member for Reigate got it the wrong way
round. The more serious the allegation, the higher is the standard of
proof. Involvement in serious crime is a serious matter, and will
require a very high standard of proof. The sliding scale is a general
principle of civil proceedings.</div>
					<a name="07070354000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is an important one,
so with permission, Mr. Benton, I should like to indulge in
a slightly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>lengthier explanation. It is virtually certain that the standard of
proof that would be needed under clause 1(1)(a) to satisfy a High
Court</div>
					<a name="07070354000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that a person has
been involved in serious crime (whether in England and Wales or
elsewhere)&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070354000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">would be
almost the same as the criminal standard. In other words, it would have
to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.</div>
					<a name="07070354000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 5(2)(a) refers
to</div>
					<a name="07070354000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any act that the
respondent can show to be reasonable in the
circumstances&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070354000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those
cases we would expect the standard of proof to be the balance of
probability. Therefore it is perfectly reasonable for a judge in the
High Court to distinguish between those two parts of the Bill. As the
right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham pointed
out, the sliding scale is not a novel idea for the High Court. It uses
it as a matter of course in civil proceedings. It is not new; it has
not arisen as a result of McCann. McCann has tried to clarify the
situation with respect to civil
orders.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000537"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I understand the Minister to say that in the
majority of cases where the consequences are serious he expects
something like the criminal standard. He will say that that follows
from the ordinary principles of law. But he must look at page 32 of the
Green Paper. The Minister says that it his intent that prevails and
I&#146;ll accept that for these purposes. But the Green Paper was
drafted by the lawyers, and they thought that one could get the balance
of probability as the test, notwithstanding McCann. That is a serious
problem which he has to
face.</div>
					<a name="07070354000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000538"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> That may have been in the Green Paper, but I am
trying to make clear to the Committee what the Government expect, not
as a result of what was in the Green Paper, but as a result of this
Bill and the various comments that I and others have made here and my
noble Friend Baroness Scotland made in the other
place.</div>
					<a name="07070354000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to quote from the McCann judgment. Lord Steyn
said:</div>
					<a name="07070354000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Having
concluded that the relevant proceedings are civil,in principle
it follows that the standard of proof ordinarily applicable in civil
proceedings, namely the balance of probabilities, should apply.
However, I agree that, given the seriousness of matters involved, at
least some reference to the heightened civil standard would usually be
necessary&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070354000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Hope
said:</div>
					<a name="07070354000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;But it
is not an invariable rule that the lower standard of proof must be
applied in civil
proceedings.&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07070354000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
the point that the hon. Member for Reigate
made&#151;</div>
					<a name="07070354000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think that there are good reasons, in the interests of fairness, for
applying the higher standard when allegations are made of criminal or
quasi-criminal conduct which, if proved, would have serious
consequences for the person against whom they are
made.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070354000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000539"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I
understand that he is attempting, as did his ministerial colleagues, to
provide as much clarity as possible. But surely when people come to
look at this legislation they will start with the Bill and then, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>perhaps, they will look at what he said in Committee. He said almost
everything that the amendment sets out to achieve. I simply do not
understand, and I am fairly sure that people outside the House will not
understand, why he cannot just put what he has said, or some variation
of it, into the Bill. There is confusion between what he relied on in
clause 1(1)(a), which is to say that the High Court must be satisfied,
and saying that the civil standard of proof must be applied. The simple
way around this is to set out exactly what the Government wish the
courts to
do.</div>
					<a name="07070354000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000540"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I shall simply repeat what we have said ad
nauseam. There is a difference of view. We do not think that it is
necessary for that to be on the face of the Bill. I have laid out what
the Government expect with respect to the standard of proof and serious
crime prevention orders. Indeed, even the hon. and learned Member for
Torridge and West Devon has accepted that High Court judges are used to
dealing with the sliding scale with respect to the standard of proof in
civil proceedings. That is what we would expect. The McCann judgment
clarified that the more serious the offence, the higher the standard of
proof that one would expect to be necessary for the court to be
convinced of anything. With respect to clause (1)(1)(a) one would
almost expect it to be virtually identical to the criminal
standard.</div>
					<a name="07070354000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000541"></a>Mr.
Cox:
						</b> I agree with almost all of what the Minister said,
except that even the heightened civil standard is nowhere near the
criminal standard of proof. The heightened civil standard simply asks,
&#147;Is it much more likely than not?&#148; The criminal standard
asks, &#147;Is it certain?&#148; The ordinary civil standard is,
&#147;Is it more likely than not?&#148; Hon. Members can work out
for themselves the differences between those tests, but that is the
situation.</div>
					<a name="07070354000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000542"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman makes his point and
people will have to make up their mind where they stand on the issue.
As I said, our view is that the standard of proof is a sliding scale,
which is flexible, and which will be applied appropriately by the High
Court.</div>
					<a name="07070354000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">To finish my
remarks, the key question in determining whether a measure is civil or
criminal is whether it is preventative or punitive. As Lord Hope made
it clear in the McCann case, if a measure is preventative it is likely
to be classified as a civil measure. The reason why the Government
believe that the orders are civil measures goes to the heart of the
Bill which, as my hon. Friends have said in our debates today, is about
preventing serious crime, supporting victims and putting them
first.</div>
					<a name="07070354000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members for Taunton and for Hornchurch talked about penalties. These
measures are not penalties or punishment for past crimes; they are
about preventing crime, and harm, in the future, and the vast majority
of our constituents would want us to put in place measures that do
that.</div>

view, and I am not going to prolong the debate any further to try and
bridge the gap, because it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>is there. It is fine for the Minister to say, &#147;This is about the
prevention of crime,&#148; but we need something that is clear, that
will work, and which the courts will ensure is robust; that is what the
amendment would ensure, and I am disappointed that the Minister has
turned his face against it. The best way for the House to ensure that
there is clarity for the courts in understanding how a Bill is intended
to operate in practice is by the language on the face of the Bill and I
am sorry that the Minister does not accept that logic. I will test the
Committee&#146;s appetite for the provision because it is so
important, by dividing the Committee on the amendment.</div>

							<a name="07070354000563"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Amendment No. 133 is not a minor amendment; it is, I
hope, an important amendment. We have been over the nature of the
orders many times&#151;how wide ranging and draconian they are, the
limited protection given to the citizen, the fact that they are
renewable, and the rest of it. Some members of the Committee might have
taken comfort from the fact that under clause 9 an application can be
made by only a limited number of individuals&#151;the Director of
Public Prosecutions, the Director of Revenue and Customs Prosecutions,
the director of the Serious Fraud Office and, in the case of Northern
Ireland, the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland. On
the face of it, therefore, the central and important distinctions are
being made at a very high level of administration.</div>
					<a name="07070354000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the comfort that some
members of the Committee might have taken from clause 9. However, I
wonder whether they should have drawn such comfort, because in schedule
2, under paragraphs 2(1) and 2(2), paragraphs 7(1) and 7(2) and
paragraph 17, the powers can in fact be delegated downwards to a
relatively low level. So far as the powers of the Director of Public
Prosecutions are concerned, paragraph 2(2) says:
&#147;References...to the Director&#148; can be deemed to
be</div>
					<a name="07070354000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;references
to...any Crown

					<a name="07070354000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph

and Customs

					<a name="07070354000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
paragraph 17, which refers to Northern Ireland, says:
&#147;References...to the Director&#148; will
be</div>
					<a name="07070354000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;references
to...any Public Prosecutor.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>
					<a name="07070354000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important point, which I
have made already, is this. If we give powers to an official, we can be
quite sure that those powers will from time to time be abused. When the
powers are set a level at which the powers in question have been set,
it is important that they should exercised at very high administrative
level. I am very far from happy&#151;indeed, I am extremely
unhappy&#151;that the powers to make applications that could lead to
such draconian consequences should be entrusted to officials of fairly
modest standing. That is not right.</div>
					<a name="07070354000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">That concern is reinforced by
the fact that the Minister has told us on several occasions that we
should expect only a limited number of applications to be
made&#151;he said that the regulatory assessment had suggested 30
orders a year. We are dealing with four jurisdictions&#151;Northern
Ireland, the Revenue, the DPP and the Serious Fraud Office. We are
talking about only four, five or 10 applications per director, so why
on earth can not it be confined to the director himself or herself,
rather than being entrusted to a relatively junior official.</div>
					<a name="07070354000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Committee will
reflect on those points and decide that applications of this kind,
which are serious in their potential consequences, should be confined
to senior officials, together with all the other consequential
decisions that are referred to in, for example, paragraph 1 of schedule
2.</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>Either the Director of Public Prosecutions,
the Director of Revenue and Customs Prosecutions or the director of the
Serious Fraud Office must make the specific decision to delegate. It
will not happen automatically, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman
implied. It will be a positive
decision.</div>
					<a name="07070354000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 2
sets out the functions of the applicant authorities in relation to part
1 of the Bill. The amendments all relate to the powers of the directors
of the four applicant authorities to delegate the exercise of their
functions in relation to serious crime prevention orders to members of
their respective organisations. Those powers have been included because
we want the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Director of Revenue
and Customs Prosecutions and the director of the Serious Fraud Office
to be required to make a decision to delegate to a member of their
staff rather than the delegation happening
automatically.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000565"></a>Mr.

states:</div>

serious crime prevention order may be made only on an
application&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07070354000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">but the
effect of paragraphs 2(1) and (2) of schedule 2 is that the conduct of
applications can be delegatedto a Crown Prosecutor. In other
words, the Crown Prosecutor, in contrast with the director, has all the
consequential decisions to make, as he has the conduct of the
application.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000568"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> But once delegated, those prosecutors would, to
all intents and purposes, be the applicant authority. I accept that
point. However, as well as being under the control of their own
directors, the right hon. and learned Gentleman will have noted that
paragraph 3 of schedule 2
states:</div>
					<a name="07070354000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
functions of the Director under this Part are exercisable under the
superintendence of the Attorney
General.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070354000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not only
that the director of the specific prosecution agency will ensure that
things are done properly; the Attorney-General also has a
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="07070354000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
amendments were made, the directors would need to fall back on their
existing powers of delegation. In some cases a director might be left
without any power of delegation and in others delegation would happen
automatically. It would be impractical to ask the directors of each of
the three organisations to carry out those functions personally, even
for the relatively small number of orders that we anticipate. Instead,
those functions will be carried out by specifically and specially
trained members of their respective organisations, all under the
superintendence of the Attorney-General, as also specified in the
schedule.</div>
					<a name="07070354000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000569"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> We had a discussion about the application of the
orders to prisoners who come out of prison having been sentenced for a
serious crime. Instead of there being 30 cases a year as under the
impact assessment, there could be 30,000. I imagine that that is the
sort of number of people leaving prison after being convicted of
serious crimes every year, so it would become an automatic part of the
process when the powers are delegated. Can the Minister say anything to
comfort me that the powers will be delegated only in a way that will
not lead to an automatic post-imprisonment process, and that a suitable
order is applied to everyone who leaves prison having been convicted of
a serious
crime?</div>
					<a name="07070354000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000570"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Obviously, only an appropriate order would be
allowed by the court. That would be part of the process. We came to the
number 30 as a result of an assessment of the number of orders that we
thought would be made in any one year. That was in the regulatory
impact assessment, and it is our best assessment of the number of
orders. We do not in any way expect there to be 30,000; the orders will
deal with very serious criminals and very serious crime.</div>
					<a name="07070354000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman almost
seemed to suggest that a director might go willy-nilly for a serious
crime prevention order. I hope that he will find the comfort that he
seeks in the fact that that simply could not happen. A director doing
that would be not only subject to the normal processes within their own
agency, but under the superintendence of the
Attorney-General&#151;who would be the governor, if you like, of the
prosecuting agencies. Before the issue got to court, the
Attorney-General would see that going willy-nilly for such an order was
not appropriate and reasonable. If someone seeking an inappropriate
serious crime prevention order got it to court, the court would simply
not allow it to be
made.</div>

						<a name="07070354000571"></a>
							<b class="B">Dan
Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): The Minister has painted a
picture of the powers being included in the Bill for operational
reasons&#151;in other words, they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>would give various organisations the capacity to
function and the director would not have to have direct responsibility,
although they would ultimately take the
decision.</div>
					<a name="07070354000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
envisage a case in which the decision that such an order might be
desirable to the agency in question came from below&#151;came to the
director, who then signed it back down to someone below. In other
words, we are increasing the capacity for the number of orders to
multiply, much as the hon. Member for Reigate
suggested.</div>
					<a name="07070354000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000572"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> To clarify the position for the hon. Member for
Reigate, I should say that we estimated that there would be
approximately 30 cases. That estimate of need came from the various
branches of law enforcement. We believe that it is appropriate for the
director of the prosecuting agency to be able to delegate to a
specific, specially trained member of staff. However, such a staff
member will not simply be able to decide to apply for the order, just
because the issue has been delegated down. The decision would have to
be proportionate and reasonable&#151;otherwise, the court would
simply not allow
it.</div>
					<a name="07070354000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The position of
the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland is slightly
different. The Bill does not give him a power of delegation; his powers
to delegate under section 36(1) of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act
2002 will be relied on. Paragraph 17 to schedule 2 of the Bill makes
the position clear. I hope that, for the reasons that I have outlined,
the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): This is the first time I
have spoken this afternoon, so I welcome you to the Chair,
Mr. Benton. If the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham is minded to press the amendment to a
Division, we shall support him for the following reasons. There is
confusion in the Government about how many people will be affected
annually by the orders. The figure 30 keeps being presented. One could
say that a point of principle is involved, that the numbers are neither
here nor there and that one is either in favour of the principle or
not. </div>
					<a name="07070354000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
public will perceive that the number of people affected each year is
significant. The Minister seeks to reassure us that the orders are
reserved for the tiny number of real Mr. Bigs, the real
problem people; 30 is the figure that he keeps citing. However, when
Government Back Benchers make interventions, they always say,
&#147;This Bill will go down extremely well in my constituency
because of all the people committing antisocial acts on various housing
estates.&#148; They say how much they will appreciate the Bill.
However, there are 646 Members of Parliament, I think. On the basis of
30 a year, a person will be affected in each constituency only about
every two decades. The effect on those hon. Members&#146;
constituencies will not be as profound as they seem to
think.</div>

super-criminals of whom we are talking spread their power, or
tentacles, over many constituencies and across whole cities,
communities and regions? It isnot just one bad person, or
super-gangster per constituency. The reach of such people is far and
wide, and often they reach into our communities&#151;the poorer

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000577"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making
that point, but if we are talking about such a small number of people,
he will have no difficulty in supporting the amendments. There is no
need to delegate the power to make a decision that is as infrequent as
this one will be&#151;roughly 30 people a year. The concern is that
if we do not pass the amendments, there will be a machine somewhere
within Government signing the orders through on a regular
basis.</div>
					<a name="07070354000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Reigate made a point about people who are released from
prison having orders imposed upon them as a matter of routine. We are
told that 30,000 is an excessive number and it will not be of that
order, but that 30 is a reasonable estimate. However, this is the same
Government who made an estimate about the number of Polish people
coming to work in the United
Kingdom.</div>

							<a name="07070354000578"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I will ignore the last remark. I say to the hon.
Gentleman that this is an extremely important point, about which I do
not want there to be any misconception. The Government do not sign
through serious crime prevention orders; it is the courts that do so.
Whatever else we have said in Committee and whatever disagreements
there have been, the courts will make the decision about whether a
serious crime prevention order should be made or
not.</div>

							<a name="07070354000579"></a>Mr.

courts will make the decision, but the application is made by an agency
of the Government and this is a Government Bill.</div>
					<a name="07070354000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, if Members think
that 30 is a realistic assessment of the numbers of people who will be
affected annually, it is perfectly reasonable that the decision is
taken at a higher level and that these amendments are supported on a
cross-party basis. If they are not, one must make the reasonable
assumption that the 30 figure will not apply in practice, if and when
the Bill becomes
law.</div>

for the hon. Member who spoke before to speak before that, but the

Brokenshire:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Benton. I shall
take that advice. My parting comment, in the light of the intervention
by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon,
is that there are clear reservations about the measures&#146; extent
and application. I urge the Minister to consider again whether some
greater comfort could be provided to make it clear that they are
intended to operate only in limited circumstances and address within
the Bill the concerns expressed about wide
discretion.</div>

							<a name="07070354000584"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Having listened to the debate, it seems to me that
there are merits on both sides. My hon. Friend the Member for
Hornchurch and indeed the Minister have made the point that it is
occasionally necessary to delegate. I understand that. A number of
applications will be made to the court in the course of any proceedings
that do not have to be made by the director in person and can probably
be sensibly delegated down. On the other hand, given the relatively
limited number of applications forecast by the Minister, a number of
policy decisions relating to any one application should properly be
made by the
director.</div>
					<a name="07070354000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
at the moment is that the director&#151;I am referring simply to the
Director of Public Prosecutions, although this is relevant to all the
other enforcement agencies too&#151;has complete discretion as to how
much delegation should occur. I should be much happier if it were made
plain in the Bill that only consequential actions should be delegated
down, and that primary actions should be retained and confined to the
directors in question.</div>
					<a name="07070354000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not a total precedent,
but the Minister will remember telephone tapping warrants. In my day,
they were made in the Home Office by the Minister and not by officials.
That may have changed, but it has always been recognised that some
classes of order should be made exclusively at a very high level. I
would like to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>think that he will revisit the matter to see whether we can construct a
clause that reflects
that.</div>
					<a name="07070354000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one other
point. The Minister draws comfort from the fact that the
director&#146;s functions are exercisable under the superintendence
of the Attorney-General. I have never served as a Law Officer, but I
was a Minister for a long time, and I can tell him that no
Minister&#151;for this purpose, I regard the Attorney-General as
one&#151;will exercise close superintendence over how the powers are
used. It is possible that a discussion might take place at one stage
between the director and the Attorney-General about the
director&#146;s general approach, but the idea that the
Attorney-General will supervise every substantial order-making power is
simply not
right.</div>

been discussed to your satisfaction, Mr. Benton, but let me
take a little longer to clarify my point. We believe that the civil
standard of proof&#151;on the balance of probabilities&#151;is not
sufficient, whereas the criminal standard, beyond reasonable doubt,
would offer greater reassurance. Baroness Scotland said in the other
place that the likely standard of proof for the orders would
be</div>

							<a name="07070354000588"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I ask the Committee to resist the amendment, which
would change the rules regarding the admissibility of evidence in
proceedings relating to an order from those that apply in civil
proceedingsto those that apply in a trial on indictment. The
amendment also seeks to provide that in proceedings for an order, the
relevant person cannot be required to answer any question or to produce
any document that they could not be required to answer or produce at
such a trial.</div>
					<a name="07070354000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is undesirable because the civil procedure rules already
provide significant and wide-ranging powers to manage the evidence that
will come before the court. The court is best placed to determine which
pieces of evidence are relevant and should be admitted in proceedings
and what weight should be accorded to each. The court will ensure that
only relevant and appropriate evidence is admitted. It is both
unnecessary and inappropriate to constrain that flexibility, and I ask
the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. He went over some old
ground in his comments, but these are civil orders, not a criminal
penalty, so the strict rules of evidence that apply to criminal trials
should not apply. Instead, the civil rules of evidence should apply,
particularly in relation to
hearsay.</div>

					<a name="07070354000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause gives power to law
enforcement officers to take documents, both copies and originals, and
to retain them. One needs to keep in mind that the person who is to be
made the subject of the order might well have a legitimate need for a
copy of the documents, either to deal with the allegations that have
been made&#151;that is natural justice&#151;or to carry out his
ordinary business. That applies also to third parties, who, as we all
understand, might be affected by the order and might have a legitimate
need to see copies of the documents, to see whether they wish to make
representations to the court, as is provided for in the Bill, or
otherwise to conduct their business.</div>

that I have overlooked a passage, but when I look at the clause, I see
no obligation on the law enforcement officers who have taken possession
of the originals or copies of documents to deliver a copy on request to

offend both natural justice and general disclosure laws that apply in
criminal and civil courts.</div>
					<a name="07070354000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">There might be exceptional
cases in which it would be wrong to provide the subject of the order or
a third party with a copy. I suppose that one can construct such cases
and I have provided for that in the amendment, which would give the
enforcement agency the power to go to the court to get relief from
delivering up a copy. As a matter of general principle, however, it is
right that a law enforcement agency should have to deliver to the
person who is the subject 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>of the order or to a third party a copy of the relevant documents on

						</b> I am afraid that we shall resist the amendment. It
is unnecessary in relation to the subject of the order, who would be
the originator of the document would therefore have had the opportunity
to make copies. In relation to third parties, it does not follow that,
simply because a third party has been given leave to make
representations under clause 10, they should have access to all the
material produced under the terms of the order. The subject of an order
should not need to make an application to the court every time that he
wishes the contents of a document that he has provided not to be passed
on to a third party. That would be wholly unreasonable to the subject
of the order.</div>
					<a name="07070354000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, the amendment could put in jeopardy possible subsequent
investigations or prosecutions, as it makes no allowance for the
applicant authority or law enforcement agency to make an application to
the court for non-disclosure. In the light of those comments, I ask the
right hon. and learned Gentleman to withdraw his

						</b> I am bound to say that I am disappointed by that
response. I draw on a certain amount of experience in this matter.
About three weeks ago, I was acting in a case in which the police had
seized every single document on the premises and carted them all away.
They kept possession of them for more than two years. The idea that my
client had access to copies is simply wrong; he had neither copies nor
originals. He was facing confiscation proceedings under the Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002, so that was a serious deprivation to him.</div>

enforcement officer should be obliged to provide the person who is to
be made the subject of the order with a copy, which he otherwise would
not have. If he had a copy, he would not make the application. He would
make the application because he did not have the copy and he needed it.
I am saying no more than the principle of natural justice and
disclosure in the ordinary criminal and civil courts requires. I hope
that the Minister will think again, and I do not withdraw my

word &#147;forseeability&#148;. When we use that word, are we
talking about a subjective or objective test? In other words, is it
foreseeable by the individual that that was the consequence or was it
something that should have been foreseen by them and that a reasonable
person would have foreseen in the circumstances?</div>
					<a name="07070354000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">In moving the amendment, I
stress that it is probing in nature and is designed to gain greater
understanding of the context of this clause and, in particular, the use
of the word
foreseeable.</div>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Maria
Eagle):
						</b> Although I have been on this Committee for only
one day, I feel like I have been here for a very long time.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Hon. Members should not misunderstand me. It is
simply that I have been waiting for so long to get to my feet, and not
because of the content of our debate, which has been interesting,
illuminating and lively. Committees are always good when they are those
things.</div>
					<a name="07070354000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I also
say what a pleasure it is, Mr. Benton, to be subject to your
chairmanship? While it appears gentle at times, it is actually more
effective than some may think. You have kept us well in order and we
are very fortunate to have
you.</div>
					<a name="07070354000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I begin by
thanking the hon. Member for Hornchurch for making it clear that his
amendment is probing in nature? We do not then have to dance on the
head of a pin over the difference between foreseeable and reasonable. I
think that will do us all a favour at this time of the
afternoon.</div>
					<a name="07070354000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly, I
want to set out the offences that we are dealing with here. We will
come back to them in clause stand part as well. Clause 41, which is in
part 2, creates an offence if a person, whom I shall refer to as
D,</div>

we have clause stand part

					<a name="07070354000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
relates to clause 41, but in order for liability to arise under the
clause, it must be proved that D</div>

assist&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070354000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">an offence. The
notion of intention is given a particular meaning by subsection (2),
which states that D</div>

not to be taken to have intended to encourage or assist the commission
of an offence merely because such encouragement or assistance was a
foreseeable consequence of his
act&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070354000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that it
assists the hon. Member for Hornchurch if I say that what we are trying
to get at is that intention should be interpreted in a narrow way, and
should exclude the concept of virtual certainty. It is equivalent to
meaning that D&#146;s purpose must be to assist or encourage the
offence.</div>
					<a name="07070354000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
was a recommendation from the Law Commission following a lengthy debate
and much concern. Following consultation, we have followed that
recommendation. I hope that the fact that the measure has a long
pedigree of consideration by erudite and learned people behind it will
assist me in persuading the hon. Gentleman and his hon. and right hon.
and learned Friends, and that he would be perfectly safe to withdraw
the amendment. I assure him and reiterate that we have the same purpose
in mind, which is to ensure that the notion of intention is interpreted
narrowly. I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels able to withdraw the

Hogg:
						</b> I have not yet had the opportunity to welcome the
Under-Secretary to the Committee, at least not formally. I recognise
that we are now debating a part of the Bill for which she has
responsibility. I am sorry that she feels that she has sat here for too
long, but we understand that&#151;it is the Opposition&#146;s
business to ensure that she sits here somewhat longer to answer our
queries.</div>
					<a name="07070354000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 2
originates from the Law Commission, and they are likely to have pored
over in some detail the clauses that we are now debating. I shall
therefore venture with more diffidence than usual. Although there is a
risk that I am dancing on the head of a pin, as it were, I think that
my anxiety is worth
exploring.</div>
					<a name="07070354000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 152 would change clause 42(b). The present drafting will enable a
disjunction of time between the doing of an act and the belief that it
will have criminal implications. It will not happen often, and it may
not happen at all, but if one reads the Bill, one sees that an offence
will be committed when a
person</div>
					<a name="07070354000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does an act
capable of encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence;
and...he believes...that the offence will be
committed&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070354000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
does not provide that the belief must be associated in time with the
act. I may be dancing on the head of a pin, but I could contemplate a
situation in which someone has done something in their past that
is</div>
					<a name="07070354000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;capable of
encouraging or assisting the commission of an
offence&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070354000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;they
could, for example, make a loan. At that stage, the person acts
innocently or not fully aware of the circumstances. Later on, he
discovers that the person to whom he has made the loan intends to use
the money in order to commit a criminal offence or to fund one. I agree
that it is not terribly likely, but it seems to me that it could happen
and that it would be better by far to make it plain that the belief
must be associated with the act so that the offence is committed only
when the person carries out the act and at the same time has the belief
provided for in the clause. It is in that spirit that I move the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07070354000625"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> Would it be in order for me to speak about

time?</div>

							<a name="07070354000627"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I, too, welcome the new Minister to her duties. I
now realise why the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr.
Sutcliffe) sat through all our previous sittings. I am only sad for him
that he did not get to give us the benefit of his views before he was
transferred. The glamorous world of sport awaits him, so maybe that is
a consolation for not being able to speak on this issue.</div>
					<a name="07070354000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 7 would add a
further subsection, (c), which would require that</div>
					<a name="07070354000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;his act was
unreasonable&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070354000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
make two brief points. First, there is a danger that the person could
innocently come under the effect of the clause without realising that
they were doing anything unreasonable. Secondly, the amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>would shift the burden of proof as it would mean that the defendant no
longer has to demonstrate that the reasonableness is something that he
has been party to or that he has behaved in such a way. The onus is
moved to the prosecution to show that the act was not reasonable. At
the moment, the defendant must show that he has behaved reasonably. If
the amendment is put in place, the burden will fall on those who wish
to show that he has behaved unreasonably. That provides a greater
safeguard, and that is why I have proposed the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000628"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I rise to support the amendment tabled by my
right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham. As always, if we can seek to provide some greater clarity in
legislation that is always welcome. His point might be technical and
narrow, but it is still worth exploring in terms of the timing of the
belief that occurs.</div>
					<a name="07070354000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not persuaded of the merits of the amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for Taunton. We have an &#147;act&#148; in the first part of
the clause and then some sort of intention&#151;what &#147;he
believes&#148;. Two elements are applied, and to add a third would
confuse the situation when the tests are relatively clear. I shall
certainly listen to what the Minister says.</div>
					<a name="07070354000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000629"></a>Mr.
Cox:
						</b> I rise with some diffidence, like my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, because this
is the work of the Law Commission. I am finding clause 42 slightly
difficult to understand. I assume that it is intended to capture a form
of recklessness, in that the defendant would have to have committed an
act believing that it would help the commission of a crime and that the
crime would be committed. If someone were in that state of mind, there
is a narrow, slender difference between doing that and intending to
help the commission of a crime, which is what clause 41 deals with.
Clause 41 deals with a situation where there is actual intention to
help the commission of a
crime.</div>
					<a name="07070354000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume that
clause 42 must deal with people who, although they believe what they
are doing is helping the commission of a crime and believe that it will
be committed, do not intend to do it. I may be wrong. I should be
grateful for clarification. If that is right, I would support the
amendment moved by my right hon. and learned Friend, because it would
bring some clarification. It might be thought unnecessary, in that a
court would not interpret it any differently from the way that my right
hon. and learned Friend has suggested it, but it would bring an element
of additional clarification to the
situation.</div>
					<a name="07070354000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000630"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> Perhaps it will be easier to deal with the
amendments and assist our discussion if I set out the
Government&#146;s understanding of what the clause does. Clause 42
creates a new offence of encouraging or assisting an offence, believing
that it will be committed, as opposed to intending that it will be
committed, which is what clause 41 deals with. As both the right hon.
and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham and the hon. and
learned Member for Torridge and West Devon have said, the clause arises
from the Law Commission report.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>
					<a name="07070354000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause imposes liability on
a person who encourages or assists an offence where he does not intend
an offence to occur, but believes that it will. It goes further than
the current law of incitement, which is generally thought only to apply
where it is a person&#146;s purpose or intention to encourage an
offence. In that sense, it advances the Law Society&#146;s
recommendation that the current law be extended to cover those who
believe that an offence would be encouraged or
assisted.</div>
					<a name="07070354000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order to
be guilty of this offence a person must do an act that is capable of
encouraging or assisting an offence by another person and must believe
that the offence will be committed and that his act will encourage or
assist its
commission.</div>
					<a name="07070354000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000631"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Will the Minister address the point that I raised:
namely, whether the belief has to be in existence at the time that the
act is done, or whether the offence is committed if, subsequently, the
defendant develops a
belief?</div>
					<a name="07070354000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000632"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I will deal with that immediately, because I am
almost at the end of setting out my understanding of clause 42, which I
first looked at
yesterday.</div>
					<a name="07070354000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 152 makes it clear that D would need to have the required belief at
the time of doing his act. The question in deciding whether to support
the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s amendment is whether the
additional words add anything to what is already
there.</div>
					<a name="07070354000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
makes it clear that, in order to be guilty of the offence, D must do an
act of encouragement or assistance, believing that his act will
encourage or assist at the time. Although that is not included in the
Bill&#151;that is the whole point of the right hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s amendment&#151;we do not believe that an order
would be made out if, at the time of doing the act, D did not have any
such belief. We are all crowding on to the head of a pin now. However,
that is the advice that I have been
given.</div>
					<a name="07070354000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000633"></a>Mr.
Cox:
						</b> Whole cases have been won on
that.</div>
					<a name="07070354000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070354000634"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> Indeed. Where would lawyers be without the heads of
pins?</div>
					<a name="07070354000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give an
example to try to illustrate what I mean. Such concepts can be
difficult to understand without examples. We can fuss about how good
examples are, but they assist us. If D lends P a baseball bat, he will
only be guilty of an offence if he believed that, at the time of
lending the bat, P was about to bash somebody over the head with it. If
he lent him the bat believing that he would play baseball, he would not
be committing the offence. That is what we are intending to capture
under the offence mentioned in clause
42.</div>
					<a name="07070354000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not believe
that the extra clarity that the right hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s amendment would include in the Bill is necessary. I
will not say &#147;otiose&#148;, although I always try to get it in
at some point. However, the amendment would not add anything to the
current draft. Although I was not present at the time, I understand
that the wording has been carefully discussed with counsel and is based
on what the Law 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>Commission had to say. Although I am reluctant to disagree with the
right hon. and learned Gentleman, whose erudition in these matters is
well known across the House, I shall have to say that this particular
amendment is not necessary. I hope that that satisfies him.</div>
					<a name="07070354000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 7 would add a new
subsection to the clause, requiring the prosecution in each case where
it is alleged that D has, with belief, done an act capable of
encouraging or assisting an offence to prove beyond reasonable doubt
that the defendant&#146;s behaviour was unreasonable. The amendment
is neither desirable nor necessary. The scope of the offence in clause
42&#151;an offence committed with belief&#151;is wide and could
cover many everyday activities, such as lending somebody a baseball
bat.</div>
					<a name="07070354000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Examples given
during the debate on this issue in the other place, and indeed, in the
Law Commission report, included that of a motorist who moves over to
let a speeding driver pass&#151;I expect that we have all done
that&#151;and that of a salesperson who sells spray paint believing
that it will be used to commit criminal damage. It is not intended that
these offences should criminalise conduct that is considered
reasonable, but the Government agree with the Law Commission that it
would be better to rely on a defence of acting reasonably in the
circumstances, which is included in clause 47, rather than to try to
attach the reasonableness condition that the amendment
seeks.</div>
					<a name="07070354000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">In proving
these offences, the prosecution must also show some awareness on
D&#146;s part, whether it be belief or recklessness, that the
principal offender will operate with the necessary mens rea&#151;or
guilty mind, fault, or whichever words the Law Commission and others
come up with to mean what lawyers think of as mens rea&#151;for the
principal offence or with any necessary circumstances or
consequences.</div>
					<a name="07070354000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we
accept that this element would be made out, the question is whether the
prosecution should have to prove that D&#146;s behaviour was
unreasonable, as would be the case under the amendment, or whether D
should have to prove that his behaviour was reasonable, as would be the
case under the Bill. The Law Commission took the view that the burden
should fall on D, arguing that only he will know why he considers his
behaviour to have been reasonable in those circumstances. The man who
lent the baseball bat to the villain who then thumped somebody over the
head with it thought that he was lending it for him to play baseball
with. He knows that, but it is not necessarily the case that the
prosecution can prove any such thing.</div>
					<a name="07070354000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not believe that there is
any unfairness in having the burden this way round. The prosecution
will have already proved that that defendant has done something to
assist or encourage an offence, believing that it would be committed.
It will have dealt with that burden. The burden would then be on the
defendant to show that it was reasonable for him to act in the way that
he did in the circumstances that he knew or believed to exist. Only the
defendant would be in a position to explain why he acted as he did and
why it was reasonable to have done so.</div>
					<a name="07070354000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">These particular circumstances
and the facts of the particular case, which he could use to justify his

<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>behaviour, would be peculiarly within his own knowledge and not within
the knowledge of anybody else.</div>

Let us suppose that D hands the baseball bat to E intending that he
should use it simply to play baseball but becomes aware 20 minutes
later, or even the following day, that E will use it to commit an
affray. Would such a person be acquitted under this
clause?</div>

Committee can see that that is a reasonably clear and sensible place to
draw the line. I understand the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham wanting clarity, because in many ways these
inchoate offences are inherently difficult to grasp&#151;if hon.
Members think that clause 42 is awkward, they should wait until we
reach clause 44. Having said that, I hope that with the assistance and
work that the Law Commission has provided we have got to a place that
is as good as it can be. Given those explanations, I hope that the
right hon. and learned Gentleman will be willing to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Hogg:
						</b> I shall not press the amendment to a Division,
because I am not actually sure about the correctness of the position
that I have adopted. Further thought needs to be given to the issue by
all sides. We should take the Minister&#146;s example of the baseball
bat, because she is quite right: it is sometimes helpful to consider
examples. A chap lends to another a baseball bat, and at that moment,
all parties are innocent. They walk to a pub together and they get
drunk. The person who has the baseball bat falls into a row with a
third party, and decides to whack the third party with the baseball
bat. He says to the donor of the baseball bat, &#147;Thank God
you&#146;ve given me the baseball bat. I can now go and do something
to the third party.&#148; One could construct an argument to the
effect that, actually, unless the donor intervenes, the donor should be
guilty of an offence in terms of public policy. The language of the
statute is capable of supporting a prosecution.</div>
					<a name="07070354000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister says that we
should look at the issue in broad terms, and that in matters of natural
justice we should not create an offence unless at the moment that one
handed over the baseball bat, one had the necessary belief. However,
there is another public interest argument, which is that if one becomes
aware of subsequent facts that show that the bat will be used 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>for an unlawful purpose, one should intervene. If the statute&#146;s
language is sufficiently wide as to capture that latter situation, we
may have got ourselves an offence where we did not intend to create
one. That is my anxiety.</div>
					<a name="07070354000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I see the force in
what the Minister said, because I accept that I am at risk of dancing
on the head of a pin, I none the less draw some comfort from the
remarks of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West
Devon. The provision is capable of a different construction, which none
of us really intends.</div>

accepted that it is inherently difficult to be extremely precise with
inchoate defences, hence the recent efforts of the Law Commission. We
are confident that an offence would be made out for D only where he was
aware at the time that he was undertaking the act of encouraging and
assisting. At that time, he must have that belief. I hear what the
right hon. and learned Gentleman says, and I am happy to think very
hard about it, but I cannot think that he might be right.</div>
					<a name="07070354000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will return to the Bill on
Report, and I think that we have covered all the angles, but between
now and Report, I shall think about what the right hon. and learned
Gentleman has said. If I, my officials or lawyers have, upon the basis
of what he said, a revelation that we might be wrong, we will consider
the matter further, but I cannot see the space in which we might be.
With such difficult offences, I understand his concern to ensure that
we are absolutely clear, but I hope that with that assurance, he may
feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div>

Hogg:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 153, in
clause 46, page 28, line 19, leave
out subsection (6).</div>
					<a name="07070354000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that the Minister is very glad to have passed over clause 44
without a debate, as we all are. I do not think that any of us really
understood it, and she would have had to make a reasoned response. She
must be relieved, as indeed am I.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>
					<a name="07070354000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 153 is very narrow
and represents a grievance that I have had in this place for years.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>It is not my only grievance&#151;I see the
Whip chatting away. I have many grievances. This is just one of them.
As is so often the case, the Bill gives to the Secretary of State the
power to amend by order&#151;in this case, the power to amend the
listed offences in schedule 3. The Committee will have been diligent in
this matter and will have checked the order-making powers at the end of
the Bill and found that this particular one is subject to the negative
procedure. I can assure the Minister of that; it is not subject to the
affirmative procedure.</div>
					<a name="07070354000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">That raises two questions:
first, should we modify a Bill at all? And secondly, if we should do
so, should it be done in a way that is wholly unamendable and unlikely
to be challenged? That raises general propositions and principles that
I have rehearsed time and time again. I am against that procedure. If
we are to amend Bills by way of order, I think that it should be done
using the affirmative resolution procedure. In general, in fact, I am
very much in favour of the super-affirmative resolution procedure,
which enables the House to consider whether it wishes changes to be
made to the draft before it comes before it for resolution.</div>
					<a name="07070354000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, however, I
strongly suspect that the Minister will make an unhelpful response, and
I am conscious that on this matter the Committee is unlikely to be with
me. I suspect, therefore, that we will not be voting on
it.</div>

44 without my getting the chance to practise my newly gained
understanding of what it actually means&#151;I did an awful lot of
work on it. But there we are! No doubt, it will come in handy at some
point.</div>
					<a name="07070354000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
from the way in which the right hon. and learned Gentleman moved his
amendment that he is continuing his campaign for the powers of the
House to be as he thinks that they ought to be. I fully understand
that. He has assured me that these order-making powers come under the
negative procedure, but as I understand it clause 79(3) states that
amendments made under clause 46(6) will be subject to the affirmative
procedure. If that is incorrect, I shall get my lawyers to have another
look&#151;</div>

for our intention that it be subject to the affirmative procedure, but

correct, perhaps I should invite him to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						</b> The Minister is correct. I had overlooked clause
79(3) or at least did not spot the reference to clause 46(6). None the
less, I would have favoured the super-affirmative resolution, because,
of course, the affirmative resolution procedure does not enable the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>House to amend an order. She could come forward, therefore, with a raft
of amendments under the provisions, and the House will have to take
them either in totality or not at all, whereas in fact we might like
some amendments but not others. That is another objection to the
affirmative resolution procedure. However, she is right and deserves
congratulations for having spotted my error. On that basis and, indeed,
on others, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

to 143 are additions that we should like to make to the schedule. The
original list of offences was taken from the Law Commission&#146;s
draft Bill. It did a lot of work on identifying offences that ought to
be excluded as belief offences, and we were grateful for that. During
the Bill&#146;s passage through Parliament my officials have been
conducting a trawl of existing legislation, as officials do at such
times, to see whether the Law Commission managed to identify all the
offences that ought to be in the schedule. They have found a number of
additional offences. We added some on Report in the other place and
indicated that we thought there might be more to come, and the
amendments contain the extra offences that we have discovered. They are
all consistent with those included in the original Law Commission draft
Bill.</div>

these further additions will provide us with a final, complete list. It
is a hostage to fortune for me to have said that, but I hope that these
are the last amendments that we will need to make to the schedule.

Landmines Act 1998 of encouraging, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>assisting or inducing an offence. Amendment No. 141 will add a list of

Eagle:
						</b> The speed with which the Committeeis
working this afternoon is extremely impressive, Mr. Benton;
it must have something to do with your chairmanship.</div>
					<a name="07070354000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments and the new
clause tidy up two aspects of part 2. Government amendments Nos. 146
and 147 relate to schedule 6. The schedule lists various references in
current legislation to the common law offence of incitement, which we
are now putting on a statutory footing. Clause 58(1) provides that,
following the commencement of part 2, those references should be read
as references to the offences in clauses 41, 42 and 43.</div>
					<a name="07070354000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments add a couple of
references to schedule 6. The result is that they will be read also as
references to the new offences of assisting and encouraging in clauses
41 to 43. Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>amendment No. 146 adds the reference to the common law offence of
incitement in section 29(6)(i) of the Criminal Procedure and
Investigations Act 1996; it sets out the meaning of &#147;terrorism
offence&#148; for the purpose of the requirement to hold a
preparatory hearing. Government amendment No. 147 adds the reference to
paragraph 12(b) of schedule 1 to the Terrorism Act 2006, which refers
to inciting a convention offence. That will now be read as a reference
to the offences in part 2. The amendments put the old common law
offences on a statutory footing.</div>
					<a name="07070354000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government new clause 9 deals
with the relationship between the new offences of encouraging and
assisting, and the new offence of corporate manslaughter. As the
Committee will know, the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide
Bill has yet to complete its proceedings in Parliament, and we need to
consider the application of part 2 of the Serious Crime Bill in that
context.</div>
					<a name="07070354000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of
those who participated in discussions on the corporate manslaughter
Bill, which I may yet be dealing with, will be aware that the new
offence is aimed at holding organisations to account for gross
corporate negligence that kills someone. Because it is targeted at
corporate negligence, the offence applies to the organisation and not
to individuals. Secondary liability is specifically excluded. That
point was considered at length in the context of the corporate
manslaughter Bill, and we obviously cannot reopen that debate today.
However, there is some overlap between the new &#147;assisting and
encouraging&#148; offences and the current rules of secondary
liability.</div>
					<a name="07070354000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill therefore needs to
be updated to reflect those new offences. That will go slightly further
that the corporate manslaughter Bill does at present, because liability
will also be excluded if the primary offence&#151;that of corporate
manslaughter&#151;has not been committed. That is currently covered
by the law on incitement, and the Serious Crime Bill does not
specifically exclude liability in that respect.</div>
					<a name="07070354000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">The prospect of prosecutions
for inciting the new offence is remote in practice, but that does not
mean that things should not be tidied up. There is some doubt as to
whether a company can be incited under the criminal law, and there are
particular difficulties with the notion of encouragement in that
context, other than in circumstances where all the relevant fault lies
with an individual. That would be dealt with under the current law of
manslaughter, rather than through the corporate manslaughter
Bill.</div>

							<a name="07070354000656"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> Obviously, the corporate manslaughter Bill has yet
to complete its passage through Parliament. It is extremely
controversial, however, and it is possible that agreement will not be
reached between our House and the other place.</div>
					<a name="07070354000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">What happens in such
circumstances?</div>

Eagle:
						</b> Ping-pong. However, I need not detain the Committee
in that regard, because we believe that it makes more sense to exclude
all applications of part 2&#151;the issue that we are dealing with in
respect of this Bill&#151;to corporate manslaughter. In that sense,
it does not matter how the Bill ends up. We need to ensure that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>any important references relate directly across the Bills, and we will
remove this addition if the corporate manslaughter Bill is not passed.
The key point is that if that Bill falls as a result of ping-pong, we
will not need to make the cross-references. I hope that that explains
the
amendment.</div>

Brokenshire:
						</b> I hear what the Minister says about the
detailed and technical nature of most of the amendments. May I put on
record the fact that in not seeking to oppose new clause 9 at this
stage, we are not in any way rowing back on any of the concerns that we
have expressed about the corporate manslaughter Bill? On the basis of
the Minister&#146;s assurances that if that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>Bill is not passed, new clause 9 will be removed on Report, we are happy
to welcome the amendments as being of a technical nature, and will not
seek to oppose them.</div>
