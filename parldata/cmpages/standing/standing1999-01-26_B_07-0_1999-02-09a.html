<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. This morning, my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) said that we wished to press amendment No. 94 to a vote, but the opportunity did not arise. Will it do so later?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I beg to move amendment No. 168, in page 8, line 12, leave out `as soon as practicable' and insert `within 30 days'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 167, in page 8, line 12, after ``prepare'', insert ``and publish''.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(c) revise the performance plan accordingly where practical and appropriate, and
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In your absence, Mr. O'Brien, a consensus has been developing in the Committee concerning the desire for openness, and to publish things, to make available the results of best value plans. The amendments relate to that process. We also wish to ensure that local authorities publish responses to the audit of best value plans. Amendment No. 168 would provide in clause 9(2) for authorities to prepare a statement in response to a report within 30 days rather than as soon as is practicable. I fear that if we allowed the phrase ``as soon as practicable'' to remain in the Bill, we would open up the possibility of an authority giving all sorts of reasonable excuses for not producing a statement in good time. For example, if an audit report proved embarrassing for an authority, it might be tempted to avoid the issue until, say, after an election. This applies also to publication of reports, to which we shall come later.
<P>
Amendment No. 167 would provide for the publishing of statements. The Bill does not yet provide for that. If reports are to be published, so should statements, so that the public are fully aware of how their authority is responding to criticism.
<P>
Amendment No. 169 would allow for the possibility of an authority having a view different from the auditor's about the nature of the report, and for the statement to say
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where appropriate, giving reasons for non-compliance with any guidance or specifications laid down by the Secretary of State under section 6'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which may have been identified in the report. That is quite an important addition because it suggests that we want a dialogue between the Government and local government about the nature and value of a service as audited in the best value plan, not simply a one-way street of intstructions from the Government.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 170, 171 and 172 have been somewhat overtaken by events in view of relevant Government amendments. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary of State for Wales who earlier circulated information about the effect of Government amendments on the clause, to which I want to speak. Our amendments do not apply to the Government amendments but I hope that the Minister will reflect on their intent and consider incorporating their spirit later in our proceedings.
<P>
Amendment No. 170 would create a 30-day limit. The updated clause 9(1)&#151;Government amendment No. 56&#151;states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A best value authority shall publish any report received in accordance with section 7(5)(a)'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and our amendment would ensure that that is ``within 30 days''. Let me provide an example to explain why I raise the issue.
<P>
In December 1997 the social services inspectorate produced a damning report about the standard of child care in the London borough of Ealing. Copies went to the chief executive, the council leader, the social services committee chair and others. However, the council refrained from publishing the report for five months until after the London borough elections of May 1998. When the report was subsequently released, the council said that it had been delayed on the recommendation of the social services inspectorate which had instructed that it should not be released so close to an election.
<P>
I question whether the social services inspectorate should be able to make such a recommendation. It is also questionable whether that was indeed the intention of the inspectorate. The matter of the internal circulation of the report was left by the inspectorate to the council. There was no stipulation by the opposition that it should have been withheld: it was left to the choice of council members and officers who received the report.
<P>
The delay was crucial in keeping out of the public domain during a critical election period a report that led the responsible Minister&#151;a Labour Minister&#151;to describe Labour-run Ealing as ``incompetent beyond belief''. It also led to calls from the local press over successive weeks for the resignation of the Labour chair of social services. Had it been known before the local elections of May 1998 it would obviously have been a major issue. The director took early retirement as a result of the report, which confirms how serious it was.
<P>
We thus want the Bill to stipulate that any salient reports should be in the public domain within a set period so that local authorities cannot abuse any of their discretions. That also applies, in amendment No. 171, to any proposed action that a local authority might take. The new provision, clause 9(3), states that an authority should ``as soon as practicable'' prepare a statement of any action that it proposes to take as a result of a report&#151;and we believe that that should also be ``within 30 days''. It should not be left to councils to decide how practicable it is. A severely critical report requiring remedial action by the authority should be treated as a matter of urgency. If the 30-day stipulation were not met, the authority would be in breach of the Act and, if legal proceedings followed, it would have to explain why not. Surely it should be possible to produce something in 30 days to satisfy the legal requirement and clarify what an authority proposes to do about the problem.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 172 would introduce new elements, which tackle an aspect of the Bill that mystifies me. The Bill provides for a local authority to construct a best value plan in the late months of a financial year in preparation for the next financial year. At the beginning of the next financial year, the best value plan is put into operation, audited and criticised. Yet the only requirement on the authority is to include any report, recommendation or statement in the next best value plan. Why is not the authority obliged to change the existing plan, where practical, in the light of any criticisms?
<P>
Amendment No. 172 would provide for a local authority to,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(c) revise the performance plan accordingly where practical and appropriate, and
<P>
(d) take appropriate action to implement the recommendations of the report.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The report should contain recommendations that can be implemented. The current tendency in local authorities is to put everything in an apparently orderly way, which extends the process over an unnecessarily long period.
<P>
If best value is to work, it should lead to speedy remedial action. Our amendments aim to achieve that, and provide for maximum openness without delaying the publication of the report or the local authority's response.
<P>
I am worried that if those points are not reflected or included in the Bill, the best value process will be extremely long. We hope that best value works and that it improves the performance of local authorities. We all support that.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales </B>(Mr. Jon Owen Jones): I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. O'Brien, as I welcome many of the constructive points that the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) made.
<P>
Preparation of a statement in response to audit is the first step that a best value authority must take to right any wrongs that the auditor's report highlights. By giving the authority a fixed period in which to prepare the statement, amendment No. 168 would ensure that the process was not dragged out and that the statement was prepared while there was still time in the relevant financial year for the authority to act on it. The statement is intended to inform the authority, the commission and, where relevant, the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales of the authority's proposed response to the auditor's criticism. If the Secretary of State or the Assembly received a copy of the statement promptly, the auditor's recommendation could be considered promptly. That would give the authority time to respond to any action that the Secretary of State proposed to take in the financial year that was covered by the performance plan.
<P>
I welcome the broad principles of amendments Nos. 168 and 170. They would ensure the timely processing of recommendations for intervention. However, the amendments do not specify when the period in which best value authorities must respond should begin.
<P>
In view of our proposed amendments to clause 9, I shall table amendments that would specify such a period. The Government reserve the right to set a period that is reasonable and broadly consistent with other legislation.
<P>
Let us consider amendment No. 167. The statement prepared by the authority is intended to inform the authority, the Audit Commission and, where relevant, the Secretary of State or the Assembly, of the authority's proposed response to the auditor's suggestions. The statement would be published as part of the next performance plan, at which point the public would not just have access to the statement, but would be able to make a judgment on the way in which the authority had begun to implement it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Why should not the statement be published sooner than that, given that it would be relevant to an existing performance plan? Part of the problem of competitive tendering is that it tends to be retrospective, yet the advantage of the early audit of a plan is that it concerns the here and now. Why should the public not have early access to it? Indeed, will councillors be denied access to such a statement? Should not it be published automatically, as a matter of course?
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> There is no difference between us on the need for prompt action. I shall come to the question of when to publish in a moment.
<P>
For the majority of stakeholders, the level of information that I have outlined is likely to be satisfactory. However, we do not envisage that the statement will be a secret document prior to its publication in the next plan. We should expect authorities to make statements available to those who wanted to see them. There is, however, a significant difference between that and the time and resource implications of publishing the statement. It would be far more appropriate, particularly in terms of best value, for authorities to devote their time and resources to putting right any issues raised by the auditor, than to spend them on publishing the details of how they were going to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is perfectly reasonable, but, supposing a critical best value report were published and an external contractor wanted to find out what the local authority intended to do in response to that, would it be possible to get hold of the statement, or could the council withhold it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I am tempted to think on my feet and say that that sounds perfectly reasonable to me, but, in view of the position that I am in, I shall return to the hon. Gentleman's query later. As I said, I believe that there is no difference between us as to what we want to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry (Skipton and Ripon):</B> What does the Minister mean by the word ``publish''? Presumably, making the material available on the internet would be simple. Surely he is not saying that the time and resources needed to do that would be excessive. Is not that the answer? People who wanted it could find it. The Government do that in spades.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Mention of publishing on the internet reminds me of detailed discussion taking place in the Welsh Office about how much material from the Welsh Assembly should be placed there, when and in what languages. I suppose the question of what ``publish'' means arises.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Think about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> It seems dangerous for a Minister to think about two things at the same time, but I shall, in this instance also&#151;the matter of publication on the internet&#151;return later to the right hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
Amendment No. 169 is unnecessary. A key function of the audit of performance plans is to consider the extent to which the plan accords with the statutory requirements, including any guidance or specifications laid down by the Secretary of State or Assembly under clause 6. Where an auditor's report identified a failure to do so, an authority would, in preparing a statement of proposed action, be expected to deal with the reasons for non-compliance. In addition, identified shortcomings in performance would be taken up in best value reviews.
<P>
The Secretary of State or Assembly would take the statement into account in deciding what action should be taken. In reaching that decision, factors that the Secretary of State or Assembly could take into consideration would include an authority's failure to address the reasons for non-compliance with any guidance or specification laid down by the Secretary of State or Assembly. Authorities will be aware of that and, in preparing a statement of proposed action, they should be conscious of the importance of ensuring that it is comprehensive. I hope that Opposition Members are reassured by that explanation and will not press amendment No. 169.
<P>
Amendment No. 171 would require the auditor's report to be incorporated in the authority's next performance plan. I am grateful to hon. Members for raising this subject. I agree that it is sensible to ensure that the auditor's report is published. As currently drafted, clause 9 does not require publication of the auditor's report, however Government amendment No. 56, which we discussed earlier, will place a requirement on best value authorities to publish any report received from the auditor relating to the authority's performance plans.
<P>
That differs slightly from the hon. Member's amendment in that the report will be published as a free-standing document. That is preferable to incorporating it in the next performance plan. It will allow the report to be published more quickly and will help to ensure that the performance plan itself remains a clear and concise document. I therefore trust that Opposition Members will be reassured and will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 172 raises important issues about how recommendations for improvement by the auditor are translated into practical action by the best value authority concerned. I am again grateful to hon. Members for introducing this into the debate. It is clear that one of the outcomes that we are seeking is that best value authorities should have the opportunity to rectify their shortcomings wherever possible and that they should do so swiftly, effectively and in a thoroughly transparent way. I understand that hon. Members are seeking to achieve that outcome, but believe that the Bill, as currently drafteed, will deliver the same result without introducing a new level of detail into the Bill.
<P>
The combined effect of Government amendments Nos. 56 and 57 to clause 9, which we will move in their appropriate place, will be to ensure that, wherever an auditor identifies deficiencies in a local performance plan, authorities will be required to act in two ways. They will need to prepare a statement of what they intend to do to address the recommendations raised and identify a timetable for doing so. This information will need to be incorporated in the next performance plan. Local people will therefore be well placed to assess how the authority is performing and how effectively it is tackling those problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his generous response. I am particularly gratified that he has accepted in principle amendments Nos. 168 and 170. I hope that he will come back to amendment No. 167 because it seems sensible to address that before we continue. I do not fully understand his problem with the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry).
<P>
As for amendment No. 169, once again I fear, we are leaving things to the Secretary of State. At present, there is a clear obligation on the authority to make sure that the best value plan applies, taking into account any appropriate guidance. The purpose of this amendment is to give some credibility or defence to a local authority that clearly has a different view about how those obligations should be applied. At present it will be left in limbo if it chooses to stick to its interpretation. Amendment No. 169 aims to give it some locus for its view in the Bill, so that it has a legal platform on which to maintain it if it chooses. Ultimately, I am sure that the Secretary of State would win any hand-to-hand combat on later best value inspections and further important procedures. However, those issues are not as superfluous as he may have been advised.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that the Government amendments include the spirit behind amendment No. 172. I am happy to withdraw the amendment, and not to press the others with a caveat on amendment Nos. 167 and 169. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Clause 9 makes provision for an independent audit of plans. Clause 10 represents a change of gear, as it concerns best value inspections, which the Audit Commission carries out on what local authorities do. What flows from those inspections is most important, so we are getting to the meat of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 173 concerns to whom the Audit Commission must have regard when carrying out inspections. Whistle-blowers play an important role, as we have learnt from various scandals in organisations such as the Mirror group. Under the Bill, the Audit Commission may carry out an inspection of its own volition, but only if it complies with clause 7(4)(e), which specifies what should be included in an audit of a best value plan or what might arise from such plan or guidance issued by the Secretary of State.
<P>
We think that an additional safety valve is needed, as&#151;it has to be said&#151;the Secretary of State may not be totally unimpeachable in everything. Individuals with sufficient evidence and knowledge should be able to make their own representations to the Audit Commission, and the Audit Commission should be able to make an independent judgment about whether to make a best value inspection. In amendments to later clauses, we will debate what protections a whistle-blower might need and what status his evidence might have, but this is a simple amendment and I hope that the Government will look favourably upon it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am anxious to know the circumstances in which inspections might be carried out. As I read the clause, the Audit Commission may decide to carry out an inspection and it may be asked to carry out an inspection. I assume that those are two separate actions and that subsection (1) is not dependent on subsection (2). In what circumstances would the Minister expect the Audit Commission to decide that it wants to carry out an inspection, and who pays? In what circumstances might the Secretary of State direct an inspection, and, again, who pays?
<P>
The Secretary of State will not read local government performance reports; he will be advised in the first instance by regional officers, who will be on the spot and will monitor what is happening. They would get the recommendation and pass it to officials at the DETR, after which it would no doubt pass to the Minister with a recommendation that he perform an inspection. Is that likley to be a regular event or an exceptional circumstance? Is an inspection ordered by the Secretary of State much more serious than one by the Audit Commission? Is the Audit Commission simply inspecting to check that things are all right or because it thinks that there is a problem?
<P>
The clause looks innocuous but these are the sort of Priestley clauses in which ``An Inspector Calls''. I am anxious to know how often that will be, who pays him, at whose instigation and what he, or she, intends to find out and what local government can expect to happen once the clause is agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr Sanders:</B> At first sight, one questions whether this is necessary given that local councillors could raise the matter with the Audit Commission and that the Secretary of State may be able to force the Audit Commission to have regard to such a matter. The amendment is important, particularly where there is a one-party council with the same party label as the Secretary of State. It is important that, when a citizen feels that he has suffered an injustice and he can provide the evidence to justify an investigation, his views are taken into account. My only question for the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I shall when I have posed the question. Will the hon. Member for North Essex clarify what the amendment means by an interested party and whether that might not require further definition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> As the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, councillors already have a locus. I am thinking particularly of a council employee who might find it difficult to go to a political authority, but also perhaps an outside contractor. I make no apology for saying that. A company that was manoeuvred out of providing a service in favour of a direct labour organisation or a direct service organisation might believe that the council was ignoring or suppressing important information. In those circumstances, the Audit Commission should have an obligation to consider such information and decide whether it merits an investigation into the way in which a contract was tendered or a service was market tested, to ensure that the public receives high-quality services and good value for money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> That covers my question, although it may need to be spelt out later.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, as well as the local government ombudsman, who deals with injustice, people can approach the district auditor directly? Conservative councillors who are in a minority often do that when they object to councils' actions. Extensive investigations ensue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The hon. Lady makes a good point. However, on some councils, there are no opposition councillors who are free to make such representations. Therefore, the amendment is important.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> It is important that we understand the precise purpose of inspections and the arrangements that the Audit Commission is being asked to establish.
<P>
Clause 10 gives the Audit Commission a general power to inspect an authority's compliance with best value. It also gives the Secretary of State the power, in consultation with the commission, to direct the commission to carry out an inspection when he judges that to be necessary. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon is right to say that there are different sets of inspections, which will be carried out in different circumstances.
<P>
Objective and independent inspection was one of the key aims in the White Paper. The commission will set up the best value inspectorate, which will work alongside the existing statutory inspectorate to monitor all local services. The best value inspectorate will incorporate the housing inspectorate, which will focus on housing authorities' compliance with best value.
<P>
The commission recently published a consultation paper, which was entitled, ``Principles of Public Inspection''. It explains the way in which the commission intends to carry out inspections. A summary of the document was given to Committee members last week.
<P>
Clause 10 gives the Secretary of State power to issue guidance to the commission on its methods of inspection. That guidance will be prepared only after consultation with the commission and representatives of best value authorities. It will build on the experience of the existing inspectorate and on the principles of the commission's consultation paper.
<P>
We are considering a complex matter. Freestanding statutory inspectorates already exist. We must ensure that the best value inspectorate's work complement that of the other inspectorates. Therefore, the clause requires careful thought and debate.
<P>
The question of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon asked whether the Audit Commission will decide on the regular inspections. Included in the review will be the template from which the authority would intend to work when drawing up its best value plans over a five-year period. One reason for wanting that to be available early is to enable the Audit Commission to set out a programme of inspections. The intention is to ensure that regular inspections take place, as happens under Ofsted. It might help if I mention that in setting departmental targets we would aim to have every housing department, for example, inspected in the first five-year period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I was thinking of the Ofsted parallel, since the inspections will apply to all authorities on a regular basis. Ofsted gives notice of its intention to inspect a school&#151;normally, six to eight months' notice, which is a long time. We have discussed notice under previous clauses. I assume that because the inspections would be regular and not related to behaviour, quite long notice would be given.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Yes, we intend that, which is why I said that the Audit Commission would draw up a programme, from which authorities could tell when they were likely to be inspected. It is important that the commission co-ordinates the activity, so that half a dozen inspections would not take place in one half year. A clear, organised programme would be needed.
<P>
The inspections that the Secretary of State would ask the Audit Commission to undertake would be required for specific reasons&#151;most probably prima facie evidence of failure or serious problems. I am happy to provide the right hon. Gentleman with more information about that aspect of the matter if he would like it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Before the Minister leaves this subject, I want to return to my question about charging. Would charges be incurred with respect to the regular Audit Commission inspections and when inspections were requested by the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The Bill provides for charges&#151;as we have discussed, the Audit Commission will set out a scheme of charges&#151;and for grant, either direct to the Audit Commission or through the rate support grant. We envisage a combination of the two, which is the subject of discussion and consultation between the Government, the Audit Commission and the Local Governement Association. Matters stand differently in other inspectorates at present, and we are working towards a degree of complementarity in the system. We need to consider whether the same charging and fee structure would relate to both types of inspection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> It would presumably be a reasonable assumption that a charge would almost certainly be incurred for the first sort of inspection&#151;when the local authority would bring in its auditor for initial inspection of its proposals. The Minister said that the Audit Commission would set a scale of charges. When the Audit Commission carries out what we have agreed to call an Ofsted-type inspection&#151;not in response to a failure but to ensure that everyone is up to scratch and that the system is working&#151;it will be reasonable for that charge not to be incurred by the local authority but to be supported externally. Where the Secretary of State sends the Audit Commission into an authority because of a failure, it should be mandatory that the local authority should feel the pain, and therefore that it should support the charge. Perhaps as it gets better, the authority will be inspected less frequently and the pain will become less.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The right hon. Gentleman raises difficult issues. As he knows, as that principle applies to Ofsted, it is the other way round at present. That is why we must continue to try to reach an understanding with local government and with the other inspectorates about how we implement the powers in the Bill. I am not trying to be difficult; I am simply trying to be honest about a complex matter.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 173 would make the Audit Commission legally obliged to consider representations from, for example, service users, local organisations and any other parties with an interest.
<P>
I acknowledge the importance of ensuring that inspections respond to the priorities of local communities. For example, when there are serious concerns about a service in a particular authority, the commission should consider an early inspection. That is right. The Audit Commission would become aware of a failing service through a number of sources, including district audit, and through the audit of the performance plan. No doubt some of the interested parties to which the amendment refers will also seek to let the Audit Commission or the Secretary of State know of their concerns whatever the Bill prescribes. But in the end, it is the Audit Commission's responsibility to draw up its inspection programme to respond to such priorities. But if the commission was required, in primary legislation, to have regard to that range of representations, the commission would find it much more difficult to draw up its programme.
<P>
I have already explained some of the factors which it is important that the commission takes into account in drawing up its programme. It is likely that some of those representations will be in conflict with each other, while others may have been made for perverse reasons. Nor will such representations necessarily take account of the resource implications for the commission of what is being asked.
<P>
Some of the matters raised by the hon. Members for North Essex and for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) would be more effectively addressed to the ombudsman or through the standards and ethics procedure. It is important to be clear that best value inspections will not be some sort of hoover to take up any complaint or anxiety about the authority, or about its members or officers. The White Paper set out a new ethical framework on which we hope to legislate. There is a clear code of practice; the issue of whistleblowers and how they should be protected, especially if they are members of the work force, is clearly identified in the White Paper. It is important not to mix everything into one issue.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The Minister makes an important point. I did not give her an example earlier, but I shall do so now. What would happen in the case of a council officer who was aware that his authority was fiddling the figures in one of the indicators of best value? That officer would need protection if he went to the auditor and explained how that figure, which may be false, was reached.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I agree that the officer needs protection, but the Bill is not the place to spell that out. The authority would be fraudulent if it fiddled the figures, and that problem may be tackled by other means.
<P>
We do not need to include a separate whistleblower's charter in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman knows that the Government are anxious that whistleblowers should have protection. I am not convinced that inspections would provide such protection, which should be furnished by other means.
<P>
The Secretary of State's guidance will be sufficient to ensure that the Audit Commission responds appropriately to concerns expressed by interested parties. We understand the concerns raised by the hon. Member for North Essex, but his amendment is not helpful or, indeed, necessary. I therefore hope that he will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her thoughtful response. We have raised a real issue, but she has stumbled into another issue by raising the variety of inspection regimes for different functions for which the Audit Commission will be responsible. The commission will be responsible for a best value inspection regime and the ordinary audit. As the Minister said, there should be complementarity between different inspection regimes.
<P>
We have flagged an important issue, and await legislation on the ethical framework for local government. It is difficult for us to judge how the Bill should be framed in the absence of such legislation. However, I trust the Minister's assurances, and therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made, No. 58, in page 8, leave out lines 32 to 39.&#151;[Ms Armstrong.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I missed amendment No. 58, which skidded past before I had a chance to speak to it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It was discussed earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I understand that.
<P>
Under the clause stand part debate, I should like to deal with the inspection of police authorities. Police authorities have told me of their concern about the double inspection regime. Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary inspects the police, but that body does not inspect police authorities. The Government are considering changes to inspections that will put retired chief constables in a position in which they may have to inspect their former police authorities. Have I understood that correctly? Will the Minister elaborate on representations that she may have received from police authorities on this matter?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> This is an important clause, which gives rise to a number of issues. I have said that co-ordination of inspectorates is most important. I would not be too concerned if, in the best value inspection of, say, police authorities, an authority happened to use ex-chief constables. It might bring additional legitimacy to an inspection rather than remove it.
<P>
It is important that hon. Members remember what we said earlier: inspections would be complementary, not inspections of the same. Operational matters will remain outside the best value inspectorate but it is important that other aspects of police authorities be subject to best value. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is keen on that. It may help the Committee if I say a little more on what we intend to do about co-ordination of inspection.
<P>
It is important to recognise that the Audit Commission will work alongside the existing specialist inspectorates. The Bill confers on the Audit Commission which does not at present have powers to inspect local authorities. The commission will inspect services not now subject to inspection, such as housing and highway maintenance. The commission is consulting on principles of public inspection to inform its arrangements for carrying out this new function, including developing working methodologies and training and recruiting staff.
<P>
The existing specialist inspectorates are considering how to tailor their inspection regimes to ensure that the principles of best value are used. In other words, the specialist inspectorates, aware of what the Bill will do, are themselves considering it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Where housing stock has been transferred, not entirely into a private sector but into something like a community trust in which the local authority retains a shareholding but not a majority shareholding, will it come under the local authority housing best value inspectorate? What degree of ownership of housing stock must a local authority have before it becomes subject to best value examination?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The right hon. Gentleman raises another issue. The Housing Corporation, which has regulatory responsibility for the organisations that he mentioned, will also introduce best value. It has already set up pilot projects to examine best value, having itself been part of a best value housing team. Authorities will be inspected for their housing function, not only as landlords but from a strategic viewpoint.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The analogy is the police again.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Yes. The Housing Corporation is involved, and has set up approximately 25 pilot projects.
<P>
Existing inspectorates have, over time, developed and refined working practices for their inspections. Differences in working practice may result from custom, or stem from features of the service being inspected. The inspectorates and the Audit Commission have already worked together and adapted their methodologies to carry out joint inspections.
<P>
The introduction of best value will increase the need for joint working, partly because of new areas being inspected but also, we hope, because local authorities would choose to review their services using a themed cross-cutting approach rather than simply by traditional service blocks. For that reason, the Government will ensure that an inspectorate forum is established to discuss and agree on working practices, and, where appropriate, programmes of inspection. As well as communication between inspectorates, the forum will provide a mechanism for consultation and communication with best value authorities, Government and other interested parties.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We built our proposals for best value on the principles of consensus and co-operation. We strongly prefer to leave co-ordination to members of the inspectorate forum on a voluntary basis. However, we need a fall-back provision so that the Secretary of State can issue directions or guidance to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the inspection function. We are carefully considering the form of such a provision and if necessary will table an amendment later.
<P>
On police authority inspections, a memorandum of understanding has just been concluded between the Audit Commission and Her Majesty's inspectorate of police&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Constabulary.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Yes, constabulary. A shared responsibility for inspecting police authorities means that we have already moved further towards that shared understanding. I hope that that will reassure hon. Members. The clause also provides the Secretary of State with power to issue guidance to the commission on the manner in which it carries out inspections and the commission must have regard to it in carrying out the function.
<P>
We are considering, in consultation with other interested parties, what form a power should take for the Secretary of State to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the inspection process. Inspection is a vital part of the best value regime. It provides that external check, about which Opposition Members were concerned this morning, on the way in which an authority conducts performance reviews and on the robustness of performance targets that flow from them.
<P>
The clause also provides flexibility for prompt investigation of poor performance with regard to a key element of best value. That can only serve to strengthen local accountability, and I therefore move that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Will the Minister explore with me the forum, which has suddenly been introduced into the debate? I remember the film, ``A funny thing happened on the way to the forum''. ``Forum'' is one of those words in the English language with a possibly doubtful meaning, which makes me wonder what all this adds up to. It is rather like the word ``appropriate'', which is beloved of Departments because it substitutes for what is really meant.
<P>
We all agree that there will be a diverse series of inspection regimes, so it makes sense to ensure that local authorities are not assaulted from different directions on different subjects&#151;without any co-ordination. There should be a way to plan and the answer seems to be a forum. Does that mean getting together for a chat? If it is going to be co-ordinated, there will have to be a secretariat. There must be some organisation, so that if one group is going to do housing on Tuesday, another had better not do police until Wednesday to ensure that the local authority can cope.
<P>
Will the Minister explain who she expects to be the main inspectorates represented in the forum and what structure she expects the forum to take? Will there be headquarters, an office, a website&#151;to help the Under-Secretary of State for Wales&#151;or what? The Minister cannot simply say that there will be a forum and expect us all to say what a smashing idea that is. Can we know a little bit more about it? Who will be in it? Where will it be? Who will run it? Will anyone fund it? Will it cost money? These are important questions. We agree that the function is necessary, but we should like to know a bit more about what will happen at nine o'clock on Monday morning.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If it is nine o'clock on Thursday my right hon. Friend will be back in Committee. He has picked up a central issue. I understand that some 11 inspecting bodies will be involved in inspecting local authorities and services for which they are responsible. We need some more information about the forum. It would be interesting to see the memorandum of understanding that has been reached between Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary and the Audit Commission. The very fact that it has been reached between them suggests that there will be a strong ring-master in this arrangement of inspection, namely the Audit Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> It is the ring-mistress in this case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes, it is.
<P>
Have I read that correctly? Will the Audit Commission be the chief co-ordinator, say the chairman of the forum. Can the Minister also give us an assurance that, when the memorandums of understanding are produced, we will have them here in Committee? For example there are significant amendments to the Bill in new clause 6 which relates to section 8 of the Police Act 1996. It would be useful to have the memorandum of understanding between HMIC and the Audit Commission before we discuss that. I ask this in good faith as the Minister has generously given us the protocol that we discussed at our first sitting.
<P>
There is concern that there is a bit of empire building going on here. Great power is accruing not just to the Secretary of State but to the Audit Commission. If the Audit Commission is now to have a co-ordinating role with all the other inspections, it will not be long before someone has the bright idea that they all ought to be one body. That is what has happened in financial services. We had a number of different inspection bodies&#151;the self-regulatory authorities&#151;which divided between them, under the supervision of the Securities and Investments Board, the various categories of market instrument and market activity. In the end the Government decided that only one inspection regime was needed and that it will all be under one authority&#151;a statutory authority at that.
<P>
When hearing about forums, memorandums of understanding and amendments to the Bill at a later stage, one gets the feeling that perhaps all the thinking has not been done. I leave that point on the record because it suggests that we are feeling our way in rather less certain circumstances than we might at first imagine.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am surprised at Opposition Members. The forum was flagged up in the White Paper. The ideas really come from the processes that were embryonic under the previous Government. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon knows that joint inspections were beginning between the social services inspectorate and the Audit Commission. There have also been joint inspections between the Audit Commission and Ofsted and in the last few months there has been a joint inspection between the three as a pilot. Those separate inspectorates realised that, because they were not operating effectively together, some important issues were slipping down the middle.
<P>
It is not a question of empire building from one inspectorate or indeed from the Audit Commission. It is proper, reasonable and sensible, coming together recognising that&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Legitimate is the word the Minister is seeking.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is more than legitimate. It is a sensible thing to do. They are using their common sense to ensure that they are covering the different aspects more effectively. Hon. Members will appreciate that the first joint inspections were undertaken because efficiency had to be considered alongside quality&#151;there was a relationship between the two. The social services inspectorate was not meant to consider the financial aspects as well as the quality of the service. Indeed, it did not have the expertise to do so.
<P>
The Audit Commission did not have the expertise to consider the matters the SSI looks at, so it was sensible for them to act together. We have consulted the heads of the inspectorates and await their response. They already hold meetings and the forum will be developed from them.
<P>
The issue has been well thought out, but it is complex; no individual organisation is empire building. It will work if people come together recognising that they have an important contribution to make which must be co-ordinated effectively. We want to move forward through consensus and deliberation, with people who know their own area well but who need to link up with people in other areas to be fully effective.
<P>
We developed the idea of a forum in the White Paper from that perspective. As I said, it is being developed with all the inspectorates, not with one supremo but with proper, effective collaboration and co-operation between them, in a sensible regime which does not overburden the authorities with too many inspections at one time in a way that overloads the machine. It is important to explore the issues involved and I am pleased that we have done so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> What about the memorandum of understanding?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will see that it is made available. I said earlier that I would make available to hon. Members whatever was available to me and could be placed in the public domain. That certainly applies to what we are discussing today.
<P>
I hope that members of the Committee are reassured that we want to proceed in a straightforward way to the most effective outcome. The inspections should not compete with each other, but they should ensure that there are no gaps. We need the powers in the clause so that the Audit Commission has the statutory capacity to do what is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I want to be sure that I have understood the Minister. The main inspectorate must be the social services inspectorate&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> And Ofsted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The chief inspector of schools. A conversation between Mrs. Shovelton and Mr. Woodhead would no doubt be of interest in the light of recent circumstances. The Housing Corporation, the Audit Commission and Ofsted have specific missions; the Audit Commission can be called in under the terms of the Bill to carry out different functions. However, if I understand the Minister correctly, there is no machinery for that; people will just telephone each other because everything will be done informally. The Audit Commission would be the best organisation to play a co-ordinating role if that were required, but we are talking not about the creation of institutions, machinery and bureaucracy, but about what people call resources when they really mean money. If the Minister can confirm that it is intended to operate on what she described as a level of common sense, not institutionally, I shall be greatly reassured.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is probably true that there will need to be a secretariat. We are discussing with the heads of inspectorates what that would involve, where it would be located and the form that it would take. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we would want it to be small, and well focused in ensuring that executive co-operation is facilitated, and happens, rather than that a whole new bureaucracy be set up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> It would be extremely helpful if the Minister was able to report on the progress of those conversations so that, before the Bill is finally dispatched, we can have an idea of what it will look like.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Inspectors' powers and duties</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move the amendment No. 176, in page 9, line 8, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) Any person required to assist the inspector with his inquiries under this section shall be entitled to legal advice and representation at any meeting he may be required by an inspector to attend under this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	(2B) Any legal expenses incurred by a person assisting the inspector under subsection (2A) may be met by the authority.'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 150, in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>page 9, line 20, leave out subsection (6).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I would understand if some members of the Committee thought that perhaps I had gone a bit over the top with these two amendments because they are very much worst-case-scenario-type amendments. However, clause 11 makes it clear that inspections are intended to have teeth, that the teeth are intended to bite, that the bite might hurt people, and that as it hurts, people will want to hide things. Therefore, there is all the familiar panoply of the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise, right of entry, right to see papers, and offences under criminal law if inspections are obstructed in any way. We are dealing with value for money and contracts, the positions of trade union shop stewards, jobs for the boys&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> And girls.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg the Committee's pardon&#151;and for the girls. We are dealing with all that in relation to some of our less salubrious local authorities. In some of the worst cases, money is being siphoned off into criminal organisations&#151;unfortunately that has happened in some local authorities&#151;and there may be all kinds of pressures on people to withhold information. Therefore, it is absolutely right that such powers should be available in any proper inspection regime.
<P>
Amendment No. 176 relates to protection for persons whom the inspector may require to give information, or who may be accountable for documents provided to him. My proposed new subsection (2A) would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any person required to assist the inspector with his inquiries''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I choose the language advisedly&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall be entitled to legal advice and representation at any meeting he may be required by an inspector to attend under this section.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The reason for that is simple&#151;a person who is asked to provide information may end up incriminating himself. It is traditional in our system of criminal law that where a person gives information to the police, he is entitled to properly conducted interviews and legal representation, and should not be put in a position where he answers questions that may prejudice a later case against him. The amendment would simply provide people with their legal rights.
<P>
When we want to get to the bottom of inquiries, arrangements may need to be made to protect individuals from prosecution so that they turn up with the information. The amendment would provide such protection. The proposed subsection (2B) in the amendment provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any legal expenses incurred by a person assisting the inspector under subsection (2A) may be met by the authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Information given to the Audit Commission by a councillor or group of councillors may turn out to be false, but an extensive review and the exercise of powers under the clause to obtain information may force certain people to give evidence. There may be a good case for giving them legal representation and for compensating them at the end of the process, particularly if they prove to be innocent of any suspicion. In those circumstances, I am sure that the Minister would want basic human rights to be accorded to those individuals. An assurance is given on the front of the Bill that it accords&#151;according to the Secretary of State&#151;with the European convention on human rights.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Yes. It already does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Well, I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that. It is a serious issue, and I mean that in all seriousness.
<P>
We are creating in local government ever more onerous responsibilities for councillors and, it has to be said, ever less discretion for councillors to carry out their functions as they see fit. It is becoming ever harder to find people of calibre to serve in public life in positions of responsibility. Some of the serious issues may be dealt with in a later Bill but I make no apology for raising them now.
<P>
Perfectly innocent people could be advised not to provide information for fear of creating circumstances in which they would be liable to prosecution even though they were not responsible for an offence. The right to silence is a fundamental human right and we should perhaps provide for it in the Bill. I thus move amendment No. 176 in all seriousness and hope that the Minister will respond thoughtfully to it.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I have some sympathy with the thinking behind amendment No. 176, which is about making legal advice and respresentation available to those having to assist an inspector in his inquiries. However, the new subsection (2B) is in direct conflict with the amendment to which I want to speak&#151;amendment No. 150. I am also concerned that it raises the spectre of the poor council tax payers of Westminster having to provide legal expenses for Lady Porter. I ought then to declare an interest&#151;along with some other members of the Committee&#151;as one of those council tax payers.
<P>
Amendment No. 150 is a probing amendment to clarify costs. How widely does the Minister envisage the inspection powers will be used? She touched earlier on whether they would apply to areas in which inspection powers already exist. She may have said that they would not, but I would like her to reiterate it as I may have missed it or not heard it clearly. If the powers were widely used, they would clearly impact on a local authority's finances.
<P>
Subsection (6) states that costs may be recovered from other sources, so will the Minister tell us what sources, so will the Minister tell us what sources she has in mind? Currently, even if an ombudsman upholds a case of maladministration against a local authority, the cost of the ombudsman's service does not come out of the local authority's budget. Will the Minister expand on the difference between the two regimes and explain why these costs should come out of the local authority budget?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The clause gives an inspector the power of entry to a best value authority's premises, and associated rights to see relevant documents that are held by the authority and to speak to those who prepared such documents.
<P>
Inspectors' experience suggests that most inspections are carried out in a spirit of co-operation and trust. However, the fundamental changes that best value introduces will not be popular with all authorities. The reserve power will enable the inspection regime to be applied fairly to every best value authority. The Bill makes unreasonable failure to comply with inspectors' requests an offence.
<P>
The inspection process is important. It will give local people a detailed view of their authority's performance. It will enable an authority to check its performance monitoring against an objective report. It will also enable the Government to ascertain how the policy is working.
<P>
The reserve powers are necessary to ensure that inspections can take place.
<P>
The powers of access in the clause mirror those that already exist in other measures. Clause 11(2) provides inspectors with powers that are expected to be used only in extreme circumstances, when an inspector meets resistance to his inspection. While I recognise that those persons called to give assistance to inspectors should not be legally disadvantaged, amendment No. 176 is a massive overreaction, when, in many cases, the power will be used only to enable the inspector to obtain clarification or to seek further contextual information that only the relevant individual can provide.
<P>
Inspectors will, of course, be aware of the legal rights of those they interview as part of any inspection, and they must have regard to people's concerns about the use that is made of the information that they provide. It is disappointing that Opposition Members seek to impute sinister intent to a provision that is designed to ensure that inspectors have access to all the material that they need to do their job.
<P>
The amendment could have enormous cost implications for authorities if all their officers who met the inspector chose to have legal representation when doing so. We fully expect local authority lawyers to be involved in the inspection process, but if lawyers are there as watchdogs the process could become unnecessarily confrontational. We are trying to avoid that through the repeal of compulsory competitive tendering.
<P>
Clause 11 is designed to equip best value inspectors with the tools that they need to do an effective job. I remind the Committee that inspectors act as guardians of the interests of ordinary people by ensuring that authorities carry out their legal obligations in a manner that puts the interests of their local community ahead of any other vested interest. The amendment appears to ignore that.
<P>
I emphasise that the Bill does not override criminal or other aspects of law under which individuals give the sort of evidence that the hon. Member for North Essex described. In such circumstances, the other elements that the hon. Gentleman mentioned would have to be considered. However, we should not guarantee that the local authority will pay the costs of someone who is criminally culpable under the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is not what the amendment says.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Well, perhaps the amendment would not guarantee that the local authority paid the costs, but it implies that that is possible. Attempts, which I do not want to describe, have been made to introduce such provisions. They lead me to be cautious about accepting the amendment.
<P>
It is vital that inspectors can carry out their work unhindered. When they are prevented from doing so, they should not suffer a financial penalty if they are obliged to take legal action against those who do not comply with their requests. If subsection 11(6) were omitted, as amendment No. 150 proposes, the costs associated with the action may not be fully recoverable by the inspector or the Audit Commission. We want to ensure that those costs are fully recoverable.
<P>
Auditors already enjoy the protection of section 6(7) of the Audit Commission Act 1998, which is analogous to this clause and provided the basis for it. The provisions in the clause mirror those in the 1998 Act.

When it does become necessary for inspectors to make use of their powers under clause 11 formally to request access to buildings, documents or people&#151;in extreme cases to seek to have those failing to comply with such requests convicted&#151;it would be wholly inappropriate for that to lead to the Commission having to pay the cost of such an action. The Government believe that the cost should fall on the authority which is directly, or indirectly, responsible for the lack of access.
<P>
I hope that on reflection the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am concerned about the possibility of levying criminal charges against the failure to produce papers. Who, in practice, is likely to be on the receiving end of such a charge? Under the clause as drafted it could be a junior in the finance director's office. Am I right to assume that we are talking about the head of a department, a chief executive or the council leader? If so, once the process happens, the council must react and instruct its staff to co-operate with the inspector. The chairman of the committee may get together with the relevant official and say, ``Now Fred, how are we going to limit the damage here?'' In practice, a junior person will operate on the basis of instructions issued to her. If there is a problem of access, does the Minister think it reasonable that the inspector should deem the chief executive or the leader of the council to be the person to whom the clause should apply, because that is where the buck stops? I want to be sure that some poor little flunky will not have opprobrium heaped on him when more senior people should be on the receiving end. I should be grateful if the Minister would say what is likely to happen in practice.
<P>
The Minister said that she wanted to recover the costs. Subsection (6) states that expenses incurred
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``are, so far as not recovered from any other source, recoverable from the authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What are the other sources from which costs might be recovered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister's response was not very helpful. I agree with her in hoping that the inspections will be carried out in an atmosphere of mutual co-operation and enlightenment, as most audits are. The hon. Lady claims that my amendments foresee a more confrontational atmosphere, but so does the clause, which will come into force if an inspector feels that he is being obstructed. If the hon. Lady does not want confrontation, she had better remove the clause from the Bill. In the vast majority of circumstances the inspector would not need formally to invoke the powers for people to know that they had better hand the information to the inspector, because that is perfectly clear. Most people would want to do so.
<P>
We are providing the means for the inspector who is, after all, the Audit Commission's representative, to gather information. The Audit Commission has other duties concerning the audit of councils' accounts which lead to penalties and, ultimately, surcharge. The Government wish to change that and I look forward to debating that issue.
<P>
We cannot separate the information-gathering process from other such processes, because the same person is gathering information. So it is wrong to say that such matters dealing with best value are meant to be co-operative, and therefore protection cannot be provided. We must look at the world as it is. The inspector examining best value performance may stumble on all sorts of entrails and worms in the bowels of local government. Such inspections may well lead to criminal prosecutions or&#151;under the present regime&#151;to surcharge. Individuals may be prosecuted and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon said, we must consider who such individuals might be.
<P>
It is Parliament's duty to ensure value for money. However, it must, first and foremost, protect the liberty of the individual or&#151;as we used to say&#151;the subject. It is unfashionable to use such a term today: we are citizens, not subjects. Parliament must protect the liberty of public-spirited citizens who are generally not paid very much if they work for local authorities. If such people are councillors, they are giving up their own time and putting themselves on the line in the service of the public. The least we can do is make it overt that such people should have protection.
<P>
The Minister wilfully&#151;that is the phrase of the day&#151;misinterpreted my proposed subsection (2B), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any legal expenses incurred by a person assisting the inspector under subsection (2A) may be met by the authority.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The operative word is ``may'': the local authority is not obliged to meet such expenses.
<P>
Placing such an obligation on local authorities might lead to complaints. Therefore, it would be sensible to follow the practice in business whereby directors and senior company officers have directors and officers' liability insurance. In the event that people are falsely pursued by regulatory authorities, courts, debtors or other claimants, and incur large legal expenses, they should not be allowed to fall into bankruptcy simply because they cannot afford legal expenses.
<P>
I do not wish to refer to particular cases, but I can think of one in which a person who was wrongly pursed committed suicide because the consequences of legal expenses were so daunting. We do not want to put good people off serving in public life: they deserve protection.
<P>
I would have been happy to withdraw amendment Nos. 176 and 150, but I am now inclined to ask the Committee to divide on the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> We might want to come back to this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes, my right hon. Friend might want to intervene or we might want to come back to this later. I will heed his advice, but I am not happy with the Minister's reply. However, we may not have the whole picture because we have not seen the Government's draft legislation on ethics and logal government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson (North Shropshire):</B> I wholly endorse the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex. Will the Minister give us a practical example of what will happen in the real world? Clause 11(2)(b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a person holding or accountable for any such document''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What rank in local government will such a person hold? The concept of wilful misbehaviour has been thrown at us. I have not come across such a concept in any of my dealings with local government.&#151;[Interruption.] Hon. Members should not mutter from a sedentary position. We have this extraordinary idea that there could be behaviour that was wilful which has never been defined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White (Milton Keynes, North-East)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Just let me finish. We also do not know at what level of responsibility an inspector may be able to take action. Our amendment is mild. It simply allows that person, who may not have any great experience, to take legal advice.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was very interested in the remarks of the hon. Member for North Essex because the clause simply mirrors existing regulations and an existing provision with the current auditor. I hope that it will not need to be used. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon asked who would be liable. It is not possible to identify that person in the Bill. In some circumstances it might be the chief executive and in others the council leader. The clause refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a person holding or accountable for any such document''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I will not name names because the court case is taking place and the matter is sub judice, but there were allegations of documents being shredded. The auditor had to take action to stop that. There were further allegations which led to criminal prosecution. We know that in the real world that can happen. If it did happen like that, it was probably wilful. I do not think that that is an exaggeration. We are simply reproducing the clause as it applies in the Audit Commission Act 1998 which is a consolidatory measure. It is not new; it is what the Conservative Government put on the statute book. We are reflecting that in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I remonstrate with the hon. Lady. I know that we are not yet discussing amendment No. 174, but she will see that I am strengthening the position for the inspector to get immediate action to avoid any shredding. To suggest that we are placing obstacles in the way of that is to say something that is not the case and I resent it. I make no bones about the fact that the amendment to insert two new subsections is an implicit criticism of the regime that already exists.
<P>
As the hon. Lady knows from her review of the ethical framework, it is by no means perfect. Just to say, ``This is what your lot did when you were in office and so I don't know what you're complaining about'' is not how we conduct the Committee. We are open minded about the benefits of best value. We want to make it work. We want to make the inspection regime fair on individuals.
<P>
If I might briefly explain&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not resent anything. I do not resent what he is trying to do but he was labouring it somewhat and trying to make out that we were not concerned about the welfare of individuals. Of course we are of course concerned about that. We want them to have proper legal recourse should that be necessary. I said that I thought the amendment was overburdening and unnecessary. We must be sure that the inspectorate can defend the interests of the public and that those who work for the authority, or serve the authority in another capacity, acknowledge their responsibility to the public. They should make the necessary documents available. That should not lead to criminal prosecution because those involved with the local authority should not try to hide anything. If people behaved openly, the amendment would never be necessary.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I remind the Minister that I did not receive an answer to my earlier question about other sources.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am coming to that.
<P>
Other sources of provision for the planned inspections may be fees or grants, or a combination of both, as we discussed earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have finished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The debate has been more interesting than perhaps we anticipated. [Interruption.] That always surprises me. The hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) points out that I am becoming tedious and repetitive, which is probably out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I dissent from my hon. Friend's view. Yet again, I did not receive an answer to my request for a practical example from a real office. Who will get the blame? Who is liable? Our arguments have not been taken sufficiently seriously. We are considering the possibility of people being charged and found guilty of an offence, which will be a stain on their record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Several questions have been left unanswered. However, it would be inappropriate to seek to divide the Committee. I hope that the Government will reflect on the discussion. We may wish to return to the matter later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 174, in page 9, line 12, leave out from `inspector' to `must' in line 15.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 95, in page 9, line 13, leave out `three' and insert `seven'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The amendment would prevent an authority or frightened individuals from having the opportunity to start shredding documents before the inspector arrived. Under the clause, the inspector has to give three clear days' notice. That requirement should be omitted. An inspection can be truly beneficial when an inspector turns up unannounced, and no one has time to shred papers. The amendment would strengthen the inspection regime. I hope that the Minister will take the amendment as a gesture of good faith. It shows that we want the inspections to work and the inspectors to have the necessary powers to be the people's inspectors, as the Minister might say. Such powers must be accompanied by the right protection for individuals. The amendment is simple, and I hope that the Government will consider it.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Amendment No. 174 would remove the requirement for inspectors to give notice. That implies complete and utter distrust of what happens in the town hall, or the county hall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Wilful.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Wilful mistrust. We expect that from the Conservatives. Amendment No. 174 contrasts with the reasonable amendment No. 95, which suggests that a more reasonable period of notice should be given to local authorities. I would be interested to know the number of occasions on which matters have been so bad in local government that people have rushed around shredding documents to avoid discovery.
<P>
The clause gives the officer of the Audit Commission extensive powers to obtain information and explanations from any local authority. Clearly, any authority with nothing to hide would willingly comply with the inspection process. However, that process should not cause the entire work of the authority to grind to a halt as staff rush around to find any amount of documents required within three days. This is a probing amendment to establish what the Government mean by three days&#151;three working days, three days including the weekend, or what?
<P>
The notes accompanying the Bill&#151;showing that the Liberal Democrats are not the only ones concerned about the brief time period available&#151;tell us that the inspector's rights of access to premises go beyond the powers of auditors in the Audit Commission Act 1998. Does the requirement for a certain number of days reflect earlier legislation that is applicable to these circumstances?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Clause 11 mirrors provisions that apply to auditors under the Audit Commission Act 1998 when an extraordinary audit is required. It is not new. The powers in the 1998 Act relate to audits and we are duplicating those powers in respect of inspections. That is where the difference alluded to by the hon. Member for Taunton derives.
<P>
In the normal course of planning inspections, an inspector is likely to give several weeks' notice to the authority to ensure that the inspection is as constructive and useful as possible. However, I accept that there may be occasions&#151;in cases of serious failure of performance, for example&#151;when an urgent inspection is necessary. Indeed, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon urged me earlier to ensure that proper notice of regular inspections is given, as happens with Ofsted's school inspections. For urgent inspections, staff will usually need to make the necessary preparations: files may have to be identified and appropriate staff may need to be available.
<P>
There may be failures where an immediate response is required&#151;for example, when someone is at risk or when benefit fraud is suspected. However, powers already exist to respond immediately. A social services benefit fraud inspector may take action without notice if necessary&#151;likewise for the police when a criminal offence is suspected. As a general rule, when criminal activity is suspected, I would expect appropriate powers under relevant criminal law&#151;rather than best value inspection powers&#151;to be used. That is my response to the concerns raised by the hon. Member for North Essex. If his concerns are such as to involve criminal activities, other powers would need to be taken under different legislation. The auditor may not be the right person to deal with such activity.
<P>
The effect of amendment No. 174 would be to allow an inspector to give no minimum notice whatever when seeking access to premises, documents or information, or if he wants an explanation from any responsible person in an authority. He would be able to arrive unannounced on an unprepared authority. That would detract from the responsibility and accountability of the authority itself to put its own house in order. It would make it difficult for the inspectorate to build constructive relationships with authorities, and would in many cases lead to inefficiency for the inspector and unnecessary disruption for the authority.
<P>
In the light of my explanation of the Government's position, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw amendment No. 174.
<P>
Under amendment No. 95, best value authorities would be given advance notice of inspection, and we anticipate that the period of notice will usually, be more than seven days. The purpose of the clause is to give statutory weight to requests for information and assistance when the authority being inspected is not fully co-operating with the inspector.
<P>
We know from existing statutory inspectorates that most inspections take place in a spirit of co-operation. We therefore expect the clause to be used only as a last resort when that co-operation is not forthcoming.
<P>
Alternatively, where there is cause for concern, where, for example, evidence of serious fraud has come to light, there may be a need for an urgent, ad hoc inspection. In such circumstances, three days' notice is adequate for an authority to arrange access to a building, a document or person for an inspector. Again, the provisions mirror those found in section 25(4) of the Audit Commission Act 1998. I hope that in the light of that&#151;

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Does three clear days mean three working days?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Yes, it does. I hope that in the light of that the hon. Member for North Essex with withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 175, in page 9, line 25, at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(8) No information provided to the inspector under this section and no provisional findings arising from a best value inspection shall be disclosed save in a report pursuant to section 12.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 177, in clause 12, page 9, line 35, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and shall not make, publish, or permit to be published on its behalf, any comment relating to the inspection, save for the purpose of publicising the publication of the report.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Amendment No. 175 adds a new subsection which seeks to prevent the disclosure of inspection findings except in a report. To be honest, I do not know what duties of confidentiality the Audit Commission and its inspectors may have, but my understanding is that the Audit Commission has immunity from prosecution for any comments that it makes in pursuance of its duties. It would be possible for the Audit Commission and the inspector under the clause to gather information, draw conclusions from it and then disseminate its view on the matter, regardless of whether that was provable.
<P>
Amendment No. 177 prescribes what the Audit Commission can do with the report once it is produced. Clause 12(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Commission shall send a copy of a report to the authority concerned.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I propose adding:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and shall not make, publish, or permit to be published on its behalf, any comment relating to the inspection, save for the purpose of publicising the publication of the report.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The wording may not be perfect but the aim is that the report should speak for itself. The evidence gathered should be used for the construction of the report. The report should be framed to explain everything that the Audit Commission thinks is important about the evidence that has been gathered. It should not require embellishment or amplification in any way. The report should speak for itself.
<P>
That would prevent any suspicion that an over-enthusiastic inspector might start to run an agenda in advance of any other action that the Secretary of State might be minded to take. It requires the inspector to act in no more than a professional way. In that respect it is a perfectly reasonable provision to include in the Bill and I hope that the Government will regard it sympathetically.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Mr. Alan Meale): The amendments seek to prevent the Audit Commission from disclosing information via the inspector that it gathers as part of the inspection for any reason other than in an inspection report. Amendment No. 175 would prevent an inspector from disclosing any information provided to him during the course of his inspection, as well as his provisional findings, except in a report that he is required to issue following the inspection. That would make the task of an inspector much more difficult. It could mean, for example, that he would not be able to check the accuracy of any of the information that he received, or test those emerging findings with key staff prior to issuing the report.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 177 would prevent the Audit Commission from publishing&#151;or permitting to be published&#151;any public comment on an inspection, except for the purpose of publicising the report. That would exert an extremely strict control over the Audit Commission on what was published in its name in terms of an inspector's report. It would, for example, prevent the Audit Commission from extracting lessons from a report and using those lessons for the benefit of other authorities.
<P>
Opposition Members may have misunderstood the wider role of the best value inspectors, particularly within the inspectorate forum. The White Paper, ``Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People'' makes it clear that the forum will bring all the key inspectorates together to discuss collaborative arrangements. Such arrangements might include the scheduling of inspections, joint inspections, developing common inspection methodologies and so on.
<P>
The Audit Commission has recently demonstrated the importance that it attaches to keeping the public informed of the outcome of inspections by suggesting that that is its first principle in its consultation document, ``Principles of Public Inspection''. A few specialist inspectorates, such as the Office for Standards in Education and SSI, have a statutory requirement to publish a report. Most inspectorates, however, do so in practice. Therefore, it is conceivable that the inspectorate forum, or the Audit Commission itself, could function effectively if they were unable to discuss operational issues and practical examples of problems of common interest.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 175 and 177 would prevent such dialogue from taking place. We believe that they are misconceived and hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I had hoped that the spirit of the amendments would have invited a more welcoming tone. Surely inspectors have no business sounding off personal opinions on information that they have gathered from investigations? Their opinions should be based, and they should not use their position to disseminate any other opinion.
<P>
The Minister said that my amendments encumbered the proper activities of the Audit Commission and other inspectorates. However, he has not addressed the inspectors' duty to behave properly in relation to information that they are given. At the moment, inspectors have immunity to behave and say publicly what they want without fear of prosecution. Other authorities do not enjoy such privileges. I am willing to be corrected if I am wrong about that.
<P>
The auditor should be free to make comments in the report. However, if such comments are not good enough to be included in the report, they should not be said at all. We should use that principle to hold those powerful regulatory authorities to account. Otherwise their powers are so overwhelming that they may destroy people. People have been put under the spotlight, only to have charges against them dropped because criminal prosecutions cannot be sustained. Even so, their reputations and standing have been damaged. We must protect individuals from such harm.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman decides whether to divide the Committee, let me assure him that normal sub judice rules will apply in such cases. I do not think that the matter is as serious as he believes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I did not really understand that point. I do not think that we shall progress further on this matter tonight. We shall want to return to it, especially as we shall discuss later legislative proposals relating to ethics in local government. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
No. 178, in page 9, line 36, leave out from beginning to `the' in line 37.
<P>
No.11, page 9, line 38, after `recommendation', insert `and the original report'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I am going to do something that I am sure has been done in Committee previously, but it it has not this could be a first&#151;move our amendment and then withdraw it. The amendment's purpose was again to attack the powers of the Secretary of State. However, it appears that the amendments tabled by Conservative Members could do the job more effectively than our amendment, so I will seek to withdraw it and speed up the proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The brevity of the hon. Gentleman's speech was most unfair, as I have struggled to understand amendment No. 178, which I tabled. Its purpose would be to place on the Audit Commission an obligation to act, regardless of any direction that may be given by the Secretary of State. It seems to me that if we have got this far in the inspection process, and the report has been produced, the commission should, when reasonably practical&#151;we shall debate later whether that should be 30 days&#151;arrange for the recommendation to be published and a copy sent straight to the Secretary of State. I do not think that it will be necessary to wait upon the Secretary of State to decide in his royalness when this should be done. He should perhaps be reminded that he is not the only show in town.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> or she.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In legislation we tend to use ``he'', which means he or she, and we do not think that we are making a great statement about the dominance of the male of the species. [Interruption.] Yes, times are changing. That would have public expenditure consequences because it would put up the printing costs of legislation. The Secretary of State is not the only show in town. Other people are capable of acting independently. The sole purpose of this simple amendment is to allow that to happen.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Member for North Essex want to press amendment No. 178?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have spoken to amendment No. 178 and I hope that the Minister will reply to the comments I have made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I should congratulate the hon. Member for Torbay on his speed and due process. I wish that other hon. Members would follow suit.
<P>
It is most important that the best value framework is seen to be transparent and that local people receive all necessary information to enable them to judge the extent to which they are receiving best value. Clause 12 as drafted ensures that where an authority is inspected and found wanting, it will be required to bring the facts to the attention of its public in its next performance plan, and, more importantly, to tell local people what it intends to do about it. We believe that that shows accountability in action and sound common sense.
<P>
Clause 12 also provides for the Secretary of State to receive inspection reports only when they recommend action by the Secretary of State. There is no benefit in drowning the Secretary of State in a deluge of reports, the majority of which will involve him in no further action. That would cause problems of providing resources to handle such correspondence, about which Opposition Members complained earlier. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon told a story about the DETR. He said that civil servants used to wheel around trollies that contained copies of the SSA. That is ridiculous. We hope that that will not happen in future, and that we can convince local authorities that there are better ways of working.
<P>
There is no reason to require the Audit Commission to publish all its recommendations. It is right to publish a recommendation for the serious step of clause 13 intervention, but there is no need to publish recommendations as a matter of course when authorities publish findings in their performance plans.
<P>
Amendment No. 178 would create an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. We urge the hon. Member for North Essex not to press it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's comments. I hope that the necessity for the Secretary of State to give direction will not delay matters. However, I shall not press amendment No. 178.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
