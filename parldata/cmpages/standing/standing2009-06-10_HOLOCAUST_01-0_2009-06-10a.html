Andrew Dismore</b> (Hendon) (Lab): Thank you, Mr.
Cook. I welcome you to the Chair of this Committee, which I hope will
not detain us long. The Bill has found favour throughout the House and
we have been able to proceed with a friendly consensus on this
important
issue.</div><a name="09061095000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will be apparent to Committee members that the amendments and new
clauses constitute a major redrafting of the Bill, but the policy and
sense of it remain unchanged. The amendments are parliamentary
counsel&#146;s redrafting of my original text. Parliamentary
counsel&#146;s text is in plain English and may be more precise than
my own&#151;though perhaps not as elegantly drafted. Legislation
needs to be precise in order to
work.</div><a name="09061095000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading it was asked whether the Bill had any tax implications.
There are not many tax implications, but the Treasury is looking at
whether the tax rules need to be changed. If so, that will be done
through the Finance Bill or tax rules changes rather than amendments to
this Bill, which would be inappropriate.</div>
<a name="09061095000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clauses 1
and 2 replace clause 1, and I invite the Committee, when the time
comes, to vote against clause stand part and to vote for new clauses 1
and 2. New clause 1 provides for the power to transfer, as opposed to
the original language of &#147;de-accession&#148;, so jargon is
being replaced by plain English, but the substance of the power remains
the same. It also makes provision for Scotland, as the Scottish
Executive now wish Scotland to be included. There are also other,
consequential amendments to that
effect.</div><a name="09061095000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 2 makes provision for the advisory panel and spells out in more
detail the provisions in clause 1(2). Again, the substance
is the same. I urge the Committee to vote against clause stand part,
and for new clauses 1 and
2.</div><a name="09061095000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000138"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport
(Barbara Follett):</b> The Government support the insertion of
new clauses 1 and 2. New clause 1 sets out the two conditions that need
to be met to trigger the power for the trustees of one of the named
institutions to transfer an object from its collections. Those are,
first, that the advisory panel recommends the transfer and, secondly,
that the Secretary of State approves that
recommendation.</div><a name="09061095000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
avoid any doubt, I clarify that museum trustees will continue to take
decisions on whether or not to return an object. That is in keeping
with the arm&#146;s-length principle that recognises that trustees
are responsible for the items in their care. It is not for the
Government to tell them what to do with them. The current arrangement
for the consideration of claims and the decision-making process,
including the approval of the panel&#146;s reports by the Secretary
of State, works well. The two conditions that must be met to trigger
the trustees&#146; power to return an object reflect the existing
arrangements for handling the reports of the Spoliation Advisory Panel.
It is right to include the requirement that the Secretary of State
approve the panel&#146;s recommendation because it reflects current
practice and provides a safeguard in the unlikely event of an
irrational recommendation by the panel. It is not, however, the
Government&#146;s intention to tell museum trustees what to do. This
clause is about giving trustees the power to decide to return an object
if the two conditions are met, in the same way that regional and local
museums are able to support the return of an object in such
circumstances.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div><a name="09061095000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
also support new clause 2, which defines an advisory panel for the
purposes of this Act. The panel is to be designated by the Secretary of
State, and he may only designate a panel whose functions consist of
considering claims relating to events occurring during the Nazi era; in
other words, between 1933 and 1945. That reflects the terms of
reference of the Spoliation Advisory Panel because, as I have
explained, the purpose of the Bill is straightforward: to give trustees
of the named institutions a power to return an object where the
trustees decide to do so, in response to a recommendation by the
designated panel which has been approved by the Secretary of State. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon said, tax issues can, if
necessary, be dealt with separately by the
Treasury.</div><a name="09061095000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061095000139"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Vaizey</b> (Wantage) (Con): It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship this morning, Mr. Cook.</div>
<a name="09061095000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conservative
Members accept that the new clauses are necessary as technical
amendments. I only wish to put two points to the Minister, or, perhaps,
to the Member promoting the Bill, to whom I offer my hearty
congratulations. First, I note that there is no definition of a
cultural object in the new clauses, whereas there is in the clauses so
elegantly drafted by the hon. Member for Hendon. I wonder whether he or
the Minister will comment on whether that is a significant change.
Secondly, I note that there is nothing in the new clauses that defines
how the advisory panel is to be made up. Will the Minister comment on
what progress has been made in defining the terms of reference for any
new advisory panel, or whether they will simply be transferred from the
existing Spoliation Advisory
Committee?</div><a name="09061095000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061095000140"></a><b class="B">Lembit
&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): I am sorry I am late,
Mr. Cook&#151;Mr. Crow was doing all he could
to prevent me from arriving this morning.</div>
<a name="09061095000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">My only
question on these issues is one of definition, and the hon. Member for
Wantage has raised the same issue. I seek the Minister&#146;s
guidance on whether the latitude given by the absence of a specific
definition is detrimental to the efficacy of the Bill. The one
circumstance in which I can see that being a problem is if there were a
legal case, or proceedings in court, where individuals who were
unwilling to give up artefacts claimed they were not covered by the
Bill because there was no definition to say that they were. It would be
useful for the record, and thus for courts in future, if some
determination could be given about that point in these
proceedings.</div><a name="09061095000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061095000141"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Whittingdale</b> (Maldon and East Chelmsford) (Con): As I
said on Second Reading, I welcome the Bill. Indeed, the Select
Committee that I chair has in the past pressed the Government to
introduce such a Bill. I do, however, want to explore, and perhaps
press the hon. Member for Hendon about, the practical consequences of
the Bill. The panel has met only nine times and, as far as I am aware,
there are not a great many objects currently sitting in our national
institutions which are under dispute. Does he have any idea when, or
if, the measures in his Bill will actually be used? Is it not the case
that the only item whose return is still under some dispute&#151;the
Benevento missal&#151;would not actually be covered by the
Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="09061095000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000142"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> To respond to the query by the hon. Member for
Wantage about cultural objects, we did not feel it necessary to give a
definition of a cultural object because, in referring to an object, the
Bill is using the definition in the legislation that already governs
museums. That, I hope, will also deal with the point made by the hon.
Member for
Montgomeryshire.</div><a name="09061095000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the advisory panel&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Hon. Members must
forgive me; I have no Parliamentary Private Secretary today. I think
that Mr. Crow has delayed her, too. The panel to be
designated will be the Spoliation Advisory Panel. We feel that that is
the best way of going ahead because it has experience in this area even
though, as the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said, it has
met only nine times.</div>
<a name="09061095000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000143"></a>Mr.
Dismore:</b> I cannot envisage the circumstances in which a
legal case is likely to arise. The whole purpose of the Bill is to
operate consensually, and ultimately the power rests with the trustees.
If they do not want to return an object, they do not have to, so I do
not think that that is a problem.</div>
<a name="09061095000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
the practical consequences. I discussed the Benevento missal with the
British Library this morning. It wanted the Bill to make specific
provision for that object, but that would have made the Bill hybrid so
we could not do that. Nobody really knows the circumstances in which
the Benevento missal went missing, but it would have been during the
period in question, so I suppose that it would be possible for the
Spoliation Advisory Panel to make a new recommendation. That would mean
that we had a recommendation that was not
retrospective&#151;obviously, the Bill will not have retrospective
application. The particular problem is that the British Library wanted
specific provision which we could not make without making the Bill
hybrid.</div>
<a name="09061095000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
Mr. Crow who has kidnapped my hon. Friend&#146;s PPS, but

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000146"></a>Mr.
Dismore:</b> The purpose of these amendments is to get the
list of institutions empowered to transfer complete and accurately
named. When we were drafting the Bill it was difficult because some
institutions have a board, some trustees and some a board of trustees.
We had to make sure that we got the right terminology and that the list
was complete. We have added the Scottish museums, libraries and
galleries, Merseyside, the Natural History Museum and Kew Gardens. I
cannot envisage Kew having any plants that it would need to return, but
it has its own library and art collection, so it is a belt-and-braces
job. I cannot honestly see Kew Gardens being in the position of having
to return an object, but one never knows. Basically, this is a
tidying-up exercise to make sure that we have the list complete and to
cater for Scotland.</div>
<a name="09061095000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000147"></a>Lembit

<a name="09061095000115"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000148"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> The Government support these amendments. They add
the various institutions to the list of bodies to which the Bill
applies. Those include the board of trustees for the National Galleries
of Scotland, the trustees of the National Library of Scotland, and the
board of trustees of the National Museums of Scotland. As I mentioned
on Second Reading, we were in touch with the Scottish Executive about
whether they wanted to be included in the Bill. They have since
confirmed that they wish to have their national museums included
because, as with English national museums, there are statutory
restrictions in place that could prevent de-accessioning.</div>
<a name="09061095000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 4
changes the reference to the trustees of the National Gallery to refer
to the board of trustees of the National Gallery because that is the
full name given to them by the Museums and Galleries Act 1992. The
position of the National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside in terms
of their ability to de-accession items from their collection was
unclear at the time of Second Reading, but we are now satisfied that
they need to be included and they are added by amendment 6.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div><a name="09061095000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 7
adds the trustees of the Natural History Museum and the board of
trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. I should say that Kew has a
magnificent collection of botanic art, and this is an area in which we
could have de-accessioning requests. We have therefore added Kew to the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000151"></a>Mr.
Dismore:</b> The amendments will change the long and short
titles of the Bill more accurately to reflect its contents and purpose.
As the Bill has developed it has become apparent that it has less to do
with looted art and more to do with the power to return art. When we
talk about stolen art, that is a very narrow reflection of what was a
much wider problem during the period concerned.
&#147;Spoliation&#148; is the word used by the panel. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>Whatever the wording, it has to have a much broader meaning than being
stolen or looted. Objects for sale but under-valued, for example, would
be included by the new long title, and indeed the short title. The
purpose, therefore, is to provide for the return and transfer of items
but to limit that provision to the Nazi era.</div>
<a name="09061095000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 9
provides for the devolved administrations, and amendment 10 relates to
the commencement provisions. I am pleased that we have been able to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000159"></a>Mr.

circumstances of the Bill. We need to give sufficient time to ensure

10-year period achieves the best of both
worlds.</div><a name="09061095000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
to a second process in Wales, we had contact with the Welsh Government

[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Assembly.&#148;] I
understand that it felt that it already had the powers to deal with the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000160"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000162"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> The Government support amendments 9
and 10. Amendment 9, which is welcomed by the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire, adds a new subsection (1A) extending the Bill to
England, Wales and Scotland. To comfort the hon. Member for The Wrekin,
we have consulted with the devolved Administrations and they are happy
with
that.</div><a name="09061095000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill will become part of the law of England and Wales. The Scottish
Executive have asked to be included, and a legislative consent motion
is being prepared for introduction in the Scottish Parliament. The
Northern Ireland Assembly Government have confirmed that the power is
not needed for national museums in Northern
Ireland.</div><a name="09061095000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
10 replaces the remainder of clause 3 with a new commencement
provision. The new subsections provide for commencement by order; the
Secretary of State must consult Scottish Ministers before an order is
made that would apply to Scottish
institutions.</div><a name="09061095000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
10-year sunset period in clause 3 remains the same but will become
subsection (6). I have indicated previously that the Government think
this is an appropriate period, after which all outstanding claims
should reasonably have been considered. That will allow something
like  74 years from the end of the second world war
and  19 years for claims to be considered by the Spoliation
Advisory Panel and for trustees, where necessary, to make a decision on
the transfer of an object.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="09061095000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
noting that the Dutch restitution committee, which was modelled on the
Spoliation Advisory Panel, has already stopped accepting new claims,
despite the fact that the scale of the problem in that country is far
greater than in the UK. In the Netherlands, many hundreds of works of
art have been returned to claimants over the years, compared with just
nine claims to the Spoliation Advisory Panel since
2000.</div><a name="09061095000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us not forget how much effort has been put in over the years by museums
and galleries in the UK to identify art that may have been looted, to
publicise it on websites and to consider what could be done about it.
However, I note that my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon said, on
Second Reading, that there are certainly a further 20 looted items in
UK museums. I have invited him to give us details of those.</div>
<a name="09061095000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, the hon. Members for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)
and for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) proposed an alternative mechanism for
terminating the Act: a rolling period linked to the date of inclusion
of an object on a published statutory list. The Government&#146;s
view is that the proposal, though well intentioned, is not workable in
the circumstances because it would involve additional costs for museums
in publishing information and would be difficult to administer. Unless
museums were under a duty to publish, it would not work, and if we were
to impose such a duty, we would need an enforcement mechanism for
non-compliance. That would remove some of the simplicity and
straightforwardness of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09061095000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude,
I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon on all the
work and commitment that he has put into the Bill. It is a real advance
and it is thanks to him that we have it
today.</div><a name="09061095000082"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000167"></a>The

that it is customary throughout the parliamentary system that when a
Member seeks to make a statement, they undergo a process called
&#147;catching the Speaker&#146;s eye&#148;. The only way to do
that is to stand in one&#146;s place and make it plain that a
statement is forthcoming. Mr. Vaizey, stand up, please. It
is no good making the request and then sitting on your
butt.</div><a name="09061095000116"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.00

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000168"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I thought that I was getting up. After that
intervention, I shall try, as one of our great actresses said, to
gather my
thoughts.</div><a name="09061095000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a small but important Bill which Conservative Members welcome. It
has not, despite the broad consensus in this Committee, had the easiest
of passages. In fact, this is an opportunity for me to pay tribute to
the work of Anne Webber and all those who have campaigned for such a
Bill. Although the Bill&#146;s objectives are something that every
right-thinking individual would welcome, there was also, potentially,
an important principle at stake, which was the inviolability of our
national collections. It was therefore extremely important, and
somewhat time-consuming, to engage with those looking after our
national collections, the directors of our national museums, to ensure
that they were comfortable that this was not somehow the thin end of
the wedge. I know that the hon. Member for Hendon may be pushing some
more wedges into our national collections with another private
Member&#146;s Bill not unrelated to friezes from the east of Europe.
Nevertheless, it is very welcome that we have arrived at this point
today.</div><a name="09061095000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that national museums have worked very closely with the
Government, the hon. Gentleman, Anne Webber and others to ensure that
this Bill will be passed. The Bill is very clear in its aims. It gives
all those who feel that they have a justified claim to an object looted
by the Nazis which is in a national collection the opportunity to make
that claim. It provides a very sensible mechanism in which an advisory
committee can make a recommendation, the Secretary of State can approve
it and the trustees may have the final decision before that object is
released, thereby keeping in place the principle that the trustees are
the guardian of the collection.</div>
<a name="09061095000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
welcome the fact that there is a sunset clause. As other hon. Members
have pointed out, sunset clauses are, in principle, a very good thing
to include in any legislation. Conservative Members wholeheartedly
welcome the Bill.</div>

&#214;pik:</b> The hon. Member for Wantage says that this is
a small but important Bill. I would say that it is a simple but
important Bill, because, for those whom it assists, it is of tremendous
importance in righting a wrong that dates right back to Nazism and the
second world war. Nazism nearly destroyed Europe, and it was thanks to
the courage of the British people and our unassailable ally, the USA,
that Hitler was ultimately defeated. Nevertheless, the Bill illustrates
the reach of Nazism and the damage that was done by that appalling
creed. There are many families, including my own, who were permanently
affected by the consequences of the second world war. It is a matter of
honour for me to serve on this Committee and to see a collective
consensus across parties which is far more important than any partisan
dispute.</div><a name="09061095000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am involved with the Holocaust Education Trust because I think that we
must never forget what happens if good men sit and do nothing when evil
is perpetrated. This restitution draws a line in the sand which
indicates that Britain, and, indeed, no right-thinking country, will
ever again allow that kind of injustice to be perpetrated, either in
the name of democracy or of humanity. I pay tribute to the hon. Member
for Hendon, who has made a powerful statement in simple terms, which I
am sure we all agree with, that Nazism, injustice and inhumanity must
never be allowed to
triumph.</div><a name="09061095000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061095000170"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Lee Scott</b> (Ilford, North) (Con): May I say, for anyone who
was unable to get here this morning, that I apologise for my
constituent, Mr. Crow, not allowing people to get here? I
will be passing that message on to him when I see him next.</div>
<a name="09061095000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
briefly to pay tribute to the hon. Member for Hendon. Many of my own
constituents, along  with people from all over the country, owe
him a debt of gratitude for this Bill, and I thank him for
introducing
it.</div><a name="09061095000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061095000171"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Louise Ellman</b> (Liverpool, Riverside) (Lab/Co-op): I, too,
pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon for his work and
perseverance, and I would also like to thank everybody else who has
been involved in bringing the Bill to this point today.</div>
<a name="09061095000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wrongs
and the horror of the Nazi era can never be put right, but there are
areas where restitution can be made in an attempt to keep memories
alive and bring some kind of justice for the descendants of those who
perished in such a terrible way. This is one such area. It is very
important that the matter has been approached in a careful and balanced
way, with safeguards written into the process. The fact that we have
got to this point is due to the work of so many people in looking at
the detail and operation of the measure, as well as the principle. I
would like to record my appreciation to everybody who has been involved
and give particular thanks to my hon. Friend for his dedication,
initiative and perseverance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000172"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> I reiterate my tribute to my hon. Friend the
Member for Hendon and thank all members of the Committee. As you said,
Mr. Cook, it has been more informal than usual. Perhaps that
is because the matter is more consensual than usual; perhaps it is also
because there are no Whips present. I am very glad that we have
cross-party consensus on this issue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div><a name="09061095000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Margaret
Hodge). It was under her aegis, when she was holding the job that I now
hold, that we began work on this Bill. I particularly thank all those
outside Parliament who have worked so hard to make sure that this
happens. They have put right a very old wrong, one that needed to be
corrected. Finally, I thank you, Mr. Cook, for your patience
with us all today.</div>
<a name="09061095000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061095000173"></a>Mr.
Dismore:</b> I thank all hon. Members for their kind remarks
about the Bill and repeat my thanks to my hon. Friend the Minister and,
indeed, her predecessors. Several of them, including my right hon.
Friend the Member for Barking, have taken an interest in this issue. I
also thank my hon. Friend&#146;s officials, who have been patient
with me throughout my e-mail bombardment of them, which I hope did not
cause too much offence.</div>
<a name="09061095000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank Anne
Webber, who has given me a lot of assistance with the Bill, and also
Jon Benjamin. We should also mention Lord Janner, who has run an
indomitable campaign on this issue. He first got me interested in the
subject shortly after I was elected in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>1997. At that time the campaign was to get the Spoliation Advisory Panel
set up. That took a couple of years, and we thought that that was the
end of the problem. As time went by, it became clear that it was not. I
sincerely hope that the Bill will now end the problem and that art can
be returned to its rightful owners. In the end, it is for them to
decide what happens to that art; whether they want to leave it where it
is, take compensation or have it back. That should be their choice
because they are the owners of something that was stolen from them and
their families so many decades ago under the tyranny of the
Nazis.</div>
<a name="09061095000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
you, Mr. Cook, for your patience and wonderful chairmanship
today. The fact that we have been able to get through the proceedings
in 39 minutes is a tribute to that and to the Committee as a
whole.</div>
