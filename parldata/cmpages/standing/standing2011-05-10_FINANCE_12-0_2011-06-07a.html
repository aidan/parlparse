                  </span> The clause deals with
tonnage tax capital allowances in respect of shipping, amending various
provisions of the Finance Act 2000 on the writing down allowances
available on the first £40 million of expenditure on a ship,
bringing them into line with the rate available on a ship used by a
company that has not elected for tonnage
tax.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Companies
operating ships subject to the 2000 Act were encouraged to train one UK
rating for every 15 crew employed; my understanding is that
there was a voluntary agreement. The aim was to encourage shipping
companies to employ UK staff. The measure was introduced because of
widespread and long-standing concerns about the underemployment of UK
staff by shipping companies running ships from the UK, often at low pay
rates, thus undercutting the wages that they would pay UK
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
low employment of UK staff is a long-running issue, and the issues
around flags of convenience are extremely complex. Can the Minister
consider whether there are ways of supporting the UK shipping industry
and, in particular, how the Bill and the clause might be used to secure
increased employment of UK staff in the shipping industry? Of course,
at such a time, anything that can generate jobs is to be
welcomed.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
Merseyside, the growth of the economy will be strongly linked to the
success and development of the port of Liverpool. Many of my
constituents would love the opportunity to work in the shipping
industry, and to take advantage of the potential expansion of the
docks.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000034">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I am taken with the point my

                     </span>
                  </strong> My hon. Friend is absolutely right: we need to
use ports and the shipping industry as an important component in
rebalancing the economy. An export-led recovery is an element in
achieving that—if not, indeed, the crucial element. Ports such
as Liverpool and those in the north-east that my hon. Friend represents
are an essential component of that recovery and regeneration, and I

current voluntary process whereby shipping companies are asked to train

want to qualify for the allowance, to adopt that approach, being
allowed to employ only 15 overseas staff for every UK rating that they

                  </strong> I do not want to wander too far off the point of
tonnage tax, for all sorts of reasons, not least to try to remain in
order. I want to tackle the issue of the link between clause 57 and the
training commitment that the hon. Gentleman proposes. The Government do
not wish to dilute the training incentive that exists within the
tonnage tax regime. In order for companies to benefit from the regime,
they must commit to train one cadet for every 15 officers employed by
the company. We think that that commitment strikes the right balance
between ensuring the UK skills base is maintained, and having a simple
regime that provides certainty for companies.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It might be
helpful to say a couple of words about the effect of clause 57, to give
some backdrop. Clause 57 reduces the level of writing-down allowances
that can be claimed within tonnage tax to the same level as that for
ships outside the regime. That change is required under EU law. We do
not expect the impact of clause 57 to be such that it would affect a
company’s ability to carry out training. I do not think that the
argument made by the hon. Gentleman, which is reflected in his
amendment, would have the desired impact in practice. Capital
allowances are available to companies outside the tonnage tax regime,
such as banks and financial institutions that own ships that are then
leased to shipping companies within the
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000048">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
effect, what the hon. Gentleman suggests would benefit the banks, which
are not involved in the training of cadets on a ship that has been
leased. The benefits would shift from the company that leased the ship
to the bank, and I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman wants the banks
to have more tax benefits than they already have. Furthermore,
exempting certain companies from the effect of clause 57 would mean
that they received more state aid than had been agreed with the
European Commission. We would have to approach the Commission to make
such a change, and we believe that such an approach would be
unsuccessful.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I said
earlier, I share the idea that seafarers’ skills and training
are important, but these things are policed and dealt with not by the
Treasury but by the Department for Transport, which is responsible for
all matters relating to the training of seafarers. I am sure that the
hon. Gentleman knows that the UK tonnage tax is very different from
that of many other countries, as it includes a requirement for
training. The best way to improve training opportunities in the UK is
for the unions, the shipping companies and the Department for Transport
to work together; that direct route would be far more effective than
trying to link the capital allowances to training through the tonnage
tax. The latter would be a more convoluted route and less likely to
have the impact that the hon. Gentleman desires, which is to improve
opportunities for UK assistance in training for the Merchant Navy and
for sail on other ships.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000050">&#160;</a>

couple of quick questions for the Minister. The explanatory notes

the Committee state in paragraph 7 of the section on clause
60:<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000056">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>The
clause amends the corporation tax definition of an index-linked
gilt-edged security. The Committee will know that the current
definition provides that an index-linked gilt-edged security is one in
which payments are wholly or partly determined by reference to the
retail prices index. This is to be changed, and such securities will be
ones where the payments are determined wholly or partly by reference to
the index of prices published by the Statistics Board.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000057">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“In
July 2010 the Minister for Pensions announced that, from 2011, the

(CPI).”<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000417">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My question
is simple. It is becoming rather a habit, but how can the Minister
bring a proposal to the Committee—clause 60 is yet another
example—when, as he admits in the explanatory notes, he does not
know the number or size of pensions schemes that will be affected? As a
starter, I ask the Minister for his assessment of the impact of the
changes. How many pension schemes will be affected? What is the size of
those pension schemes? How many individuals are there? Is there a
costing in the Treasury for an up or a down in the overall value of the
schemes? Putting, “We’re very sorry, guv. We don’t
know,” in an explanatory note is not satisfactory, so will he
give some indication of
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000061">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> While the right hon. Gentleman is right to
highlight the issues raised in the background note, and while it is
right to say that there is no reliable Government estimate of the
number or size of the pension schemes affected by the increased use of
the consumer prices index, the purpose of the clause is actually to
create certainty for pension schemes that use index-linked, gilt-edged
securities. Let me set out what that change is. In clause 60, we are
looking to make changes to ensure that the corporation tax treatment
for all index-linked, gilt-edged securities issued by the Government is
consistent, regardless of the index of prices used to determine
payments.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
way of background, it is right to say that, in July 2010, the Minister
with responsibility for pensions announced that, effective from 2011,
CPI would be used for the revaluation and indexation of private sector
occupational pensions, Pension Protection Fund compensation and
financial assistance scheme payments. As a result, for those pension
funds, the trust deeds of which refer to the general level of prices
for the revaluation of deferred pensions and the indexation of pensions
in payment, the CPI would henceforth apply as a statutory minimum
increase, rather than the RPI. Those changes may affect the value of
many pension schemes’ liabilities and the preferred mix and type
of hedging instrument schemes used to manage
liabilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the past, Governments have only ever issued RPI-linked gilts. The
availability of a CPI-linked gilt will afford some pension funds an
instrument with which to better hedge some liabilities. Under the
current corporation tax rules, an index-linked, gilt-edged security is
defined using the RPI to calculate payments, so if a gilt-edged
security linked to a different index of prices is issued, the
corporation tax treatment would be unclear and a different tax
treatment would be applied. The clause changes the definition of an
index-linked, gilt-edged security to remove any doubt surrounding their
taxation. The legislation governing the taxation of index-linked,
gilt-edged securities uses the index of prices by which payments on
that gilt are calculated to identify the gains arising from the
inflationary uplift and removes them 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 460<a class="bkMark" name="Column460">&#160;</a>
                  </div>from the charge to tax. The clause will ensure that that continues
regardless of whether RPI or CPI is used to calculate the inflationary
uplift.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
changes made by clause 60 will ensure that the current corporation tax
treatment of index-linked, gilt-edged securities will be applied to any
future issuance by the Government. That should be welcomed by gilt
market participants and should reassure them. UK pension funds are the
largest single investor group in that index-linked market. I say to the
right hon. Gentleman that the main focus of the clause is actually to
provide greater flexibility for pension funds, to enable them to use
CPI-linked gilts to hedge their future liabilities and to ensure that
the tax treatment of those index-linked gilts is clear and beyond any
doubt. It is creating certainty for pension funds, and it is up to them
to decide whether to use the
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000065">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I do not want to create a long-running saga out of
what is a relatively small but helpful clause. The point is to
facilitate CPI-linked gilt-edged issuance. Should the Government decide
to proceed down that route in the future, pension funds will have to
decide how they approach this matter and whether there is any appetite
for CPI-linked gilt-edged issuance. It is only when the pension funds
themselves have reached a decision that we will know what appetite
there is and what the impact will be. Rather than waiting for a problem
to emerge or for a clamour for action once a problem has been
identified, the Government are now making it possible for pension funds
to make those changes. The funds know that the opportunity may be there
for the Government to issue CPI-linked gilts in the future. It is only
once they have decided what they are going to do that we can respond to
that

                     </span>
                  </strong> The clause deals with the reduction of
supplementary charge for certain new oilfields and makes two changes to
the field allowance legislation. The first change amends the time at
which the initial licensee is to hold a field allowance. Where a
production income occurs in the same accounting period as that in which
development authorisation is given, the change enables the field
allowance to be activated in that period.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
change amends the definition of “new oil field” for the
purposes of the field allowance. That will enable certain previously
decommissioned fields to be treated as new oilfields for field
allowance purposes. Both changes have retrospective effect as from the
introduction of the field allowance legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New field
allowances were introduced by the previous Labour Government as a means
of encouraging the development of certain types of oilfield that could
prove marginal due to tax costs. They did that by exempting a portion
of income from the fields from supplementary charge, which means that
they pay only 30% corporation
tax.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
allowances were previously allowed only for fields that were given
development consent by the Department of Energy and Climate Change
after 22 April 2009. However, that could prevent fields that were given
development consent but then decommissioned from being recommissioned,
as they would still have to pay a supplementary charge due to their
development date being before April
2009.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause states that if all the field’s assets have been
decommissioned, the approval date before the decommissioning will be
ignored, which effectively means that the date of DECC approving the
field is the one that should be taken for determination if the
allowance is available. The measure is sensible and encourages all the
fields to be redeveloped with new technology. However, if we consider
the clause in connection with clause 7, which we discussed on the Floor
of the House, we see that there are linkages between the effects of
both clauses. Both deal with the issue of the supplementary charge.
Will the Minister update us and tell us what progress she is making in
her discussions with the oil and the gas industries about the
supplementary charge in the legislation
overall?<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000078">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Following
those discussions, Centrica, which is the parent company of British
Gas, last week decided against reopening one of the largest gas fields
following the Government’s decision, under clauses 63 and 7 of
the Bill, to raise taxes on production. The firm now says that it will
buy in cheaper from abroad. The energy field concerned is the South
Morecambe gas field, which is one of the three largest production areas
that make up the offshore Liverpool-Morecambe Bay gas field. Recent
concerns about the opening of the field are linked to the measures in
the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000079">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">This
week, my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)
raised that concern in the local area. Centrica’s decision not
to reopen the field 20 miles off the coast of Barrow, following
scheduled annual maintenance, was announced on Friday 3 June. The
reasons given were that the new supplementary charge
proposals—of which clauses 63 and 7, which we have considered,
are part—mean that the field is now 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 462<a class="bkMark" name="Column462">&#160;</a>
                  </div>not productive for Centrica to keep open. My hon. Friend has indicated
that, as well as the loss of gas production, some 200 jobs are at risk,
which is a matter for discussion with Centrica. He says that it is
alarming that the proposals before us have led to such
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Initially,
will the Minister update us on the discussions that she has had not
only about clause 63, but about the supplementary charge generally? On
Second Reading, we tabled an amendment that asked the Chancellor to
produce, before the end of September, an assessment of the impact of
the supplementary charge on business investment and growth, and on the
long-term sustainability of oil and gas exploration. On the UK North
sea facilities, Centrica’s chairman, Sir Roger Carr, has said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000081">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>There have also been
recent discussions about the impact of the changes on North sea
development, and since our debates on the supplementary charge, the
chairman of the CBI has written to the Government urging them to
reconsider moves relating to the charge. As those matters are linked,
it would be helpful if the Minister updated us.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There have
been issues about consultation on the supplementary charge regime, and
again, we made such points in Committee on the Floor of the House. My
hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East stated that consultation on the
proposals has been slim. On the Government’s plans, we need
transparency about the proposals that are being brought forward.
Oilfields are long-term investments that require long-term certainty
and stability. The industry has said to me that it believes that the
value of investments in the UK oil and gas industry has fallen by a
staggering 24% as a result of the 2011 Budget, and that point relates
to the proposals in clauses 63 and 7. The Minister needs to examine the
long-term potential for the industry, and the long-term investment in
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Since
discussing clause 7—this is linked to clause 63, Mr Hood,

initial points to the Minister are on clause 63, therefore, but they
are coloured by clause 7. Where are we in relation to her discussions
with the industry on these matters? There is concern from such august
bodies as Aberdeen university to suggest that, over the next three
decades, the Government’s changes introduced through the Bill
could slash oil and gas investment in the UK by some £30
billion. Production could be reduced by up to a quarter, leaving the UK
more reliant on imported oil and gas. That is important because only

these are important issues because the worry that has been expressed to

               <p class="tabbed">Not two hours
ago, ScottishPower announced a 19% increase this August in the cost of
gas to my constituents. It is a quite a significant company now. It
operates not just in Scotland, but supplies people throughout north
Wales, the north-west and other areas. If the measures in clauses 63
and 7 are leading to a lack of investment in the oil and gas industry
in the North sea, and with Centrica’s announcement only last
week about the Morecambe Bay gas field, the potential is there for gas
prices to rise even further from what are already appalling
prices.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000090">&#160;</a>

                  <em>West Evening Mail</em> last week

hypothesis that it would be wrong for Centrica to raise prices because
of increased gas prices worldwide when it had gas it could access at a
much cheaper cost to pass on to its consumers right on its doorstep in
the South Morecambe field? Is that his
argument?<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000093">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The argument I am making is that we face oil and
gas companies throughout the United Kingdom saying that the measures in
clauses 7 and 63 could lead to extra costs for them. In the
case of the Morecambe Bay field, that will lead to the loss of
production because Centrica does not feel that it is beneficial for it
to develop that field due to the taxation. We already face higher gas
prices—for example, the 19% rise announced today by
ScottishPower—so my worry is that companies will invest less in
oil and gas production because of the changes in the Bill relating to
the supplementary charge, which puts at risk some of the future
development that could match capacity to help to meet those particular
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000094">&#160;</a>

assessment, some six or seven weeks since we first discussed the matter
on the Floor of the House, of progress in the discussions on the issue
of supplementary charge as it affects clauses 63 and 7. She has had
meetings with the oil and gas companies, and discussions are ongoing,

                  </strong> The clause makes two changes to the field
allowance legislation that applies to oil and gas production companies.
The changes were those requested by the industry and, as I am sure the
right hon. Gentleman 
<div class="columnNumber">

               <p class="tabbed">Before
I go on to discuss in a little more detail what clause 63 does, I shall
respond to some of the points made by the right hon. Gentleman. We have
to return to the background to the rise in supplementary charge. As a
Government, we were faced with some large rises in fuel duty proposed
by the outgoing Labour Government. We had to decide whether it was
right for those duties to rise, as proposed by the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
felt that the cost of living was a hugely important issue for people in
this country and that the impact of the rise in the oil price as it fed
through to the price of petrol at the pumps was serious. With the
limited fiscal means available to us, we wanted to do what we could to
alleviate the tough and damaging effect on the economy recognised by a
range of stakeholders, including the CBI. The pressure was on not only
households with motorists, who were finding it hard to cope with the
price of petrol, but companies, many of which had fuel as one of their
key costs and relied on hauliers to get goods to where they needed to
be to sell. We were determined to ensure that we did what we could in
the Budget to support motorists and ensure that motoring remained
affordable, and, in doing so, to introduce a package that had broader
support for the economy—but of course, that had to be paid for.
We felt that the most effective way to do so was to raise tax from the
one sector of the economy that was doing well from the high oil price.
That, of course, was the oil
industry.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000104">&#160;</a>

been better to leave the oil industry to make significant extra profits
and leave the motorists and hauliers across the country to face the
higher fuel duty rises proposed. We took a different view, and wanted
to see what we could do to support motorists and hauliers. Far from
bringing forward the fuel duty rises that were proposed, we managed a
fuel duty cut.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000105">&#160;</a>

importance of supporting small businesses and motorists generally on
the cost of fuel. Does she therefore agree that we should reverse the

                  </strong> I do not want to stray too far from the topic or
I will be out of order, but the hon. Gentleman must be aware that VAT
had to rise because the outgoing Labour Government left us with a huge
fiscal deficit, and we all know that the previous Labour Chancellor
proposed the rise too. Labour’s attitude had been to ignore it;
our attitude has been to try to deal with the structural deficit. In
fact, only yesterday the International Monetary Fund backed our plan,
which shows that the country is on the right track. The shadow
Chancellor may ignore those reports, but they show that we are on the
right track.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000107">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Thank you, Mr Hood. The first matter is in
respect of fields that have been decommissioned. A company may decide
that such a field should be redeveloped, which we would very much
welcome. From a policy perspective there is no reason to treat such a
field differently from a new field. It is appropriate that the field
allowance should be available in such cases, but because the field is
not “new” within the terms of the legislation, no
allowance is available. We want to address that
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000112">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second matter is in respect of the accounting period for which the
field allowance is first able to reduce taxable profits. The allowance
cannot currently reduce profits until the accounting period following
that in which the development of the field is authorised. The delay in
obtaining the benefit of the allowance is unintended and inappropriate,
particularly if a company develops a field quickly, because it can find
that the benefit of the allowances is unavailable until the following
accounting period. We want to address that
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause makes two changes. First, it treats a field of which all the
assets have previously been decommissioned as a new field, therefore
such a field will potentially be eligible for the field allowance.
Secondly, it enables the field allowance to reduce taxable profits for
the accounting period in which the development of the field is
authorised. We published the draft clause back in December, and we
discussed it previously with industry advisers. No comments have been
received.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Broader
discussions with the industry are ongoing. It is probably not wise for
me to give a running commentary on those discussions because it would
not be helpful to the
industry.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Member for Delyn mentioned Centrica and its decision on the
South Morecambe field. It is not unusual for Centrica not to reopen the
south Morecambe field in the summer. The 2010 Centrica accounts show
that the field reopened later in the year in 2010 when the gas price
increased, so it is quite possible that that approach will be taken
this year. The right hon. Gentleman is right to flag up concerns about
jobs, and Centrica has confirmed that no job losses will result from
the commercial decision to shut the South Morecambe field
temporarily.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">More
broadly, the analysis, which was carried out not only by Wood
Mackenzie, but by Professor Kemp at Aberdeen university, shows that the
tax increase on the supplementary charge is likely to have only a small
impact—a reduction of about 2%—on projects and new
fields. Understandably, investment is driven by movement in the oil
price or companies’ screening hurdles, which can have far more
effect. Nevertheless, as we pledged in the Budget, we are working with
the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 467<a class="bkMark" name="Column467">&#160;</a>
                  </div>industry to address the marginal fields that have been impacted. We are
looking at how we can use field allowances and the broader oil and gas
tax regime to ensure that those marginal investments still go
ahead.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Having
addressed the points raised by the Committee, and having given some
explanation of what clause 63 will do—the clause brings forward
changes that have been requested by the industry—I move that the
clause stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000118">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I accept what the Minister has said. The new
measure is sensible and encourages the redevelopment of older fields
with new technology. It also enables the allowance to be claimed in the
accounting period in which the field is authorised, which means that
the legislation will now work as intended. I am happy with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause mentions the supplementary charge, and I wanted to stray
slightly by asking the Minister for an update on her discussions with
the oil and gas companies on the supplementary charge proposals as a
whole. I fear that I have not got much further, but I have received an
update of sorts that said, “We are in discussions.” That
does not tell me anything more than I have read in the paper. I would
like a little more from the Minister on what those discussions have
meant, because she will be aware that there has been considerable
concern in the oil and gas industry about the impact of the
supplementary charge proposals as a whole on the potential for
investment, the potential for developing new fields, the potential for
extending existing fields and the potential for reopening fields that
are currently not being utilised to the full. The latest briefing that
I have been provided with raises issues such as trust, employment,
security of energy supply, exploration of new reserves and wider energy
sector tax revenues, all of which are
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
would like to press the Minister a tad more. As part of the
supplementary charge issue generally—the words
“supplementary charge” are in clause 63—will the
Minister give an indication of when she expects to complete any
discussions with oil and gas companies? What mechanism will she have to
report back to the House on any outcomes from those discussions, not
only on their welcoming of clause 63, but on their engagement with the
Minister on clause 7? It is important that the Minister gives us some
indication of what the outcome of those discussions is likely to be. I
accept that a running commentary is not always helpful, but before we
leave this clause, it would be useful to have an indication of the time
scale involved, and know when the Minister will report back and whether
the measures in clause 63 will be impacted on by the wider discussions
with industry about clause
7.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000121">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> In response to the right hon. Gentleman’s
further questions, he will be aware that we have talked to industry
about a number of issues. One issue that is important to industry, for
example, concerns certainty about decommissioning relief, and a working
group has been established to look at that. As we made clear at the
time of the Budget, we are also looking at field allowances and clause
63 seeks to make those work more effectively. As the right hon.
Gentleman will know, the nature of the UK continental shelf means that
there 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 468<a class="bkMark" name="Column468">&#160;</a>
                  </div>is an increasing challenge in the new fields that companies are looking
at, whether they are of tight gas or heavy oil. There are a number of
technical challenges, and the field allowance regime was brought in to
provide a more nuanced tax regime to help unlock those additional
opportunities. We are in the business of talking to the oil and gas
industry about how to ensure that field allowances work more
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman will be aware that we have had extensive discussions
with Centrica about the impact on gas. I have already said in
Parliament that Treasury officials went to Centrica’s offices to
talk on its home turf about its views on the increase in supplementary
charges. It is probably not for me but for the Chancellor to talk about
what measures—if any—will come through and when. The
usual time frame for announcing such measures is the Budget, so it is
probably not wise for me to go any further than that today. I reassure
the right hon. Gentleman that we are working with industry and making
progress on issues such as decommissioning relief. Over the coming

discussions.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000123">&#160;</a>

understand the Minister’s perspective and why she is not able to

try to get at least some indication as to whether the talks she is
having will influence the Bill, as opposed to a future Budget. The Bill
has not yet completed its passage through the House of Commons, and it
remains to be considered on Report. Following her initial announcement
and discussion on Second Reading, the consideration in Committee of
clause 7, and of clause 63 today, does the Minister anticipate any
further proposals being examined and brought back for consideration
pending Royal Assent, not in a subsequent Budget in 2012 but in the
Bill? I thought that the Minister might follow up on her discussions
and have some news for us on the concerns that have been raised by many
Labour Members—and elsewhere—about the potential impact
of the whole package of clauses 63 and 7. It appears that we shall have
to wait for a future Budget, which in itself provides an indication of
the response to the consultation that is being undertaken. With those

                  </strong> Thank you, Mr Hood, for the matters overlap; this
is a straightforward question. Schedule 15 is divided into two parts.
Part 1 covers swaps, where companies swap their oilfield licences
rather than buying a new licence outright. They can also apply if the
licence is acquired partly for cash and partly for another licence. If
it is a pure swap, the old licence is treated as disposed of for no
gain or no loss, and the acquisition cost for the new licence is
treated as the no gain, no loss value of the old licence. If it is a
partial swap, the licence portion disposed of is still no gain, no
loss. That legislation was introduced in 2009, and the schedule updates
it, which I
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
first change is to treat any enhancement expenditure on the asset that
the buyer reimburses as incurred by the buyer. The second is to allow
swaps to be treated as made on what the parties agree to be the
effective date of the swap, even if the swap is not completed at that
point. That is the point on which I wish to press the Minister. That
effective date is when the economic benefit passes, even if formal
title has not passed. It is common for oil and gas asset disposals to
have an effective date and a later completion date. The change is in
line with the original intention of the legislation and is reasonable.
Any subsequent increase in the non-licence consideration will also be
caught.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000132">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What
might happen in the event of a subsequent decrease in the non-licence
proportion? There is no such provision in the schedule as I read it. If
that occurs, what will be the Minister’s response? At the
moment, the increase in non-licence consideration will be caught, but a
decrease may not be. I do not know whether there is any impact in that
respect. As I read it, there is nothing in the schedule or the clause
looking at that point. It may have no consequence, but I felt it
worthwhile to point out that provision to the Minister, so that she can
examine with officials whether it has a
consequence.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000133">&#160;</a>

been put to me that that is a flexible approach, which is fine, but it
means that the definition is not under the direct control of Parliament

the Minister clarify those two issues? First, what happens when there
is a decrease in a non-licence proportion? Secondly, will she give me a

                  </strong> It is probably worth briefly running through
clause 64 and schedule 15 to say why they are in the Bill and what we
intend them to achieve. They introduce small but important changes to
chargeable gains legislation that will apply to oil and gas companies.
The changes relate to two areas of the fiscal regime and are intended
to encourage further investment in oil and gas
fields.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
existing oil licence swaps legislation provides that no chargeable gain
arises on the swap of oil and gas licences in the UK and the UK
continental shelf in some circumstances. That legislation was
introduced to encourage and enable the transfer of licences so that
they would be held by companies that were likely to invest in them.
However, it does not adequately address the circumstances that arise in
practice, and in many cases the legislation simply cannot apply. The
existing ring fence reinvestment legislation provides that no
chargeable gain arises in some circumstances when disposable proceeds
are invested in new oil trade assets. One requirement of the
legislation is that the disposal and acquisition qualify for roll-over
relief. Again, that legislation encourages the disposal of licences and
at the same time encourages investment of the proceeds in the UK
continental
shelf.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000139">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
lot of such investment comprises expenditure on exploration, appraisal
and development, such as the cost of drilling wells, which does not
qualify for roll-over relief. The right hon. Member for Delyn asked
about the definition of expenditure on exploration, appraisal and
development, and the measure uses generally accepted accounting
principles. I hope that that provides the clarification he wants.
However, as a result, the ring fence reinvestment legislation cannot
apply, and that is the situation that we want to remedy. The changes
made in the clause and in schedule 15 address those issues and ensure
that oil licence swaps legislation applies by reference to the date on
which the economic benefits under the licences concerned are treated as
passing, rather than by reference to the date on which the swap
arrangements are entered
into.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman also asked about valuation reductions. The point
is that the parties want the swaps legislation to apply with reference
to the position agreed on the effective date, and that any non-licence
consideration should not affect the outcome, whatever way the
non-licence consideration payments flow. He raises an interesting
point, but in practice the way the legislation is now structured should
ultimately have no impact. In fact, the changes in the clause and the
schedule should ensure that the technical problems facing us in the
existing legislation fall
away.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
schedule will also ensure that for chargeable gains purposes the base
cost reflecting any expenditure incurred arises to the appropriate
company. On the ring fence reinvestment legislation, the incurring of
expenditure on exploration, appraisal and development is treated as
expenditure on assets that qualifies for roll-over relief, thus
enabling the legislation to
apply.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000142">&#160;</a>

introduced by the clause and the schedule have been developed with the
industry. They will enable the existing legislation to apply more
widely, which will help to assist the transfer of UK continental shelf
assets, ensuring that assets are held by those companies that are most

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause and the schedule amend part 5 of the Finance Act 2004 as it
relates to certain tax rules for registered pension schemes that apply
to individuals reaching the age of 75. From 6 April 2011, the effective
requirement to buy an annuity by the age of 75 will be removed and the
alternatively secured pension rules will be repealed. Individuals will
be able to leave their pension funds invested in a draw-down
arrangement and make withdrawals throughout their retirement, subject
to an annual cap. The maximum withdrawal of income that an individual
can make from most draw-down funds on reaching minimum pension age will
be capped at 100% of the equivalent annuity that could have been bought
with the fund value. That is what I want to explore with the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000150">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
maximum capped amount will be determined at least every three years
until the end of the year in which the individual reaches the age of
75, after which reviews to determine the maximum capped withdrawal will
be carried out annually. Individuals who can demonstrate that they have
a secure pension income for life of at least £20,000 a year will
have full access to their draw-down funds without any annual cap, which
is the key point that I want to discuss with the Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000151">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The tax rules
require that tax-relieved pension savings must be used to secure an
income by the age of 75. That requirement is intended to ensure that
pension savings accumulated with the help of tax relief are used to
provide an income on retirement. That is a sensible approach to ensure
that they are used appropriately, because they have been accumulated
with help and support from the state.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000152">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Most members
of defined contribution schemes secure a retirement income by buying an
annuity. Until now, members of defined contribution schemes who do not 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 472<a class="bkMark" name="Column472">&#160;</a>
                  </div>want to buy an annuity have been limited to two options: before the age
of 75, an unsecured pension arrangement that enables individuals to
leave their pension fund invested while drawing down an income, or
after the age of 75, an alternatively secured pension arrangement,
which is similar to the previous example, but with a lower maximum
draw-down
limit.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000153">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
the new rules, the concepts of unsecured pension arrangements and
alternatively secured pension arrangements will disappear, and there
will be a single alternative to an annuity, which is the draw-down
pension. The key point about that, which I want to develop with the
Minister, is that the maximum withdrawal of income that an individual
may make from most draw-down funds will be capped at 100% of the
equivalent annuity that could have been bought with the fund value.
However, individuals who can demonstrate that they have a secure
pension for life of at least £20,000 a year will have
unrestricted access to receive their draw-down fund as pension
income.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
issues are quite simple. I would welcome some assessment from the
Minister of how many pensioners have a guaranteed income of
£20,000 a year for the rest of their life. Under the clause,
pensioners with that guaranteed income have a beneficial ability to
draw down funds from their pension scheme. For everyone else, the
amount that they draw down—take out of their pension
fund—will have a cap of the equivalent annuity that could have
been bought with the fund. In other words, they will be no better off
than if they had been forced to buy an annuity.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000155">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I want to get
some idea from the Minister of how many pensioners he believes will
make use of the provisions that allow them to draw down funds based on
their income of £20,000 a year. I would also like him to give
some indication of the effect that these changes will have on the
proposals for saving generally. The Government recently consulted on
giving people early access to their pension savings and, as a recent
press release from the Treasury states, this is their
conclusion:<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000156">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“While
early access has some merits, there is insufficient evidence that to
suggest it would act as an incentive to save more into
pensions.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000428">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Although
I accept that early access to pensions is a different question from
using the annuity, the two are obviously related, and the Government
have said that there is no evidence that using the annuity will
encourage any more saving in pensions either. As well as asking the
Minister for his assessment of the number of individuals who will be
able to access income of £20,000 a year—not only now, but
years hence—I wonder what evidence he has that the proposals
will help savings in general to be increased still
further.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000157">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">A
third concern is whether these proposals, as they are developed, could
be used for avoiding inheritance tax. That is a charged issue and, dare
I say it, there are potential differences between the three Liberal
Democrat members of the Committee and the Conservative party on the
question, although the coalition agreement will smooth those things
over for the moment, and the Liberal Democrats will undoubtedly support
the proposals today. However, for the benefit of the three Liberal
Democrat members of the Committee, I shall explain the potential impact
of the clause on inheritance tax.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000158">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Ministers
have clearly said that they do not want to charge inheritance tax on
funds that remain on death and have removed some inheritance charges,
but because people would no longer be required to buy annuities there
is a risk that the changes could provide a straightforward avoidance
route. It is possible that wealthy people could put assets into pension
funds, with the usual tax benefits, and leave them there until they
die, when they would be passed on to the children with no inheritance
tax charge. I would welcome the Minister’s comments on the
question of inheritance tax as it relates to the pension proposals
before the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000159">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Schedule 16
introduces a tax charge of 55% on lump sums left in pension pots at
death by those over the age of 75. That is calculated to be the
equivalent of the 40% inheritance tax charge, with an additional 15% to
take account of the tax relief given on pension pot accumulations.
However, the amount of tax relief can vary hugely, depending on
people’s circumstances. The 55% rate will therefore over-recover
tax from some and under-recover tax from others. Will the Minister give
his view on the impact of the clause on inheritance tax
avoidance?<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000160">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The schedule
also provides us with the opportunity to consider inheritance tax
generally, on which subject there is a difference between the Liberal
Democrats and the Conservative party. When I last counted there were 41
pages of legislation—it may have grown slightly since
then—but I believe that those provisions will benefit a few of
the wealthiest people while doing little or nothing to encourage more
saving.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000161">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My questions
are as follows. How many people do the Government believe will benefit
from the change? Will the Minister put my mind at rest, and tell me
that it will not be only the wealthiest? Does he believe that more
pension saving will take place, and if so will he give us some evidence
of how the measures will encourage pension saving?<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000162">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Why is there
no inheritance charge tax on assets left at death? I give the Minister
the benefit of the doubt, but will he assure me that it is not a
deliberate attempt to leave a loophole open? I would welcome his
explanation of why inheritance tax is not to be charged on assets left
at death. That would be in line with the normal use of inheritance tax,
and I am sure that the three Liberal Democrat members of the Committee
would not wish to encourage inheritance tax loopholes.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000163">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What
assessment has the Minister made of the impact of lifting the
inheritance tax threshold to £1 million, given the incentive for
these changes? Is it still the Conservative party’s intention to
do that, or has it been sacrificed with trade-offs with the Liberal
Democrats? On page 75 of the consultation document, the Government
admit that the 55% charge will over-recover tax from some and
under-recover tax from others. Does the Minister intend that to be the
position? Why have the Government not done anything about those
particular issues?<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000164">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In summary,
there are some general questions on which the Minister should reflect
to see whether he can satisfy the concerns that have been expressed to
me by colleagues both inside and outside the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000165">&#160;</a>

before I deal with the right hon. Gentleman’s questions. He will
be aware that this has been a hotly 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 474<a class="bkMark" name="Column474">&#160;</a>
                  </div>debated topic. It was raised many times in the previous Parliament and
not just by Conservative Members in this House and the other place. I
recollect that Baroness Hollis, who was a social security Minister
under the previous Government, was also a champion of the end to
compulsory annuitisation. The requirement to secure an income by the
age of 75 has existed since 1976. At that time, the average life
expectancy of a healthy 65-year-old male was 13 years. The life
expectancy of a healthy 65-year-old male has now increased to 21 years.
For a female, it is currently 24 years. As longevity continues to
increase and people work for longer, the existing rules will become
more restrictive for an increasing number of people. We believe that
people should have more say over how and when they use their pension
savings to provide an income in
retirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000166">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Removing
the requirement to annuitise at the age of 75 will make the tax system
simpler by avoiding unnecessarily restrictive and outdated rules.
Together with the changes in clauses 66 and 67, this will ensure that
the pensions tax regime is both fair and sustainable. It will also give
individuals, employers, providers and schemes appropriate flexibility
to make arrangements to suit their circumstances and
preferences.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me set
out the changes that have been made by this clause. They will primarily
benefit those people who have to find contribution schemes. Let me
highlight four types. Individuals with defined contribution pension
savings who have yet to take a pension will be able to defer taking
benefits from their scheme rather than having to buy an annuity at age
75. Individuals who wish to leave their pension fund invested as part
of an income drawdown arrangement will be able to do so beyond the age
of 75 subject to the annual drawdown limit to which the right hon.
Gentleman referred. Individuals with a lifetime pension income of at
least £20,000 a year, known as a minimum income requirement,
will be able to gain access to their drawdown pension funds with no cap
on the withdrawals that they make. That is known as the flexible
drawdown. The age 75 ceiling will be removed from most lump sums to
which a member is entitled.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The detail of
these changes were subject to extensive consultation last summer. We
received 185 responses from a wide cross-section of individuals,
pension professionals, advisers, trade bodies and academics. The
consultation highlighted the clear preference of most respondents for
the new rules to achieve their objectives of minimal complexity, and we
listened carefully to those
requests.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000169">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Simplicity
underpins many of the key elements of the clause under debate today. In
particular, a single level minimum income requirement will be
applicable at all ages, before someone can access flexible drawdown.
Where someone is not on flexible drawdown, there will be a single
annual withdrawal limit. There will be a single recovery charge on
unutilised funds remaining on death of 55%. As the right hon. Gentleman
said, the recovery charge can be as high as 82% for those above the age
of 75. Perhaps he should also have mentioned that lump sum death
benefits relating to individuals who die before the age of 75 and
before taking a pension are tax free. Lump sum death benefits relating
to individuals who die before age 75 after taking a pension are liable
to tax at 35%. That is under measures put forward by the right hon.
Gentleman’s Government 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 475<a class="bkMark" name="Column475">&#160;</a>
                  </div>when they were in office. Therefore, rather than having no tax, or
having tax paid at 35% or up to a rate of 82% on an unutilised pot at
death, we have moved to a single tax rate of 55%. I must say that I
have received much correspondence from colleagues suggesting that the
55% rate should be reduced, and their constituents have written to them
asking for lower rates to be introduced, but I believe that 55%
achieves the right balance, and let me say
why.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
setting the charge at 55%, we have sought to recover the amount of
relief received by a typical individual who may be subject to the
charge. The governance modelling suggests that a 55% charge would
ensure that there are no tax advantages for pension death benefits
compared with other assets on which inheritance tax is payable.
Accordingly, it is not appropriate to levy inheritance tax on top of
the recovery charge. We recognise that most of the people who will take
advantage of the measure will be those who paid the higher rate of tax,
and a 55% rate is, therefore, applicable. That would lead to cases in
which people received tax relief at the basic rate of an over-recovery,
but it is better to have a single simple rate, rather than a variable
rate that depends on the rate of tax someone may have paid at some
point in their life as they built up their pension
pot.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000171">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
single rate is appropriate. It means a higher tax charge for those who
die before the age of 75 and a slightly lower tax charge for those who
die afterwards, but it ensures that the tax relief that the Government
have given to encourage people to build up a pension pot is actually
fully recovered at the point of death. That is the right way to do it.
Of course, if the unutilised pot is used to provide a pension for a
dependent, which may be a spouse or a minor, that will be tax-free, as
is the case at the moment. That is the right level of protection to
ensure that tax relief is recovered by the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000172">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman asked about the take-up for the measure, and our
assessment is that up to 200,000 individuals currently in a draw-down
arrangement could initially benefit from not having to purchase an
annuity at age 75. Around 50,000 individuals currently in a draw-down
arrangement could initially benefit from flexible draw-down. A further
12,000 individuals a year may be able to access flexible draw-down in a
steady state. Recent independent estimates by the Pensions Policy
Institute suggest that up to 700,000 people currently between 55 and 75
could benefit from not having to purchase an annuity, and that includes
individuals who have uncrystallised pension savings. PPI also estimated
that some 200,000 people currently between 55 and 75 could benefit from
the flexible
draw-down.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
initial Government estimates were published in the tax information and
impact notes of 9 December 2010. One of the reasons why there is so
much appetite for the measure out there is not so much to address the
challenges faced by pensioners today, but, as we all recognise, rather
that there has been a significant shift from defined benefit to defined
contribution schemes over recent years, and the proposal ensures that
people who are in DC schemes can benefit from increased flexibility in
the future. They may decide that they want to work for longer. They may
wish to put off the date of retirement and not to be required to buy an
annuity. 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>They may have a complex mixture of assets in retirement. By bringing
forward the measures, we want to ensure that they are given the maximum
flexibility while safeguarding the interests of the taxpayer more
broadly.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000174">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
must say that I have had correspondence from a whole range of
people—from the self-employed to high earners—who are
keen about the proposal, because they believe that it will encourage
them to save more for the future. They resent having to buy an annuity
at 75. They want the flexibility that the measure brings to give them
more control over their pensions and their savings. That is one of the
themes that run through the Government’s approach to reforming
pensions and savings. We want to give people more flexibility not only
in the way they accumulate their pension savings and their savings more
generally, but also in the way they use the pension pots that they have
built up when they have chosen to retire. This measure captures the
right balance, ensuring that taxpayers’ interests are
safeguarded by clawing back the tax relief given. It also ensures that
people have some choice and control over their savings. It will in the
long term prove a further reason for people to build up
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000175">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> On 14 October 2010, the Treasury announced that it
would reduce the annual allowance from the current level of
£255,000 a year, to £50,000 a year, and the Finance Bill
confirms those figures. Amendment 188 is our attempt to tease out from
the Government how they are addressing circumstances in which people in
defined benefit schemes have a large deemed charge in a single year and
are therefore hit by additional tax charges. The reduction in the
allowance will bring many more individuals within the scope of the tax
changes. Those changes will apply to all pension scheme members,
whether they are in defined benefit or defined contribution pension
arrangements, and will include both occupational and personal pension
schemes.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000185">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Substantial
numbers of people are now likely to be affected, and I would welcome
the Minister’s assessment of the impact of the changes as far as
numbers are concerned, particularly those in final salary schemes who
have long service or have had large salary increases. The Government
estimated in 2010 that 100,000 people would be affected. I would
welcome confirmation from the Minister that that figure is still in
place, or whether it has been revised up or down since the initial
assessment. As there is no current intention to increase the
allowances, my worry is that many people may be caught up in future
years, as salaries and incomes change. Up to 200,000 people could face
additional tax in future if inflation increases and tax allowance
limits remain the same. Even if only the originally estimated 100,000
are affected, a much larger number will need to be involved in checking
to see whether they are affected.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My first
point is that we need some current assessment—not for October
2010, but for June 2011—and for future years, of the numerical
impact of these changes in the annual allowance. My second point is
that the tax charge may be quite substantial for those affected. For
example, an executive earning around £150,000 a year with 20
years’ service, in a final salary pension scheme, will face tax
of £12,200 on a pay rise of £9,000, which is a marginal
rate of tax of 135% on a pension increase plus 50% income tax. That
makes a combined tax rate of 185% on the pay rise.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We can have
many debates about how to tax higher earners but, under clause 1 of
this very same Bill, the Minister indicated that the Government would
undertake a long-term review of the 50p rate of tax. Yet we face a
situation in which final salary pension schemes might well be
threatened with a combined tax rate of 185% on the pay rise being
brought
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
number of affected employees will face complex choices, about whether
to accrue benefits and pay the tax, or not to accrue benefits and face
a much poorer retirement. Wealthy individuals who might want to save
more than £50,000 in a pension scheme will not be the only ones
affected. Many individuals currently choose to pay off debts—for
example, mortgages—and not to save into pensions, given that
debt interest is usually much higher than interest on savings; they
might then be planning to save hard for retirement using spare income,
having paid off the mortgage. The effects of the measure will mean that
they are less likely to be able to do that in the longer term. The
total pension would be reasonable, but it would have been funded in the
second half of their working life rather than uniformly throughout
their life, and that could create some difficulties. I wish the
Minister to examine such issues and to give some response
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Potential
concerns include parents returning to work after a period of raising a
family, who might feel under-pensioned; they might therefore wish to
divert significant amounts of their income into ensuring a decent
pension in old age. They, too, might be hit disproportionately by the
proposals before the Committee today. Entrepreneurs are another good
example: they might have had a long period of building a business and
putting their resources into it, expecting rewards for their hard work
to flow in only after some years. Their ability to save for a pension
might only arise once the business starts to pay decent profits, which
could be towards the latter part of their careers. All of those
groups—those who pay off debts 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 478<a class="bkMark" name="Column478">&#160;</a>
                  </div>first, those who are out of work and then in work because of family
commitments, and those who are building a business—might find
themselves disadvantaged by the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000190">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Complexity
in tax legislation on pension schemes potentially creates barriers to
encouraging people to save. Clearly, there is a large reduction in the
amount of the annual allowance in the clause. Before April 2009,
individuals could contribute significantly more of their income into a
pension and benefit from tax relief at the marginal rate of tax on such
contributions. The changes will have a significant impact on the
ability of individuals to
save.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
addition to the preamble, I have two particular areas on which to
question the Minister today. First, the costing of the changes: when
the Government came in, they said that they did not want to continue
with the changes we had proposed to restrict pensions tax relief but,
to square that, they needed to raise the same amount of money for the
Exchequer. The costings for how much the changes will raise may be
over-optimistic. A commitment from the Minister today about the cost of
the changes and a robust assessment of the stress testing of those
costings would be
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
as I outlined, in some circumstances the new annual cap of
£50,000 on contributions before a tax charge is triggered will
create some difficulties—not in every case, but for some people.
Those are people in defined pension schemes with large deemed
contributions if they get a promotion. I want some explanation of the
Minister’s view of those
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
summary, I have drawn attention to changes that will have a significant
impact, although admittedly on a small group, who are probably higher
earners. However, it is important for the Minister to give an
explanation to the Committee of the impact of the changes, so that we
can assess them fully before agreeing to the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000194">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> It is worth giving some background to the change.
The Government provide generous tax relief to save for a pension, to
encourage individuals to take responsibility for retirement planning
and in recognition of pensions being less flexible than other forms of
saving.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000195">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
the previous Government, the cost of tax relief, net of income tax on
pensions paid, doubled to nearly £20 billion per annum by
2009-10. To ensure that pension tax relief remains fair, affordable and
sustainable, we confirmed in the June Budget last year that we would
proceed with the previous Government’s aim of reducing the cost
of tax relief on pensions by £4 billion every year.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000196">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Member for Delyn will remember the previous Government’s
plans. They were complex and seen as unfair and anti-competitive. He
raised the issue of cost and asked how much revenue would be raised by
the measures. For the period between 2011-12 and 2015-16, the proposals
put forward by his colleagues when in Government—once updated to
reflect new economic data—would have raised £15.6 billion
in total. Across the same period, the measures that we have proposed
will raise £16.6 billion. Therefore, we will raise additional
tax revenue as a consequence of introducing this legislation, and I
hope that the right hon. Gentleman will recognise that.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000197">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Those
estimates are compiled by HMRC. They are robust and we have tried to
take into account data on earnings, growth, and ways to prove the model
in terms of assessing the impact of the measures. They are our best
estimates, and we believe that the amount of revenue raised will be
marginally greater than that which would have been raised under the
previous Government’s proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000198">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The previous
Government’s approach to achieving a reduction in pension relief
introduced significant additional complexities to the tax system; it
undermined pension saving and damaged UK businesses and
competitiveness. We believe that an approach which limits the amount of
tax relief for those who make the highest contributions is better than
restricting the rate of tax relief available to those on incomes above
an arbitrary threshold. In our proposals, those whose pension
contributions exceed £50,000 will not receive any tax relief.
Under proposals put forward by the previous Government, even those
earning the highest salaries and paying the highest rate of tax would
have received tax relief at a rate of 20% per annum.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000199">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We wanted to
ensure a more flexible and simpler system, and we consulted on that
basis. Several commentators commended our approach; the Institute for
Fiscal Studies stated that perhaps the most welcome change in the 2010
Budget was the decision to rethink the previous Government’s
“complex, unfair and inefficient” plans for pension
contribution relief for high earners. The responses to the informal
consultation held last summer confirmed our view that reducing the
allowances to tax-privileged pension saving would be fairer. That
approach preserves incentives to save and lessens the impact on the
ability of UK businesses to attract and retain talent. It is also more
straightforward to understand and implement.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In October,
we announced that from the 2011-12 tax year, the annual allowance for
tax-privileged savings would be reduced from £255,000 to
£50,000. Such a move recognises that it is right to provide
generous tax relief to save in a pension, but that it is also right to
ration that relief at a more appropriate level. The CBI responded
positively to our approach, saying
that<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000201">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“these
new proposals are a significant improvement on the approach proposed by
the previous Government, which was simply
unworkable.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000429">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause
66 reduces the annual allowance to £50,000 for tax year 2011-12
and beyond. Individuals making annual pension savings above that level
will face an annual allowance charge to recoup the tax relief that has
been granted to them. The reduced allowance of tax-privileged saving
will apply to all individuals receiving UK tax relief in all types of
registered pension schemes. An annual allowance of £50,000 is a
level that far exceeds average annual contributions. That will protect
those on moderate incomes on whom a lower limit would have impacted.
The reduction in the annual allowance goes hand in hand with the
reduction in the lifetime allowance to £1.5 million, which we
will cover in detail when we discuss clause 67.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000202">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The reduction
in the lifetime allowance allowed a higher level of the annual
allowance to be set than we originally proposed, while still raising
the intended revenue. That combined approach also provides individuals
with  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 480<a class="bkMark" name="Column480">&#160;</a>
                  </div>greater flexibility around when they make their annual pension
contributions. With the changes to the lifetime allowance in clause 67,
the reduced annual allowance will generate £4 billion-worth of
annual revenue in steady state, thus protecting public
finances.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000203">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Reducing
the allowances will affect individuals with the highest levels of
pension savings only, leaving the vast majority of pension savers
unaffected by the changes. In fact, less than 1% of pension savers will
be affected. That alternative approach to restricting pension tax
relief has been welcomed by pension and employer groups, and we have
continued to work in consultation with them to finalise the design of
the new scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As a result
of ongoing consultation with the pension industry since the publication
of the Finance Bill on 31 March, changes have been
indentified that would make the application of legislation simpler, and
therefore reduce administrative burdens on the pension industry.
Government amendments 129 to 133 ensure that the legislation will work
as we
intend.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000205">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
133 addresses a simple drafting issue. The annual allowance charge
operates by reference to pension savings made over a certain period. In
changing the dates of when that period begins and ends, the Bill
inadvertently provided for, in certain circumstances, a period of 364
rather than 365 days. The amendment corrects that so that the period
will be 12 months unless the scheme or, in other circumstances, its
members nominate otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000206">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
130 to 132 concern individuals who have high annual allowance charges.
The schedule provides for them to nominate to meet their tax charge out
of their pension savings. If they so nominate, an offsetting adjustment
is made by the pension scheme to reduce the individual’s pension
savings to reflect the tax paid on their behalf. Schedule 17 provides
for the amount of the adjustment to be reflected in the valuation of
the individual’s savings when determining their annual allowance
charge in the year the adjustment is made. Amendments 130 to 132
address an imbalance in carrying out the adjustment between individuals
in defined benefit or cash schemes and those in defined contribution
schemes. Amendment 129 relates to the year in which a pension comes
into
payment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000207">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
calculating the increase in pension rights, there is a choice between
continuing to use a notional valuation and using the actual amount of
pension benefits taken. Schedule 17 provides for the notional amount to
be used, but representations received since the Bill was published have
shown that that is confusing for individuals, who could expect the
actual amount of their pension to be taken into account. The
representations also show that the practical application of the
provision is administratively burdensome for pension schemes. Using a
notional value in those circumstances also has the unintended
consequence of excluding all enhancements paid to an individual who
retires early on grounds of ill health. It was not the intention to
preclude ill-health retirements that do not meet the definition of
serious or severe ill health from the annual allowance charge.
Amendment 129 removes that disjoint and makes a value used in the year
of retirement easier to understand for those taking benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000208">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
188, in the name of the right hon. Member for Delyn, requires the
Government to lay before the House by 1 April 2012 an assessment of the
impacts of clause 66 and schedule 17, including the impact of creating
marginal tax rates of more than 100%. He has given more explanation of
why he tabled the amendment. He talked about marginal tax rates, but I
point out to him that under the scheme the previous Government proposed
that it was possible for income to rise by only £2,000 before
having a marginal tax rate of 650%. We very carefully learnt lessons
from the flaws in the design of that scheme.

Macavity—he was not around at the time, because he was in the
Home Office. It is a fair comment, as we cannot all be held to account
for the detail of legislation proposed by our colleagues.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman needs to be a little careful because the measure does
not alter the rate of tax relief. It will still be at the marginal
rate. The measure simply imposes a stricter rationing on how much
tax-privileged saving any one person can make. There will be no relief
over £50,000 of saving. As such, tax charges are a direct result
of a change in the level of pension contributions, rather than a change
in income. In that sense, the concept of marginal effective tax rates
is not a useful
way—<em>[</em>

               <p class="tabbed">The
concept of marginal effective tax rates is not a useful way of
considering the measure’s impact on individuals. Marginal
effective tax rates relate to how an additional pound of income affects
the rate of tax that an individual
faces.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman got to the nub of the question in his remarks on
the impact that the measure could have on people. He asked whether it
would affect only 100,000 people. The 100,000 estimate is based on a
detailed model that makes use of data from HMRC’s operational
income tax systems and the administrative returns provided to HMRC by
all pension providers. The methodology is consistent with previous
estimates of the policy and the previous Government’s approach.
The methodology underpinning the estimate was set out in the Budget
2011 policy costings document and has been scrutinised and certified by
the Office for Budget
Responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000214">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
100,000 figure is lower than the number of people we expected to be
affected before the details of the regime were announced in October. We
were able to reduce the number of people affected because we were able
to increase the annual allowance above the amount initially expected.
Additionally, the factor of the value of an increase in savings to
defined benefit pension schemes is also lower than originally expected,
which has helped soften the
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000215">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
does not mean that 100,000 people will be paying tax charges from their
pension benefits. We expect that individuals and employers will look to
adapt their pension saving behaviour and remuneration terms to aim off
and ensure that their pension contributions remain below the annual
allowances, so that they will 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 482<a class="bkMark" name="Column482">&#160;</a>
                  </div>never face a charge. We expect about 40% of people to aim off in 2011-12
and for that to increase to 65% of defined benefit scheme members and
90% of defined contribution scheme members by
2015-16,<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other issue raised by the right hon. Gentleman is the impact that the
measure will have on flexibility, the way in which people save for
their retirement and the extent to which that triggers a large tax
bill. I will take a few moments to set out the steps that we have taken
to mitigate that
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
reduce the likelihood of individuals exceeding the annual allowance, we
first set a more generous annual allowance than originally proposed.
Secondly, we ensured that individuals would be able to carry forward
any unused allowances from the previous three years. Citing the right
hon. Gentleman’s example, someone who is out of the market for
three years would effectively accumulate a £50,000 annual
allowance in each of those three years, which they could use in a year
in which they were in employment and pay higher pension tax
contributions. Similarly, someone setting up a business could achieve
exactly the same goal. They could choose not to make pension
contributions for three years and use the accumulated unused annual
allowance to make a larger contribution in one particular
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
recognise that there may be circumstances, despite the mitigation
measures, in which people pay a higher charge. Individuals with an
annual allowance charge exceeding £2,000 will be able to elect
to meet their full charge from their pension benefits instead. That
recognises that a substantial increase in pension wealth has led to the
liability in the first
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000219">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that I have reassured the right hon. Gentleman that we have
thought carefully about the impact of the measure on people who may in
one year face a sudden one-off increase in the value of their pension
and consequently face an increased tax charge. There are ways in which
they can mitigate that. I think the overall package of measures that we
have here achieves our goal of making sure that the cost of pension tax
relief is fair, affordable and sustainable and that there is sufficient
flexibility in the
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000220">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I shall be quick because the amendments are
relatively self-explanatory and I hope the Minister will consider
accepting them. If an individual’s pension and savings pot is
very small, it is defined in the Bill as 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 484<a class="bkMark" name="Column484">&#160;</a>
                  </div>trivial. When he retires, an individual can choose to take it as a lump
sum or a commutation. Under the old rules, that could be done if the
pension pot was less than 1% of the lifetime pension allowance. The
Minister has, I accept, listened to representations about this. Given
that the Bill brings down the lifetime allowance, the figure needs to
be changed. The Government have therefore gone for a figure of
£18,000 and below for the new definition of trivial.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000269">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The only
problem is that the effective date of implementation of the trivial
commutation limit of £18,000 is for 2012-13. However, by the end
of 2012-13, the trivial commutation limit will have already been fixed
at £18,000 for three years. It strikes me that it would be
possible for the Government to consider raising the limit slightly; we
suggest the figure of £21,500 in the amendments. That would
allow a few more of the poorer pensioners, who have slightly bigger but
still relatively small pension pots, to take them as a lump sum. The
cost to the Exchequer would be negligible, because the Government would
still get some tax from lump sum payments.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000270">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are designed to tease out the answer to the following
questions. On what basis has the Minister fixed the limit of
£18,000? Why has it not been raised in line with inflation, over
the course of the years in which it has been operating? Does he intend
to raise it in future years? At the moment, freezing it at
£18,000 for an effective three-year period to 2012-13 means that
the value of £18,000 is diminished accordingly. Our suggestion
is to index it initially at £21,500, which could be reviewed in
due course. I welcome the prospect of finding out whether the Minister
will accept the amendment. In anticipation that he may not, I would
like to know when he intends to monitor the change in the value of
£18,000, or if it is fixed in
perpetuity.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000271">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The clause and schedule seek to reduce the lifetime
allowance from £1.8 million to £1.5 million. That takes
it back to the same level as on A-day in 2006, and it would raise
around £0.5 billion in annual revenues. The reduction means that
the annual allowance will be higher than we originally proposed, which
will help protect those on moderate incomes. There are provisions in
the schedule to protect those who have pots in excess of £1.5
million already, but I will not go through those as they are clearly
not the point that the right hon. Gentleman is keen to focus
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000272">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman is right to say that the limit is set at £18,000.
In the past, the limit has been effectively 1% of the lifetime
allowance. Clearly, reducing the lifetime allowance to £1.5
million gives us the opportunity to decouple that link, which is
helpful. The right hon. Gentleman’s amendments would increase
the amount to be paid out to registered pension schemes in certain
circumstances without incurring unauthorised payment charges. It is
proposed that the limit should be raised from £18,000 to
£21,500.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000273">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Pension tax
rules currently allow pension pots to be taken out as a lump sum, if an
individual’s aggregate pension savings are below a specified
limit. Some 25% of the lump sum can be paid tax free, while the
remainder is taxable as income. That is known as trivial commutation,
but the rules also extend to a number of other, different
circumstances, which are also covered by the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000274">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">We need to
bear in mind the point that the right hon. Gentleman made in an earlier
debate. We are seeking to encourage people to build up pension pots to
support themselves and provide an income in retirement. Evidence shows
that an annuity can be purchased with as little as £5,000. The
median wealth held by individuals in a defined contribution
occupational pension is £6,500, while in a defined contribution
personal pension, it is £12,000. Those are both way under the
£18,000 limit currently in statute, and the £21,500 level
proposed by the right hon. Gentleman. Against the background of the
relatively low amounts held in defined contribution schemes and the
fact that annuities can be bought with as little as £5,000, the
current limit is set at an appropriate level. It is not right to
increase it by £3,500 at this point.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000275">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What we have
said—and this returns to the consultation document that the
right hon. Gentleman mentioned earlier, when we discussed early
access—is that we will explore reform to trivial commutation
rules to improve flexibility for those with very small levels of
savings in personal pension schemes. We will keep the lifetime trivial
commutation limit under review, and we will consider any evidence on
the benefit of an increased limit. I hope that that provides the right
hon. Gentleman with the reassurance that he is looking
for.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000276">&#160;</a>

                  <em>]</em> I am encouraged by
support from the Government Benches for my clear reference. That
newspaper expressed the concern that under the NEST scheme, which we
introduced, fund managers could put money into unsuitable forms that
would eat up much of the savings in fees. Because of coalition support
for the proposal, which we agree with, automatic enrolment in pension
schemes could expose people to unscrupulous schemes. Will the Minister
assure me that the concerns expressed by Mr David Pitt-Watson of Hermes
Fund Managers are unsubstantiated?<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000316">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
187 is a probing amendment. Our intention is to highlight the complete
inadequacy of this measure in ensuring a fair and balanced burden of
taxation. The target revenue for this tax is too low and the Government
refuse to consider any taxation on the banks below that low level. The
issue is an important part of the Finance Bill, which many Members will
want to debate. There are many more aspects of the schedule that
Members will want to discuss beyond the issue brought forward by our
amendment, so rather than pressing the amendment to a vote now or
opposing the clause, we should like to return to the issue on Report.
In the meantime, I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to
press the Minister on a few
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000321">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Opposition
Members support the principle of the bank levy. It is important to
ensure that the banking sector makes a fair contribution towards the
costs of the financial and economic crisis and that the burden of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 487<a class="bkMark" name="Column487">&#160;</a>
                  </div>taxation is shared out fairly when taxes have to be raised. A specific
tax on the banks is a good way in which to achieve both objectives.
That is why the Opposition called for a repeat of last year’s
bank bonus tax. What we have from the Government is wholly
inadequate.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000322">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
we support the levy in principle, questions must be asked about the
amount and why that level was chosen. When the bank levy was debated on
the Floor of the House last month, my hon. Friend the Member for
Nottingham East said that we were unable to table an amendment to this
Bill that would raise the level of the bank levy. That is why amendment
187 calls on the Government to report on why these particular rates and
allowances were chosen for the levy and what the effect would be of
lowering the allowances in terms of the amount of tax raised.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000323">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many measures
that the Government have taken have supposedly been beneficial to
people, but when they are put in the context of other policies, we see
that the Government are not really helping ordinary people at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000324">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am glad that my hon. Friend has made the point
about not helping ordinary people. The Treasury’s original
design for the bank levy showed that it would raise £3.9 billion
and not the £2.6 billion that is currently forecast. Does she
agree that that additional £1.3 billion would make all the
difference as it would take the pressure off hard-working families, who
are being penalised by the Government?<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000325">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That is the issue to which I want the Minister
to respond. Of all the priorities for taxation, he—I say
“he”, but I am perhaps slightly elevating his position
and should say “the Government, of whom the Minister is a very
valued member”—chose to give with one hand and take away
with the other, for which the Government were criticised by the
director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000326">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For example,
the personal allowance for income tax is supposed to give people an
extra £40 a year, but it is wiped out by the Government’s
hike in VAT, which will cost the average family with children more than
10 times that amount—more than £450 a year.
The 1p cut in fuel duty, which this Committee has already discussed, is
peanuts compared with the 9p or 10p a litre that the Government will
have added to fuel taxation by August 2012.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000327">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s proposals for a bank levy are no exception. The
£2.6 billion forecast to be raised by the bank levy may seem
like a lot until it is put in the context of the £4.9 billion
that the Government plan to take away from families with children in
cuts to child benefit, child tax credit, the child trust fund and the
Sure Start maternity grant. The bank levy could be put in the context
of the £10.6 billion a year that the Government will take out of
people’s pockets by 2014-15 by switching to CPI indexation for
benefits, tax credits and public service pensions. Compared with that,
the bank levy will be little more than a drop in the ocean in terms of
rebalancing the burden of taxation.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000328">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The levy
could even be put in the context of the implicit subsidy that the
taxpayer has been providing to all large banks in the UK in the
expectation that the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 488<a class="bkMark" name="Column488">&#160;</a>
                  </div>taxpayer will bail them out if they fail. According to the Bank of
England, that subsidy is worth £100 billion a year. There was
clearly scope to go much further and to make a genuine impact. Will the
Minister tell the Committee what steps were taken to determine the
level of the bank levy and what assessment the Government have made of
the amount of tax that could be raised by setting the threshold at a
lower rate—specifically at £10 billion, as detailed in
our
amendment?<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000329">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have demonstrated that the low level of taxation in this
case was their choice. The target revenue of £2.6 billion is no
accident. In their consultation on the bank levy, they stated that they
intended to raise £2.5 billion when it was fully in place.
Following the consultation, they found that their proposals would have
raised nearly £4 billion. Ministers could have stood by their
original design, but instead they took active steps to reduce the
amount, principally by changing the proposed £20 billion
threshold into a tax-free
allowance.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000330">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">We
did not receive a full explanation from the Minister on the Floor of
the House, so perhaps he will explain to the Committee now why the
target of £2.6 billion of revenue was chosen. What estimates
were made of the impact of that level and any other levels on the
industry and on revenue for the Exchequer? Why were the Government so
averse to raising more than that through the original mechanism? They
also refused to tax the banks via a bank bonus tax, which the
Opposition suggested. The bonus pool for 2010 across the City of London
has been estimated at some £7 billion. There is, understandably,
still a great deal of public outrage about that because it is an
incredible figure, particularly when banks are still failing to meet
their responsibilities to wider society. As we discovered recently, the
Project Merlin banks are missing their lending targets by some
£25 million a
day.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000331">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
called on the Government to repeat the bank bonus tax that the Labour
Government introduced. Unfortunately, the Chancellor refused to take
that option. The bonus tax raised £3.5 billion for the
Exchequer, and that would ensure a fair contribution from the banks. It
would also provide funds to be invested in a real plan for growth in
the economy, which we sorely
lack.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000332">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
plan that we proposed before the Budget this year was based on a
conservative estimate that a repeat bonus tax would raise £2
billion. We proposed using that to create 110,000 new jobs, construct
25,000 new homes and boost investment in local businesses through the
regional growth fund by £200 million. The Government’s
refusal to repeat the bonus tax means that banks are looking at a tax
cut this year worth about £1 billion, which the Government are
granting by watering down a bonus tax of £3.5 billion to a bank
levy worth just £2.5 billion. That does not include
their cuts in corporation tax, which will give back to the banks
£100 million this year, with many more cuts planned by the end
of the
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000333">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the same year, families have lost thousands of pounds in tax credits
and benefits, and are paying hundreds of pounds more in tax. Families
with children are being hit especially hard, with cuts to child care
support alone amounting to up to £1,560 a year. This is also the
year when those families are seeing reductions in NHS staff and police
numbers, with reductions of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 489<a class="bkMark" name="Column489">&#160;</a>
                  </div>more than 11% in some local council grants from the Government, and cuts
or closures in their local public services.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000334">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
bank levy is an important issue and many hon. Members will want to
speak about it on Report. Our amendment would address just one of the
many concerns about the Government’s proposal, so we will not
press it to a vote today, but will the Minister explain why the
Government took active steps to reduce the amount taken by the bank
levy following their consultation, when at the same time they raised
taxes and cut payments and services for ordinary
families?<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000335">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Does
the Minister accept that the banks have a bigger role to play in
contributing to the cost of the financial and economic crisis, which
began in the financial sector? The Government had a choice on ensuring
the fairest possible distribution of taxation. Given the relatively
puny amount that they expect to raise from the banks, and the steps
that they have taken to keep that amount down, ordinary families would
be right to wonder whose side the Government are
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000336">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Clearly, many hon. Members who spoke about this
matter in the Committee of the whole House may want to speak at length
on Report, but mercifully not this evening. It was always our intention
that the levy would raise around £2.5 billion. That is what we
set out to achieve, and that is what we are delivering through clause
72 and schedule 19. We will move to the more substantive stand part
debate a little
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000337">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
levy will be paid by between 30 and 40 building societies and banking
groups. We think the amount that we seek to raise from that is an
appropriate contribution. It was set with consideration for the wider
environment, including the international programme of regulatory
reform, global economic conditions and the need to maintain the
competitiveness of the UK sector. The rates of the levy were chosen to
deliver that. Other countries have chosen different headline rates, but
we need to bear in mind the relative size of the banking sectors, and
the design of the bank levy, in different countries. If we look at the
combined effect of rates based on the scope of the bank levies in
relative terms, the UK levy is larger than that of France and that of
Germany.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000338">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Bristol East suggested that the banks were getting a
good deal out of the proposals and referred to the reduction in
corporation tax that we announced in the Budget. She suggested that
banks were benefiting by £0.1 billion, but I point it out to her
that that estimate of £0.1 billion relates not only to banking,
but to insurance and pension funds and to auxiliary financial services.
Clearly, banks are paying more as a consequence of the increase in the
bank levy that was announced in the Budget than they are benefiting
from the reduction in corporation tax rates.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000339">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the
allowance and threshold, when we announced the bank levy last year we
stated that there would be a threshold of £20 billion. As part
of the subsequent consultation exercise, however, we explicitly sought
views on whether an allowance would be preferable to an all-or-nothing
threshold. The respondents to the consultation made it clear that a
threshold would provide a cliff edge, which banks would avoid by
restructuring, and they even suggested that banks or building societies
might avoid growing their UK operations to avoid the threshold. I think
that that is a fair point.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000340">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 490<a class="bkMark" name="Column490">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">We have
decided, therefore, that there should be an allowance on the first
£20 billion of liabilities that are liable to the levy. The
sector is not paying any less levy as a result of that, because we have
made it clear from the start that developments in the design of the
levy would improve its effectiveness but would not reduce the overall
expected yield. The rates were set only when the design had been
finalised, and to meet our detailed yield. Those details, along with
many others, have already been made
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000341">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am sure the hon. Lady recognises that the Government have taken
substantial steps to explain the basis of our decisions. As she will
know, all tax measures now have a tax information and impact note that
sets out clearly information about the impact of the measure. That has
provided a significant amount of analysis on the levy so far. I do not
believe that there is a need to produce any further analysis of the
rates and threshold of the bank
levy.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000342">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second part of amendment 187 also concerns the allowance, and it seeks
a forecast of the change in yield that would be achieved if we were to
reduce the allowance from £20 billion to £10 billion. As
I have explained, the Government did not introduce an allowance to
reduce the overall yield from the levy. Instead, the allowance ensures
that the levy is proportionate to the risks inherent in banking
businesses of different sizes. That means that smaller banks and
building societies and foreign banks with a small UK
presence—those whose liabilities are less than the £20
billion annual allowance—will not pay the levy.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000343">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not know
whether the hon. Lady has discussed her amendment with the Building
Societies Association or whether it would be content to see the
threshold of the allowance reduced and more of its members’
money—which could otherwise go to their depositors in higher
savings rates or lower borrowing rates—swallowed up in that way.
That would be the consequence of reducing the threshold and the
allowance to £10
billion.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000344">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have also had to balance the probability that the failure of a bank
might pose a systemic risk against the relative burden that is imposed
to gather additional revenue at the margin. Although size is not the
sole factor in determining risk to the system, it is an important one.
Setting a lower allowance would risk imposing an unnecessarily high
burden on institutions that do not pose a systemic risk to the UK
economy in the way that large banking institutions do. Analysis of the
change in yield from a reduction in that allowance would not,
therefore, be appropriate or worth while.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000345">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
expressed support for the principle behind the bank levy, which is
welcome. Such support was not forthcoming at the general election. The
previous Government explicitly ruled out the unilateral introduction of
a bank levy—I am pleased that her party has
recanted.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000346">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
should bear something else in mind. The hon. Lady mentioned the bank
payroll tax introduced by the previous Government, but she must
recollect that the then Chancellor said that it was a one-off measure
and could not be repeated. It is, however, much better to have a
permanent tax on banks, and the levy tackles that. Each and every year,
our permanent bank levy raises more than the one-year bonus tax
proposed by the previous Government. Our levy is raising more money
from taxes on banks than the bank payroll tax  
<div class="columnNumber">

and he explicitly ruled out a repeat of exactly the same tax
measure.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000347">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is not necessary to produce yet another report on the bank levy.
Sufficient information is in the public domain to enable people to
reach their own conclusions on the rates, the thresholds and the
allowance. Therefore, if the hon. Lady presses her amendment to a
Division, I shall encourage my hon. Friends to oppose
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000348">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister’s answers were unsatisfactory, simply repeating what
was said earlier without providing any new information on how the
decisions were reached. In particular, the banks saying, “We
don’t like the sound of that, and we’ll take our ball
away if you bring the levy in at a higher rate,” is something
the Opposition would greet with some scepticism. Basically, that is
what banks and companies do when we talk about taxing
them—indeed, individuals do so as well, although, obviously,
people at the lower end of the scale are not in a position to make such
threats.<a class="bkMark" name="11060763000350">&#160;</a>
