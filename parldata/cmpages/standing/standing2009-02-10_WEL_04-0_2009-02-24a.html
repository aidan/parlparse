<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000310"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Hood. I shall particularly address amendments 40 and 65.
The Government have signalled their intention to introduce &#147;work
for your benefit&#148; schemes, although I prefer to call the schemes
Workfare, because I think that that better describes the
Government&#146;s intention. Liberal Democrat Members have
considerable concerns about some of the proposed changes, and amendment
40 addresses parents with school-age
children.</div><a name="09022464000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
make it clear that I have no problem with parents, or single parents in
particular, working. My mother brought me and my two sisters up as a
single parent, and I have no doubt that there are many other people in
the same position. However, we are talking about working for benefit,
and a change in Government policy to cover children of school
age.</div><a name="09022464000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the proposals, from October 2010, single parents with children aged
seven or over will be required to claim jobseeker&#146;s allowance.
After 12 months, they will be transferred to a private provider under
flexible new deal provisions and, after 24 months, to work experience 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>schemes. We will then have a situation in which single parents will be
competing with jobseekers for the attention and support of flexible new
deal providers, although there will be no additional incentives or
resources to support that group.</div>
<a name="09022464000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Previous
experience of asking private sector providers to deliver for single
parents have shown that, without additional resources, they are
unwilling to invest in this area. In what is usually described as
&#147;parking&#148;, there are concerns that providers will take
little action for the most vulnerable claimants, who will therefore be
more likely to become eligible for the &#147;work for your
benefit&#148; schemes.</div>
<a name="09022464000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The YWCA is
concerned not only that this is a &#147;work for your benefit&#148;
programme, but that it is also inappropriate for single parents and
unlikely to lead to improved work outcomes. Single parents are likely
to form a disproportionate number of the participants. We have gone
from the Government talking about the idea in the Green Paper to a
situation in which the proposal is going to be actively
implemented.</div>
<a name="09022464000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Research from
the Department for Work and Pensions itself suggests that there is
little evidence&#151;not just in this sector, but across
others&#151;that work for benefit schemes actually increase the
likelihood of finding work. Such a scheme is least effective at getting
people into jobs in weak labour markets where unemployment is high. I
am sad to say that that is the case in many of our constituencies. It
is also not effective for individuals with multiple barriers for work,
and it can reduce employment chances by limiting the time available for
job search and failing to provide the skills and experience that
employers
value.</div><a name="09022464000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
all that evidence, the Government, in their Green Paper, preferred to
rely on the following justification:</div>
<a name="09022464000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
report points to evidence that full-time activity in such programmes
leads to improved job outcomes: between a half and two-thirds of
leavers found unsubsidised work at some point in the three years after
leaving the Wisconsin programme. Australia's 'Work for the Dole' had a
7 per cent net increase in participants going into jobs compared to
nonparticipants.&#148;</div>
<a name="09022464000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Significantly, with
reference to the Australian research, the Green Paper omitted a
sentence that the research report included, in bold type:</div>
<a name="09022464000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
other research found that WfD was ineffective in helping participants
find sustainable employment with only one-quarter in work three months
after leaving the programme and 14 per cent employed in
full-time jobs.&#148;</div>
<a name="09022464000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is seriously
worrying that the DWP is prepared to consider work for benefit schemes
without addressing some of the key problems that other programmes have
encountered.</div>
<a name="09022464000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
consider the current employment climate. At a time of rising
unemployment, the Bill&#146;s focus on conditionality and sanctions
is inappropriate. We should be concentrating on protecting the jobs
that already exist and strengthening the opportunities that are
available for people to find work. Using the big stick might have been
appropriate a few years ago, but not in the current economic climate.
We are particularly concerned that rising unemployment will cause
anxiety and
fear<i class="I">&#151;</i><i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="09022464000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000311"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I will not allow conversations to take
place between Members in the room while an amendment is being
moved.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div><a name="09022464000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000312"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Thank you, Mr.
Hood.</div><a name="09022464000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
this time of increased anxiety, lone parents, disabled people and those
facing the prospect of unemployment will be the hardest hit. We thus
believe that excluding lone parents with children of school age from
the programme, as proposed in amendment 40, would be
appropriate.</div><a name="09022464000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
65 would ensure that before any programmes were produced, there would
have to be evidence that there was guaranteed and predictable access to
good-quality, affordable and flexible child care.</div>
<a name="09022464000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">A woman who
came to see me in my surgery a couple of weeks ago was getting a job
which would leave her under the 16-hour rule, so she would not be
entitled to receive the child tax credits that would have enabled her
to pay for her child care. She told me that she would end up being only
&#163;5 a week better off. She has decided that she wants to work,
but she is working those hours for an extra &#163;5 a week. I would
prefer the Government to amend the 16-hour rule so that parents can pay
for flexible child care and to ensure that child care is provided in
areas where there are shortages. Such steps would represent money
better spent on helping people back into work.</div>
<a name="09022464000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions in this part of the Bill are meaningless because they do not
deal with some of the problems and barriers that many lone parents face
when moving into work. I would prefer the Government to concentrate on
addressing that, rather than using the stick without the
carrot.</div>
<a name="09022464000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022464000313"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): It is a pleasure to
see you in the Chair, Mr. Hood. I look forward to serving on
the Committee with you.</div>
<a name="09022464000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
hon. Member for Rochdale for mentioning my amendment&#151;hopefully
my input will result in better child care for children throughout the
country&#151;and I thoroughly endorse what he said. Having said that,
this is about a Scottish element to the Bill, and I want to ensure that
adequate support is
available.</div><a name="09022464000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that there is a need to get people into work, particularly at
the current time, and I disagree with the premise of amendment 40
because this has to be about exchange, not something for nothing.
However, we know about the difficulty in reaching our targets and the
prospective child poverty Bill, so we need to make sure that children
are at the forefront of our minds when we consider the effect of this
Bill. We cannot put extra strain on parents by making them worse off
through a system that is supposed to work in the other direction. Given
the increasing obligations to be placed on unemployed parents, there is
widespread concern about a lack of high-quality, flexible and
affordable child care in Scotland. Amendment 65 would ensure that such
child care was considered before strict conditions were placed on
parents.</div><a name="09022464000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Work
on the amendment has been carried out by the Scottish Campaign on
Welfare Reform, which includes more than 40 organisations that work
with people experiencing exclusion and poverty in Scotland. I thank it
for its work and help. The amendment has already attracted media
coverage north of the border, and I thank the media for publicising the
need to look at the amendment. I also thank Citizens Advice Scotland
for its help, not just with this amendment, but through the other work
that it has done with me over the years.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div><a name="09022464000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">This amendment
would ensure that, unless a claimant had access to good, affordable
child care, they would not be faced with the Catch-22 of deciding
between benefits and making sure that their children were looked after.
According to figures from One Parent Families Scotland, more than
50,000 children could be affected by the planned changes. We must
remember that there is no legal entitlement to child care in Scotland,
unlike in England and Wales, and no subsidy for child care for
two-year-olds in Scotland, unlike in England and
Wales.</div><a name="09022464000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are limited means for systematically monitoring Scottish provision, so
it is difficult to get a clear picture of the situation. However, we do
know that between 2006 and 2008, the number of child care centres and
child minders in Scotland fell from 10,388 to 10,322. While the
decrease might be small, it is none the less a decrease at a time when
we were hoping to give better coverage for children north of the
border.</div><a name="09022464000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Costs
are the biggest hurdle to getting a job with an income to support a
family, especially for single parents and couples with low incomes. It
is concerning that figures from the Daycare Trust show that the cost of
out-of-school child care in Scotland increased by 29 per cent. in the
last 12 months, while the cost of a nursery place rose by around 12 per
cent. Given the problems in the finance markets and the fact that
inflation is coming down, these increases are greater than we would
expect parents paying for child care to
face.</div><a name="09022464000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
DWP&#146;s impact assessment on the Bill, which was published in
January, emphasised the importance of child care and recognised the
risks of imposing obligations on parents. However, it stated that those
were mitigated by the improvements in England and Wales as a result of
the Childcare Act 2006, which places a duty on local authorities in
those countries to secure sufficient child care for working parents.
However, there is no such duty in Scotland, as my right hon. Friend the
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform recognised on Second Reading
when he
said:</div><a name="09022464000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
measures are not, as billed, &#145;Any job at any cost,&#146;
regardless of whether there is child care provision or other elements.
I take on board what many of my Scottish friends have said
about...child care provision in some areas of Scotland, not least
Glasgow.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 27 January 2009; Vol.
487, c.
268.]</div><a name="09022464000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
that recognition is welcome, we need to ensure that the Bill takes
account of child care availability so that they are not just warm
words. I look to the Minister to address these
concerns.</div>
<a name="09022464000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09022464000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
should be noted that a precedent was set with regard to the Children
(Leaving Care) Act 2000, with regard to which Scotland was given nearly
four years to put its house in order so that it could come in line with
England and Wales. I am asking the Minister for something similar: for
the Bill to give the Scottish Government and local authorities north of
the border time to ensure that children in Scotland receive the same
care and attention as those in the rest of the
UK.</div><a name="09022464000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022464000314"></a><b class="B">Mr.
James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): It is a great pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. We look forward
to receiving your guidance as we seek to subject the Bill to proper
parliamentary
scrutiny.</div><a name="09022464000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Rochdale said, the Government&#146;s plans for
&#147;work for your benefit&#148; were first mooted in their Green
Paper of July 2008. It might assist the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>Committee if I say, by way of brief introduction, that in January
2008&#151;six months before the Government produced this
scheme&#151;we published a Green Paper on the subject. We proposed a
return-to-work programme, saying:</div>
<a name="09022464000043"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
intention is that anyone who has been through the new system without
finding work and has claimed the allowance for longer than two out of
the previous three years will be required to join a mandatory long-term
community work scheme as a condition of continuing to receive benefit
support.&#148;</div><a name="09022464000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not resile one bit from that proposition, which we produced a little
before the Government reached their
position.</div><a name="09022464000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
what the hon. Member for Rochdale said in general terms about the
Liberal Democrats&#146; approach, I take it that they are opposed to
the proposal in principle and that amendment 40 is not just a probing
amendment to seek more details. It was not entirely clear whether that
opposition in principle extended to all time or just the present
economic circumstances. However, we must consider amendment 40 against
that background.</div>
<a name="09022464000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">It appears to
me&#151;I look forward to legal advice and analysis from those with
perhaps greater expertise than me&#151;that, under amendment 40, no
parent with a child under 16 would be eligible for &#147;work for
your benefit&#148;. The hon. Gentleman confined himself to talking
about single parents, but the amendment would apply to any couple
because it refers to responsibility for a child, not sole
responsibility for a child, so it would appear to cover both members of
any couple with a child under 16. Therefore, neither member of such a
couple would be required to work under the provisions of &#147;work
for your benefit&#148; after they had been out of work for two years
and undertaken the flexible new deal programme for 12 months. We simply
cannot agree with
that.</div><a name="09022464000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
heard the hon. Gentleman&#146;s case, but it is always possible to
mix and match research on such a subject, and it appears that there is
no academic consensus. He referred to the Australian scheme of working
for benefit, which appears to attract at least a degree of political
consensus. A telling feature of that scheme is that while it was
introduced by the previous Australian Government, the incoming
Australian Government, who are of a different political complexion,
have chosen to keep the scheme in place. That tells us something about
the way in which the scheme in seen in Australia.</div>
<a name="09022464000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a general
proposition, we believe that work is a good thing, and that children in
families with at least one member in work do better than children in
workless families. There is a great deal of evidence to support that.
That is not only due to the higher income that work generates, but
because the child grows up seeing somebody in the family in work.
Anything that brings a family into the routine of work, that gets
children into the habit of seeing at least one of their parents go out
to work, that prevents long-term worklessness, and that helps people
get back into work, is a good
thing.</div><a name="09022464000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
heard the various complaints made by the hon. Member for Rochdale.
However, one is tempted to ask what members of families in low-income
work, or those of families in which both members have low-paid jobs,
would make of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal that if two members
of a couple are on benefits, neither should be in work. He did not
indicate whether he would press 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>amendment 40 to a Division&#151;he has not yet heard the
Minister&#146;s response&#151;but if he does so, we shall vote
against it.</div>
<a name="09022464000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Glasgow, North-West made reasonable points in support of
amendment 65, which relates to child care. He said that his points
related to Scotland, but they are important in themselves and we look
forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response to
them.</div><a name="09022464000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also note that amendment 62 is in this group, although I do not think
that the hon. Member for Rochdale discussed it. It relates to clause 3
and the entitlement to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. Clause 3&#151;as
opposed to clause 1, which deals with the &#147;work for your
benefit&#148; proposals&#151;is concerned with the shift of
claimants from income support to JSA. I have not yet heard the details
of the amendment from the hon. Gentleman&#151;I will wait to hear
what the Minister says about it&#151;but it raises a reasonable point
about the serious subject of domestic violence. I anticipate that we
will be told that the amendment would make little difference in
practice. However, it is worth considering domestic violence in such
circumstances.</div><a name="09022464000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say once again that if the hon. Gentleman presses amendment 40 to a
Division, we will oppose it, because we think that the amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000315"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Tony
McNulty):</b> I, too, look forward to working under your
chairmanship, Mr. Hood, and that of Mr.
Amess.</div><a name="09022464000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am afraid that the hon. Member for Rochdale was offering a counsel of
despair, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere implied. We are making
legislation for the future, not for the immediate downturn. However, I
would say that even in the period of economic downturn, there is more
than sufficient evidence, research and academic work to suggest that it
must be right to try to keep all individuals as close to the labour
market as possible, if not to get them formally back into work. To
suggest right at the start of our deliberations that it might be too
difficult to help such individuals because of the current economic
climate is an utter counsel of despair with which I do not agree at
all. I do not think that such a suggestion is appropriate.</div>
<a name="09022464000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
other amendments that we will consider, the hon. Member for Rochdale
did not set out an alternative, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere
implied, and the proposal in the amendment would become worse than was
suggested. As hon. Members will know, we have a policy on the stocks to
raise the school leaving age under law to 18. The hon. Member for
Rochdale is thus saying that no parent, of any
description&#151;single or plural&#151;of a child up to the age of
18 would have to comply with the conditionality regime at all. That
must be a nonsense in any circumstances, but it also makes a nonsense
of the help and support that the state should provide parents, lone
parents and couples in those circumstances. We have&#151;this guides
the entire Bill&#151;a fundamental duty to keep as many people as we
can as close to the labour market as possible, if not in it. If the
Liberals wish to demur from that, it is entirely a matter for them, but
it is a sorry day if that is really what they are suggesting.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div><a name="09022464000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not, I
hasten to add, Workfare. Workfare, by definition&#151;at its most
crude&#151;is a largely punitive program of work aimed at dissuading
claimants from continuing their claim in the first place. To suggest,
as other commentators have done&#151;the hon. Gentleman is not
original in this regard&#151;that this is Workfare of the most
punitive kind is not correct. &#147;Work for your benefit&#148;
will consist of full-time work experience that is backed up by
additional employment support designed to give the long-term unemployed
the best chance of taking work in the open labour market. As far as I
am aware, that compares with no proposal from the Liberal Democrats,
which is a shame. We think it is absolutely right that, as the duration
of a claim increases, claimants are expected to do more to help
themselves back to work. There is nothing shameful or underhand about
this. It is a proper balance of rights and responsibilities, and we
would argue that that is in the interest of the individuals
concerned.</div><a name="09022464000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have said throughout&#151;from the Green Paper onwards&#151;that,
given that this is not Workfare, we will not insist on, in any way,
shape or form, lone parents taking any old job regardless of any
significant barriers that may remain to securing employment. There are
safeguards to prevent customers from being sanctioned if a lack of
appropriate child care prevents them from participating in &#147;work
for your benefit&#148;. It is important that parents who claim JSA
understand their responsibility to make reasonable efforts to find
appropriate, affordable child care, but we want to get to a
personalised system. Each and every one of the assorted barriers that
an individual might face will be taken into account when looking at
their progression through the back-to-work programme. That addresses
points raised in subsequent
amendments.</div><a name="09022464000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take cognisance of the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow, North-West that things are not as they should be in Scotland.
There is no UK-wide equivalent of the Childcare Act 2006, which puts a
new duty on local authorities in England and Wales to secure, as far as
is practical, sufficient child care to meet the needs of working
parents. I might need to mull over my hon. Friend&#146;s proposal in
due course, and I ask him not to press it to a Division on the promise
that, after reflection, I will come back to it on Report. As we see
elsewhere in the Bill, when there is this interface between devolved
matters and UK matters, we are trying to accommodate the devolved
Administrations. I take much of what he said to heart and I promise to
pursue the matter
further.</div><a name="09022464000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the substance of the amendment, we think that it has been drawn
wrongly, with drafting technicalities that would render it rather too
broad. I am assured by lawyers who know such things far better than
I&#151;I wake up every day happy that I am not a lawyer&#151;that
those who are not parents could conceivably object to going on to a
conditionality regime because affordable and practicable child care did
not exist for parents. The effect of the amendment could be far wider
than anticipated if those without children were able to claim that they
should not participate in &#147;work for your benefit&#148; because
appropriate child care was not available. I know that that sounds daft,
and I know that it is not the thrust of what my hon. Friend wants to
achieve, but nonetheless I am assured that the effect could be that
wide.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div><a name="09022464000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We take
domestic violence very seriously but, again, amendment 62, although
perhaps tabled with the right intentions, does not come anywhere near
to achieving its aim. Let us be clear: immigration rule
289A&#151;those rules and regulations are dear to my heart in some
ways&#151;is quite rightly about there being a pathway to indefinite
leave to remain for people caught in circumstances of domestic violence
that have led to the irrevocable breakdown of a relationship. That is
thus an appropriate pathway into ILR. We would argue that once an
individual has established indefinite leave to remain, it is right and
proper for that individual to be afforded the same treatment as
everybody else. That does not mean ignoring the domestic violence
background, but that will be part of the personalised service under
conditionality. Despite raising a very important issue, amendment 62
either does not achieve what it seeks to, or, as the hon. Member for
Hertsmere suggested, is irrelevant or superfluous, because the issue is
already covered in the broader policy and the
legislation.</div><a name="09022464000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
start as I mean to go on, we reject amendments 40 and 62. I ask my hon.
Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West not to press amendment 65 to
a Division on the grounds that it concerns an important issue that I
shall consider in more detail, and on which I shall get back to the
House on
Report.</div><a name="09022464000281"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000316"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I accept that amendment 40 was badly drafted and
that it should have referred to children of single parents. However, on
amendment 62, which deals with the important matter of domestic
violence, I do not believe that the Minister gave us an adequate
explanation. Far too much of the Bill is left to further regulations,
so I would like to press amendment 62 to a Division. However, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw amendment
40.</div><a name="09022464000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000317"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I beg to move amendment 3, in
clause 1, page 2, line 19, leave

(f).</div><a name="09022464000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000318"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: amendment 88, in clause 2, page 5, line 20, after
&#145;failure&#146;, insert</div>
<a name="0902256000003"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;, including demonstrating that the
failure was caused by a long-term or fluctuating mental health
problem,&#146;.</div><a name="09022464000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

person&#146;s health at the time of the failure to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000319"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> We now come to amendment 3, which is designed
to elicit more details from the Government. The relevant paragraphs
concern good cause in relation to sanctions for failure to comply with
regulations under the &#147;work for your benefit&#148;
scheme.</div>
<a name="09022464000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like
to hear more detail about that. Will the Minister provide some examples
of the principles that animate that particular provision? Will he also
give some practical examples of what might amount to good 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>cause? As matters stand we are not seeking to oppose this, but we want
more details; at the moment the Bill is fairly broad regarding the
subject.</div>
<a name="09022464000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 88
is a Scottish nationalist amendment from the hon. Member for Glasgow,
East. It covers an important point about whether fluctuating mental
health problems should, in effect, amount to good cause of failure to
comply with work-related activities. That would seem a reasonable point
to consider. We will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s
comments about how that would fit in with the Government&#146;s ideas
on good cause&#151;one would imagine that they will have given that
matter some thought already.</div>
<a name="09022464000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 89
prescribes a person&#146;s general health as a matter to be taken
into account in determining whether or not that person has good cause
for failing to comply with requirements. Again, one imagines that the
Government will have something to say about the issue in their view of
good cause.</div>
<a name="09022464000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 77,
which is tabled in the name of the Conservative party, makes the same
point about general health amounting to good cause, but within the case
of failure to comply with requirements where the claimant is dependent
on drugs. That is a general subject to which we will return, but we
would like to hear the Minister&#146;s views at this stage as to
whether in this case general health problems might amount to a good
cause for failure to comply with requirements. Again, we simply want to
elicit information from the Government on that; it is a reasonable
point to consider.</div>
<a name="09022464000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022464000320"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): Thank you, Mr.
Hood, for your patience as I learn how these Committees work.</div>
<a name="09022464000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer,
briefly, to amendments 88 and 89. We would like to see the issue of
health clarified because the words &#147;good cause&#148; seem
quite vague. Perhaps I should say, first, that I have reservations
about the whole direction of the Bill; it seems that there are a lot of
sticks and not very many carrots. The statement was made earlier that
no one should get something for nothing; but when we are dealing with
children and people with disabilities and poor health and so on, yes,
we as a society have a duty to provide something for nothing.</div>
<a name="09022464000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a
slight fear that the Bill has been geared toward England, and Scotland
has been a bit of an afterthought, but I am reassured by the
Minister&#146;s earlier statements that he will look at the Scottish
situation. I also confirm that I agree that work is a good thing, as
the hon. Member for Hertsmere said, and that children who grow up in a
family where work is part of the routine have a big advantage: it will
help them move into work themselves. So we are positive about helping
people get into work. But when it comes to the idea of a personalised
system, which affects health and other issues as well, many Members
across the House wonder whether Jobcentre Plus can really be as
personal as the Minister hopes it can be. I would certainly hope it
could be, but my experience of dealing with bureaucracies and bodies
like Jobcentre Plus is that it is very difficult to personalise their
services.</div>
<a name="09022464000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes
there is an assumption that a person&#146;s health, whether physical
or mental, is constant. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>reality is that the health of people with fluctuating health conditions
does vary. I am interested to hear how the Minister thinks we might
deal with that.</div>
<a name="09022464000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022464000321"></a><b class="B">Meg
Munn</b> (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab/Co-op): I want to raise a
brief point on these amendments, and specifically to speak against
amendment 3. My concern relates to people with learning disabilities,
and I would like some reassurance from the Minister that regulations
will specifically address how this new proposal will impact on such
people. It is likely that there will be a number of people with
learning disabilities on JSA&#151;an increasing number are coming on
to JSA&#151;and they are likely to be people at the milder end of the
spectrum. So I would like an assurance that regulations will address
that and ensure that, in relation to these specific issues, people with
learning disabilities will be taken into account. It is enormously
important that they are given equal access to the opportunities that
the Bill presents.</div>
<a name="09022464000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000322"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> The Minister might be able to help the Committee
with this clause. We are dealing with a conditionality
aspect&#151;the withdrawal of benefit if a person does not comply.
What we do not have in front of us are the detailed regulations that
will be used to apply that conditionality. Mind, along with many other
organisations, has concerns, which are reflected in these amendments,
about how that conditionality might be applied.</div>
<a name="09022464000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">In previous
Bills that I have been involved with, the most recent of which became
the Pensions Act 2008, the Minister gave an assurance during the
Bills&#146; passage that those regulations would be made available as
and when they were produced by the Department. That would address some
of the real fears and concerns that Members have about people who have
fluctuating mental illnesses that prevent them from attending an
interview when they are summoned. If we could see from the regulations
that there is scope for that to be taken account of, or that there is a
mechanism that can be applied, I am sure that many Members would feel a
lot happier.</div>
<a name="09022464000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister therefore give us an assurance that we can see the regulations
at the earliest possible opportunity? That would allay some of the
quite reasonable fears about how this sanction would be
applied.</div>
<a name="09022464000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000323"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> On the broader point about regulations, allegedly
in this room or certainly close to it there is a rather
thick&#151;for which I apologise&#151;compendium, as promised, of
where there will be regulations or a regulation-making power throughout
the Bill. Where possible, the compendium contains at least the outline
of what those regulations will include. I do not doubt that it will
find its way to a pile, either close to members of the Committee or
otherwise, at some stage this morning. I apologise that it is tedious
and very detailed, but the Committee will know that it is one of those
areas of legislation&#151;not dissimilar to immigration&#151;where
there is a massive pile of regulation and rules alongside primary
legislation. That is not new&#151;it is just the way that things have
developed, probably since the early &#146;70s and before.</div>
<a name="09022464000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
the perfectly reasonable debate earlier&#151;I always get this in at
some stage during our Committees&#151;the Committee should be aware
that we should not suffer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>from undue specificity. If we put something on the face of the Bill that
looks in the first instance as though it blocks off an option or is
trying to put a principle on the face of the Bill, that can in many
circumstances, rather erroneously and unintentionally, preclude a whole
series of other things from being included, because of the undue
specificity. That is why we have regulations alongside to explore
things much more fully.</div>
<a name="09022464000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, to
be perfectly frank, I do not understand amendment 3, which seeks to
simply take away the regulation-making power, does not put anything in
its place, and says that we cannot prescribe what we mean in terms of
matters and circumstances and good
cause.</div><a name="09022464000084"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000324"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I repeat that amendment 3 is designed as a
probing amendment to seek details. At this stage I will not be moving
it to a
vote.</div><a name="09022464000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000325"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> In that context, I fully understand amendment 3
as a probing amendment. It clearly made no sense on its own terms. But
I apologise&#151;I realise that the hon. Gentleman said
&#147;probing&#148; at the
start.</div><a name="09022464000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Committee seeks an exhaustive list on the face of the Bill
outlining what good causes may be, that is a fool&#146;s errand. That
is in the sense that, with the greater personalisation and the focus on
individuals, we would hope to be as flexible as possible precisely
because of the very personal nature of that relationship. Of course,
that will include a person&#146;s health and other such matters.
Currently, in terms of sanctions on the new deal, the following
circumstances all constitute good cause, in terms of an impediment to
the individual being able to comply with the conditions: disease or
physical and mental disablement, travelling time, caring
responsibilities, attendance at court, arranging or attending a
funeral, being in a lifeboat crew or a part-time firefighter, domestic
emergencies, emergency duties, continued participation potentially
putting the individual&#146;s health and safety at risk, antisocial
behaviour orders, and community orders or community disposal
orders.</div>
<a name="09022464000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, we
could not have an exhaustive list of health conditions. The hon. Member
for Glasgow, East will know that elsewhere in the Bill we will be
discussing what we can do in the most flexible of terms for individuals
with ongoing disability, fluctuating conditions or&#151;particularly
in the case of later clauses&#151;problematic drug use. So, quite
deliberately, the Bill is drawn as broadly as possible, to be as
all-encompassing as possible in terms of providing the individual with
as much scope as possible for a good cause to be part of the developing
relationship between the personal adviser and the individual. Two years
down the line, at the end of the new deal, after 24 months on JSA, we
think not only that the conditionality should apply&#151;we are very
clear about that&#151;but equally, that it should apply in the most
flexible of circumstances. We should take full cognition of an
individual&#146;s circumstances, and ensure that what is established
in terms of good cause is as broadly drawn as
possible.</div>

circumstances of February 2009, for what will prevail in the future
once we get through the recession. The starting point taken by the hon.
Member for Hertsmere&#151;to tease out more readily what we mean by
good cause&#151;is, on reflection, a perfectly reasonable probing
amendment. I hope that I have sought, at least in part, to answer his
questions. I am grateful that he is not going to pursue amendment 3. I
would add, given what I have already said, that amendments 77, 88 and
89 are therefore not necessary. I also think they are problematic, in
the sense of how they relate to some other parts of the Bill, and some
other parts of what we are doing. They potentially restrict rather than
allow the greatest degree of flexibility, which is central to all that
we are trying to do in terms of the two-way relationship rooted in the
conditionality regime.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000329"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> It may assist the Committee to know that all
these amendments stand in my name and those of my hon. Friends. They
relate to the type of parliamentary scrutiny that regulations should be
subject to under the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>Bill. In each case, they require the affirmative resolution procedure as
an alternative to the negative resolution procedure that is in place at
the moment in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09022464000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee, and anyone who looks at the Bill, will have gathered, it
contains an enormous number of regulation-making powers. Without
counting them up exactly, I understand that the vast majority are
subject to the negative procedure and only one or two are subject to
the affirmative procedure. It would take up a lot of the
Committee&#146;s time and possibly generate inappropriate debate if
one was to suggest that the negative procedure was taken out in every
case and replaced by the affirmative procedure. In these amendments we
have taken what we regard as some of the more important issues
currently covered by the negative procedure&#151;I will be corrected
if I am wrong about that, but at the moment they seem to be covered by
it&#151;and suggested, as a way of opening up a debate, whether or
not they should be subject to the affirmative procedure. I am afraid
that it will be necessary to leap between a number of subjects and
areas in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09022464000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
amendment 4 would require the use of the affirmative procedure under
clause 1(8). That is in the case of hardship payments where sanctions
have been applied for failure to comply with &#147;work for your
benefit&#148; regulations. This is obviously a sensitive issue. We
observe that in the notes on clauses, provision for such hardship
payments is contained in section 20B(4) of the Jobseekers Act 1995. It
may be that the Government envisage the hardship provisions working
here in the same way as the ones that are already established. It is
certainly important to hear a few words from the Minister on this
subject.</div>
<a name="09022464000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 7
refers to proposed new section 2D. This is a different
subject&#151;that of work-related activity for claimants in receipt
of various income-based benefits, including employment and support
allowance. The regulation-making powers in question, to which this
amendment relates, are very important in the context of what is
required of these claimants by way of work-related activity. I am sure
the Committee will understand that when I say &#147;work-related
activity,&#148; it means not that a person will be required to look
for a job, but that they will be required to undertake activity that
serves as a preparation for finding work and helps to move them nearer
to the labour market. It covers claimants in receipt of a number of
different types of benefit.</div>
<a name="09022464000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">So these
regulation-making powers go to the heart of what is required of
claimants. They, for example, prescribe the time and amount of
work-related activity that a person is required to undertake, the
circumstances in which a person is or is not to be regarded as
undertaking such activity, and the imposition of a sanction where a
person has failed to comply with requirements. Those are important
matters, and they stand out from among the other regulation-making
powers as ones where it is appropriate to at least consider whether the
affirmative resolution procedure should be used, rather than the
negative one.</div>
<a name="09022464000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 8
relates to regulation-making powers to reduce benefit where sanctions
are imposed on a claimant who has failed to comply with requirements on
work-related activity. We regard reductions in benefit and the length
of time for which it is to be reduced as important 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>matters. We note that, in this context, the Gregg report&#151;the
Committee will be familiar with Professor Gregg, who gave evidence to
us in our sitting two weeks ago&#151;said of the sanctions that are
currently in
place:</div><a name="09022464000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst
the current regime is broadly effective and certainly increases
compliance with labour market conditions, there is also widespread
acknowledgment that it is complex and difficult to understand. The
process is also, in some circumstances, time-consuming and costly to
operate. This means that the system is not as clear and crisp as it
could be, which reflects the piecemeal development of conditionality
across different benefits based on different legislation, different
regulations and different case
law.&#148;</div><a name="09022464000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government, in their December White Paper, admitted that there were
shortcomings in some respects in the way sanctions were
working&#151;although we know that the Government are seeking,
through the Bill, to move benefits together, which will reduce the
number of benefits to some extent. In the light of those criticisms and
considerations, it is important to have a debate about this.</div>
<a name="09022464000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">In their
White Paper, the Government suggested that the initial sanction for
non-compliance for jobseekers should be one week&#146;s loss of
jobseeker&#146;s allowance. We wonder whether the Government have the
same amount in mind in the case of non-compliance for work-related
activity.</div>
<a name="09022464000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 22
relates to schedule 1, which makes various amendments to the Jobseekers
Act 1995. The delegated powers memorandum states that it contains
amendments to the Act, which would provide a framework under which some
people are not required to meet some of the conditions</div>
<a name="09022464000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but...are
expected to prepare for work in the future.&#148;</div>
<a name="09022464000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">It contains detailed
provisions related to conditionality, dealing with requirements to
attend work-focused interviews; powers to direct claimants to undertake
activities relating to finding employments, becoming employable, and
remaining employed; action plans, requirements to undertake
work-related activity and application of sanctions. These are very
important matters. They may apply, in some cases, to lone parents with
younger children; we think it is right to raise the issue once again in
this context, at the level of parliamentary scrutiny which is
appropriate to them.</div>
<a name="09022464000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 15
relates to clause 7, which gives the Secretary of State the power to
abolish income support. This is obviously a very sweeping
regulation&#151;a very big step. We apprehend that this is the
direction in which the Government wish to travel. We understand that
that will be done once the Secretary of State is satisfied that it is
no longer necessary to prescribe income support to groups of people
because they are catered for elsewhere in the benefits system. As I
indicated a moment ago, the Government are trying to move benefits
together, which was recommended in various reports into this subject.
By saying that this is a big step, I support the proposition. It is
perhaps appropriate to consider whether this should be subject to the
affirmative procedure as well, given that it is a step of great
magnitude in social security policy. At the moment it appears that it
is subject to the negative procedure. We wonder whether there is not a
case for asking whether this step should be subject to the affirmative
procedure when it comes to be
taken.</div><a name="09022464000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
in the same vein, we come to clause 19 and benefit sanctions following
a first offence of benefit fraud. This is a different subject&#151;up
to now we have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>been talking about jobseeker&#146;s allowance, &#147;work for your
benefit&#148; and work-related activity for claimants&#151;this
concerns benefit offenders who have committed benefit fraud. We will
come to this clause in due course&#151;no doubt we will have a wider
debate on it&#151;but it is the same point about the type of
parliamentary scrutiny that is appropriate. Under clause 19(6) to (10),
which deal with the amounts by which benefits will be reduced, we once
again wonder whether this is an appropriate case for the affirmative
procedure. That is the common thread that runs through this: a concern
for proper parliamentary scrutiny. We think it is entirely appropriate
to ask about that in these circumstances and to raise the issue. We
look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09022464000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000330"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> To echo what the hon. Gentleman said, it is
entirely appropriate to table such amendments and there is a consequent
and ongoing tension between primary and secondary legislation. As I
have tried to indicate, this is&#151;not quite uniquely, because
immigration is the same&#151;a whole area of UK law where there is an
entire regulatory framework alongside the primary legislative framework
That is the way that both immigration and benefits law have worked for
some time.</div>
<a name="09022464000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also accept
that there is a desire to scrutinise aspects of policy surrounding the
Bill. For reasons that I shall come to, I do not accept that this is a
necessarily proportionate way of doing it. There is a balance to be
struck; there are existing safeguards to ensure that the regulations
receive proper scrutiny. For example, we work closely with the Social
Security Advisory Committee on regulation. We have shown with the
employment and support allowance regulations that we are willing to go
beyond what is required of a Department by law and engage
constructively with the Committee. We will also study with great care
the memo from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and
will respond
appropriately.</div><a name="09022464000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I may, I shall briefly discuss each element in turn. As the hon.
Gentleman suggests, Amendment 4 relates to the hardship payments under
the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; regime. I can assure hon.
Members that we intend to apply pretty much the same hardship regime
that is already operating for JSA. It is more an updating of the
regulations than the introduction of anything substantially new. In
that context, I think it appropriate that it is negative&#151;the
Committee will know that negative resolutions are laid and, under the
negative process, hon. Members can pray against them and they can
eventually get their day in court, for want of a better phrase.
Negative does not mean that there is no recourse to a degree of
scrutiny.</div><a name="09022464000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman suggests, amendment 7 relates to clause 2 and how
those moving from income support to JSA are treated. Again, we propose
to introduce regulations that are similar to existing ones that relate
to work-focused interviews, action plans and jobseeker&#146;s
agreements, including relevant good cause provisions. They are
therefore appropriately carried out under the negative
resolution.</div><a name="09022464000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
15 is strange given that it relates to the abolition of income support.
The key safeguard here, as the hon. Gentleman said, is that the
Secretary of State must be satisfied that there are no groups who still
need it before the benefit is abolished. By the time the negative
resolution is laid, everyone will be clear that there is no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>need for income support any more, so it should be abolished. Why that
should not be done under a negative rather than a positive procedure
escapes me; we would only lay that negative resolution when the time is
right for that particular benefit to be
abolished.</div>
<a name="09022464000283"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div>
<a name="09022464000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have found
an amendment where the hon. Gentleman was in error: amendment 19 is
unnecessary&#151;I can confirm that the affirmative procedure will
already apply. The regulation-making powers are intended to be the same
as those existing in the two strikes legislation in the Social Security
Fraud Act 2001, because this is inserted in that legislation&#151;but
it will be the affirmative rather than the
negative.</div><a name="09022464000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will be aware that in both the delegated powers memorandum
and the document to which I referred&#151;which is now, I hope,
available&#151;there are copious notes and tables about where
regulation powers are taken and whether they are to be pursued under
negative or positive procedures.</div>
<a name="09022464000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 8
and 22 refer to the establishment of the progression to work
group&#151;in particular, those who have moved from
jobseeker&#146;s allowance to income support. I appreciate that the
powers seem wide-ranging, but we either build on the existing JSA
regulations or mirror the types of conditionality that will be applied
in income support before people migrate to JSA. I accept the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point that notwithstanding that it builds on
existing conditionality, we are still developing what we want to take
forward as the Gregg model&#151;for want of a better
phrase.</div>
<a name="09022464000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I am
not accepting the amendments&#151;God forbid; I do not do that sort
of thing&#151;I think that the hon. Gentleman does, potentially, have
a point. As we develop the model of conditionality during the Bill,
amendments 8 and 22 may be ones that we should return to given the
import and the substance of those regulations, and the significant
shift that they will make. In that spirit, I still ask him to take the
lot of them away, but with amendments 8 and 22 the hon. Gentleman does
have half a point, at least. I need to reflect on whether it is more
than half a point.</div>

and his implicit acceptance that we are subjecting this aspect to
proper parliamentary scrutiny. I have, at least, got half a

credited with after much longer consideration of other Bills.</div>
<a name="09022464000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will accept that at the outset we were trying to select some of the
things which we thought were most important for affirmative resolution
debate. I want to say very gently, without wishing to dislodge any good
spirit, that the right hon. Gentleman referred to the Secretary of
State making a decision, but it is not always the case that we agree
with what the Secretary of State decides; we hope we do in this case.
In the light of the Minister&#146;s comments, I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000332"></a>Meg

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000334"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> The amendments are very simple. They seek to explore
how the proposals may impact on disabled people. We know that these
people, generally, are one of the groups most excluded from the work
force. Only 49 per cent. of disabled people and only 17 per
cent. of people with learning disabilities are in work. That suggests
that the failure is largely that of the workplace and not of disabled
people.</div>
<a name="09022464000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to ensure careful consideration of the impact of the
proposals on disabled people. I am grateful to Mencap for its briefing
on this matter. There is a concern that such measures may be introduced
as a consequence of factors outside the control of individual disabled
people, such as failure by the flexible new deal provider, or the
unwillingness of employers to take on, and acknowledge that there are
problems in relation to, those people. The DWP&#146;s impact
assessment on this proposal
stated:</div><a name="09022464000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
policy proposal is expected to have a greater impact on people with a
disability as they are more likely to reach the end of Flexible New
Deal without having moved into
employment.&#148;</div><a name="09022464000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am seeking reassurances in relation to this whole area that this issue
will be properly monitored, that providers will have to provide
information about people with specific disabilities, whether learning
or physical, and that these issues will be properly looked at by the
relevant Minister so that the impact of these important changes on the
way we deal with these issues is properly examined, on the basis that
people with disabilities face particular barriers.</div>
<a name="09022464000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">To sum up, I
am essentially seeking to ensure that it is possible to identify what
is happening to disabled people as a result of the changes, and to
ensure that their specific needs are recognised in the
future.</div><a name="09022464000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022464000335"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood.</div>
<a name="09022464000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
share the sentiments that inspired the amendment, I have a concern
about it. I, too, looked at the excellent briefing note from Mencap,
which covers the use of providers and relates to some of the evidence
that we heard from Ministers. We have spoken about the black box
concept&#151;the concept of letting providers go off and deliver what
they are supposed to do to get people into work. The concern is that if
one says that those providers have to provide a detailed raft of
information to the Department, which inevitably means that the
Department is going to take action as a result 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>of that information, one is in danger, if one is not careful, of
effectively having the Department micro-manage what the providers are
doing. I am not sure whether that is the right solution.</div>
<a name="09022464000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
the hon. Lady has drawn attention to a genuine concern. The way to
tackle that, when one is getting providers to get people into work, is
to look at the needs of individuals and the fee that the providers
receive. If providers are paid a flat fee, there is exactly the danger
that she suggests: those who require more help and support to get into
work may well be neglected. If, however, the fee reflects the amount of
work that will be needed to get someone into work, it ensures that
those people who have a greater requirement for help and support will
get it. That would be a better solution than the amendments that the
hon. Lady is proposing. However, like her, I will listen with great
interest to what the Minister has to say, to see whether he will
reflect on the point that I have made. If he will not, her proposals
may actually have some
merit.</div><a name="09022464000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000336"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Jonathan
Shaw):</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Hood. We look forward to your guidance during our
proceedings.</div>
<a name="09022464000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley.
She raised the same point during the oral evidence hearings, and we had
some brief discussions on the issue. I also welcome the comments by the
hon. Member for Forest of Dean. What we are hoping to achieve&#151;I
am sure that there is agreement across the House on this&#151;is to
provide help to those who are furthest from the labour market. In
particular, people with learning difficulties have stubbornly remained
furthest from the labour market for far too long. My hon. Friend and
the hon. Gentleman, along with many of us, will have seen excellent
examples of innovative programmes that have provided real jobs for
people with learning difficulties. One of those&#151;I am sure that
she is aware of it&#151;is Project Search, which we are piloting at
Norfolk and Norwich hospital and Leicester city council. It is an
exemplary project, providing good training, job coaches and assistance
to those people&#151;people who seemingly could not find work but
have found work.</div>
<a name="09022464000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to address the point that the hon. Member for Forest of Dean raised
about this black box. We do not want to be so specific that we dictate
the parameters within which providers assist people with learning
disabilities to find employment. To date, that has not worked. We are
not in the position to be able to say that what we have done so far,
universally, has worked for people with learning disabilities. We can
certainly point to some good examples and, as is often the case with
public policy, where we see good things working we just want that to be
spread across the board, but delivering that is always the frustration
for policy makers, whether nationally or locally.</div>
<a name="09022464000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
the people that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley
referred to&#151;the risk assessment of people with learning
disabilities, or people with disabilities&#151;it is likely to be
those people who come to the end of the flexible new deal and have not
found employment. She is right to highlight that, and I can give her
some assurances with regards to what we intend to do at that
point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div><a name="09022464000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend that
the Jobcentre Plus personal adviser will review, in partnership with
providers, every case in which someone reaches the end of the flexible
new deal without finding sustained work, Mr. Hood. This is
to ensure we have a clear idea of the barriers and circumstances that
an individual faces&#151;you will hear that word repeatedly
throughout our proceedings because it is about tailoring our support
and resources to individuals&#151;and will act as a safeguard to
ensure that only those who are capable of working will be referred to
this programme.</div>
<a name="09022464000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
acknowledge that some jobseekers have particular circumstances that we
need to consider as we design the programme and the way it operates.
That is why we intend that the &#147;work for your benefit&#148;
programme will offer personalised and tailored support. We will
incorporate appropriate safeguards to ensure that the work experience
offered is suitable and relevant to an individual&#146;s
circumstances, in the way that the hon. Member for Hertsmere suggested
earlier. People with disabilities who have restrictions within their
jobseeker&#146;s agreement relating to the days and hours they must
be available to work, will also be able to apply those restrictions to
participation in the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; programme.
Similarly, any restrictions in jobseeker&#146;s agreement on the type
of work a person is available for will also apply. It is not our
intention that people will be required to participate in activities
that are unsuitable and inappropriate to their personal
circumstances.</div>
<a name="09022464000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect our
suppliers to be exemplary in meeting their duties under the Disability
Discrimination Act 2005, including the disability equality
duty. This aims to ensure that all bodies actively promote equality for
disabled people when providing a service on behalf of the Secretary of
State. The contract for the &#147;work for your benefit&#148;
programme will require suppliers to support the Secretary of State in
his duty to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. The
DWP&#146;s contract management arrangements will monitor delivery in
that regard, and customers will have the opportunity to discuss any
problems with their jobseeker advisers. As my hon. Friend is aware, we
will be piloting those. It is important that we monitor the
effectiveness of this, but as my right hon. Friend the Minister for
Employment and Welfare Reform said, we do not want any undue
specificity. Is that correct?</div>
<a name="09022464000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000337"></a>Mr.

there would be an inevitable discussion about who is on it and who is
not. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley will be aware of
that from her time as a Minister. We want the flexibility that the hon.
Member for Forest of Dean referred to, so that we can see a step change
in the pool of talent among people with learning disabilities. We have
seen such people providing excellent work and being assets to the
organisations they work
for.</div><a name="09022464000284"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000339"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments
so far, but he has not addressed the issue I raised on differential
fees for the rewards paid to providers. I know that the Department is
thinking about that idea and will pilot it. My concern is that if
providers are paid a flat fee for every person they try to get into
work, so that the fee structure does not reflect the amount of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>help and support required, there is a danger that certain categories of
people will be neglected, as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley
suggested. It might be too late if they have to wait until they fail to
get a new job under the flexible new deal. Will the Minister say a
little on the Department&#146;s plans for differential
fees?</div><a name="09022464000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000340"></a>Jonathan
Shaw:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for picking up
on that important point. There has been concern over cherry-picking,
not just under this provision, but under our supported employment
programme. We do not want to see cherry-picking. Under this programme,
we will develop a payment and contracts model to minimise that risk. We
are also exploring the new personalised employment programme and the
new accelerator funding model. This is another example of where we are
running pilots so that we get things right. I am sure he will agree
that we must balance value for money with the personalised, tailored
programmes that will provide success for the individual in gaining
employment.</div><a name="09022464000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
those remarks and my assurances to my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Heeley and the Committee, I hope that she will feel able to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022464000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000341"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> The last thing I want to see is micro-management;
that is not the right way forward. I wanted reassurance that there will
be proper monitoring and evaluation; without that, I fear that we will

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000342"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b><b class="B"> </b>This is the appropriate moment to raise
one matter with the Minister. As was the case with the proposals that
we brought out before this programme, it is important to bear in mind
that the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; scheme will not kick in
initially with a jobseeker&#146;s claim, but only after a
jobseeker&#146;s claim has been extant for a considerable period. As
I understand the Government proposal, it must be at least two years
from the beginning of the jobseeker&#146;s claim and after a year of
job search followed by a year on the flexible new
deal.</div><a name="09022464000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commencement of the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; programme is
tied to the beginning of the flexible new deal. We understand from the
December 2008 White Paper that the programme is due to be piloted from
2010. It
states:</div><a name="09022464000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
pilots will start in 2010, in line with the first people completing 12
months on Flexible New
Deal.&#148;</div><a name="09022464000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Committee members may recollect, the flexible new deal is not expected
to commence until 1 October 2009. As we speak, the end stage of the
tendering process is subject to delays. What is the implication of this
for the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; scheme? Is the
&#147;work for your benefit&#148; scheme still tied to the flexible
new deal? Is it therefore likely to be affected by the circumstances
that are apparently causing some turbulence in the flexible new deal
tendering process?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000343"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> Briefly, the answer to the perfectly fair
question is probably yes and no. Yes, in the sense that of course it is
inextricably linked with the flexible new deal. And, notwithstanding
periods of reflection and turbulence, there is no proposal to do
anything other than bring in the flexible new deal by October 2009. The
two are inextricably linked. For reference, and no more, we have asked
the healthy list of providers who bid for the flexible new deal to
revisit some of their assumptions. The original assumption was for a
cohort of 100,000 long-term unemployed. We have now asked them to look
at a range from 100,000 to 300,000. So it is a live contract process
which, unlike this legislation, is very much connected with the
economic downturn. Yes, the two are linked but no, at this stage there
are no plans other than to pursue the start date for the flexible new
deal of 1 October. In that context I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="09022464000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000347"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> Clause 2 deals with the work-related activity
which may be required of certain benefit claimants, including benefit
claimants on income support, income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance
or income-related employment and support allowance. Although it is not
specifically mentioned in the Bill, the clause appears to affect lone
parents of younger children who are currently in receipt of income
support. This is the relevant point to ventilate some important
considerations for lone parents of younger children.</div>
<a name="09022464000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 39
deals with the age that the youngest child must have reached before
lone parents are required to take part in the work-related activity
regime envisaged in these proposals. It would set that age at five.
Amendment 44, which has been tabled by the Liberal
Democrats, sets it at seven. The background to this is quite important.
Until last year it was possible for a single parent to remain on income
support until the youngest child reached the age of 16. However, in
June 2007 the Government announced that they were moving lone parents
from income support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance in
stages.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div><a name="09022464000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process
began last year, when the age limit for single parents to remain on
income support was reduced to the youngest child reaching the age of
12. As we speak, the process of transferring lone parents from income
support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance is proceeding in jobcentres up
and down the country. The age at which lone parents are transferred
from income support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance will fall to seven
in October 2010. That leaves open the question of what is
expected of lone parents with children under seven. Of course, they
will not be expected to move from income support to jobseeker&#146;s
allowance, as is the case with lone parents of children over the age of
seven, but under the Government&#146;s plans they will be expected to
fulfil the requirements set out in the clause, some of which we have
already touched on when debating other amendments.</div>
<a name="09022464000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
understanding of the Government&#146;s proposals as a whole is that
they see lone parents as part of a progression to work group from the
time their youngest child is aged one. The Government have set out how
they see that group in their discussion paper on the implementation of
the Gregg review. According to their response to that review, lone
parents with children aged between one and two years will
be</div><a name="09022464000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Required
to attend Work Focused interviews and agree an action plan. They are
not mandated to undertake any activities recorded on the action
plan&#148;.</div><a name="09022464000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the important point is that when the youngest child reaches the age of
three, lone parents will
be</div><a name="09022464000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Required
to follow the full progression to Work regime based around Work Focused
interviews, action plans, work related activity and the backstop of
adviser
direction.&#148;</div><a name="09022464000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
presumably means that lone parents with children aged three or over
will be subject to the regime of sanctions for failing to comply with
the requirements, as is set out in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09022464000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 39
would substitute the age of three with the age of five as the point at
which the regime and all its requirements would begin. The age of five
was specified in the Government&#146;s July 2008 Green Paper as the
appropriate age at which requirements could begin to be made on lone
parents. The Green Paper envisaged piloting a requirement for lone
parents whose youngest child is five or six to attend relevant skills
training where that would address the skills gaps identified as a
barrier to starting work. Subsequently, the Gregg review suggested that
lone parents with a youngest child between the age of one and seven
should be in the progression to work group, as I have indicated, as
part of the Gregg vision of personalised conditionality, although I do
not believe that Professor Gregg specified the age of three as the age
at which that move to the regime would occur, as the Government are now
setting
out.</div><a name="09022464000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
progression to work group is intended to prepare people for full
availability for work, and in this case we are talking about preparing
single parents for entry to the jobseeker&#146;s regime when their
youngest child reaches the age of seven. Commencing the work-related
activity for them at the age of five, as suggested in amendment 39,
would give them two years in which to undertake work-related activity
to prepare them for work, and something along those lines seems to have
been present in the Government&#146;s thinking in the July 2008 Green
Paper.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div><a name="09022464000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question I
wish to put to the Minister is this: why is the two years of
work-related activity in that regime from the time the youngest child
reaches the age of five insufficient to prepare lone parents for
work?</div><a name="09022464000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022464000348"></a><b class="B">Mr.
James Plaskitt</b> (Warwick and Leamington) (Lab): In view of
what the hon. Gentleman is saying, can he tell us what has happened to
the recommendation of his own party&#146;s social justice policy
group, chaired by the former leader of his party,
that:</div><a name="09022464000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst
their youngest child is below the age of 5 they should spend between 5
and 10 hours a week preparing for
work&#148;?</div><a name="09022464000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000349"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
studying that document, because it has proved to be the inspiration
behind much of what we are debating today. It created the momentum of
the debate because we had 11 years in which there was no movement at
all and the age remained 16. To answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question directly, he will see that the age of five was specifically
mentioned in that report as the age of the youngest child at which
parents should be moved across, and of course that document did not
have in mind the full regime that we are now talking about. The
Under-Secretary of State looks perplexed about that, but when that
document was written the social justice policy group did not have in
mind and could not know the full regime proposed by the Government. We
have no issue with the regime as a generality, but in the case of
parents of younger children we think that there is an issue to discuss
in cases where parents will be subject to the regime and to sanctions
for failing to comply. I think that the hon. Gentleman will have to
accept that there are issues to be debated and that it is right for us
to debate the age at which that move takes place. He has not answered
the question of why two years is insufficient
time.</div><a name="09022464000285"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000350"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Kitty
Ussher):</b> The hon. Gentleman said that I looked perplexed.
I was perplexed because I did not understand whether he shared the view
of his own policy commission&#151;and, indeed, our view&#151;that
there should be work-focused activity when the child is under, not at,
the age of five. I would be grateful for his
response.</div><a name="09022464000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000351"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I think that I responded to that in my answer
to the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington. We are talking about the
regime, not some general work-focused activity. We have no problem with
interviews. However, this is a very specific regime in which action
plans have to be agreed, directions are given and sanctions may follow
for non-compliance from when the child is aged three, as the hon. Lady
knows from her study of both the documents and the Government&#146;s
response to the Gregg
report.</div><a name="09022464000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hoped that the hon. Lady would answer the question of why two years was
insufficient time for lone parents to prepare for work. We are willing
to listen to the debate. Two years is a long time for somebody to
prepare for work. We are talking about somebody whose lack of
availability for work is caused, in the first instance, by the fact
that they are caring for a child. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>They are not in the same position as somebody in receipt of employment
and support allowance, who may need to spend time managing a condition
that they have. Here the inhibition is the care of a child; that is
what prevents the parent from going into the labour market. Five is a
reasonable age in such circumstances, as it leaves two years for a
parent to prepare for work, and the child will have started school. It
is reasonable to ventilate the issue, and we look forward to hearing
why two years is not sufficient time for a parent to be under the
regime envisaged in the
proposals.</div><a name="09022464000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000352"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I wish to continue to press the hon. Gentleman
on that point. As I said before, his own social justice policy group
says that a lone parent should spend between five and 10 hours a week
preparing for work if their child is under five. What activity did the
group envisage during those five to 10
hours?</div><a name="09022464000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000353"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I think that I have answered the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question. I am waiting for an answer from him as to
why two years is not sufficient. I shall make a deal with him. I am
interested to hear his
answer&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I have given the
hon. Gentleman our

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000354"></a>The

calm.</div><a name="09022464000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000355"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> The hon. Gentleman has had his answer. The
commission for social justice could not have known about this specific
regime, under which lone parents will be subject to sanctions. I think
that the hon. Gentleman will, on reflection, feel that it is reasonable
to ventilate the issue. I return to my question: why is two years not
sufficient? If he cannot answer, I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09022464000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000356"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I assume that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
commission would argue that two years was not sufficient, otherwise why
would it recommend that the job preparation activity should commence
while the child was under five? I return to my earlier question about
the five to 10 hours, which he has still not answered. Does
his commission envisage lone parents undergoing a 10-hour
interview?</div><a name="09022464000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000357"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I think that we are going round in circles. The
question is whether two years is sufficient time to prepare under a
regime that is subject to sanctions. If the hon. Gentleman cannot
answer, I look forward to an answer from the
Minister.</div><a name="09022464000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000358"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> We have started an important debate about
conditionality within a new system of work-related activity. As has
been said, we have already seen a change of Government policy, in that
a lone parent will now have to engage in work-related activity when
their child reaches the lower age of 12. That policy has been operating
for only a short time and it is still bedding in, but we now have a
Government proposal to lower the age to three. Taking on board the fact
that the change is new, we believe that support for lone parents
getting back into work is not fully in place, and that must be
addressed. Indeed, we have heard of examples of people who have been
given, in our view, quite inappropriate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>advice about what they can and cannot do in terms of getting back to
work. There are still barriers to work for lone parents&#151;child
care, transport and facilities barriers. For example, there is only one
child care place for every 200 children over 11, yet the Government are
already moving the provision from the age of 12 to three, and the way
in which to deal with a parent with older children has not been
addressed. Serious issues must be addressed before the change can be
made.</div>
<a name="09022464000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We suggest in
amendment 44 that the child should be seven rather than five before
conditionality beds in, and we would like a phased movement rather than
the Government&#146;s complete change because that would give the
parent time to organise and prepare themselves for work as the child
starts school. We need some answers about this aspect, which deals with
young children and lone parents. In particular, I should like from the
Minister a commitment&#151;the Child Poverty Action Group has asked
for it, too&#151;that parents will be protected from any financial
sanctions that worsen the severity of child poverty, and that any
non-financial sanctions that might be imposed as a result of the regime
will not create additional expenditure for the parent. If parents are
required to attend a particular locality for a certain number of hours,
will the costs of travel and child care be paid
for?</div><a name="09022464000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also want assurances that decisions on child care will rest fully and
firmly with the parent and that under no circumstances will a direction
be given to them that they have to take a particular form of child
care. We want an assurance that lone parents and partners in
education&#151;I had a case relating to this a couple of weeks
ago&#151;will not be required to cease their education, which in turn
will be recognised as a work-related activity. The case I had involved
a single parent who was looking after two young children and had gone
to university. He received a student loan, but that was classed as
income and affected his entitlement to housing benefit, so he had to
drop out of the course because he could not afford to pay his rent and
university fees. Such real issues affect lone parents, and if we are
going to apply stricter conditionality at a much lower age, we need to
address the availability of child care, for example. It would be
interesting to hear what steps the Minister is taking to ensure that
child care for older children will be improved under the current
regime. It appears that the Government are moving far too quickly, and
that they do not have the support in place to enable this group to get
back into work, which is, I am sure, what we all
want.</div>
<a name="09022464000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000359"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> We have already touched on some of these topics,
including during our discussion of the first set of amendments. It is
important to start by saying that no one has a monopoly on concern for
child poverty, as the hon. Member for Rochdale implies. Everyone can
quote the Child Poverty Action Group. The surest way to help children
out of poverty is to support more parents into paid work that enables
parents to manage the careful balance between employment and family
life&#151;that must be absolutely right. The hon. Member for
Hertsmere will know that Professor Gregg suggested conditionality from
the age of
one.</div><a name="09022464000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Rochdale is confused, in part, when he suggests that
there is a time dimension to being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>prepared for work. We have had what I consider to be a rather facile
debate about two years versus one year versus three years versus four
years. Let us be clear that work-related activity is about the health
and well-being&#151;intellectually, morally, spiritually and every
other way&#151;of the individual while there are barriers, including
the delight of childbirth, to getting back into work. That is the
centre of what Gregg was saying, and to describe it as a mechanistic
process in which one can turn a tap on and off and say that six months
will do, as though it were an elongated version of a makeover or
make-up session, is nonsense. This is about not preening someone to get
back into the labour market, but providing all that we can for an end
goal that all the child poverty lobby agrees is desirable: to get
people who want to do so back into
work.</div><a name="09022464000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman again draws a picture of doom and gloom&#151;Rochdale
doom and gloom not Hertsmere&#146;s; Hertsmere is
happier&#151;about the notion of conditionality as though it were
oppressive, suppressive and driving down on lone parents for some
malign intent, as yet not fully defined, but nothing could be further
from the case. It is about trying to help and support people get back
into work at the earliest opportunity. The hon. Gentleman&#151;for
Hertsmere this time, not Rochdale&#151;is seriously suggesting that
we need to leave people alone and not trouble them until their children
are five, and then between five and seven we should have a magical
process to get them back to work-readiness and back into work. That is,
at one level, utterly neglectful. We need to start working with lone
parents at the earliest opportunity&#151;with them, I
emphasise&#151;with all that that entails on removing barriers, to
get them ready for, and ultimately involved in, work-related activity,
and then to get them back into the labour market. Again, quite
deliberately, work-related activity is drawn at its widest. We cannot
have a Bill that purports to offer as much personalised and flexible
support as possible and then get lost in an anally retentive fixation
on lists that define what that flexibility is&#151;by definition that
is an oxymoron.</div>
<a name="09022464000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why the age
of three? Notwithstanding the point made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Warwick and Leamington, three is increasingly&#151;it is not yet
100 per cent. there throughout England and Wales&#151;the age at
which the state provides full-time child care. The duty on local
councils is newish, and the absence of such provision will be taken
fully into account when discussing the details of an
individual&#146;s work-related activity at
three.</div><a name="09022464000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Saying
that the two years do not matter either way, and that five is a lot
better, is at least a more measured approach from the hon. Member for
Hertsmere. The Leader of the Opposition, as is his perennial wont,
dismissed these plans as sick and shameful in his rush to jump on the
nearest bandwagon&#151;he is more fixated with bandwagons than the
Liberal Democrats used to be, which is a shame. It would be interesting
to be a fly on the wall when he welcomes his soon-to-be-ennobled Front
Bencher in the Lords, David Freud, who thinks we are being timid. He
would like us to go much further than even we are suggesting, although
I do not know whether that was a Freudian slip. It is rather a shame
that there is a notion that this is territory in which we should play
rather futile politics. There can and should be as wide a consensus as
possible.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div><a name="09022464000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="09022464000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
age of seven is a nonsense, although I would entertain five a little
more, notwithstanding the point about Scotland. Starting to talk to
individual lone parents about their journey back into work by time the
child is seven should, in the interests of those parents, happen at the
earliest opportunity. The closer the child gets to seven and the lone
parent to that stage of obligation, I would envisage a slightly
stronger focus on the work element of the work-related activities
rather than the broader skills and training element.</div>
<a name="09022464000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are, I hope, probing rather than otherwise&#151;certainly
that tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. We take it as read that
the hon. Member for Rochdale could not care less about the Bill or the
policy framework that we are seeking to adopt. However, I fear if he
continues for too much longer, the implication of his comments will be
that he could not care less about the people about whom we are talking,
and that would be a dangerous road to go down. I ask for the amendment
to be withdrawn.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000360"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I shall study the Minister&#146;s words
carefully because the subject is important. We think that it is
reasonable to have a debate about the age at which such requirements
are placed on lone parents. We have no problem with the general vision
of getting people back to work and of conditionality in appropriate
circumstances. The Minister mentioned going further, and we will not be
slow to come forward with ideas about how the Government can go further
than they are at present&#151;much further in some cases. He referred
to giving help to parents of children below the age of
three&#151;help with interviews and making suggestions and assistance
available. There is no problem with that
either.</div><a name="09022464000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is significant about the Government&#146;s proposals, however, is the
way in which things change at the age of three. Some of the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s remarks were fair, but he referred to a mechanistic
approach on our part. However, when I look at the Government&#146;s
proposals, I think mechanistic is rather a good word to use to describe
them. I will quote so that the Committee will know exactly the issues
at stake as we consider the
amendment</div><a name="09022464000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Age

although they will be encouraged to do so on a voluntary

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000363"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Notwithstanding the Minister&#146;s comments and
my party&#146;s general views on the Bill, the Government are seeking
to introduce major changes in legislation. We will do two things. We
will put forward alternative policies and seek to amend what the
Conservative Opposition have described as mechanistic and what we would
describe as half-baked and ill thought-out.</div>
<a name="09022464000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 58
and 59 and new clause 3 are probing amendments that deal with issues
associated with carers and the carer&#146;s allowance. Amendment 57,
which relates to clause 2, removes the requirement to engage in
workplace activity for a person who is caring for another person for 35
hours or more per week. The current lack of provision for carers does
not sit well with the research that the Department has carried out,
including the Gregg report. Some 230,000 people satisfy the criteria
for carer&#146;s allowance&#151;that is, they are caring for
someone for at least 35 hours a week and currently receive income
support or income-based JSA. We would welcome clarification that people
in that category will not be required to undertake work-focused
activity. That is consistent with what was set out in Paul
Gregg&#146;s report, and which was confirmed in the White Paper: that
people providing substantial care should be in the no-conditionality
group.</div>
<a name="09022464000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
several other related issues, such as the current inadequacy of the
carer&#146;s allowance, which is the lowest of all the income
replacement benefits at &#163;50.55 a week. The earnings limit of
&#163;95 a week prevents many carers from progressing into paid work,
and the rule banning more than 21 hours of study per week traps carers
on benefits and in low-status jobs. The allowance cannot be paid
alongside a state pension, so it leaves many older carers with no
recognition of their caring role or the assistance that they need with
the costs of caring. I am aware that the Government have promised to
overhaul the carer&#146;s benefit, but that seems to have been
completely overlooked in the Bill. That is a disappointment. The
Government are committed to ensuring by 2018 that no carer is forced
into financial hardship by virtue of their caring role, as set out in
the national carers strategy, &#147;Carers at the Heart of the
21st century: families and communities&#148;, which was
published in June last year.</div>
<a name="09022464000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Work and
Pensions Committee called in August last year for an overhaul of
carer&#146;s benefits and set out a prescription for reform that
would tackle many of the problems I have just outlined. This clause
proposes that people receiving income support, income-based JSA or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>income-based ESA will not be required to undertake work-related
activity, as specified in these regulations. I hope that the Minister
can give us that clarification, as well as saying why no opportunity
has been taken in the Bill to deal with some of the inequalities
relating to carer&#146;s allowance.</div>
<a name="09022464000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 58
amends clause 7 and, again, ensures that in exercising the powers the
Secretary of State will not require people to take part who are caring
for at least 35 hours and are receiving income support. This is a
probing amendment because we want to hear a commitment from the
Government that they will not move carers off income support until
there are clear and detailed plans setting out how the benefits system
will be reformed over the long term. There is a need for further
analysis of the ESA. The clause provides for the abolition of income
support.</div><a name="09022464000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Carers
UK welcomed the commitment in the White Paper, &#147;Raising
expectations and increasing support&#148;, that carers receiving
income support will not be moved off it until there is a clear and
detailed plan setting out the long-term reform of the benefits system.
The proposal in the Green Paper, &#147;No one written off&#148;, to
move them to a modified version of jobseeker&#146;s allowance caused
distress and anger among carers, who saw it as insulting to receive a
benefit that implied that they were not working already. Carers UK
would welcome a reiteration of the Government&#146;s commitment. When
will we get further details of the clear and detailed
plan?</div><a name="09022464000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
59 would add the instruction &#147;including any caring
responsibilities&#148;. Again, we want a commitment from the
Government that the changes in the Bill will not affect the commitments
that have been made to this very vulnerable group until we have the
long-term changes. That is also the purpose of new clause 3, which
includes a requirement on the Secretary of State
to</div><a name="09022464000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;undertake
a review of the benefits to which carers are entitled, reporting to
Parliament on the outcome of this review no later than six months after
the Welfare Reform Bill receives Royal
Assent.&#148;</div><a name="09022464000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want carers to be involved in that review and the findings to be
published.</div><a name="09022464000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the Government&#146;s previous commitments to carers, we believe that
the promise of a review within six months of the Bill receiving Royal
Assent will provide reassurance on the needs of carers. They undergo
discrimination at the moment and the caring duties that they carry out
are worth millions of pounds each year. Before some of the changes in
the Bill are introduced for carers, there should be a full review. I
hope for and look forward to the Minister&#146;s commitment to
reaffirming and protecting the interests of carers, particularly in
relation to the
clause.</div><a name="09022464000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000364"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> No one doubts that these are important matters.
As was said earlier, the broader notion that we should move to a
simplification of the benefits system and eventually to a single
working-age benefit is the right sentiment. However, perhaps we got
carried away in our enthusiasm for that journey when we insisted in the
Green Paper that carers would all transfer to jobseeker&#146;s
allowance. I was happy to work with the Under-Secretary of State for
Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>Member for Chatham and Aylesford, to review that aspect of the Green
Paper. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am not allowed to say
&#147;Jonathan&#148;.</div><a name="09022464000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the reasons suggested by many carers&#146; organisations, we have set
aside the notion that all carers should be transferred from IS to ESA.
One reason for that was that doing so would have suggested to carers
that they do not already have a job. In many instances, caring for
their family is very much a full-time job. We were very clear in the
White Paper&#151;much read out by the hon. Member for
Rochdale&#151;at least in spirit, that we would not be migrating, for
want of a better phrase, carers on IS to
JSA.</div>
<a name="09022464000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09022464000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
what are we left with? We are left with the hon. Gentleman asking me to
confirm the content of the White Paper, which, of course, I am very
happy to do. We made very clear in the White Paper, and in our response
to Professor Gregg, that we accepted his suggestion that anybody
involved in full-time caring, above the 35 hours that the
hon. Gentleman suggests in his amendments, should not be subject to
conditionality at all. That is the import of both amendments 57 and 58,
and given that we have said that as recently as in the White Paper, I
can confirm that full-time carers will not be subject to
conditionality. I hope that deals with amendments 57, 58 and
59.</div>
<a name="09022464000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3,
which calls for a review of carers&#146; benefits, is, again, what
was spelled out in the White Paper. I listened very carefully to the
hon. Gentleman, and he said almost word for word what I am implored by
officials to read out:</div>
<a name="09022464000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As a
result we have amended our
proposal&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09022464000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
in the Green
Paper&#151;</div><a name="09022464000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
will not move carers from Income Support until we
have&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09022464000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
I think these were the exact words the hon. Gentleman used
&#151;</div><a name="09022464000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
clear and detailed plan setting out how we will reform the benefits
system over the longer
term.&#148;</div><a name="09022464000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
commitment is, and remains, absolute. We are very mindful of the
contribution carers make in this country&#151;that is beyond doubt
across all parties.</div>
<a name="09022464000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much of what
the hon. Gentleman suggests about extra areas that need looking at will
be encompassed in that study. We may need to take a range of decisions
as this work progresses, including moving people to different benefits
under transitional arrangements. Many carers, however&#151;as I am
sure the hon. Gentleman knows&#151;want to work; some already receive
jobseeker&#146;s allowance with the carer premium. But the Government
do appreciate that caring responsibilities often make it difficult or
impossible for carers to consider taking up paid employment, and we
have no intention of requiring carers to seek employment or of reducing
the level of benefit income they
receive.</div><a name="09022464000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman also implied, last year we published &#147;Carers
at the heart of 21st century families and communities&#148;. This
followed the major review of our national strategy for carers, which
was an enormous consultation exercise. He will know that the income
taskforce, which was set up to examine the financial support available
to carers, focused particularly on carers&#146; benefits. Many of the
other points that he made&#151;perfectly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>valid ones&#151;regarding some of the criteria for benefits will be
the focus of that taskforce, including the interface with that
study.</div>
<a name="09022464000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Everyone
agrees that benefits for carers should be reformed over the long term.
We know also that, working with colleagues in the Department of Health,
we need to be far more integrated in our broader approach to carers
across government. We accordingly made a commitment to look at the full
picture not just in the context of longer term plans for welfare
reform, rather than piecemeal changes, but in the broader context of
what, from the social care side, we are doing with carers from the
health perspective.</div>
<a name="09022464000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
new standing committee on carers, which is overseeing the delivery of
the overall carers&#146; strategy. Much of what we determine in the
wider reform of carers&#146; benefits will feed into that process. I
can therefore absolutely assure the hon. Gentleman that his amendments
on 35 hours and full-time carers and on the migration of carers from IS
to jobseeker&#146;s allowance, and the broader points that he makes
in new clause 3, are covered in the White Paper. I say in the gentlest
of terms that, given what I have said, his amendments and the new
clause are not required. While I accept the spirit in which he made his
case, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09022464000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000365"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those comments.
In our view, it was important that those commitments be read into the
record. Given that we have got those, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000366"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I beg to move amendment 6, in
clause 2, page 5, line 12, leave
out paragraph
(e).</div><a name="09022464000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000367"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 14, in
clause 3, page 10, line 24, leave
out subsections (2) and
(3).</div><a name="09022464000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000368"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> Amendment 6 refers to a specific point in the
context of work-related activity requirements for partners: the
work-related activity requirement for partners where a claimant has
more than one partner&#151;in other words, where there is a
polygamous relationship. Polygamous relationships are recognised
elsewhere, in social security legislation and policy, but we would like
a bit more detail from the Government about what will happen in this
instance.</div>
<a name="09022464000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
2D(2)(e) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 establishes a
regulation-making power for determining, in the case of a claimant in a
polygamous marriage, which of the partners is required to undertake
work-related activity&#151;or, indeed, whether all the partners are.
The purpose of this amendment is to ascertain the principles that will
lie behind this process, since nothing is said in the notes on clauses
about the principles that will operate. On the face of it, it appears
that a number of questions have to be answered. For example, in which
cases will one, some or all of the partners be required to meet the
requirements? If only one or some of the partners are required to meet
the work-related activity requirements, how will the decision be made
as to which one, or ones? There is no clue in the Bill or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>elsewhere as to how these decisions will be made. Therefore, we think it
a proper use of parliamentary scrutiny to ask the Minister for a bit
more detail as to how this will work in practice and what principles
will be adopted to determine these
issues.</div><a name="09022464000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
14 simply deals with the same issue in a different context&#151;that
is, in respect of a joint claim for jobseeker&#146;s allowance. That
raises the question of who are to be regarded as joint claimants and
whether there is a joint claim for jobseeker&#146;s allowance. Again,
how will that be determined? Which of the partners will be part of the
claim, and which will
not?</div><a name="09022464000220"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000369"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> As the hon. Gentleman suggests, these are complex
and sensitive matters that have already been recognised for some time
in the body of social security legislation. This part of the Bill
merely seeks to reflect that which already exists in recognition of
this particular condition. I accept what he says, but we need to
explore&#151;not in the Bill but in regulation&#151;precisely how
to deal with the matters that he brings up. If the amendments are
passed, we will lose the ability to do
that.</div><a name="09022464000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
without wishing to sound like a broken record, we feel that this is
more properly done in regulation rather than in the Bill, not least for
the reasons that the hon. Gentleman suggests. Secondly, we have to do
so, since this recognition already exists in the body of social
security legislation. Thirdly, officials can and should come forward,
sooner rather than later, with the regulations and what they look like,
to explain the perfectly valid points the hon. Gentleman makes.
Although I know that my response to him is sadly lacking&#151;in a
sense, he is saying let us wait and see what the substance of the
regulations is&#151;in the spirit of a wonderful morning, I ask him
to withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="09022464000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000370"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> How can I respond to such a suggestion? I think
that the best response is to say that we will remain tantalised by how
those decisions will be made, and we hope that there will be harmony
when they are made in certain domestic circumstances, but we shall wait
and see. It seems that we shall also have to wait until we see more of
the regulations to know exactly what the principles of the measures
will be and how they will work. In order to make progress, and in the
spirit of these being probing amendments, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022464000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000371"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I beg to move amendment 46, in
clause 2, page 5, line 28, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(j) but may not
prescribe accessing of healthcare provision, taking of medication or
accessing psychological therapies as a relevant
requirement.&#146;.</div>
<a name="09022464000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
relates to the conditions that may be attached to a person in order for
them to receive work-related benefits, and the amendment would make a
clear commitment that a personal adviser may not prescribe that someone
should access a certain type of health care, medication or
psychological therapy as a requirement of receiving benefit. I
appreciate the importance of someone with a drug or alcohol problem or
a mental illness receiving support and help, and I understand that it
might be necessary for that person to deal with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>that problem or illness in order to take part in full-time work. Indeed,
I think it vital that such people be encouraged to take that route. The
evidence from the DWP&#146;s voluntary programme has shown that when
people are encouraged to go on a drug rehabilitation programme, they
make progress and move into the world of work, whereas there is no
evidence whatever that prescribing a certain form of treatment will be
successful.</div>
<a name="09022464000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
evidence sessions, we heard that nearly 250,000 people who currently
receive benefits have drug and alcohol problems. We also heard that the
health care budget would have to be increased by 50 per cent. if the
Government&#146;s target of ensuring that everyone is involved in the
programme is to be achieved, but that is not going to happen. We do not
believe that a move from encouraging people to seek treatment, as a
means of getting them back into work, to making treatment compulsory is
the right way forward. We believe that the best way forward is for the
Government to continue what they are doing with the voluntary scheme,
and to encourage and develop such programmes, which are the best way of
getting people back into the work
market.</div><a name="09022464000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09022464000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also have great concerns about who will undertake the direction. Will
it be the personal adviser? If so, what additional training will they
get? No qualifications are stipulated as being required for JCP
advisers, and there is no qualification to say that a person is
experienced at analysing, assessing and stipulating what course of
treatment people who present themselves for interview should undertake.
In our view, that kind of decision is best left to health care
professionals.</div><a name="09022464000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
the Bill runs directly contrary to the recently published NHS
constitution, which makes it clear that treatment shall not be
prescribed to a patient, yet the Government are saying that it will be
possible for a personal adviser to prescribe a course of treatment as a
condition of benefit. That is totally contrary to the NHS constitution,
and it is totally inappropriate. As I said, all the evidence is that
voluntary programmes in which people readily engage are the ones that
are likely to be
successful.</div><a name="09022464000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
psychological therapies, how will a JCP adviser be able to carry out a
proper assessment of a person who has a fluctuating mental illness?
Earlier, we discussed the problems that may come about if a fluctuating
illness means that a person is unable to attend for an interview. If
the illness is so unstable and so fluctuating, what qualifications will
the adviser have to make such
decisions?</div><a name="09022464000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is dangerous, and we do not believe that it is the right way to
go about getting people back into work. As we said earlier, we would
much prefer to see greater emphasis on developing programmes that will
get people back into work. We have real concerns about how the measure
may be interpreted, and we do not believe that this route will result
in people with a drug or alcohol problem or a mental illness getting
back to work. Much better routes could be taken, and we are
disappointed with the formulation of the
clause.</div><a name="09022464000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000372"></a>Mr.

Gentleman&#146;s enthusiasm and rush to download every hackneyed
clich(c) that he possibly could while 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>discussing his misinterpretation of our policies in clause 9
on drug misuse, he has tagged his concerns on to clause 2 and made the
speech anyway. On one level, that is fine, but the downside is that we
will have to hear it all again when we get to clause 9, which is a
matter of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000374"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I beg to move amendment 10, in clause 2, page
5, line 49, at end insert</div>
<a name="0902256000008"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;, including activity which enables
the person to improve his or her skills for
work.&#146;.</div><a name="09022464000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment concerns the definition of work-related activity, which the
Bill defines as</div>
<a name="09022464000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an activity
which makes it more likely that the person will obtain or remain in
work or be able to do
so.&#148;</div><a name="09022464000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is common ground between us on the idea that the acquisition of skills
makes it more likely that a person will obtain or remain in work, and I
apprehend that the Government&#146;s thinking is that the acquisition
of skills will play an important part in work-related activity.
However, we thought this was an opportunity to hear more about the
Government&#146;s plans and thinking, and to give them a gentle steer
in our direction. We know that the issue is dealt with in the White
Paper, and we will make common ground on it, but we would like to hear
more detail and, particularly, what provision there will be for the
assessment and reskilling of existing incapacity benefit and employment
and support allowance claimants.</div>
<a name="09022464000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000375"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> The hon. Gentleman is entirely right: the
provision will include improving and identifying skills need and taking
steps to improve such skills. We have, as I have indicated throughout
the morning, drawn the definition of work-related activity as broadly
as possible&#151;quite deliberately, because different individuals
will be at different stages on an array of different journeys on their
way back to work. I should have thought that, for all concerned,
improving and identifying skills need would be a central work-related
activity, and as I tried to imply earlier, all the more important the
closer the person got to the end of that journey back to work. The
early stages of such a process, however, may include stabilising their
housing situation; attending a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>motivation and confidence-building course&#151;much pooh-poohed by
many, but for people who are remote from the labour market, developing
such self-esteem and confidence-building skills is important; starting
to use the services of a children&#146;s centre and all that that
entails; or attending appropriate training, having discussed what was
necessary with the personal adviser. So, the provision is quite
deliberately drawn as broadly as possible.</div>
<a name="09022464000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
those&#151;when we finally get to them&#151;in the ESA work group,
rather than in the support group, there will be a range of activities
and help and support. Again, we have drawn the provision broadly so
that we can make it as personalised as possible. If that sounds vague,
it is meant to, because we really want individualised and personalised
activity and support for each individual. I know that I sound a bit
like a broken record.</div>
<a name="09022464000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the thrust of the amendment. In this case, the hon. Gentleman is
probably three-quarters right rather than half right, but for the
reasons suggested, there is no need for the amendment. We do not want
to fall down that slippery slope of undue specificity. Although I
embrace the spirit of the amendment, I ask that it be withdrawn as
otiose.</div>
<a name="09022464000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000376"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> Heaven forbid that we should be otiose, but we
make common ground on this issue by wanting a wide reach for
work-related activity, both in its forms and in the people whom it
reaches. We are concerned that the provision should have as much effect
in practice as possible and reach as many people as possible. Skills
are an important part of that, but in light of what has been said, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000379"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> Very briefly, this is a probing amendment.
Subsection (2)(e) of the proposed new section requires an action plan
to be prepared by a person, subject to requirements. It must be
prepared by the Secretary of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>State in prescribed circumstances. We simply want to know more about
what those prescribed circumstances are, and as such, this is a probing
amendment seeking more detail. We note the amendments tabled by the
hon. Member for Glasgow, East; no doubt the Minister will want to
explain how they fit into the scheme of the Bill. Amendments 84, 85 and
86 stand in the name of the hon. Member for Rochdale. If I may
introduce a new word for the Committee, we have some concern about the
&#147;automaticity&#148; of the provision that the hon. Gentleman
is recommending&#151;that there will always be a right to
reconsideration of a report. We have some concerns, but we look forward
to hearing more details from the Minister.</div>
<a name="09022464000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000380"></a>John
Mason:</b> I wish to speak to amendments 91, 92 and
93, on the question of action plans. If we are going to have action
plans there surely needs to be agreement as to what is in them. My
reading of the Bill at the moment&#151;and I seek reassurance from
the Minister&#151;is that the adviser, solely, would be able to lay
down the terms of what is in the action plans. That may not be the
intention but it is my reading of it. Elsewhere in the Bill we have
talked about a right of control and wanting people to be involved in
their own progress. It would seem that some of these measures would in
fact take away from that, and the person&#146;s real involvement and
ownership would be less.</div>
<a name="09022464000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">We obviously
need to build confidence in people&#151;going back to people with
mental health issues and so on. I wonder whether imposing such an
action plan, completely from outside, is the right way to go ahead. It
appears that both the DWP and private contractors are able to issue
mandatory directions. There is no detail in the Bill about how such an
agreement between an adviser and a claimant would be reached, and if
there is dispute over what is in these action plans, how that would be
taken forward&#151;other than when there is a sanction, there would
then be an
appeal.</div><a name="09022464000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022464000381"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> We want to look at the parts that deal with the
actual sanctions, and the sanctions that may be taken if someone who is
on income support&#151;claimants, or partners of
claimants&#151;does not undertake the prescribed activities. We are
seeking to introduce three small amendments&#151;84, 85 and 86. We
want to replace the word &#147;may&#148; with
&#147;shall&#148;. We believe it is an important safeguard. We wish
also to insert the word &#147;reasonable&#148;. I know we are not
defining what we mean by reasonable&#151;that presumably will be
developed by case law&#151;but we think it is important that a
reasonable sanction should be imposed. The third change we wish to make
is to leave out subsection (6)(a) of proposed new section 2D, which
refers to the reduction, and how it is to be calculated by reference to
such an amount as may be prescribed. That does not actually explain
what is happening. They are small amendments but in terms of sanctions,
they tighten up what is being proposed.</div>
