<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Is it permissible for members of the Committee to remove their jackets?

<H4><center>Relief for a woman with a child and an incapacitated husband</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 14 in page 14, line 30, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5) Relief for widow's bereavement allowance shall be similarly extended to widowers.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the amendment will not detain the Committee long. It has been tabled in a genuine spirit of inquiry to discover why the relief for widow's bereavement allowance cannot be extended to widowers. Widowers feel the loss as keenly as widows, so on the face of it there is no reason for not extending the allowance in the way that the amendment suggests. Might any failure to do so get us into trouble with sex equality laws, passed either by this Government or as part of conventions that we have signed overseas? We are constantly under pressure from various quarters to make all our legislation apply equally to both sexes, and a number of cases have recently been lost by various Governments, which then necessitates changes to legislation.
<P>
We are anticipating possible problems by using this opportunity to extend the allowance to men as well as women. Usually we are under pressure to do it the other way round, but, for various historic reasons, it was felt that widows needed the allowance, possibly because they had lower earnings or, in some cases, no earnings, so the loss of the main breadwinner was keenly felt. Now it can equally happen the other way round.
<P>
Therefore, I ask the Financial Secretary to explain why the point has apparently not been dealt with in the clause and whether, either in Committee or on Report, she will correct this apparent oversight.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> The right hon. Gentleman has moved the amendment in a genuine spirit of inquiry. I welcome that. As he knows, the widow's bereavement allowance was introduced in 1980 to address an anomaly whereby a bereaved husband [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</b> Order. We can have only one person standing in the Committee at a time. Will the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall) please resume his seat.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</b> The widow's bereavement allowance was introduced in 1980 to deal with an anomaly whereby a bereaved husband continued to receive the higher personal married allowance in the year of his wife's death, whereas a bereaved wife was entitled only to the standard allowance. As the right hon. Gentleman will be aware, the married couples allowance is available to the widower now.
<P>
I Understand the right hon. Gentleman's intention, but the amendment does not fulfil his objective. The word "similarly" is insufficiently precise to clarify the intended changes to the requisite section of the legislation. He made it clear in his opening remarks that the amendment is a probing amendment, and I have interpreted it as such. I am sure that he will agree that it is technically defective.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman will also be aware that the current laws governing entitlement to widow's bereavement allowance were introduced by his party when it was in power. During 18 years of Conservative government, it did not tackle the question of widower's entitlement. I was therefore surprised when Conservative Members turned their minds to the matter so soon after losing office.
<P>
In asking that the amendment be rejected, I can assure the Committee that the Government are looking carefully at all aspects of the personal tax system, especially those that may be seen as discriminatory. Clause 26, which will extend the additional personal allowance, shows that, unlike the previous Administration, the Government have moved quickly to tackle the matter where possible.
<P>
However, the widow's bereavement allowance raises wider and more complex issues than those relating solely to the tax system. For example, it raises the question of social security benefits paid to widows. Because of that read-across, the Government are taking a more considered approach than was possible with the additional personal allowance. We shall of course report our proposals to the House in due course, once we have ensured that the interplay between social security and the tax system delivers our objective.
<P>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendment, as clause 26 clearly indicates the Government's intention to tackle discrimination within the tax system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It seems that we have discovered a discrimination. By implication, the hon. Lady has admitted an inequality that men are treated differently from women that has not been dealt with during the first year of a Labour Government.
<P>
The hon. Lady rightly said that the matter was complicated, and that there was interaction between the tax system and the social security system. However, we were told of a great review of social security. Indeed, many measures were introduced further to restrict single parent benefits in particular. The Government were quick off the mark in cutting benefits to certain people, but they have not reviewed discriminatory provisions in the tax and social security systems with similar speed.
<P>
The hon. Lady said that the Government's proposals would be explained to the House in due course. However, we need something rather more precise.[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]
Before the Committee finishes debating the clause, the Government must demonstrate a greater commitment to tackling the discrimination that we have discovered. Instead of simply saying that it will be done at some future date, will she give a commitment that before the end of the Bill's Committee stage and certainly before debate on the Bill ceases in this House the Government will introduce proposals to correct the imbalance, particularly in view of the vulnerability to appeals or cases brought under various human rights provisions or domestic legislation? Does the Financial Secretary believe that the Bill is vulnerable? If it is, it would be wrong and would implicate the Committee if we proceeded knowing that all tax and benefit legislation was vulnerable to attack. We should have her assurance on that before allowing the clauses to become law.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman pressing his amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I need a response from the Minister.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Chair is not, fortunately, responsible for the Minister. Is the hon. Gentleman pressing his amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I should say a little more and make the point 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory, I would never dream of cutting you off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If the Financial Secretary is slipping back into the bad habit of not responding to reasonable questions, I remind her that the day is young. We have plenty of time for debate this morning, this afternoon and this evening and we shall return to the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) is indicating that he would like to participate in the debate, perhaps to encourage the hon. Lady to be a little more co-operative.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Sevenoaks will have to rise to his feet if he wishes to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): I was about to do so, Mrs. Dunwoody, and a very good morning to you.
<P>
We are waiting to hear from the Financial Secretary whether she accepts the principle of the amendment and accepts that the discrimination that she is tackling in the remainder of the clause should also be tackled for widows and widowers. It would be helpful if she could tell the Committee, because we want to know whether the Government accept the spirit of the amendment. We want to hear the magic phrase that we elicited from her at our previous sitting that the amendment is not without elements of desirability. That would encourage those outside the House who welcome the fact that the Government are tackling one area of discrimination in the clause and would like to know whether they are prepared to tackle the further element of discrimination.
<P>
The Financial Secretary said that wider issues were involved. Wider issues are always involved, but she did not say what they were. Did she mean the benefits system, other legislation or cost? We would be prepared not to press the matter if the Government said that they accepted the principle of removing the discrimination in the bereavement allowance and that they would undertake to return to the House at some stage and tell us how they intended to do that.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not respond to threats, veiled or otherwise, when responding, on the Government's behalf, to amendments. I made it clear earlier, as Hansard will show, that the Government are reviewing the whole tax system for any discrimination. They have done so more than the previous Government did in 18 years. I explained to the Committee the complications and necessity of considering the social security system, too. That is the Government's policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Good morning, Mrs. Dunwoody, I am pleased to see you back in the Chair.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I counsel members of the Committee against either welcoming me to the Chair or welcoming me back to the Chair? I am afraid that I shall be with hon. Members for some time. I hope that they will be able to bear that as best they can. May I also point out that, as there is a great deal of noise in the Room, hon. Members must speak up. I call Mr. Clifton-Brown fortissimo!
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Mrs. Dunwoody, you could never be missed in the Chair. I hope that you will be able to hear clearly what I am saying.
<P>
I found it difficult to understand what the Financial Secretary said in her reply to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), but I think that I got the gist of it. Now that there is much greater sex equality in the workplace and that both women and men receive substantial earnings, it seems to me that anything in the tax system which discriminates against women or men must be undesirable. My right hon. Friend was right to ask the Financial Secretary for an undertaking in principle on whether the Government intended to remove this distortion and discrimination in the tax system.
<P>
For too long, widowers have not benefited from the bereavement allowance. That is unfair, just as it was unfair on women when they did not have an independent taxation system. Do the Government intend to ensure that men and women are able to maintain independent taxation systems? The Financial Secretary hinted that the clause might have wider implications. I wonder whether that was what she meant. I shall certainly want to return to that matter on Third Reading and on Report if the Financial Secretary does not let us know that the Government are prepared to end the matter once and for all.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Financial Secretary's reply was slightly fuller than her first reply, but she still has not told the Committee whether she accepts the spirit of the amendment. It is a simple point: is the spirit of the amendment acceptable to the Government? I realise that our proposal might take a year or two to introduce, require different legislation and be expensive the money may have to come from elsewhere but all that we want to know is whether the Government accept the spirit of the amendment. I do not understand why the Committee should be denied an answer to that very simple question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I think that we have finally elicited from the Financial Secretary the tacit admission that the allowance is discriminatory. The Government are clearly embarrassed about that. They have tackled various parts of the social security and tax system, not always to the advantage of vulnerable people, who have been further disadvantaged by the Government's actions. We are trying to do some good by evening out the benefit system and providing equivalent relief for widowers. But the Government are reluctant to legislate, certainly in the Finance Bill, or to make a time commitment and say whether they will do so by, for example, the end of the year. It has taken us almost 20 minutes to get the Government to admit that. We are grateful for their admission that there is a problem that will be tackled at some stage, but in order to put a marker down that we will return to this matter, we will press the amendment to a Division. We are aware that it is technically defective, but we want to make our position clear and to distinguish between Opposition Members, who regard this as a matter of concern, and Government Members, who may not hold the same view.

<H4><center>Clause 28</center></H4>
<H4><center>Charge and rates for financial year 1998</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 15, line 5, leave out "31" and insert "30".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 35, in clause 29, page 15, line 11, leave out "30" and insert "29".

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such fraction as the Treasury shall determine will result in a marginal rate of Corporation Tax between the lower and upper relevant maximum amounts which is equal to the rate specified in subsection (1) above.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> During the brief time that I have been in Parliament, I have clung to the idea that the Government might occasionally stick to their word, and do things that they say they intend to do.
<P>
When they introduced the Budget, they said that they would ensure that the cash cost to companies of the new rules for collecting tax in the same year in which profits were generated under the new tax payment system would be mitigated by a lower rate of corporation tax. I am grateful to the Inland Revenue for its press release No. 8, which was issued on 17 March this year, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A one per cent cut in corporation tax rates announced by the Chancellor today will benefit around 400,000 companies, enabling them to retain more of their profits for investment and growth."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The table on page 9 of its press release No. 9, however, made it clear that the effect of the change on the way in which tax is collected from companies in this country, combined with the reduction in corporation tax, would leave companies very much worse off more than œ4 billion worse off by 2004.
<P>
It was clear from the figures on page 9 that the simplest way in which the Government's intentions could be realised would be to go further than they proposed and introduce on top of the 1 per cent. reduction in the main corporation tax rate next year an additional 1 per cent. reduction in the corporation tax rate this year. The figures showing a net loss to companies until the last financial year the year 2003-04 would then reflect a virtually neutral change in the cash flow of companies across the sector.
<P>
We have proposed a change in the main corporation tax rate because, owing to the pressure exerted on the Government before the Budget I think that the Conservative party can claim credit for its part in that the Government recognised that they could not impose the new system of corporation tax on smaller companies, which are subject to the lower corporation tax rate. It is large companies' cash flows that will be hit by the changes to the way in which tax is collected. Therefore, their rate of corporation tax has to be properly adjusted not too little, as the Government propose, but sufficient to ensure that their cash flow is virtually neutral as a result of the changes, so that the profits that they need to retain in their businesses, as the previous press release acknowledged, are available for them to invest in growth and the creation of jobs.
<P>
I was very conscious of the fact that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition challenged the Prime Minister on the Government's proposals on 18 March, the day after the Budget, and reminded the Prime Minister that the Confederation of British Industry had complained about the adverse impact of the Government's policies. When the Prime Minister says that he wants things to happen as a result of the Budget, and they do not happen, I have to believe that it is because, like other members of his Administration, he does not always read the fine detail in his red boxes and[Mr. St. Aubyn]
he does not realise that the proposed changes do not go far enough to give effect to his intentions. Let us listen to what the Prime Minister said because it shows that, if he were a member of the Committee, he would support our amendment. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"corporation tax under this Government... is the lowest that it has ever been."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"this Government have cut corporation tax twice since being in power."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Finally, he said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As a result of the changes going through, businesses will pay less tax, not more". [Official Report, 18 March 1998; Vol. 308, c. 1282-1283.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If it is the Government's intention that businesses should pay less tax, it is important that the rate of tax should achieve that result. On the basis of figures given on page 9 of the Inland Revenue's press release of 17 March, we estimate that the effect of our proposal would be to take away from the Government's revenues an additional œ0.7 billion in the year to April 2000, œ1 billion in the year to 2001, and œ1.1 billion in the year to 2002 and for each year thereafter.
<P>
I realise that by the time we reach the end of the period projected in the Inland Revenue figures, there will begin to be a substantial advantage for companies in the lower rates of tax. It might be asked why we proposed those lower rate during the introductory period of the new collections system and did not propose that the rate should be readjusted back up at the end, so that the cash flow effect would be, as near as possible, neutral. We did not propose that because, in the press release, the Inland Revenue states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the numbers shows are subject to wide margins of error because of the many uncertainties inherent in predicting the future baseline... and the impact of the changes."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems wrong to extrapolate the figures for five years and then propose, in this year's Finance Bill, what the rate of corporation tax should be in five years' time, based on projections which the Inland Revenue admits are unreliable.
<P>
Clearly, the Inland Revenue's projections for the early years are the most reliable. That is why it is most important that the construct the combination of the new payment system and the tax rate in those early years should have a neutral effect on the cash flow of companies. That is why it is vital that, in those years, the figures are shown to be neutral, and do not show, as the figures in the press release show, a total of œ4.6 billion being taken from companies in the first four years. The cumulative effect of the Government's proposals over the first four years the years when we are most confident of the projections will be that almost œ5 billion will be taken from major companies. That will hit their investment plans and ability to create jobs and prosperity for the whole economy.
<P>
We thought that the Government had learnt something from the past 18 years. We thought that they understood that lowering rates of taxation could generate higher tax revenues. If the Government reduce the rates of corporation tax by a further 1 per cent. this year and an additional 1 per cent. in subsequent years, it is possible that by the fourth and fifth years the additional prosperity that those companies could generate through extra investment would translate into higher revenues for the Government. The reduction in the Government's tax take, which their nominal figures project, will not come about because the companies, which will have invested wisely, will have generated more profits and more corporation tax.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
So, this is a clear case of putting the Government on the spot. We ask them to recognise the error of their calculations in the press releases that were issued by their public servants. For the reasons that I have given, it should be easy for them to accept the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): In supporting the amendment, which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), it is worth emphasising the fact that the marginal rate cut that the clause proposes is dwarfed by the extra sums that the Exchequer will take from this country's corporate sector. According to the Red Book, we face a œ1.6 billion increase in the financial year 1999, an increase of œ2 billion in the following year and an increase of œ3.1 billion in 2001. As my hon. Friend has already stated so clearly, those figures dwarf the value of the marginal cut that the clause proposes.
<P>
Are not the Government giving with one hand and very much taking with the other? Tax increase over this Parliament's lifetime are estimated to be about œ20 billion. That sum of course includes the windfall levy, but a significant proportion of its is accounted for by the clause's proposals and by the new corporate tax regime. Large companies do not welcome the proposed acceleration of payments.
<P>
The Labour party is very skilled in the arts of spin, and it tries to make people believe things tht simply are not the case. It wants us to believe that black is white. However, I should remind the Committee of the value of marginal tax cuts to companies, which are in the Red Book. The proposed cut from April 1999, which is dealt with in the clause, is of virtually negligible value to companies, and for the year 2000, the sum is œ700 million. Those are very small sums of money in the great scheme of things.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford eloquently pointed out, it is clear that investment will not improve. To understand why, one should compare the net effect of the small cut in the taxation burden which is affected by the marginal rate cut with all the other increases, which involve the new corporation tax regime, the abolition of fixed income dividends, the surplus advance corporation tax changes and the shadow ACT changes, which we shall debate with relish later.
<P>
I want to re-emphasise a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford made. I shall not try your patience, Mrs. Dunwoody, because I see that you are anxious to press on, but it does no harm to remind the Labour party of the Prime Minister's broken promise. Despite what the Red Book says, he maintains that there is an effective tax cut for the corporate sector in this country. The Red Book shows otherwise. Investment plans will be greatly assisted by my hon. Friend's amendment, so I hope that Ministers will give it serious consideration.
<P>
However, I have no great hope that they will concede. After all, when the previous Administration were valiantly cutting corporation tax from the historically high levels that we inherited in 1979 it was cut from 52 per cent. to 33 per cent. in an historic and majestic Lawson Budget, the Labour party voted against those marginal rate cuts. I fear, and I am depressed by the fact, that Labour Members will not see the good sense of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Various themes are emerging from the Government's Budgets. The first is that Budget statements tend not to match what is in the subsequent Finance Bill. We have seen nothing in the Bill, for example, about the working families tax credit and there was nothing in the Budget statement about the end of bed and breakfasting and the end of retirement relief for capital gains tax. The Budget statement is being used for spin.
<P>
The second theme is that of incompetence. The saga of incompetence started in July with a decision to abolish dividend tax credits. That led to the problem with FIDs, which led to the problem of having to recoup the cash flow lost to the Government, so they decided to abolish ACT. Now we have the problem of what to replace that with.
<P>
The third theme is hidden taxes. There was the hidden tax in the last Budget from the œ5 billion a year abolition of dividend tax credits and in this Budget there is the hidden tax with the introduction of quarterly payments, which will mean a cash flow disadvantage for companies. The Government said that they were introducing quarterly payments to compensate the Treasury for the lack of cash flow resulting from the abolition of ACT. As members of the Committee will know, ACT was paid 14 days after the end of the quarter in which a company pays its dividend. That meant that it was paying the Treasury some tax several months in advance of its mainstream corporation tax liability. Therefore, if ACT is abolished, there will prima facie be a cash flow disadvantage to the Government.
<P>
The Government seem to have over-egged the pudding. I do not know why they should want to do that. Perhaps it is another way of raising even more revenue, which they can then spend in their final year, once the moratorium on spending has ended. The result is that companies will have to pay œ1.6 billion extra next year and œ2 billion the year after that. It is a concern to the corporate sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will my hon. Friend reflect on the fact that substantial amounts of money are flowing into the Exchequer from these punitive tax increases over and above what would have flowed into the Treasury coffers had the Conservative party won the last election? Does he think that there is a connection between the date of the next general election and these huge amounts of money, which no doubt will be used for a public spending splurge?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend raises a telling point. The notes on clauses show that the maximum level of extra revenue to the Treasury, principally in 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02, is œ3.1 billion. The following year it starts to decline, and by the year 2003-04 it turns into a net cost to the Treasury. It is a coincidence, but the Government have a clever man in the Paymaster General, who can work these things out for them. I am sure, as my hon. Friend has intimated, that this is more than an accidental windfall; it is a deliberate policy to raise vast sums of money that the Government can spend in the run-up to the next general election.
<P>
Indeed, this is another example of the Government's stealth tactics. The corporate sector does not want to face this burden. The CBI, for example, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The 1 per cent. reduction in the Corporation Tax rate does not amount to full compensation for earlier payment when the effect of time discounting is included."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The burden is even worse for companies that do not pay a dividend, because they never made an advance payment of corporation tax to the Treasury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): The hon. Gentleman has made much of the inconvenience and the cost that will be suffered by businesses during the transition period. Will he accept that, once the transition has taken place, the net benefit to those companies will be œ1.6 billion each year? Only 20,000 out of the 700,000 companies affected will experience the interim problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am amazed by the hon. Gentleman's intervention. He refers to it being only a transition period. The transition period is four years the lifetime of this Parliament. If Labour Members are saying, "We promise that, at the end of those four years, should we win the next general election, we will not raise taxes on the corporate sector again and we will allow the corporate sector to benefit from that reversal", they must be living in cloud cuckoo land. The Labour party made a clear pledge at the time of the general election that it would not raise taxes and it raised taxes within two months of coming to power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> There must be a confusion in the hon. Gentleman's mind between raising taxes and the amount of revenue that is received by the Exchequer. I have heard on numerous occasions arguments from Opposition Members in the House and in Committee to the effect that, the lowering of taxes makes the revenue take larger. Indeed, it is one of their traditional, stock arguments in debates. Yet they cannot see that we are talking about lowering taxes but having a revenue take in the meantime.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be short.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman really is confused. The justification for saying that when we lowered taxes the revenue was raised is that the previous Government lowered the top rate of income tax from 83 per cent., which was the legacy from the Labour party's last Government, to 60 per cent. That meant that people came back into this country to be entrepreneurs, they stopped avoiding tax through schemes and they worked harder and had the incentive to work.
<P>
This is not the case here. The hon. Gentleman should bear in mind the key point that the Treasury never[Mr. Gibb]
includes in its projections any supply-side effects that we believe should be taken into account when tax rates are lowered. If we were to lower the tax rate tomorrow, the Treasury would count that as a cost and would ignore any supply-side effects that it would have on increasing revenue in the future.
<P>
The situation with corporation tax take is the result of advance payments. It means that the corporate sector will have to pay more money. The hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner) says that raising taxes should not be equated with raising revenue, but the revenue raised by the Treasury from the corporate sector is being paid by the corporate sector directly and now. That is a cost to the corporate sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Does my hon. Friend recall hearing the Chancellor say that one of the Labour party's taxation principles would be fairness between the generations? Does he agree that pulling tax receipts forward from the future to now scarcely supports that objective?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. These are large sums of money. The sum of œ2 billion a year is equivalent to 1 per cent. on the rate of income tax; œ3 billion the following year is almost 1.5p to 2p on the rate of income tax. It is not œ30 million or œ40 million, but œ2 billion and œ3 billion a year, an enormous sum of money, which the corporate sector will have to bear. It will mean reduced investment and therefore fewer jobs. I believe that it is a decision that the Government will come to regret, because the corporate sector and the CBI, supposedly the Labour party's friends, are beginning to realise that they have allowed a monster into power. The Government should review that decision, and take into account the sentiments that lie behind the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I should like to support everything that my hon. Friends have said about the amendment.
<P>
I want to discuss amendment No. 50, which appears in the amendment paper in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford, although I tabled it. I say that not out of vanity but because I want to discuss a defect in that amendment's drafting and to explain why I tabled it.
<P>
I should begin by declaring an interest as the director of a company that expects, in the relevant period, to have profits that fall between the lower and upper limits that are contained in clauses 28 and 29. I suspect that I am not the only Committee member who has such an interest. Almost by definition, all Committee members have a direct personal interest when we discuss taxation.
<P>
The reason for tabling the amendment is to allow us to have a short discussion about the issues that face small companies that have profits that are above the lower threshold level of œ300,000 but below the upper threshold level of œ1.5 million. I recognise that the amendment contains certain defects, but I wanted to table an amendment that it was in order to discuss in relation to clause 28.
<P>
I do not know whether the Paymaster General or the Financial Secretary will respond to this debate, but if he or she is sympathetic to my reasons for tabling the amendment, I should be happy to withdraw it and to table a new clause that would deal with the same matter in a technically more effective and elegant way, and which we could discuss later. It is important to raise the matter in relation to clause 28.
<P>
As to he lower rate of tax for small companies, the marginal relief system currently prevents small companies that earn profits of œ300,000 from facing a cliff edge and having to pay the full mainstream corporation tax rate on all their profits. That system is valuable because it avoids the œ300,000 cliff edge. None the less, as the Paymaster General appeared to recognise on Second Reading, companies face a marginal rate of tax on profits of between œ300,000 and œ1.5 million, which is substantially greater than the marginal rate of tax that is faced by companies that earn profits of more than œ1.5 million, and which is therefore higher than the mainstream corporation tax rate.
<P>
The amendment seeks, in its inelegant way, to shift the cliff edge to the œ1.5 million limit. I believe that at that level, in extremis, companies could afford the sudden addition of œ30,000 to their tax charges. It is preferable to avoid the cliff edge altogether, but it would not have been in order to have tabled an amendment to that effect in relation to clause 28.
<P>
I raise this matter for discussion within the context of my hon. Friend's remarks. They referred to the huge additional yield that the Treasury will receive over the next four years from the other changes that will be made to the corporation tax regime about œ5 billion will be involved over the next four years. Plenty of money will be available to finance a modest concession to medium-sized companies at a critical point in their growth. The key point is that companies with profits between œ300,000 and œ1.5 million are likely to be the companies that the Government will be seeking, through their strategies and policies, to encourage to invest, grow and create jobs.
<P>
The United Kingdom has a significant number of large, world-beating companies. We should all be extremely proud of that. We also have, thanks to the policies of the previous Administration's 18 years in government, a vibrant culture of small enterprise. I like to think that we have imported something of the mentality of north America into the culture of western Europe. We have a large number of small companies. Indeed, I think that we probably have more business start-ups in the UK than the other members of the European Union put together. We should be extremely proud of that too.
<P>
However, we should all be concerned about our dismal record on turning smaller companies into medium-sized, solid, long-term, bedrock companies in the British economy. The German economy during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s often referred to as the German economic miracle achieved that very well. Most people who have studied the comparative economies of western Europe recognise that one of the strengths of the German economy is the so-called Mittelstand, which is the large body of medium-sized companies, often family-owned, that are solidly profitable and able to generate funds internally for investment. That allows them to remain at the forefront of technology, to ensure steady, solid growth, and to provide a strong base in the economy of secure, reliable, often well-paid jobs.
<P>
I hope that Ministers will wish to pursue a policy that encourages such medium-sized companies. Whatever we can do to break down the gap between, on the one hand, large and successful companies and, on the other, small dynamic entrepreneurial companies, will be positive for the United Kingdom.
<P>
I ask the Government to consider the spirit of the amendment rather than the full glare of its technical defects, and to say whether there is sympathy for tabling a new clause at the end of the Bill's consideration. The revenue consequences are difficult for someone outside the Treasury to calculate, but I estimate that they would be relatively small and, in the context of the cash grab that the Government are making in the other clauses relating to corporation tax, almost insignificant.
<P>
Governments send a signal to the corporate sector indeed, to all of us in their decisions on what to tax and what not to tax. The Treasury's statement of intent on environmental taxation says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"How and what governments tax sends clear signals about the economic activities they believe should be encouraged or discouraged".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that applies to environmental taxes, I do not see why it should not apply to taxation in general. I am certain that the Government would wish to dissociate themselves from any suggestion that they are sending a signal to medium-sized businesses that they are not to be encouraged to grow and invest. The Government have an opportunity to signal an encouragement to that sector. If Ministers are sympathetic to that, I will withdraw the amendment and table a new clause for debate later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I support the amendments. Some telling points were made on two aspects in particular. The first is the effect of quarterly filing for corporation tax payments on large companies. The advance cash flow is a cost, despite what Labour Members may say, because if a company pays tax in advance, it either borrows more or uses money that could be deployed elsewhere. The CBI stated clearly that the cost of the quarterly filing requirement is more than the reduction in the rate of corporation tax.
<P>
I echo the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) on the marginal rate of tax between the rates for small companies and large companies. Amendment No. 50 covers an important point that should be borne in mind by the Government when setting future rates of corporation tax. As my hon. Friend made clear, the import of amendment No. 50, albeit that it is not properly drafted, is that when a small company's profits increase to œ1 over œ300,000, all its profits become liable to the large-company rate of corporation tax. It is the small and medium companies from which tomorrow's jobs and tomorrow's enterprise come. We spent a lot of time during our 18 years of Government encouraging small companies, which employed 1 million extra people. We must give them the right corporation tax structure, including amendment of the rate, because the filing regime, bureaucracy and difficulty of filing constitute a problem for small companies.
<P>
My final and perhaps most important point is that, although large companies pay 85 per cent. of all corporation tax, the rate and regime of the tax decides the domicile of those companies. The Conservative Government reduced considerably the rate of corporation tax, usually without increasing the complexity of filing. The result was that this country became one of the most popular places in the world for large companies to be domiciled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): On the basis of the hon. Gentleman's statement, will he welcome those parts of the Budget that reduced corporation tax to its lowest level ever?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I unreservedly welcome the fact that the rate of corporation tax has been reduced, but it is wholly reprehensible that the accompanying changes notably withdrawal of associated advance corporation tax credit, the filing requirements and the huge increase in bureaucracy have more than offset the reduction in the rate. That sends an unfortunate signal to companies who are making long-term plans on whether to be domiciled in this country. Our debates have a wider audience than the Committee, and the Paymaster General should clarify the Government's strategy for corporate taxation. Will the proposals before us be the end of the matter, or will there be progressive increases in the total burden of taxation on the corporate sector? Companies making long-term and significant decisions involving a great deal of employment will examine carefully the statements being made by the Government to see whether the Government are friends of business. There is a growing perception that perhaps the Government are not the friends of business that they purported to be during the run-up to the election.
<P>
The response of the Paymaster General to the amendments will be examined carefully by the corporate sector. I, for one, await his reply with eagerness and anticipation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> This has been an important debate. My hon. Friends have well illustrated by example and argument the immediate problems that corporate Britain will face as a consequence of the changes being introduced by the Government. There will be considerable difficulties with cash flow, with additional compliance and above all with the extra burden imposed. Business organisations up and down the country have bombarded Committee members with evidence of the pain that they will feel. Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 make my hon. Friend's case very well.
<P>
Although I declared my interests on Second Reading, I should tell the Committee that, as a director of a small business, I too have an interest in amendment No. 50, tabled in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford. He spoke for the whole sector when he said that small businesses should not simply thrive as small businesses, but should grow. The clause will not allow them to do that.
<P>
The debate was interesting in another respect. For the first time, we had a contribution from a member on the Government Benches. The hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner) defended the Government's actions. However, the Government should brief their Members better, as the Paymaster General will need to improve on that defence.
<P>
First, the hon. Member for Brent, North said that the changes would bring a net benefit to companies. There may be a net benefit in a single year after 2002. However, there will be no net benefit during the period 1998 to 2002. Instead, there will be a net hit on corporate Britain.
<P>
Secondly, the hon. Member suggested that this was simply a transition period. However, four years is a very long transition period. In each of those years corporate Britain will suffer serious and negative consequences. Finally, the hon. Gentleman suggested that the clause would affect a few companies only. That is a bizarre suggestion, which he may want to reconsider, because the changes will hit this country's major employers. The Government are allegedly more friendly to business, yet the changes will render those employers less competitive, and may threaten jobs.
<P>
We welcome the Paymaster General to the Committee's proceedings and we look forward to two answers from him. First, will he acknowledge that the changes will cause companies problems over the next three to four years? We of course welcome the rate reduction. Nevertheless, there will be negative consequences, and there should be mitigation for those companies that are affected most.
<P>
We have tabled several amendments that would mitigate the damage. That is particularly true of amendment No. 9, to which we attach considerable importance. We look to the Paymaster General to acknowledge the problem, and to confirm that the Government are sufficiently sympathetic to industry to seek a solution to it.
<P>
Secondly, will the Paymaster General tell us about the Government's long-term strategy on the rate? We welcome any rate reduction, but the current reduction does not compensate for the additional costs imposed on business over the next four years, as my hon. Friends have said. However, companies might take some comfort if the Paymaster General were to announce that this was not the end of the story, and that further rate reductions would be made when and if circumstances allowed.
<P>
The previous Administration reduced the rate as much and as often as circumstances allowed. The Government's further small cut is welcome. Is it to be succeeded by others?
<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson):</B> We have had a good, even-tempered start to this morning's debate.
<P>
May I remind Opposition Membrs that all the figures involved in the change to in-year instalment payments for corporation tax, which were put out for consultationlast November, were arrived at in a spirit of open consultation. Many people took part in that consultation, including the CBI and the major companies some 20,000 that will be affected. As the hon. Member for Sevenoaks said, those companies are very important to the economy and pay something like 85 per cent. of the corporation tax cake. It might seem a heinous crime to listen, consult and then do something, but as a result of those discussions we took medium-sized companies out of in-year instalments completely, which is a big step forward. It also has a bearing on amendment No. 50, which was moved by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, to which I shall refer in a moment.
<P>
There has been an open debate. There have been no secrets, and we have made it plain from the beginning that ACT which has an in-built bias to distributions, distorts investment and poses problems, in particular, for major overseas groups has no place in a modern taxation system. It is interesting that the Opposition have switched from opposing our move away from ACT in principle to opposing it on the fairly narrow though important issue of the transitional arrangements. As the hon. Member for Sevenoaks said, subsequent amendments relate precisely to the transition and how best to deal with it and, for that reason, I hope that our debate will not become too repitious.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge declared an interest in amendment No. 50, as did the hon. Member for Sevenoaks. I should point out straight away that, as a result of the defective nature of the amendment, those for whom the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge bears the interest would incur an immediate increase in their tax bill of œ30,000. Perhaps he and the hon. Member for Sevenoaks should tell their clients that the amendment would cost them œ30,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> To clarify this point, I believe that I am right to say that the additional burden of œ30,000 would cut in only once the profitability reached œ1.5 million. That is my understanding of the full effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman should explain that to his clients as clearly as he has just explained it to the Committee. I think that he might be wise to withdraw the amendment, as I regret that I cannot promise that we will be any more sympathetic to the amendment, which is at present defective, on Report. I recognise that, in light of the higher marginal rate for profitability of more than œ1.5 million, he has made a good point. I cannot, however, encourage him with any hope of success to table the amendment on Report. He can say this to his clients: even though they have been taken out of in-year instalments, medium-sized companies will still benefit from the 1 per cent. reduction in the marginal rate of corporation tax from 33.5 per cent. to 32.5 per cent., which is worth having. We are moving in the direction in which he, with some good reasons, is trying to push us. Those medium-sized companies paying didends most of them do will benefit from the abolition of ACT. Some other benefits in this and previous Budgets are to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises especially medium-sized companies. That shows the hon. Gentleman that, indeed, we regard them as extremely important.
<P>
Cisco and other organisations have made the point that we are concentrating on start-ups particularly high-tech start-ups especially those which are not management buy-outs or buy-ins, and on the FTSE top 100, 200 or 500 companies. We recognise that there is a big gap filled with companies, many of which are medium-sized I do not mean the 20,000 at the top for which the stock market is not responding as required and other sources of finance are not in place. We are considering that problem we have taken, for example, the decision to extend first-year capital allowances. We announced our decision, on Tuesday of this week I think, to extend capital allowances to 100 per cent. in Northern Ireland for the rest of this Parliament. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that our proposal was tremendously well received; there was an emphatically positive reaction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I hear what the Paymaster General says about the 100 per cent. capital allowances extended to Northern Ireland, but we are getting a little tired of tax incentives being announced just ahead of critical votes, targeted specifically on the regions that will be voting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I wish I had not given way; that intervention will not encourage me to do so in future.
<P>
We have made changes to employers' national insurance contributions, with the abolition of the entry fee for lower paid employees and the new flat rate, again specifically aimed at that target group of companies. For those people who are starting up businesses, the taper on capital gains tax will be yet a further advantage. I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider in the round what we have already done for businesses in that sector, to which he has rightly drawn our attention and, in that context, I ask him to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
Most of the other points that arose in the debate were made at the outset by the hon. Member for Guildford. The hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) and for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) may have raised one or two new points, and I shall deal with those in due course, but I shall address the main issue first.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford was correct to speak of cash flow and profit, and cash flow and tax. In saying that it is a cash flow impact, I am not trying to say that it is negative and does not have an impact on certain businesses of course it does, but one must make the distinction between a cash flow impact and a profits impact. One is a one-off and the other is a continuing benefit. The Opposition's proposal, to introduce a 1 per cent. cut in one year and then to introduce a further 1 per cent. cut in the next year, is unacceptable.
<P>
The whole point of the Government's economic policy and approach to industrial matters and corporation tax is that it must be long term. Companies will have an on-going benefit of œ1.6 billion, rising to œ2 billion after the transitional period. That has been widely welcomed by the corporate sector, which sees that we now have the lowest tax rates for major companies, as well as for small and medium-sized enterprises, in the European Union. They are headline rates, which are attractive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Given the code of conduct on tax harmonisation to which the Government have signed up, can the Paymaster General guarantee that any future moves by the European Union to harmonise business tax rates across Europe will not result in the United Kingdom being forced to raise rates in line with the average in Europe? Can the hon. Gentleman guarantee today that the Government will veto any such proposals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I might have expected that intervention from the right hon. Member for Wells.
<P>
This would be an appropriate moment to remind the Committee that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is the chairman of the relevant committee, so I refer the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to her. We have said this may reassure the Committee that there will not be any increase in corporate tax rates during this Parliament, which is as reasonably far ahead as one can be expected to look on such matters, and that the current rates of 30 per cent. for large companies and 20 per cent. for small and medium-sized enterprises will stick.
<P>
Returning to the issue of cash flow and profits, our proposals do not constitute a tax hike; the tax rates will remain the same. Opposition Members say that four years is a long time, but would they really want the change to be made in a shorter time, which would mean a more concentrated impact on the cash flow of those companies? To try to make an on-going benefit equate to a transitional cost is no way to run a business. In effect, Opposition Members are asking that an on-going benefit should be provided to cover in totality a temporary cost. What would they do about that on-going benefit in the future, once the transitional period, especially if it were shorter, has been completed?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> If the Paymaster General had listened to me, he would know that I said that the Inland Revenue's projections are, in its own words, subject to wide margins of error. Obviously, that happens in later years. There is no way of knowing whether the proposal will cost the Exchequer money from 2003 onwards, which, under our proposal, is when the cash flow becomes negative from the Government's point of view. As for the idea of using a lower tax rate to mitigate the changes, that is precisely the Government's policy. We are not debating the principle but the rate at which that policy is working.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I was coming to that. The hon. Gentleman has not answered my question about funding an on-going benefit that is of considerable size œ1.6 billion or œ2 billion for the corporate sector and which will continue after the transitional period. Governments must ask how that is to be funded. Transitional costs cannot be met entirely by on-going benefits, and there is a problem beyond the transitional period. That is the reason for our solution which, I am sure, we will debate later.
[Mr. Robinson]
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold was worried about the attractiveness of the UK as a domicile for major multinational groups. That concern has been mentioned many times and was also raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I am pleased to say that the abolition of ACT is a most important measure. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) has been on about that because a principal client of a company with which he is associated is the Billiton group. [Interruption.] I am sorry. It is a colleague of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds.
<P>
An interesting letter arrived this week from the Billiton group which said how pleased it is with the taxation changes, and that it is happy to be domiciled here.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Can the Paymaster General tell us what representations he has received from companies with foreign source profits on the abolition of foreign income dividends? Is that not a huge disincentive to locate in this country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Absolutely not. FIDs were introduced to help those companies that paid ACT but did not have enough mainstream corporation tax arising in the UK to offset it. Now that we do not have ACT, the problem is solved. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton understood that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a second.
<P>
Now that we have got rid of ACT, those companies have every incentive to be here because the problem will not arise. We will discuss what will happen to existing surplus ACT, but those companies will not generate the inevitable surplus ACT when most of their profits come from abroad.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the Paymaster General accept that some companies with foreign source profits will have unrelieved ACT prior to 6 April? Some companies that have elected to go down the FID route prior to the change will have unrelieved ACT. For that reason, some people argue that there should be a shadow FID regime as well as a shadow ACT regime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is anticipating amendments that we will debate later, and I shall be happy to discuss the matter then. However, we are talking about the abolition of ACT, which means that problem of unrecovered ACT will not arise. That is why Billiton have written to me saying how pleased it is with what we have done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I am grateful to the Paymaster General who is, I think, compounding his own confusion. Before he tries to pin companies associated with my company on colleagues with whom they have no connection and if, like last year, he is going to pluck scruffy bits of paper out of his pocket from certain companies, which supposedly have something to do with the company of which I am a director, would he have the courtesy to publish those letters in full instead of quoting from them selectively, as it subsequently turns out that the gist of the representations is the opposite of what he is implying?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I note the hon. Gentleman's tetchy tones. I seem to have touched on a raw nerve. He must have tense internal discussions, because we have the full support of the chairman and one of the most distinguished non-executive directors on the board, a former ambassador to the United States. I am not sure whether I should publish the letters. I might seek your advice, Mrs. Dunwoody, or perhaps seek the permission of the senders of the letters. They are personal letters. I have not referred, other than in general terms, to representations that we have had from the distinguished company of which the hon. Gentleman is a director.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have allowed a wide debate on these three amendments, because I believed that the points being made were serious enough to warrant being put into context. Neither Ministers nor hon. Members must have debates on later subjects until we reach the relevant clauses. I hope that that will be remembered.
<P>
I should also say that I am not inclined to allow a stand part debate on this clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for your guidance.
<P>
Perhaps I may finish on my last point. If I obtain permission to let the hon. Gentleman see those letters, he will be reassured by them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Paymaster General has made the helpful statement that the rates of corporation tax are unlikely to be increased during this Parliament, which will be welcome to the corporate sector. Can he elucidate the matter a little further and give some assurance that the reduction in the small rate of corporation tax is not merely to soften up medium-sized companies for a quarterly filng regime for them as well? It would be helpful if he could give an assurance that he does not intend to introduce a quarterly filing regime for small and medium-sized companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I can give the hon. Member for Cotswold a categorical assurance on both points. The rates that we have committed to the 30 per cent. rate for large companies and SMEs at 20 per cent. are for this Parliament. We as a Government have no intention of bringing the medium-sized enterprise companies into the in-year instalment arrangements. I cannot be more clear than that.
<P>
I have replied to the debate and covered all the Opposition's points. I hope that they will not press the amendments to a vote. If they do, we shall oppose them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> It is for my hon. Friends in midfield to decide whether to press the amendments. The Paymaster General's speech brought out three points that the Committee should note.
<P>
First, he has confirmed that there will be no further cuts in corporation tax. [Interruption.] No, he used the word "stick". He said that the corporation tax rates would stick for the rest of this Parliament. Perhaps he now wants to change that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> They will not be increased.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I see. That is some comfort. The word that he used earlier was "stick", but if he is now telling us that it is possible that corporation tax rates could be reduced, we will take some comfort from that.
<P>
Secondly, he tried to suggest, with some sleight of hand, that the industry was happy with that. He said that it had all gone out for consultation. In a letter that the entire Committee received yesterday, the CBI, the principal employers' organisation, made it clear that it was still unhappy with what the Paymaster General was proposing. It points out, quite rightly, that, despite the cut in the rate that we are talking about, the Government's cash flow will still benefit from the latest changes during the four-year transition, with around œ2 billion a year arising from the replacement of ACT and only œ1 billion given back through the rate cut from 31 per cent. to 30 per cent. Even when the transition is over, the net benefit for business that is what the hon. Member for Brent. North was banging on about of all the corporation tax rate cuts will be more than offset by the changes to dividend tax credits. Overall, the clause is a serious hit on business, and the amendment would do something to mitigate its effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I listened carefully to the Paymaster General's comments on amendment No. 50 and, in spite of myself, I detected a note of sympathy for the situation in which medium-sized companies find themselves. I hope that he will indeed bear my representation in mind, as he promised to do.
<P>
I should make one point of clarification. The Paymaster General said that I was representing clients in my remarks, but I am sure that that was a slip of the tongue. I assure him and the Committee that when I made my remarks I represented no one but myself. The declaration of interest that I made was merely as the director of a small company that aspires to make profits that fall within the proposed band.
<P>
As you are not minded, Mrs. Dunwoody, to allow a clause stand part debate, I want to draw to the Paymaster General's attention one small point about the clause. Widening the difference between the basic rate of income tax and the small companies rate of corporation tax will create an additional administrative burden for business and industry. The lower rate of small companies corporation tax is welcome but, traditionally, the small companies rate of corporation tax and the basic rate of income tax have been the same. The Government's proposals have implications on the persistence of the difference between those two rates, and there will be additional administrative burdens for what are in some cases very small companies.
<P>
In view of the Paymaster General's comments and his generally sympathetic tone I shall not press amendment No. 50 to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have in my cloakroom at home a framed Conservative election leaflet from the 1886 election. The slogan reads, "By their deeds ye shall know them," The Conservatives went on to win the 1886 general election, and a similar slogan might well lead us to win the next election.
<P>
The Paymaster General showed what a gulf there is between his rhetoric and what will happen to large companies if the amendment is not accepted. The key point is the fact that he gave a commitment that the rate of corporation tax will not go up during this Parliament. However, as figures from the Inland Revenue and the Red Book show, the Government's proposals involve significant costs for companies. It is only in the next Parliament if the current rate of corporation tax continues that companies will receive any cash-flow benefits whatsoever. This Parliament cannot of course bind its successors, so the Paymaster General cannot make any meaningful commitment to ensure that, as a result of the proposed changes, companies will receive any benefits.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks said, when one factors in the changes on dividend payments, which were introduced last year, there will be a detrimental effect on companies.
<P>
The Prime Minister's claim, which I quoted before 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment's scope is very clear. I allowed hon. Gentlemen to paraphrase earlier, but I do not want our debate to go backwards. I must encourage Committee members to accept the simple fact that if they must quote, they should do so briefly. The hon. Gentleman has already made his point.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Aspirations will not be met unless the amendments are accepted.
<P>
The Paymaster General tried to explain his party's taxation policy, but we all know and my hon. Friends have already identified the point of his party's taxation policy. It is to raise taxes early in the current Parliament so that they can buy success at the election and win power in the next Parliament. There is no doubt that that tactic will be seen through by the country. There is an old adage that when General Motors sneezes, America catches a cold. General Motors is not as important to the American economy today as it used to be, but if the Government attack large companies, the entire business sector will suffer from the taking away of money that would otherwise be invested and put to productive use in our economy.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not sure about sneezing, but the new regime of taxation could be described as Labour's very own millennium bug, because no benefits will flow through to companies until 2003. We must press the matter to a Division. The Paymaster General tried to make out that it was our idea to mitigate the effect of the changes in the way tax is collected by changing the tax rate, but that was the Government's idea. It is evident that they have got it wrong and if they intend to do what they say they want to do, by their deeds in the Division shall we know them.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The key debating points on these clauses come under schedule 3, but I want to make one or two points about clause 29.
<P>
The clause is the culmination of a catalogue of incompetence, which began in the July Budget with the Government's decision to abolish dividend tax credits. That was seen as a mean-spirited, surreptitious way for the Government to raise some œ5 billion a year, which they thought they would get away with, with nobody noticing, but people have begun to notice. The abolition of dividend tax credits had to be accompanied by the announced abolition of foreign income dividends. That meant 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is talking about clause 29 or clause 30. I called clause 29.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am sorry, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>

<P>
Clause 29 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I want to make a general point. If there is too much noise during a Division, we shall get ourselves into trouble. I hope that hon. Members will not talk, move around or make noises during a Division. It is quite fundamental.
<H4><center>Clause 31</center></H4>
<H4><center>Abolition of advance corporation tax</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I cannot let the clause pass without saying a word or two about ACT and the way in which it fits into the more general system known as the imputation system of corporation tax, which is now being replaced.
<P>
I am not necessarily a defender of any one system of corporation tax: each has different features and advantages. Like electoral systems, they each have their merits and their disadvantages. No one system achieves everything for all economic participants and agents. Some are seen to be better from the point of view of the taxpayer, the shareholder, the company or the Government. The imputation system that we are replacing was not in place for long since the war there have been a number of different systems but I hope that it is in order to say "Rest in peace" to it. We regret that one of its key features is being abolished: it satisfactorily avoided the double taxation of profits in the hands of companies and shareholders.
<P>
ACT is going, and in a sense the clause buries it once and for all. The criticism that Conservative Members constantly make is about the manner in which it has been done. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who has just had an abortive outing in the debate which failed to take off, will agree that it was reprehensible that the Government used the excuse of a change of corporation tax to increase enormously the tax take from the corporate sector. The instalment payments will bring in an extra œ2 billion a year from larger companies during this Parliament. The abolition of dividend tax credits, which formed a prominent part of last year's Budget, has already caused huge inconvenience and, in many cases, damage to pension funds, local authorities with pension funds and the entire savings culture. At a time when the Government are talking about a need for self-reliance and long-term savings, and indeed for savings themselves as a way of damping down the economy, it is bizarre that they carried out a huge and continuing raid on pension funds through changes enumerated in the present and previous Finance Bills.
<P>
Opposition Members alerted the Government to the damage they were doing. Events have borne out fully our strictures and warnings. For example, the Bank of England has had to take the strain of the anti-inflation drive by ratcheting up interest rates, which has led to a very strong pound.
<P>
It is probably too late for any one clause to reverse the damage. Nevertheless, will the Paymaster General say why the Government have not removed many of the consequential provisions regarding franked and unfranked income? That was a feature of the tax system when I was a practising accountant, as was the distinction between qualifying and non-qualifying distribution.
<P>
Given that we have removed advance corporation tax altogether, I do not understand why the clause still refers to "qualifying distributions" and "franked investment income". From the perspective of the company that pays dividends, that is now a meaningless distinction. Perhaps the Government feel that the distinction is necessary with regard to the shareholder. Nevertheless, it needs further elaboration. Otherwise we shall risk retaining complex legislation for such distinctions, which has always baffled the taxpaying layman, despite having made a substantive overall change.
<P>
If we are genuinely committed to simplification, and to making the Tax Acts at least vaguely comprehensible to taxpayers, this is a missed opportunity. Will the Paymaster General explain why we persist in such complexity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I should now like to start from where I left the debate on the previous clause.
<P>
The clause is the culmination of a catalogue of incompetence that began in July 1997 with the decision to abolish dividend tax credits. That decision required the Government in turn to abolish foreign income dividends because, as they rightly forecast, if the repayment of dividend tax credits to non-taxable funds such as pension funds were abolished, the incentive for UK companies to withhold payment of FIDs to pension funds would be removed.
<P>
Fewer FIDs were paid than was anticipated because pension funds wanted to receive the tax credits in order to reclaim them from the Inland Revenue. That became part and parcel of their expected return on investments. However, given that dividends from April 1999 were not in general to have repayments of the tax credit, there was no difference. The abolition of FIDs was therefore announced.
<P>
However, the Government failed to anticipate the problems that the abolition of FIDs would create for UK companies with interests abroad. As those companies continued to pay dividends from profits earned abroad, they continued to earn surplus, unusable ACT. Profits earned abroad, although taxable in the UK, would be covered almost totally by double tax relief. When the dividend on which ACT is paid is taken from those profits and given to UK shareholders, there is no UK mainstream corporation tax liability against which to offset that ACT. The problem of surplus ACT will continue. The Paymaster General tried to come up with four solutions to the problem created by his Government. But, as he acknowledged, those solutions represented the effective reintroduction of foreign income dividends.
<P>
Another example of the Government's incompetence can be seen in the way in which they underestimated the quantity of FIDs that would be paid once they announced the abolition of dividend tax credits. That is why the Red Book has some amendments to the expected quantity of corporation tax receipts. There we have it a new problem created by the Government.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government announced the introduction of quarterly payments and the abolition of ACT to deal with the problem, but that has given rise to further problems. We have to deal with œ7 billion of surplus ACT which remains in the ownership of companies in this country. That is a valuable asset which no Government not even this one could, with a fell sweep of a pen, simply write off and confiscate. The Government have had to introduce a complex shadow ACT system, which we will debate later. Draft regulations relating to it were published yesterday. The Financial Times reports Robert Turnbull, tax partner at KPMG, as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the regulations contain tougher rules than the present system and some companies might find them too difficult to use."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We will debate that later.
<P>
To conclude, this proposal is the culmination of a catalogue of incompetence. Although the abolition of ACT may be welcome, the inconvenience and cost that accompanies it is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I can do no more than endorse my hon. Friend's comments, save to add that the abolition of ACT, and the credits associated with that regime, will have many damaging effects. That is not a party political point. It has been raised many times by the Institute of Fiscal Studies which publicly stated its opinion when Norman Lamont reduced ACT and the value of the credit associated with it when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and last July, at the time of the first Labour Budget. The Institute of Fiscal Studies adduced several arguments to support the proposition that the changes would cause economic damage. I shall concentrate on those most recently brought to the public's attention.
<P>
The first argument is that the value of companies on the stock market would be lower than it would otherwise have been were it not for the change. The value of companies on the stock market reflects the future post-tax dividend stream. It is obvious that it will be affected in a deleterious fashion by the abolition of ACT.
<P>
The second clear and demonstrable defect in the proposal relates to its impact on pensions. Those employers who are responsible for making contributions or those personal taxpayers who are holders of personal pensions will face a choice. They can do nothing, in which case the benefits received by pension holders when they come to draw the pension will be lower than before the abolition of ACT and the associated credits, or they can increase the contributions to make up the shortfall that will clearly arise as a result of the abolition of ACT. This is nothing more than a tax on employers who operate occupational schemes for their employees and a tax on personal pension holders[Mr. Ruffley]
who decide to make their contributions now rather than doing nothing and suffering lower benefits and lower standards of living.
<P>
There is plenty of scope for us to debate issues relating to pensions, but I do not want to leave this clause without making one final point. The Government generally think of pension funds as insufficiently long-termist. The view somewhere expressed by the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) last year I forget exactly where was that, because of their short-termist nature, pension funds, which will be affected grievously by the abolition of ACT, have a propensity to demand dividend payments from companies rather than retaining profits. In other words, the Labour view is that, as long as ACT operates, there is an in-built incentive for dividends to be paid out. That is what pension funds desire.
<P>
Perversely, abolition will require pension funds to look at the hit they are taking as a result of the abolition of ACT and the associated tax credit a shortfall in income, particularly for those pension funds that have to rely on dividend payments to fund pension payouts so they will put institutional pressure on companies to pay out even bigger dividends in future to make up the shortfall that they are suffering.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Two points arise from what my hon. Friend says. Last year, detailed research showed that companies that paid out healthy dividends corresponded with companies that put a considerable amount of money into research and development. The whole argument promulgated by the Government, that paying out dividends disadvantages R and D, is complete nonsense.
<P>
The second point, of which my hon. Friend is no doubt aware, is that raising capital, by raising equity and paying out dividends, is the most efficient and cheapest way of raising capital to promote investment in R and D and expansion for the corporate sector.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions, even on speeches of hon. Members from one's own side of the Committee, must be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
Of course, my hon. Friend is right in what he says about R and D. His second point about the relevative merits of debt finance and equity finance has been well chewed over, both inside and outside the House. His point about equity finance is well made.
<P>
I conclude by reiterating my point about short-termism. This measure will have the perverse effect of ensuring that institutions, in the shape of pension funds, will, if anything, ask for bigger distributions to make up for the shortfall in their income as a result of the changes to ACT. In that spirit of honest inquiry as to the true effects on the real economy, I seek a response from the Paymaster General. It seems to me that, throughout this debate and throughout the changes announced in last July's Budget and confirmed in the 17 March Budget statement, we have had no adequate answers to the questions I have posed, which turn on the severe disadvantages to many sectors of the economy. I look forward to a detailed response to the questions that my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) and I have raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I can tell the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds that the matter was debated in detail in proceedings on the previous Finance Bill. He is referring to payable tax credits which were removed in the Budget in July last year. There is no point repeating those debates because the matter is over and done with.
<P>
When we come to amendment No. 31 to clause 32, we shall discuss the problem of surplus ACT and I look forward to that. This is the second time that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has raised the matter and he obviously intends to make a major contribution, which I look forward to. The earth trembles at the prospect of his speech.
<P>
I welcome the acceptance of the right hon. Member for Wells for our changes. He has behind him a distinguished career as a chartered accountant and it is a sobering thought that he was qualifying when ACT was introduced. It is a question of RIP.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked me two specific questions, which I shall do my best to answer. The first concerned the distinction between franked and unfranked income. That distinction must remain as it is for companies paying tax on franked investment income that has already been taxed as profits of another company. There would be double taxation if we removed the distinction at this stage.
<P>
Turning to qualifying and non-qualifying distributions, the Finance Bill is already complicated. When I respond to some of the substantive points raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) I shall refer to the matter. The distinction will cease to be relevant when ACT has been dispensed with, which the hon. Gentleman is in favour of. It would not be relevant or for the convenience of the Committee if I went into more detail now, but I shall be happy to do so if the hon. Gentleman has a lingering interest in the matter.
<P>
Perhaps I may take the opportunity of trying to put the mind of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton at rest. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds referred to payable tax credits on dividends and ACT there is always an inter-relationship between the two but there may have been a misunderstanding. In the previous Budget in July last year we were able to split the issue of FIDs and surplus ACT. One reason for doing that was the sheer size of what the July Budget would otherwise have been. The Opposition complain regularly about the length of time taken to make draft regulation available, but they must realise the extraordinary burden of work that is imposed on the Inland Revenue. One of the great faults of all Governments and the danger for incoming Governments in particular is the temptation to attempt too much at one time, particularly when so much of the work, as in our case, has been done in Opposition. If we had not split the matter in two, we would have so overburdened the system that we would have caused a long period of indigestion. The issue slotted naturally into two natural, logical, progressive arrangements and because we had planned that, including the workload and the burden on the Revenue 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment. How does the hon. Gentleman think that it was possible for us to give our assurances we did not give them lightly to Billiton if we did not have in mind exactly what we intended to do? There were four options and when we properly, openly and fully consulted in November, the front runner was already clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Paymaster General was being slightly disingenuous when he said that reforms to the corporation tax system were planned before July. On Report, he came to the House with four ways to deal with the unanticipated problem that the Government had created in FIDs. That proves that the reforms were not planned. The press said at the time that the Government had committed a major error and that it was not clear how they would get out of it. To say that the reforms were planned before July is disingenuous, and I hope that the Paymaster General will withdraw his comments.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman appears to want to persist in that line of thinking but, if he is so obsessed with trying to establish that the Government made a mistake or had not got a plan, there is nothing that I can do to disabuse him. I have tried awfully hard to do so many times in the House and during our consideration of the previous Finance Bill. I assure him that the matter is an obsession on his part. However, he cannot oppose a solution that we have not come up with.
<P>
A similar situation arose with individual savings accounts which I shall not discuss in detail, Mrs. Dunwoody. We went out and consulted and the Opposition hated the result because we came up with the right answer. In this case, too, we have the right answer we have a totally revamped system of corporation tax. Many Opposition Members, who are not present in Committee, have come up to me and said, "We should have done that, you know. What did we do in 18 years? What did we do in our last four years in government under the previous Chancellor?"
<P>
A very distinguished City figure who worked in the Department for three or four years as an adviser came into my office to see me and said of the corporation reform package, "Gosh, I've been trying to get that done for three years, you know, but we couldn't get anyone to take an interest in it." Nowadays, he regularly contributes to debates, and he usually attempts to support the Opposition's position, which is increasingly difficult to do, but there we are.
<P>
I believe that the Opposition generally support the measures, and I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This short debate has again shown that the change in the type and structure of corporation tax was really driven by the search for additional revenue. That is the Government's underlying motive and I am sure that an instruction to that effect was given to junior Ministers and the Inland Revenue. They were told last July to find a way to raise more money, and they carried out this raid of œ5 billion a year on pension funds. That damage will stay with us for a very long time.
<P>
The present payments-on-account system is also driven by the search for additional taxation. The victims in all this have been clarity and simplicity much confusion has surrounded that change in last year's Finance Bill and in this Bill.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was right: we all remember the FIDs fiasco that is the only word to describe it. Last July, the Government published a wholly unworkable clause governing FIDs. Any first-year accountancy student could have told them that the system was unworkable. Many companies with substantial foreign earnings instantly got on to the Treasury and said that unless the proposal was withdrawn or amended, they were off. They were not going to sit around being ignored while their interests were trampled on. Rather than withdraw the clause in the Finance Bill that would have been too mcuh of a loss of face the Government agreed to make the provision inoperative. Unbelievably, we enacted a clause that the Government admitted was unworkable. Finally, the matter was sorted out.
<P>
What lay behind my questions to the Paymaster General and I am grateful to him for the partial way in which he answered them was a genuine attempt to clear away what I might call the detritus that surrounds the Government's proposed changes in corporation tax. In my view, the distinctions between franked and unfranked income and between qualifying and non-qualifying distributions fall into that category. I hope that the Paymaster General will clarify the matter, although I appreciate that this may not be the right amount to do so.
<P>
The search for revenue the breathless pursuit of a higher effective rate of corporation tax has pushed into the background the accompanying search for a simpler tax system that more people can understand. Certainly in the last Parliament we had a dual approach. We launched an initiative to rewrite the tax statutes in plain English, and I should like to know what has happened to that. Secondly, we realised that that would not succeed unless the underlying tax structures were made simpler.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying hard to relate the hon. Gentleman's remarks to the clause. I hope that we shall not get on to too many different aspects. We are talking specifically about clause 31.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I understand your concern, Mrs. Dunwoody, but the clause is directly relevant to what I was saying. The Government have missed an opportunity in this clause, or in another one, to tear away some of the associated language, and indeed some of the provisions in the Finance Acts, which are no longer relevant because of the demise of ACT and, more generally, the imputation tax system. Our initiative is now receiving a lower priority in the Treasury and the Inland Revenue, which is regrettable. Although we never achieved it completely in the last Parliament, we always had it in our mind that, in a[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]
healthy democracy, people should understand the taxes that they are paying, why they are paying them and how they are being spent. That is impossible if no one can understand the basis of taxation or the Tax Acts. This 400-page Bill does nothing to make it more transparent.
<P>
I think that I detected an understanding of that in the Paymaster General's remarks and perhaps half a commitment to return to the issues that I raised, specifically on franked income and qualifying distributions. We have no intention of voting against the clause, but doubtless we shall return to the subject about which I have spoken, perhaps elsewhere in the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 31 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Advance corporation tax</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 158, line 7, leave out "be amended as follows", and insert "cease to have effect".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 26, in page 158, line 9, leave out paragraphs (2) to (6).
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I should just check that we are on schedule 3.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are. Normally when I announce schedule 3 I actually mean schedule 3. There is always room for doubt, but not usually when I am in the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for that clarification, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
The amendments seek to amend paragraph 23 of schedule 3. Amendment No. 25 adds to the end of sub-paragraph (1) the words "cease to have effect". In other words, it seeks to repeal section 419 of the Taxes Act 1988. Amendment No. 26 therefore repeals sub-paragraphs (2) to (6), which suggest that the Inland Revenue wishes to keep the basis of section 419 in place, although clause 31 abolishes ACT.
<P>
The amendment reflects the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells during the debate on clause 31. It is astonishing that, when ACT was abolished, the whole panoply of legislative phrases, terms of art and taxation issues was not abolished with it. It goes to show that it is not true that the Government had planned the reform of the corporation tax system in July. Had they done so, they would not have left in place so many oddities from the previous imputation system: they would have got rid of those as well as replaced the whole system with a coherent, unified system of corporation tax and the taxation of dividend income for individuals. We are left with the archaic system of foreign income dividends; we are left with the obscure position that dividend income is charged at a different rate from earned income. That is done to prevent such individuals from being taxed twice on their dividend income, first, within the company and, secondly, when they receive it. That is a consequence of abolishing the imputation system. The imputation system has, effectively, been only partially abolished, which makes the tax code infinitely more complicated than before.
<P>
My amendment and those of my hon. Friends would lead to a major simplification of the tax system. It would repeal pages 1,831 to 1,834 of the Butterworth's tax code. It would also remove five sub-sections of the Finance Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> There may be some confusion about the amendment. I understood the amendment to propose the insertion of the words, "come to have effect" not "cease to have effect". Will the hon. Gentleman clarify that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If the Paymaster General were to obtain a copy of the latest amendment paper, he would find that it says "cease to have effect". There was an error in the Public Bill Office when the amendment was tabled.
<P>
The amendment would repeal section 419, which relates to loans to participators. Under that section, if a closely held company which is basically a family-run company or a company owned and run by the same people, five or fewer of whom are participators lent money to its participators or shareholders, it would have to account to the Inland Revenue for ACT on that loan, as though it were a dividend. When the loan was repaid to the company, the Inland Revenue would repay the ACT to the shareholder or participator. The reason for that was to avoid dividend substitution the avoidance method whereby instead of a shareholder receiving a dividend from the company, on which the company would pay ACT, the company would lend money to the shareholder, thereby avoiding ACT. Section 419 was introduced to remove that tax avoidance mechanism.
<P>
Despite the Government's intention to abolish ACT, paragraph 23 of schedule 3 says that section 419 will be replaced with a requirement that, where a close company makes a loan to a participator, it must pay to the Inland Revenue an amount equal to 25 per cent. In other words, the Government are trying to maintain the machinery of the section. I believe that that approach is wrong, and that they should abolish section 419, together with advance corporation tax. The Inland Revenue has no doubt told the Paymaster General and other Treasury Ministers that the mechanism must be kept in place because, otherwise, higher rate taxpayers will get away without paying any tax and money will be siphoned out of closely held companies into the hands of higher rate taxpayers. That is not the case; there are plenty of other mechanisms that the Inland Revenue can use to avoid cash payments being construed as income, and it is not necessary to maintain pages and pages of complex legislation.
<P>
The legislation is not only complex but burdensome. In some instances, companies do not even realise that they have become close, as the close company legislation is phenomenally complicated. Companies can suddenly find that they have become closed simply as a result of changing their credit or shareholding arrangements. Such companies then have to worry about not having accounted to the Inland revenue for ACT on loans that they may have made to shareholders or other participators in the company.
<P>
I urge the Paymaster General to listen to the points made in this debate rather than to the advice of the Inland Revenue, which always errs on the side of extra regulation and extra legislation on tax avoidance. Any avoidance arising from the abolition of section 419 could be tackled by other methods.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made a good point, but I do not think that the two are linked. Only in the sense that it was linked to ACT at 25 per cent. does the abolition of ACT raise, in principle, the question whether a charge of this kind should be made where a close company makes a loan to one of its participators. Whether that should be the case is a point of principle. If we feel that it is a necessary anti-avoidance provision, arrangements must be made for it to continue once ACT has been abolished. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was straightforward and said that he did not think that it was necessary. On balance, I think that the Inland Revenue is right that it is necessary. Otherwise, it leads to an unfair advantage for a participant who takes a totally interest free loan in those circumstances, which we do not want to encourage. The instances of malpractice and misbehaviour will be well known to a distinguished member of the profession such as the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Secondly, what the Revenue has done is fair because the charge to the company is relieved as soon as the charge crystallises on the borrower not when it is repaid and the company is repaid the 25 per cent. charge. That is necessary in principle. It is fair that we have left the level the same, and we are making provision for repayment when the charge crystallises on the borrower.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> This is a genuine question. What does "crystallise on the borrower" mean?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> When he becomes liable to repay it. When the debt crystallises is when one becomes immediately liable for its repayment. The debt does not have to be paid until it crystallises in that sense. A notification of repayment is issued. There can be an interlude between repayment by the borrower becoming effective and repayment to the company. If one considers past history, that is necessary. It is also fair because of the arrangements for its repayment and because we are not increasing the 25 per cent. charge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I did not understand the point about crystallising on the borrower either. If what the Paymaster General says is true, the avoidance could be continued because the company could say, "We are sorry, the money is due because it has crystallised. Therefore, the borrower will receive the ACT from the Inland Revenue." Perhaps the Paymaster General could take advice from his officials and clarify the matter. People would like to know precisely why the Inland Revenue want to retain this measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The reason is clear; it is an anti-avoidance measure. I shall read from my brief on crystallisation, which should make the matter clear. We propose to extend the circumstances when relief for the tax charge may be given to a company. From 6 April 1999, relief will be due when the loan or advance is written off, then it crystallises the debt, as well as when it is repaid. When this happens, the borrower is treated as having received income equivalent to the loan and a tax charge arises on him. That is when the 25 per cent. must be repaid.
<P>
This is a narrow point and I urge the Committee to resist the amendment if it is pressed to a vote.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton persisting with this amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I should like to make one comment, Mrs. Dunwoody. The provision was an anti-avoidance measure to prevent companies from avoiding paying advance corporation tax. Now that advance corporation tax has been abolished, it would make sense to repeal this provision. This is an opportunity lost by the Government to remove a plethora of laws from the tax code, but in view of the technical nature of the amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 163, line 28, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Section 30 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1997 <P>
43A.Paragraph (b) of subsection 5 of section 30 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1997 (which prospectively amends section 231(3) of the Taxes Act 1988) shall not have effect."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important amendment. It would undo some of the damage done by the previous Finance Act to many hundreds of thousands of people in this country who have a small portfolio of shares and who will not be able to reclaim tax credits on those holdings because of the July Budget.
<P>
The amendment would repeal section 30 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1997. That Act prevented non-taxpayers from reclaiming the dividend tax credit. The measure was a by-product of the smash-and-grab raid that the Labour Government undertook on pension funds. Their callous approach was oblivious to the effect that it would have on non-taxpayers outside the pension fund industry, as well as to the damage that would be done to people's pension funds. The Government ignored the fact that it would have a damaging effect on other non-taxpayers.
<P>
The Government engineered the smash-and-grab raid on pension funds by saying that any non-taxpayer, pension funds, individual or whatever would not be able to reclaim tax credits from April 1999 onwards. Non-taxpayers used to be able to write off to the Revenue and reclaim an amount equal to about a fifth of the level of the dividend that they received. In 1995-96, 300,000 people over 65 reclaimed œ75 a year each. That may not sound an enormous sum of money to people in the Committee, but it sounds a lot to me [Interruption.] I am not as wealthy as some members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The figure of œ75 is an average. Many pensioners will be hit to the tune of several hundred pounds, which is an even greater amount than my hon. Friend suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point which I was going to deal with shortly. It is an average figure. Many people received less than the œ75 a year refund from their tax credit, and many received more.
<P>
A non-taxpaying individual will, in general, be earning less than œ5,400 as a pensioner over 65, and less than about œ4,000 if he or she is below 65. The burden of bills for food, heating, lighting and council tax all the regular bills that people have to pay must be taken into account. The disposable income of a non-taxpaying person is very small, and œ75 a year represents a high proportion of it.
<P>
There is increasing concern about what has happened. Age Concern has received a number of letters from non-taxpaying pensioners and, indeed, non-taxpaying people who have not reached pensionable age, but who are increasingly reliant on their savings income. The measure was introduced in last July's Budget. It was pushed through quickly the Budget was on 2 July; Royal Assent was received on 31 July. Interested groups such as Age Concern did not have time to register what impact the Budget woud have on individuals.
<P>
Age Concern said that older
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Pensioners who will not have had the same opportunity to contribute to SERPs on private pensions ... are likely to be more dependent on their pension and their savings."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is enormous concern that those people are being hard done by. I and, I am sure, other members of the Committee have received letters from constituents and others who are reliant on their savings. I received a letter this morning from someone in Rock near Kidderminster who says that although the dividends are small, they are an important part of that family's way of life. That person is incensed by the change to the repayment of dividend tax credits.
<P>
The Inland Revenue referred to last July's decision not to allow the repayment of tax credits to individuals as anomalous. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It would have been anomalous to allow individuals to continue to claim payment of tax credits when such credits are being removed from all other investors."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a callous way of describing the problem created by the Government for many low-paid people.
<P>
The decision is anomalous in another way. Tax-paying individuals in receipt of dividends will receive a tax credit. Basic-rate or lower-rate taxpayers will not pay tax on dividends, because they will be entitled to the benefit of the tax credit through the changes in the rates to which I referred earlier. Higher-rate taxpayers will be taxed only on the difference between the basic rate and the higher rate of tax, because they will also benefit from the tax credit. Yet those with the lowest incomes are the anomaly: they are the people who are being forced to pay higher rates of tax on their dividend income.
<P>
Age Concern has highlighted a number of case studies, which demonstrate the hardship suffered as a result of the Government's measure. For example, a blind woman in her 90s, whose only income is from her state pension and investment income, will lose approximately œ700 a year; a woman aged 81 has investment income from shares bought in 1957, which now produce a tax credit of œ170; a man in his 80s, whose shareholding is primarily made up of building society windfall shares and privatisation issues, will lose about œ200 a year; a woman aged 65, who receives the average tax credit repayment of œ75 a year on her building society windfall shares will lose the equivalent of more than one week's pension, which equates to a 3 per cent. tax increase. Therefore, there are many examples of people who are suffering directly as a result of the measure. By accepting the amendment, the Government have a second chance to remedy that.
<P>
We were told last July that ISAs were the answer to such people's problems that they should put their shares into an ISA and receive all the tax credits to which they were no longer entitled. But that is nonsense. No respectable financial adviser would advise a non-taxpayer or basic-rate taxpayer to hold equities through an ISA. The benefits of an ISA are capital gains tax relief and the 10 per cent. tax credit that the ISA will receive. No, or very few, basic-rate taxpayers or non-taxpayers will need that relief, because they are unlikely to generate gains in excess of their annual exemption anyway; and the 10 per cent. tax credit is likely to be more than eaten up by the charges.
<P>
Therefore, the Government should accept the amendment. People are beginning to notice what is happening. Letters are beginning to trickle in, as people realised that, from 1999, they will no longer be able to write to the Inland Revenue to reclaim the tax credit on their dividends.
<P>
I put this point to the Paymaster General from a political point of view. He should consider what will happen in April 1999: people who are not so familiar with the business pages of the newspapers and do not keep up to date with debates in the Committee and the House will write to the Inland Revenue, expecting their usual cheque of œ75 or œ200 for the year, and will receive a letter from the Inland Revenue saying, "I'm sorry, the law was changed in 1997, which you should have been aware of. You are not entitled to receive the œ75 or œ200 that you were relying on". One can imagine the hostility and the uproar when people realise what has happened.
<P>
One of the disadvantages of the Government's highly successful spinning is that sometimes bad news does not filter out through the media. They have manipulated the media so much that they seem to be able to get away, for the moment, with some appalling tax legislation. But, ultimately, that tax legislation will have an effect on ordinary people's lives, and at that stage, two years down the line from when the measure was introduced, people will revolt, and the letters that are now a trickle will become a torrent. I warn the Government that Age Concern and other groups will not sit quiet when the people whom they represent are suffering; nor will Conservative Members. I urge the Government, therefore, to adopt the amendment and to help the lowest paid.
<P>
<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): I support the amendment and I congratulate the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on tabling it, because it attracts wide support. I have been approached on the amendment not just by Age Concern but
