<H4><center>Clause 53</center></H4>
<H4><center>Complaints--informal resolution</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland </B>(Mr. Tony Worthington): May I just confirm that I shall write to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) in the terms that I outlined this morning?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I am most grateful and look forward to hearing from the Under-Secretary in the next few days.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 53 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 54</center></H4>
<H4><center>Complaints--formal investigation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 27, line 19, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`may as he thinks fit'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert `shall'.
<P>
This too is a drafting amendment. Since only two alternatives are given in the relevant subsection, the word ``shall'' strikes me as more appropriate than ``may''. The ombudsman would not be required to undertake any course besides those two alternatives. Either he would do as provided for in subsection (3)(a) and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``formally investigate the complaint in accordance with section 56'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or he would, under subsection (3)(b),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``refer the complaint to the Chief Constable for formal investigation by a police officer in accordance with section 57.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should be interested to hear the Minister's defence of the present wording of the clause.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office </B>(Mr. Adam Ingram): That was a very short speech. I do not know whether this is a probing amendment, but I do not think that we shall need a long debate. The amendment would place an extra requirement on the ombudsman to investigate a complaint in cases where informal resolution was not possible. That would be additional to the requirement to investigate serious complaints and those other matters, such as public interest cases, referred to under clause 55.
<P>
I understand the reasons for the amendment, but it goes against the underlying principle of allowing the ombudsman power and flexibility to deal with cases as he or she sees fit. The amendment would, by removing discretion, require the ombudsman still to conduct a formal investigation even after determining, on preliminary investigation, that there was no substance to an allegation. In addition, the amendment would require the ombudsman to conduct a series of formal investigations of repeated and possibly vexatious complaints by an individual on one issue.
<P>
Clause 54(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In the case of any other complaint, the Ombudsman may as he thinks fit--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) formally investigate the complaint in accordance with section 56; or
<P>
(b) refer the complaint to the Chief Constable for formal investigation by a police officer in accordance with section 57.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That allows the ombudsman to use his discretion. He need not refer the cases for the reasons set out. The use of the word ``shall'' would automatically apply the logic of referral to such cases as I have described. It would remove the ombudsman's discretion and flexibility--which both the Government and, I am sure, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, think he should retain. On those grounds, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That was an interesting response from the Minister. He was in Committee for only part of the debate this morning so he may have missed some salient points, one of which was about the origin of the ombudsman's power to discontinue cases. The Minister is now saying that that discontinuance derives from here.
<P>
I had thought that there were only two alternatives under clause 54: either the ombudsman says that the complaint is serious and deals with it accordingly under clause 56; or, in the case of ``any other complaint'', as stated in subsection (3), he adopts one course or the other. However, the fact that the ombudsman may act ``as he thinks fit'' means that he has the option of formal investigstion under paragraph (a); of referring to the Chief Constable under pargraph (b); and, it now seems, a third option of discontinuing a case on the grounds that the complaints are vexatious, malicious or spurious.
<P>
If that is the case, it is helpful. Flexibility is important, but I am unsure whether the wording includes the third possibility for the ombudsman. If the Minister is giving me a categoric assurance that that is the case, it is a good point to have cleared up, but it was not so clear in this morning's deabte. We were unsure about the grounds on which the ombudsman could terminate cases. Clause 64 was cited as an example with reference to guidelines for regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right that I was not present for the final part of our earlier sitting. He is now saying that he wants the Bill to include some extra strategy for the ombudsman, but his amendment would not achieve that; it would achieve the opposite, by closing it off. In what ways will the amendment provide the extra strategy that he wants?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister makes a valid point. My interpretation of the orginal words--before I tabled the amendment--was that the ombudsman had only two options. It seemed that ``shall'' clarified the situation by applying either to one option or the other. But the Minister, by stressing that the ombudsman may act ``as he thinks fit'', is giving him other options--but they are not specified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> He does not have to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I sometimes wish I were a lawyer. Would it not be clearer to refer to (a), (b) or (c), the last specifying that the ombudsman does not proceed with the case? That seems to be what the Minister is saying, but I did not originally interpret the provision that way--hence my emphasis on ``shall''. I am grateful for the clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not answered my question. If an extra strategy for the ombudsman is so important, what amendments has he tabled to achieve it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have not yet tabled amendments to deal specifically with that, but there is plenty of time. In the two previous clause stand part debates we had a long discussion about the ombudsman's role. The Under-Secretary said that he would write to us on some of the important issues that we raised. If the letter clarifies them, fine; we need not return to them on Report. But if not, we reserve the right to table amendments accordingly.
<P>
The amendment was an attempt to strengthen the wording but I confess that I interpreted the aims of the Bill. I happily accept that in addition to options (a) and (b) the possibility of a third option--for the ombudsman to do neither--lies behind the amendment. If he does neither, what does he do? The sensible thing would be to write to complain, saying ``We've been through various stages and I do not think that there is a basis for this complaint.'' But the Bill does not allow for that. Where else is it written that he will reach a conclusion, and terminate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will write to members of the Committee on the basis of this morning's discussions. This matter will be dealt with, and the details spelt out eventually in regulations under clause 64. I hope that the letter will help the hon. Gentleman to understand what we aim to achieve with the various decision-making tiers given to the ombudsman, and the way in which the powers vested in him would be used under regulations. This will be clarified in regulations. We are also examining ways of specifying the powers to the satisfaction not only of members of the Committee but of those who will have to live with the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is all very well, but the regulations will not appear until the Bill becomes an Act of Parliament, by which time it will be too late to do much about it in Committee or on the Floor of the House. If it is done by statutory instrument, Order in Council and Northern Ireland legislation, we shall have a debate, but we shall not be able to make changes. The appropriate time to flag up our concerns is now. Perhaps when we reach clause 64 we shall have a more in-depth debate about the practicalities of achieving the Government's aim.
<P>
The provision is specific in stating that the ombudsman must do certain things in two instances. The first is clear-cut, where he determines a complaint to be serious: he investigates it formally, in accordance with clause 56. In the second, with other types of complaint, he does one of two things. The Minister says that he can do a third. For clarification, perhaps it would be useful to include the third choice under a subparagraph (c). My amendment does not suggest that, but I am happy to accept that that is what the Bill seeks--although it is not written in terms that would help people those who read it.
<P>
I am happy to withdraw the amendment, and I look forward to our discussions on clause 64. My purpose was simply to tidy up the meaning that I interpreted in the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon </B>(Newry and Armagh): I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 27, line 22, at beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`providing the complainant gives his consent,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The essence of the amendment is that it would apply a similar procedure to an increasingly grey area with complaints that are dealt with informally as well as those that clause 50 describes as serious. The question of definition was raised at our previous sitting, when many members of the Committee, including me, said that difficulties could arise because of a lack of definition following a serious incident or the results of one. Because there is no absolute position within the definition, every attempt should be made to ensure that the complainant has the same options open to him as he would have if it were a serious complaint or if it were one that was going to be resolved informally.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Why does a complainant in this middle grouping, which would probably constitute the greatest number of complaints at any given time, not have the same option as a complainant in a lesser case? I know that that is not the accurate term. Less serious cases, for want of a better phrase, cannot be dealt with informally unless the complainant gives consent. They must reside with the ombudsman to investigate and adjudicate.
<P>
In absolute terms it is decided that the ombudsman will refer this broader mass of cases which stop short of being determined as serious and are not capable of being resolved informally. I agree that that is in accord with the ombudsman's control of the process. But why should someone in those circumstances not have the same right to give consent as the person in the informal resolution category? What is the reason for that? Does it make sense? If one argued, as doubtless that Minister will, that this retains the ombudsman's independence and leaves him in control of the procedure, surely the clause that required the complaint to be dealt with informally restricts his role.
<P>
This goes to the heart of some of the problems that we shall be dealing with in other parts of the Bill. I believe that the wishes of the complainant should be of distinct importance here. If that person has absolute confidence in the system of policing and says that he would like it to be investigated by the Chief Constable and a policeman in accordance with clause 57, there is no problem. That is not compromised by the right of another person who, for whatever reason, good or bad, does not share that confidence to say, ``No, I won't give my consent; I would like it to be processed in the other way.''
<P>
I should like to hear the arguments against this because it impinges upon some of the later amendments. If the Bill ensured that every complaint was investigated by the ombudsman or his agent, my argument would still be valid although perhaps not so strong. But that is not the case. I know that I am straying from the amendment, but one of the schedules impinges on the ombudsman's independence and makes imperative what he should do and how he should do it. If that schedule did not exist, the import of my argument would lessen, but it is there and I ask the Minister to clarify the matter.
<P>
One startling factor in Dr. Hayes' report that is seldom referred to is the prediction that the cost of processing police complaints would fall under the proposed system from &#163;7 million to &#163;2 million, give or take a few pounds. It would be the first time in my life that the cost of something dropped so radically without reason. Are the necessary resources hidden in the proposal? If, in effect, the ombudsman was constrained, and he lost that &#163;5 million before he started, the only way that he could operate would be by having complaints investigated by the Chief Constable and an officer of the RUC, under this proposal.
<P>
Perhaps it is a scepticism that develops with age, but I am beginning to wonder how the cost involved will fall from &#163;7 million to &#163;2 million. The sceptic could see the matter as a means of protecting the budget--I hope that the Minister will take that point seriously. The more that is moved to the Chief Constable, his investigators and their procedures, the less is spent from the ombudsman's budget. The Minister will probably tell me that that is far too cynical, but we must know how the &#163;5 million saving will be made.
<P>
The amendment is no more an infringement of the requirements than the clause, which states that a complaint is not suitable for informal resolution unless the complainant gives the ombudsman his consent. Why not, therefore, accept the amendment?
<P>
The difficult element is what will develop later: the police investigating the police, politicians investigating politicians, or housewives investigating housewives. It is not just a policing matter; and important principle could, finally and for ever, have been written into the Bill. The Minister could have said, ``Look, we know this has been a problem over the years and now is the time to solve it in legislation.'' If that were the case, and the ombudsman could, if he wished, appoint members of the police to investigate complaints, it would be a different scenario. But is is not, by definition, because the schedule states that the ombudsman ``shall'' appoint members of the RUC for that purpose.
<P>
The citizen should have the right to say, ``Hold on a minute. This is a new dispensation, a new ball game, a new ombudsman and a new process. I do not give my consent for my case to be investigated in the old way, I want it to be investigated in the new way.'' I look forward to the Minister's explanation. As a canny Scotsman, he will not fail, I am sure, to explain how he will save &#163;5 million.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Let me try to explain to the hon. Gentleman and to the Committee what the Government are trying to achieve. Informal resolution, at any level, is a lesser form of investigation; that is why there is a need for consent. It is not a full-blown investigation and, clearly, the consent of the complainant is required under those circumstances. That individual is accepting something less than he might receive under another form of investigation, and which falls short of the serious complaint procedure that might be carried out. That is a cogent reason for consent to be given for informal resolution of complaints.
<P>
The clause deals with the formal investigation of complaints. It takes full account of the independence of the ombudsman, who should be seen as an independent authority at all times. That is consistent with Dr. Hayes's recommendations. The ombudsman should be able to make judgments about how, where and when investigations should take place. We are discussing a relatively serious level of complaint and the ombudsman has to give the best judgment about the quality of the investigation that can be delivered.
<P>
The judgments cannot be based only on the consent of the complainant. If that were the case, a complainant might believe that his complaint was serious--not serious as defined in the legislation, but serious in the mind of the complainant--and might not give consent to the ombudsman, or might say nothing. The ombudsman might decide that he needed to get consent in order to refer the case, but the complainant might say nothing. That complaint might well not be taken further. The seeking of consent would, therefore, not be desirable under those circumstances. These matters rely on the ombudsman's independence and on his flexibility in determining the flow of complaints.
<P>
It is important that there should be safeguards that give absolute security to complainants, to deal with any suspicions that they--or the wider community--might have about the way in which an investigation was being carried out. There are two safeguards. The first is that the ombudsman can, at any time, take back control of the investigation if he is not satisfied that the complaint is being properly addressed. The second safeguard is that, in any event, the report is returned to the ombudsman for consideration and evaluation.
<P>
The Government will have to establish a well defined audit trail to ensure that every complaint that is received is appropriately dealt with when it passes out of the ombudsman's hands. That will ensure that the complaint is being considered; other assessments will have to be made about the quality of the judgments on the complaint, depending on the basis on which such judgments are delivered.
<P>
I hope that that explanation will help the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh. He is looking quizzical; perhaps he would like further elaboration of the matter.
<P>
The ombudsman must have flexibility. He must have the capacity to move a complaint forward when it cannot be dealt with through informal resolution. Such complaints must remain under the control and direction of the ombudsman and not rest solely with the complainant. There is a wider public interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): My hon. Friend referred to clause 54(3)(b). However, we can look forward to clause 57(4), which says that the ombudsman can decide to keep control of the investigation. Clause 57(6) explicitly refers to the inquiry being conducted by a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``member of a police force in Great Britain''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That runs contrary to the suggestion of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh that investigations would always be carried out by the RUC.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> My hon. Friend's useful intervention relates to the way in which complaints are dealt with. In dealing with formal complaints, not informal ones, it is always better that the ombudsman should have control. Where an outside force is called in, that can happen and it is likely to happen. That adds another layer of confidence to the process. My hon. Friend's intervention was most helpful.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh suggested that the clause contained a hidden agenda and was all about resources. He suggested that the clause is about machinery by which we can avoid dealing with cases, and is an attempt to avoid giving the ombudsman adequate resources.
<P>
I can assure the Committee that we have examined the sums to be allocated. The way in which the Northern Ireland Office has previously worked on public confidence issues suggests that if there were a major breakdown in service delivery--and the ombudsman service relates critically to confidence in the RUC--resources would be made available. However, I cannot give a blank cheque; if commitments became open-ended, we would have to consider other efficiencies and how best to deliver the service. However, past evidence has been that we have found the means to act where public confidence is concerned.
<P>
There is no hidden agenda and no attempt to avoid meeting the full costs by transferring cases somewhere else. The ombudsman will be independent and will not be under the direct control of the Secretary of State. He or she will make a judgment based on the merits of the complaint.
<P>
If direction of the complaint were left to the consent of the complainant, the ombudsman might, by exercising judgment based on knowledge of past complaints, be able to see a quick route to a resolution that would satisfy the complainant, but still have to put the complaint at the end of a very long queue if the complainant determined that the case had to be handled in a particular way.
<P>
Hon. Members will be aware that in other services--such as the health service--that offer ombudsman investigations, people may wait a long time for a response because of the volume of complaints. We hope to create a mechanism by which the ombudsman can find the best resolution to a formal complaint. That matters not just to the complainant but to the whole community's confidence in the system. The ombudsman should not be dictated to by the complainant. There is a wider community interest.
<P>
I hope that that explains the matter. I see that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh is shaking his head so we are in for a long debate. I have been as clear and precise as I can--in Committee, it is ever thus--but I see that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire wants to participate in the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> As ever, I am trying to help the Minister. In subsection (3)(b) the amendment seeks to insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``providing the complainant gives his consent''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we trace the informal complaint from inception we find that it has come from clause 53 where the ombudsman has decided that it goes to one of the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Let us say that in this example it is the Chief Constable. Clause 53(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where a complaint is referred under subsection (3), the appropriate disciplinary authority shall seek to resolve it informally and may appoint a member of the police force to do so on behalf of the authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chief Constable appoints one of his own officers to investigate the complaint. The complainant has had to give his consent under subsection (2). If that case has not been resolved informally under the terms of clause 53(6), it comes back to the ombudsman and that is referred to in clause 54(1)(b). In this case the ombudsman sends it to the Chief Constable; the Chief Constable gets one of his officers to look into it and if it is not resolved it goes back to the ombudsman. The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh asked why the ombudsman can decided to send it back to the Chief Constable--where it has already been.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood me. I am not talking about cases that can be resolved informally but about cases that are less serious and on which there is no right of consent by the complainant. There is a right of consent in cases that are dealt with informally. If it is right in one instance, why is it not right in the other? That is the thrust of my argument. It does not relate to any transfer involving the informality and the role of the ombudsman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I apologise if I misinterpreted the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's amendment. Since it goes in line 22 after paragraph (b) it relates to subsection (3), which concerns other complaints under clause 53(6). I do not know what those others are but they are not serious complaints. If the hon. Gentleman wanted his amendment to apply only to serious complaints I think it should go before subsection (2).
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> My point is not relevant to what are termed the serious complaints. It applies to those that will be resolved informally. I am asking that it be applied specifically in relation to clause 54(3)(b) where that element of consent exists. I am simply asking for the complainant to have the option of giving his consent in that broad body of cases where the ombudsman decides whether to investigate it or to hand it over to the police to investigate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes his position clearer. Certainly other complaints in subsection (3) include those that have been referred back after passing through the informal process and not being resolved. I can see what the hon. Gentleman is getting at. He wants the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``providing the complainant gives his consent''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to apply both to those that have already been to the Chief Constable and to any others before they return to the Chief Constable or that are being passed to the Chief Constable for the first time. He has made a valid point.
<P>
Let us concentrate on complainants who have already been through the informal resolution stage: they have already been to the Chief Constable; they have already had their complaint investigated by an officer appointed by the Chief Constable. Under clause 53(6), the Chief Constable decides that he cannot resolve the matter and he hands it back to the ombudsman. Why should the compaint be referred back to the Chief Constable again under clause 54 (3) (b)? That makes no sense unless the consent of the individual is assumed.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I listened to the Minister with interest but gained the feeling that his heart was not in it. He has not addressed the points at issue. His argument relies on the independence of the ombudsman to decide. I said in my initial statement that there may be circumstances in which no constraints are placed on the ombudsman, but the provision makes the decision for the ombudsman. What he shall do is decided for him.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) made a good point about the introduction of a police officer from other forces, but we are not talking about that. Schedule 3 (5) (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Ombudsman and the Chief Constable shall enter into arrangements for members of the police force to be engaged for a period of temporary service with the Ombudsman.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not a request to Yorkshire police for an investigator; nor is it an exercise of the ombudsman's power to acquire a specialist to deal with a case. It is a requirement that tells the ombudsman whom he may or may not use. That is why this small amendment is so important.
<P>
As we discussed this morning, the reason why many cases do not progress--I know from my long experience--is not because they are spurious, vexatious or malicious. It is because they come up against the problem that the complaint is being investigated by the organisation against which the complaints have been directed. That is especially true for younger people.
<P>
However meritorious the ombudsman, the same problem will arise. I know from personal experience through the years that when they reach that point in the investigation, many valid cases will drop--for a reason connected with the complainant's health. It has happened to many young people and it will be a case of, ``Don't worry, Jack, we will see you some night down the road, somewhere between Cullyhanna and Forkhill''. That may not be a diary arrangement, but if someone is young and of a certain class in Northern Ireland, it is a potent means of conveying the message that it may not be in someone's best interest to have the police investigating a complaint.
<P>
Many more complaints could cross that threshold if the complainant had the right, in effect, to say to the ombudsman, ``Look, I have had my problems with the police. I should prefer you to deal with this complaint.'' Is there nothing valid in that approach? Is there nothing valid about Dr. Haye's comment in his report that, probably, in the initial stages, the ombudsman, if worth his salt, would ensure that almost all the relevant cases would be investigated by him? The option to make such a choice would make the new process much more effective.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was not convinced by what the Minister said about the budget. However good the final draft of the Bill, and however effective it is designed to be, there is one way in which it can be prevented from reaching its objectives. That is to starve it as Dr. Hayes described--to cut the &#163;7 million budget to &#163;2 million. The Minister spoke of blank cheques, but no one is asking for those. However, I cannot for the life of me see how the system will be run on less than it previously cost--unless clauses such as the one we are considering result in the budgetary onus being taken away from the ombudsman's office and transferred to the police budget. The ombudsman could write a nice balance sheet at the end of the year, showing that the &#163;2 million budget had been adhered to. However, there would be a danger of decisions being based not on personal judgment but on considerations of organisational survival. That has happened before.
<P>
The three main points that I have made are valid and the Minister should consider them again. He should recognise that much experience has been gained in 28 years of such complaints as we are discussing, and that many of us know exactly where the blockage is. He should at least give the complainant a choice in the matter. Choice is available with respect to informal resolution of complaints; why not in this case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh said that my heart was not in what I was arguing. The question is not what my heart feels, but what my head tells me; the logic of the circumstances. I have listened carefully to the argument and heard nothing to change my mind--and I have shown my willingness to be flexible previously.
<P>
I shall explain again. The arguments of the hon. Members for North-East Cambridgeshire and for Newry and Armagh traced the flow of a complaint from an attempt at informal resolution and investigation by a police officer, under clause 53 through its progress, under clause 53(6)(b), to consideration under the relevant provision of clause 54 and the ombudsman's decision to refer it for formal investigation by the Chief Constable. Clearly, the ombudsman would already have made some initial decisions. Once the attempt to deal with the matter by informal resolution and the involvement of the police had proved unsatisfactory, he would have to decide, on the basis of the quality and nature of the complaint, and on the strength--to return to a matter of his independent judgment--of his in-depth knowledge of the best way to deal with complaints, whether it should be investigated by the Chief Constable. The easy answer might be that it would not be the same officer who would investigate. That applies now in a re-investigation, and the new regulations will allow for it.
<P>
What may be at the heart of the matter is the fact that some people will never trust the police. But we cannot allow the rest of society to be dictated to on the basis of constant mistrust when every effort is made to ensure that the police act in the greatest interest of the greatest number of the community. It is easy to accept that thousands of people who make potentially vexations claims may say that they do not want the RUC to investigate. I ask members of the Committee to imagine a scene of public disorder after which everyone registers a complaint, and they all say that they want it to be investigated by a particular route. No amount of resources could handle that. There will always be a problem with the delivery of any public service if there is an overflow of demand for a service not designed to deal with a massive number of complaints. The important point to be borne in mind in the motivation of complainants and the demand for the ombudsman's independent judgment to be overridden.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The Minister gave a hypothetical example of an incident involving a large number of people who demand that it be investigated by the ombudsman. But with issues of controversy, is not the basis for thinking about an ombudsman already there? The Minister's example is the obvious circumstance for an ombudsman to come in and investigate in such a way as to establish almost immediately whether a complaint is genuine, or vexatious or malicious--one to which investigation by the ombudsman, rather than a policeman, should automatically apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That should be the reality. However, the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh argued that we should give people every power to control the direction of complaints, because they will not trust the ombudsman's judgment, nor--in this case--that of the Chief Constable. I do not believe that that would deliver good public service. The public service ethos should override the interests of individuals. Those matters are of public interest, and that is a fundamental point.
<P>
Dr. Hayes did not recommend what the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh has argued. The Government's provisions are consistent with Dr. Hayes's report. However, I do not want to get into resource arguments. We have not signed up to the figures set out in Dr. Hayes's report, although there might be a base figure that we would want to achieve. The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh said that because the existing service was being delivered at a cost of &#163;7 million, it was inconceivable that it could be cheaper. If that were the case, public expenditure would never be reduced and efficiency measures could never deliver any benefit to the public purse. The Government are undertaking a comprehensive spending review to ensure that we receive maximum value and return from every penny of public money.
<P>
We have not made an investigation in this case, but there could well be savings. We must investigate the resource needs; those have not yet been determined. It is not a matter of setting &#163;2 million against &#163;7 million, because no figure has yet been decided. The project groups have not considered the total costs, or where the transfer of resources would be required and how it would be funded. The matter of resources is not part of the argument about the clause.
<P>
I do not want to discuss schedule 3 in detail at this point. The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh's interpretation of the schedule is wrong, but it would be better to discuss the meaning of paragraph 5 of the schedule when we consider that part of the Bill.
<P>
I believe that I have set out a reasoned argument, although hon. Members may still disagree with me.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is no possible way to legislate for people who believe that the ombudsman and the Chief Constable are in cahoots--to use an Irish term? The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh seemed to be suggesting that we should legislate for that eventuality. However, clauses 56 and 57 address his concerns by giving the ombudsman the power to call back complaints and to oversee their investigation. It would therefore be helpful if he would withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Once again, my hon. Friend has made a strong and valid intervention. I agree with what he said, although I do not know whether ``cahoots'' is an Irish word. That is the only point on which I disagree with him. I thought that ``cahoots'' was a native American word. However, we can find out its derivation and that would be one matter that would be resolved to the satisfaction of all members of the Committee.
<P>
I have exhausted all the arguments in my armoury. I will do my best to resurrect them if the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh is still not convinced. However, on the basis of my arguments, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> First let me deal with ``cahootery'', which is a Scottish word.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am sorry about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> However, no matter what hoots the Minister throws at us, and how he derives them, nothing that I said could be construed to imply that I believed that the new ombudsman and the Chief Constable would go into cahoots to distort the operation of the legislation. It would be sad if anyone could even start to think that that was part of my argument. It is not.
<P>
There are two parts to my argument. The first is that the ombudsman already had an absolute right defined for him in the Bill, as consent is required for the informal resolution of complaints. Why should not the same principle be applied to the clause so that the complainant has the right to say, ``I do not consent. I want to go through the ombudsman's office.''? That would be a compliment to the ombudsman, rather than implying that he and the Chief Constable were in cahoots.
<P>
I know from experience that many complaints stop or are dropped when the police investigation comes into play. That is not necessarily because the complaints are vexatious or malicious but because of the complainant's lack of confidence in the police process, for whatever reason. As the Minister said, confidence building is a matter for us all in the north of Ireland; surely he could at least concede the point in that case.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I feel strongly about the matter and I will press the amendment to a vote, although I think that I may be the only member of the Committee who votes for it. If, three years after the Bill has been enacted, it is shown that several complainants do not proceed with their complaints for the reason that I gave, will the Government, if they are in government, consider amending the legislation and strengthening the Act in the way that I suggest, even at that late stage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I cannot commit a future Government to do anything on that basis, but if there were a complete breakdown in public confidence in the delivery of a public service--we could take the Child Support Agency as an example--the House must investigate the matter to discover whether there were better ways of delivering that service. In some circumstances that could be done without changing primary legislation, but no Government can legislate for every possible complaint by every member of society about the delivery of a public service. If there is a coalescence, for whatever reason, of a significant group of people to try to frustrate the working of an Act of Parliament, it must be taken into account. I would cite the example of the poll tax, but I do not want to raise unpleasant memories in the minds of some members of the Committee.
<P>
When there is great public dissatisfaction, Governments revisit the issue. However, the Bill is not in that territory; as drafted, it hangs together in a coherent way. That does not mean that it will not be amended and I have already accepted the need for some changes.
<P>
The clause is consistent with Dr. Hayes's report and, as drafted, it will help us to achieve the delivery of a service: that of the independent ombudsman. The decision should rest solely with the ombudsman, not just in terms of dealing with individual complaints but because of the greater public interest. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman wants to divide the Commitee on the amendment and I shall be interested in the result of the vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I do not want to take up the Committee's time, but it is important, for the public perception of the Bill, to deal with the arguments of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, and to try to persuade him to change his mind.
<P>
If the amendment were accepted, and the ombudsman decided that the further investigation of a complaint required police resources, he would have to request permission from the complainant. The ombudsman might decide that it was important to enlist the help of the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall to investigate a complaint. The amendment would deny the ombudsman the right to call in that resource. He would be allowed to act in accordance with clause 56, but not with clause 57, unless he had obtained the complainant's consent.
<P>
The amendment suggests that the ombudsman cannot make a judgment to utilise further resources. The ability to exercise such judgment, and to use the provisions of clause 57, would be vital if malpractice occurred in the RUC. With respect to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, the amendment is a mistake, which fails to achieve his objectives. I hope that he will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): The ombudsman's independence is the nub of the matter. If we want him to be free from political pressure from the Secretary of State, and pressure from the Police Authority and the Chief Constable, it is inconsistent to argue that his decision can be questioned by the complainant. There must be consistency. The ombudsman must not be under pressure from anyone. The final adjudication must be his.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I hope that the clause will empower the ombudsman and that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh will reconsider his decision to push the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I do not intend to repeat what I have already said more than once. The blurred vision about the amendment is interesting. I do not wish to curtail the ombudsman's independence, but to give the complainant an option that already exists in other provisions. If the ombudsman is constrained by the provision for informal resolution, he should be constrained under clause 54. There would thus be two equal constraints. There should not be one definition on page 31 and a different definition on page 32.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman is desperate to prove his point. He is too well acquainted with the true circumstances to continue with his argument. The complainant's preliminary choice, before the matter goes to the ombudsman, to have the complaint resolved informally, is different from his choice to question the ombudsman's decision after it has been referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> At heart here, and it is not just a north of Ireland matter, is the concept of the police investigating the police or, as I put it earlier, politicians investigating politicians or housewives investigating housewives. It is not the way that independence is protected. That point is at the heart of the amendment. We will return to it on later amendments. It will be there until the very last debate on the Bill. I will thereore wrestle with my conscience and allow it to fall.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Question is, That the amendment be made--
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> On a point of order, Miss Widdecombe. I thought that I was very gently withdrawing the amendment at this stage on the grounds that the skirmish will continue right through the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Hon. Members must make their intentions explicit to the Chair. The Chair does not have the gift of interpretation and will take its guidance from the words used, not from the meaning behind the words. On this occasion I will accept the withdrawal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 54 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 27, line 35, after `(2)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `The Police Authority, the Secretary of State or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 127, in page 27, line 36, leave out `the Chief Constable' and insert `them'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The amendment is fairly simple. The clause deals with what can be described as call-in powers for the Police Authority and the Secretary of State. In later subsections the ombudsman is also given his or her own call-in powers. I have nothing against the basic principle. It follows closely what was recommended by Dr. Hayes in his report and it clarifies the present situation.
<P>
I am concerned about why, under subsection (2), only the Chief Constable can refer to the ombudsman any matter which appeared to him
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to indicate that conduct of a member of the police force may have resulted in the death of some other person.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Section 70(1) of the Police Act 1996 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The appropriate authority--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) shall refer to the Authority--''
<P>
</UL></FONT>in that case the Police Complaints Authority--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(i) any complaint alleging that the conduct complained of resulted in the death of, or serious injury to, some other person.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Section 65 of the Act defines the appropriate authority as being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in relation to a member of any other police force<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) if he is a senior officer, the police authority for the force's area, and
<P>
(ii) if he is not a senior officer, the chief officer of police of the force.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Paragraph (ii) includes the chief constable, which is the same as in the Northern Ireland legislation. It also provides that if a senior officer draws the matter to someone's attention, it has to be put to the Police Complaints Authority by the Police Authority. That is what the England and Wales legislation says: I am simply adding the Secretary of State to the triumvirate.
<P>
If an incident occurs, it is not only for the ombudsman to pick it up. In the case of a serious incident involving death, the Chief Constable may be involved. The Police Authority could be a route to the ombudsman. The Minister looks puzzled but I repeat that that is what the England and Wales legislation states. It is in the 1996 Act and if it is good enough for England and Wales, why is it not good enough for Northern Ireland? I ask that question for the umpteenth time in Committee.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I see no reason why the Secretary of State could not be given that particular call-in power, given that subsection (1) provides the Secretary of State with such a power under various other headings. The amendment is straightforward, and I see no reason why its inclusion would not improve the Bill. It would provide another route, when a death is alleged to be the result of the conduct of a police officer, for referral to the ombudsman--either by the Police Authority or the Secretary of State.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire appears to have provided a strong argument--that in serious cases, different authorities will be required to make reports. However, why stop at the Police Authority or the Secretary of State? Why not Ministers of State or Under-Secretaries of State? To whom exactly would the report be made? If a Minister other than the Secretary of State is advised of a incident, would that person be required to pass it on to the Secretary of State who would then pass it on as a complaint? That may seem a frivolous point, but those issues are important and were taken into account when the Bill was drafted.
<P>
In dealing with the alleged conduct of police officers, the responsibility rests initially on the shoulders of one person--the Chief Constable or appropriate officers. If a report is not made by the police force through the offices of the Chief Constable--and someone below him has not performed the requisite duties properly--we are immediately into a disciplinary mechanism because the police have not carried out their due reporting responsibilities as a result, for example, of a death in custody.
<P>
In England and Wales the appropriate authority means the chief constable or the police authority, but the Home Secretary is not mentioned. In trying to clarify reporting mechanisms in the Bill, the considered judgment was that responsibility for reporting should rest on the shoulders of the one authority--as I said, the Chief Constable. It may be a fine judgment but it is appropriate.
<P>
Northern Ireland legislation can be related to the 1996 legislation for England and Wales through article 20 of the Police (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The appropriate authority shall refer to the Commission any matter which appears to the appropriate authority to indicate that the conduct of a member of the police force may have resulted in the death of some other person.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That authority is defined as the Chief Constable or the Police Authority. The Select Committee on Home Affairs is conducting an investigation, and we await the Home Office review, on the back of that Committee's report, of how some of the legislation is working. We have taken the opportunity in this legislation to clarify that.
<P>
This is an important judgment. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that he would argue for the Police Authority, but for some reason his amendment refers to the Secretary of State, although that is in the England and Wales legislation. We have gone the opposite way and said that there should be one reporting authority and that it covers police conduct. On that basis, if someone is not performing his duty properly, there are disciplinary mechanisms open to the Chief Constable to discharge. That would not apply to the Police Authority or the Secretary of State, although the latter would be held accountable, probably in a court of law--as the Police Authority could be. The Secretary of State would be accountable to Parliament. I do not think that that is what the hon. Gentleman is seeking, however. We have tried to produce some logical structure, which is why we homed in and made the provision specific to the Chief Constable. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment, which attempts to add elements other than the Chief Constable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am not sure that the Minister has persuaded me that I should withdraw my amendment. He accepts that a fine judgment is involved. He says that he looked carefully at England and Wales legislation, and moved carefully away from my position--left or right: I am to the right. In the England and Wales legislation, a police authority can refer to the police complaints commission in an incident involving the death or serious injury of a member. I thought that there was an omission in the Bill because only the Chief Constable can be referred to. I added the Police Authority, but I then began to think a little wider.
<P>
One argument--which the Government pick up and run with when it suits them and drop when it does not--is that Northern Ireland is a finite area; that the Secretary of State's relationship as regards the hands-on control of Government includes--through the Northern Ireland Office--the police force. Because of that hands-on involvement, and the recommendations in Dr. Hayes' report, the Government are giving the Secretary of State call-in powers in subsection (1) in any event--and the Secretary of State is mentioned later in the clause. What is the difference between the Secretary of State, under subsection (1), having power to refer to the ombudsman a matter that appears to him or her to indicate that a member of the police force may have committed a criminal offence, and a situation in which that criminal offence may have resulted in another person's death? I see no difference, and I do not think that the Minister has made a fist of arguing otherwise.
<P>
By broadening the base, we say simply that referrals to the ombudsman can come from these various bodies. Perhaps the Chief Constable has not picked that up from the system. The amendment is another route to achieving the same end. In that context, why did the Government of the day see fit to include police authorities in the England and Wales legislation, section 65 of wich does not refer to police authorities in isolation? It provides that if a senior officer is involved, the police authority for that force shall be the conduit.
<P>
In Northern Ireland the Police Authority is responsible for the discipline of senior officers, including the Chief Constable himself. That is probably the reason for the wording. However, the Minister is arguing that that should not be the position in Northeren Ireland. I do not understand. The Minister has not explained the matter. He said only that the Government made a decision to act in that way. Why did they make that decision?
<P>
One of the most serious accusations that can be made against an officer is that his conduct led to the death or serious injury of another person. I am not undermining the Chief Constable's authority, but there is another route by which referral of such cases can be made to the ombudsman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I tried to set out the reason for the clause. It deals with a fact, not with a complaint. It is not the complaint about the death of a person, but the fact of a death that would automatically be the reporting responsibility of the police officer or officers involved. The Chief Constable would then be required to act. At what point would the Secrtary of State or the Police Authority be involved?
<P>
Police officers know that they have to operate in the public interest and if a death occurred, they would be obliged to report that fact. The Chief Constable would be the first persons to know about it. If the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire is suggesting that there would be a cover-up to obscure the death, that is a serious charge. That would be a matter for investigation by the ombudsman.
<P>
The legislation for England and Wales does not apply in this case; it is the fact of the death that must be reported in Northeren Ireland. That is the reason for the difference in the provisions. We want to ensure that there is a clear reporting mechanism and that is why there should be only one channel for such reporting. It should not be obscured by the involvement of other people.
<P>
I hope that I have explained the matter to the satisfaction of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. If I have not, will he give the Committee same examples of when the Police Authority or the Secretary of State, rather than the Chief Constable, could be brought into the reporting process for deaths in which police officers were involved?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am more than happy to turn the tables in this matter with a question to the Minister. Will he tell us why, under the legislation for England and Wales, a senior officer has to make a referral to the complaints commission through the police authority? Why can it not be done in that way in Northern Ireland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We are debating inherited legislation. I was not responsibe for the 1996 Act. If I had been, I might have approached it in the same way as I have approached this Bill. I have explained the reasons behind the clause; that is what we are considering in Committee. I have asked the hon. Member for an example of when the Secretary of State or the Police Authority, as opposed to the Chief Constable, could be brought into the process. If he could give me an example, it might make me change my mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I cannot give an example, and the Minister cannot explain to the Committee why it was deemed necessary to have different legislation in Northeren Ireland from that of England and Wales. He quoted me something that applied to Northern Ireland in 1989--I think that was what he said. The legislation for England and Wales is much more recent.
<P>
I know from my time in the Northern Ireland Office that the civil servants there worked closely with their counterparts in Great Britain. There would be close liaison on such legislation. The latest thinking on the matter is the 1996 Act. Will the Minister tell me if UK thinking has moved on since then? He has not explained that it has; it seems that he, or someone else has decided that there should be a change. There may be referrals by the Police Authority, although I cannot think of circumstances in which there would be, but the proposal must be in the England and Wales legislation for a purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument is that because something is in previous legislation it should always apply in the future. If such logic was always applied, legislation would never change and the House would have to take into account Acts that were drafted 300 or 400 years ago.
<P>
All legislation must be examined to see whether it applies in a praticular jurisdiction or set of circumstances. That is what happened on this occasion. If the 1996 Act were to be considered now, it may or may not have been drafted differently because we take a new and different approach--who knows? In the circumstances that apply in Northern Ireland it is appropriate for the Chief Constable, the responsible authority, to report matters to the ombudsman, and if he fails to do so the ombudsman should have the right to investigate. The hon. Gentleman has not given the Committee a convincing argument for the Secretary of State or the Police Authority to be engaged in the process. I have tried to explain why there should be one reporting mechanism. I have given due thought to the matter and I believe that the Bill as drafted is clear.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We could go round the houses in discussing the amendment, but the Minister obviously will not budge an inch, and we may discuss the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 28, line 9, leave out `of his own motion', and insert `himself'.
<P>
The amendment is simple; it substitutes clear English for a techincal term, this clarifying what is meant. The ombudsman's powers, set out in Dr. Hayes report, include his own call-in facilities. The power is important and necessary; it strengthens the ombudsman's independence and the public's perception of it . The ombudsman has the power in any situation, if he thinks fit, to call in for investigation anything that pertains to the conduct of members of the police force who may have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(i) committed a criminal offence; or
<P>
(ii) behaved in a manner which would justify disciplinary proceedings; and
<P>
(b) is not the subject of a complaint,''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That might come to the ombudsman's notice through various channels, perhaps even from the Police Authority, and the ombudsman will decide whether it merits calling in. My amendment would clarify the subsection's language; it would thus state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The ombudsman may himself formally investigate in accordance with section 56''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I can only advise the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that the phrase ``of his own motion'' is a legal term that has certain connotations. It is tougher than the word ``himself'', although that reads better, and invests more power in the ombudsman to take a particular action. I have no further arguments; we took the best legal advice in drafting the clause, and the term exists in other legislation. I ask the hon. Gentleman to take me on trust; he is not a lawyer and neither am I. I am arguing on the basis of advice given to me. It is important to be honest at all times. If there were another argument I would deploy it, but there is not. The term is consistent with legislation that requires action to be taken. I ask the hon. Gentleman to give further consideration to his amendment. It is not just a question of formulating clean legislation, but legislation that is consistent with other measures. The phrase has a particular meaning, but I am elaborating. I can see that I have won the argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Not quite. I moved the amendment because paragraph 12.10 on page 48 of Dr. Hayes's report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The related issue is the question of call-in, sometimes called an own-motion power.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is only sometimes, not always or regularly or legalistically, called that and, that being the case, I thought that most people reading it would not understand what it meant. That is why I sought to change it. It might have been better to say that he may use his own call-in power, but that again is not readily understood. I do not think that Dr. Hayes is a lawyer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> He is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> He may have made the same mistake as I made. The term is used much more frequently than we envisaged. When the amendment was first tabled, although my writing is quite legible, the Clerk interpreted it as ``own-motive''. He had not heard of it and he is a lawyer. I will not divide the Committee on the amendment. I accept what the Minister says in all good faith. He is honest at all times. I would never question what he says or suggest that he was trying to hoodwink the Committee. He has certainly been wrong on occasions but he has probably not known that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The clause is important. We have had a short debate on some of the issues. We have received some submissions with questions and I should like to take this opportunity to put a couple of questions to the Minister. First, in a letter to the Minister dated 18 February, Mr. Carlin of the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions states:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In relation to policing matters, over a period of time there have been particularly contentious issues arising from suicide in custody and the use of fire-arms by the police. It appears from the Bill that these will fall under section 55(1). There is some ambiguity and we would therefore welcome a clear declaration that such issues will always be the subject of investigation by the Ombudsperson without need of reference to any other source, such as the Chief Constable, the Secretary of State or the Police Authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The letter arrived a week or so ago and the Minister and his officials may already have replied. If they have not, I am more than happy if the Committee hears the answer to that on another occasion or in writing.
<P>
The Police Federation raised the matter of ``disciplinary proceedings'' in clause 55. It says that the the term has changed from ``criminal proceedings'' in an earlier order. The submission states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This change, which may be accidental''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is doubtful--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``brings routine discipline under the umbrella of the Ombudsman. The Northern Ireland Office has constantly emphasised the need to have the Ombudsman deal with serious matters. If this remains unchanged, the Ombudsman could take over the entire work of our Complaints and Discipline Department and the budget and staffing levels considered appropriate in the Hayes Report would be a nonsense. It is our contention that the word criminal should remain.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I did not see the merit of tabling amendments to make that change. However, the Police Federation is worried about the extent to which the internal inquiry proceedings that the RUC currently undertakes will shift to the ombudsman. The Minister may have already tackled that in his reponse to the Police Federation, in face-to-face dealings or through his officials.
<P>
I can put those points in writing if that would be more convenient for the Minister. They should be aired in Committee, and the Minister should respond to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The first point was about the letter from Mr. Carlin. I do not remember whether I have sent a reply--I cannot recollect every letter that I have written. However, given that the issue has been raised with Mr. Carlin's agreement, a copy of any letter to him will be distributed to members of the Committee.
<P>
The letter dealt with a suicide in police custody. That would be considered by the Chief Constable, although, first, the police would investigate the circumstances to make sure that a suicide had occurred. The Chief Constable would refer it, and any death in custody, to the ombudsman. However, we shall prepare a detailed response.
<P>
We are engaged in discussions with the Police Federation. The Bill sets out a new range of ombudsman's powers, and clause 55 clearly covers criminal or disciplinary proceedings. The Secretary of State will shortly address a Police Federation conference, which I shall also attend.
<P>
We have established a good relationship with the Police Federation. It has raised many worries. However, the clause provides powers for appropriate investigation by the ombudsman into criminal or disciplinary matters that are in the public interest.
<P>
We are considering new circumstances and powers for the ombudsman. The provision is unique to Northern Ireland; it will not apply to England and Wales. There are international examples of the provision's application. The new raft of measures for the independence of the ombudsman will strengthen the machinery in Northern Ireland and renew public confidence in the RUC. The hon. Gentleman has discussed the principles of the clause and the powers that it invests in the ombudsman.
<P>
I do not want to provoke the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis), who performs a service for the Police Federation, but he broadly welcomed the clause. The Police Federation recognises its importance. It is a matter of gaining confidence in a police force that is--in my opinion and that of other hon. Members--highly reputable. I shall continue my communication with the federation. I hope that we shall be able to satisfy it as to any possible concerns. I shall, if members of the Committee wish, make available to them any communications that are given to the federation, on the same basis as the letter in reply to Mr. Carlin.

<H4><center>Clause 56</center></H4>
<H4><center>Formal investigation by the Ombudsman</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 28, leave out lines 36 to 41.
<P>
The amendment is straightforward. It would delete clause 56(3) and is intended as a probing amendment. We have received submissions questioning why the people appointed by the ombudsman, who will, as is made clear later in the Bill, be drawn from a range of occupations, skills and professions, should, in conducting their investigations, be given all the powers and privileges of a constable. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A person employed by the Ombudsman under paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 3 shall for the purpose of conducting, or assisting in the conduct of, an investigation under this section have all the powers and privileges of a constable throughout Northern Ireland and the adjacent United Kingdom territorial waters''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Police Federation is concerned about the provision. It argues that despite the fact that the officers of the ombudsman will be people with many skills and professional qualifications, they will not have received the training that constables receive for conducting searches and arrests, among other things. The federaton considers that without that training, procedural mistakes by the ombudsman's officers in the line of duty will be likely. Of course, mistakes made in the process of bringing a matter to court can be very expensive, because of counter-claims for wrongful arrest or wrong use of procedures.
<P>
The Police Federation maintains that if the ombudsman's officers are not trained in the relevant aspects of constables' work, the payment of compensation through the courts for procedural mistakes could eat significantly into the budget assigned to the ombudsman's department. We have not yet reached the point of detailed discussion of finances, though the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh has raised the matter several times. I think that it is dealt with later in the Bill. However, if lack of training resulted in many court challenges to the way in which complaints were being investigated, the expense could eat substantially into the ombudsman's budget.
<P>
The Minister should explain to the Committee why it is deemed essential to give the powers of a constable to the investigating officers. That point was also raised by Mr. Carlin in his letter to the Minister, which states that under clause 56(3)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a person employed by the Ombudsperson for an investigation is given the powers of a constable. We would be grateful if you''--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Moss.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Having only just arrived on time, Miss Widdecombe, I feel a bit like a pumpkin. I thought I had finished asking my question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall try to answer the half question that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked. If my answer is wrong it will be because the question was not finished. The hon. Gentleman referred to specific concerns about the clause raised by Mr. Carlin on behalf of the trade union movement and to some raised by the Police Federation.
<P>
The Police Federation's main worry is the possibility of the introduction of a second police force into Northern Ireland: the clause refers to officers appointed by the ombudsman having powers and privileges over constables throughout Northern Ireland. The clause is necessary to give those officers power to conduct investigations into criminal and disciplinary offences, which is in line with the Hayes report. That does not mean that staff of the ombudsman will, in effect, be constables; they will not. They will merely have vested in them the powers to carry out their specific functions. In other words, they must be able to caution and, in exceptional cases, arrest people. They would most appropriately be compared to Customs and Excise or trading standards officers, who have constabulary powers and operate under the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. If the ombudsman's staff did not have such powers, they would have to ask the police to take such actions for them. Police officers must exercise their own discretion, the range of which we have discussed. We have written a new element into our awareness of that discretion in relation to the impartiality of police officers who choose to exercise their particular powers.
<P>
The ombudsman must have staff with a range of powers that, in effect, fall short of full constabulary powers. Such staff would not take the oath, make the declaration, or attest in front of a JP, which was the subject of the half question before the hon. Gentleman finished speaking. The fundamental distinction is that a constable is a constable all the time; but those working for the ombudsman are constables only in relation to the powers that they must exercise when they are on duty, as they have not taken the relevant declaration of office. Clause 56(3) states that such a person will have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all the powers and privileges of a constable throughout Northern Ireland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, the other subsections of the clause set out further conditions in relation to how they would be called in to act. That may be a subtle argument, and I did not think that I would have to ask the Committee twice in one sitting to take what I say on trust. There is a clear distinction between someone who acts with some of the powers of a constable and someone who has the full powers.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about training. If officers who were acting for the ombudsman came from Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue or financial investigators, they would be trained by their parent bodies. The ombudsman would have to be satisfied that they were competent before he engaged them. New training mechanisms would not be needed as officers would bring the abilities gained from the bodies from which they were drawn. Proper training would be given beyond that.
<P>
We will deal with the Police Federation's concerns; I assume that the transcripts of our proceedings will be read at the federation. We will explain the position to the federation and to Mr. Carlin on the basis explained earlier and will circulate letters to the Committee. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am again more than happy to take on trust what the Minister says. Subsection (3) refers to clause 18(3), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the reference to the powers and privileges of a constable is a reference to all the powers and privileges for the time being exercisable by a constable whether at common law or under any statutory provision''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is no good the Minister looking towards his advisers for inspiration while simultaneously nodding to me. He must do one or the other.
<P>
Let me clarify whether we are talking about time-limited powers that will exist only when the officer of the ombudsman is doing ombudsman's duties. The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all the powers and privileges''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
may seem to extend further, to the powers of arrest and so on. Is there no limitation? If there is, what is it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If I inadvertently misdirected the hon. Gentleman by nodding, it was only because I was trying to keep myself awake. The powers referred to are those that exist at present. As I said earlier, there will be specific powers for officers acting for the ombudsman. If those people are not constables, certain powers will be invested in them--but not all, because they will not have made a declaration of office and would not be expected to act as constables at all times, whether on duty or off. They would have the powers only when carrying out their duties, although the powers would include caution and, occasionally, arrest. That differentiates a normal constable who takes the oath of office from those who might come from Customs and Excise or some other body to support the Ombudsman's requirements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That could lead to confrontation and some difference of opinion. We are talking about people recruited by the ombudsman to investigate complaints against police officers. Professional people from outside are trying to take evidence from police officers who have been accused of wrongs ranging from mild misdemeanours up to serious criminal actions.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The police officer under investigation would normally know the law relating to the powers of police constables better than the investigator. Training must be good enough to equip the investigating officers with the requisite skills. Let us face it--given human nature, they will face resistance. There will be obfucscation and, in some cases, all manner of obstacles placed in the path of the officers.
<P>
It is important that investigating officers have a clear sense of their powers, but the Minister has not yet spelt out what they are. Somewhere in the regulations, both sides of the equation must appear: the police being investigated and the investigating officers who will not normally be seconded from the police. Both sides must know where the boundaries are. They must be clearly defined to avoid a possible source of friction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We are entering new territory with the new independent ombudsman--a unique set of circumstances apply to Northern Ireland. However, the powers of investigators will not be limited while they are conducting their investigations. They will have all the powers of a constable and will need full knowledge of the applicable law. The ombudsman would have to be satisfied that those acting on his behalf were competent to do the job; otherwise no one could have confidence in the independent investigation of complaints against the police.
<P>
Will the investigating officers need to know the law? The answer must be yes. Sometimes when the police are investigating the police, attempts are made to frustrate inquiries. One police officer may be better versed in the law than his investigating officer. Obfuscation--to use the hon. Gentleman's word--could come into play. If there is wilful frustration, it will become part of the report. I would not claim to be an expert in all these matters, but if it becomes manifestly clear that an investigation has been deliberately frustrated, the investigating officer--or, indeed, the ombudsman--could note and report it.
<P>
Customs and Excise officers provide a good example.They are not usually viewed by people whom they investigate as being a soft touch. They are tough in their approach to their business and they do a difficult job in difficult circumstances, sometimes having to deal with drug dealers. Some investigating officers may be drawn, like some Customs and Excise officers, from a highly reputable and trained investigative force, which would match the best that the police service had to offer in terms of knowledge of the law. The powers vested in investigating officers while they carried out investigations would be the same as those vested in constables, but as soon as the investigations cease they would no longer be required to have such powers. Police constables have them at all times. That is the difference between the two bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 56 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 57</center></H4>
<H4><center>Formal investigation by a police officer</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 29, line 7, after `formally', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`on behalf of the Ombudsman'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall be brief, because the amendment's intention is obvious and transparent. It would do exactly what the Minister recommended in a previous sitting--defend the independence of the ombudsman. It does so by inserting that a formal investigation be conducted on behalf of the ombudsman. It might be argued that that is implicit in clause 57(1). However, obvious tensions exist between the roles and powers of the police and of the ombudsman's office, which surfaced in earlier debates. That little amendment, humble though it may be, would leave no doubt about the primacy of the ombudsman's function. Subsequent, linked amendments attempt to extend that principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> It is not implicit but explicit in the clause that the Minister--or rather, the ombudsman--is in control of investigations. [Laughter.] That was a good start. The ombudsman is in control of the investigations. However, when a police officer is appointed to investigate, and the ombudsman has first referred the matter to the Chief Constable, that officer is responsible to the Chief Constable for the conduct of his affairs. It remains a disciplined force with the Chief Constable in control. The clause makes it clear that the ombudsman is, or can be, in control in several different ways.
<P>
First, subsection (4) allows the ombudsman to supervise the investigation of a complaint referred to the Chief Constable if he considers it desirable and in the public interest to do so. Therefore, if he is in doubt, he investigates or supervises the case. In addition, under subsection (7) the ombudsman
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may impose requirements as to the conduct of an investigation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (8) states that a report must be submitted to the ombudsman. However, the plea by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh seems to have touched such hard, stony hearts that we shall agree to the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> It is right that the Minister's heart should be touched by the amendment, which is rather humble in its transparency. It will add to the perception that the objective on all sides of the Committee is to protect the ombudsman's independence. I thank the Minister most graciously.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 29, line 15, leave out from `appoint' to end of line 22.
<P>
The amendment would help to protect the Chief Constable. What would happen if the Chief Constable made a mistake by appointing someone who did not have the ombudsman's approval? A remarkably messy situation might result, in which the ombudsman would say to the Chief Contable, ``Look, do not proceed with your appointment because I do not approve of the person whom you have appointed.'' That would introduce delay and put the Chief Constable in a rather invidious position--he would have to eat humble pie and appoint another person, which would not be good for the system or for the Chief Constable.
<P>
The cleanest way to deal with that situation is for the ombudsman to bring himself into an investigation at any stage. That proposal was not conceded formally earlier in our debate, but it was referred to. Otherwise there would be a clash between the ombudsman and the Chief Constable, and the system would be very shaky. The cleanest and most immediate way to deal with the problem is not for ombudsman to go through the procedure--perhaps for the second time--but for him to say, ``Okay, I shall exercise my powers, call myself in and investigate the matter.'' I readily foresee objections to that proposal, but if I were the Chief Constable, I should prefer to have that arrangement rather than the possibility of an ongoing tension over an investigating officer's appointment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The amendment would provide that the Ombudsman may require that no appointment take place until his or her approval had been secured in a specific case. I think that the hon. Gentleman is seeking to prevent the Chief Constable from appointing an investigating officer without the ombudsman's approval.
<P>
However, the amendment would remove the provision allowing the ombudsman to remove officers already appointed, which I am sure is not what the hon. Gentleman is seeking to do. Someone who was already appointed might be unsuitable for the task. I would argue that the clause as currently drafted offers the greatest degree of flexibility for the ombudsman. I do not believe that the ombudsman needs to approve every appointment by the Chief Constable; I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the report of Dr. Maurice Hayes when he categorised complaints into three groups: serious complaints which the ombudsman would have a statutory duty to investigate; less serious but still substantial complaints which might, at the discretion of the complaints body, be remitted to the police for investigation and report, either supervised or unsupervised; and complaints about the quality of service, which would be remitted to the police for informal resolution.
<P>
Although it is to be expected, at least in the early stages, that the ombudsman will formally investigate all serious complaints and most others, we must look ahead. If in due course a significant number of cases is referred to the Chief Constable by the ombudsman, he may not wish to be required to approve all investigating officers immediately, not least as that may impede the commencement of investigations. If there is a substantial number of complaints, it may be that many cases can be left to the police to appoint the investigating officer.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the clause gives the ombudsman discretion to decide whether he wishes to approve the investigating officer. If he thinks that it is a case in which it is crucial that he approve the investigating officer proposed by the Chief Constable, he may do so. It is the ombudsman who decides which cases to pass to the Chief Constable and who can tell the police what he is looking for in an investigating officer.
<P>
The clause also provides the option to dismiss an investigating officer, even if the ombudsman had approved that officer at the outset of the case.
<P>
I would argue that the current drafting best fits the spirit of the legislation establishing the office of ombudsman. It provides the necessary powers to fulfil the role effectively, but leaves matters to the discretion of the ombudsman rather than imposing on him a requirement to appoint everyone, which might make the new complaints system unnecessarily bureaucratic.
<P>
Having established my credential of reasonability, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter. There is an imperative in subsection (3)(a) that no appointment should be made unless the ombudsman has given notice to the Chief Constable that he approves it. That is straightforward. The next paragraph refers to an appointment having been made but the ombudsman not being satisfied. Where are the special circumstances? The Minister may be aware of such circumstances, in which case I should like to know what they are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> My understanding of subsection (3) is that the ombudsman may, especially in a serious case, say that an appointment cannot be made unless he has approved the appointment; but when a case has been referred to the Chief Constable he may appoint the investigating officer if the ombudsman does not consider it necessary to take unto himself the power to specify which officer it should be. He has control in deciding in which cases it is important for him to appoint a specific officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the Minister, but I am still not clear. My understanding is that under subsection 3(a) no appointment can be made unless the ombudsman approves the appointment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The hon. Gentleman is having difficulties with this because he is ignoring the beginning of subsection (3), which states that ``The Ombudsman may require'' in particular cases ``that no appointment'' be made unless the ombudsman approves. I think that the hon. Gentleman is having difficulties because he is ignoring ``may require''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> If that is the case, the confidence of the Chief Constable and the ombudsman in each other will be at a low ebb. The Chief Constable will have to remove an officer from the investigation, and appoint another officer at the ombudsman's request. Under the Bill, the ombudsman will have the power to continue with the investigation. We are considering the best method of achieving an objective. I would have preferred a clean way, in the interests of the police and the ombudsman. However, I shall not press the matter.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 46, in page 29, line 23, at beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `At any stage in the investigation,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 47, in page 29, line 37, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7A) In exceptional circumstances the Ombudsman may take over an investigation being undertaken under this section and continue it within the terms of section 56, if he considers that it is desirable in the public interest for him to do so;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (7B) After exercising the discretion conferred on him by subsection (7A) the Ombudsman shall notify the Chief Constable to that effect.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and Government amendment No. 56.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The power of the ombudsman to involve himself in an investigation has cropped up throughout our debate. There could be circumstances in which that would be essential. I hope that clause 57 will cover those circumstances. However, it is important to include the phrase contained in the amendment at the beginning of subsection (4), to ensure that the ombudsman can supervise an investigation at any stage. It is the ultimate test of our confidence in the ombudsman's ability to control investigations.
<P>
The amendment is obvious, and I hope that it is acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, amendment No. 46 would change the Bill to allow the ombudsman to intervene at any stage in an investigation that has been referred by the ombudsman to the Chief Constable.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary. The measure does not restrict the time of the ombudsman's intervention. His power to supervise may be exercised at any time. Subsection (4) makes that clear and states that he may supervise any complaint,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if he considers that it is desirable in the public interest''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the Bill achieves the hon. Gentleman's aim, and I ask him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
