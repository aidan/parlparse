Bill</a></center></H3>

<H4><center>Clause 92</center></H4>
<H4><center>Local transport plans</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 11, in page 55, line 4, leave out `must' and insert `may'.—[Mr. Jenkin.]
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:
<P>
No. 13, in page 55, line 12, leave out `must' and insert `may'.
<P>
No. 14, in Clause 93, page 55, line 21, leave out `must' and insert `may'.
<P>
No. 15, in page 55, line 23, leave out `must' and insert `may'.
<P>
No. 16, in page 55, line 28, leave out `must' and insert `may'.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I was saying that my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Clarke) has raised an interesting issue concerning the role of the new large unitaries—his own authority, Northampton and Oxford among them—and their potential right to put forward their own transport plans. We have discussed the issue previously and the Government will continue to monitor it, but it is not our intention that these should become local transport authorities. However, we are clear that the counties should be actively engaged with the districts in the elaboration of local transport plans and that is stated in our existing guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): Northampton, Norwich and Oxford are unique. They are very large cities that are not yet unitaries because the previous Government messed up the plans through the Local Government Commission. We hope that one day all the local authorities in England will become unitary authorities, to match those in Wales and Scotland. The problem is that when a shire authority has sole responsibility for the local transport plan, albeit in consultation, where the majority of the problem exists within a city centre, be that Northampton, Oxford or Norwich, it is a bit like the tail wagging the dog. Will the Minister assure us, if not by stating it in the Bill, verbally, that he will make it clear that he will expect county authorities and those not yet unitaries to make joint proposals for local transport plans? It is not simply a matter of consultation; they should be important partners in the drawing up of a plan in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am not sure that I can explicitly guarantee that they will be called to develop joint plans, but I emphasise that we would certainly expect the counties to co-operate closely with such authorities in the elaboration of local transport plans.
<P>
My hon. Friend has made two good points; first, that authorities like his own should become unitaries and, secondly, that when they do they might have some role in terms of the development of local transport plans. To that extent, it is important that we should place that firmly on the record and I am grateful to him.
<P>
I turn now to the intervention by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), who raised a number of issues. He talked about freight interchanges, which I know are the subject of a later amendment. Without anticipating the Government's response on that at all, he will be aware that existing guidance on local transport plans requires local transport authorities to develop policies that are consistent with sustainable distribution and to allude to the possibility of development of freight quality partnerships.
<P>
Predictably, the hon. Gentleman also referred to tour bus operators about which, as we are all aware, he has managed to generate some publicity. That may emerge in this part of the Bill as the hon. Gentleman's King Charles' head. He has certainly engaged the Department on that, but he will, again, be aware that relevant amendments have been tabled to later parts of the Bill and we shall deal with the matter in more detail then.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was amusing on the subject of what he called school reports. When responses from the Government and Government offices seem inappropriate to the policies that are set out in local transport plans, the Government will certainly take those observations on board; we are, after all, a listening Government. I assure him, however, that the Government offices work in close co-operation with the local transport authorities.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the 28 tables setting out criteria for assessment; he seemed to think that that was a rather excessive number. They were produced in response to local authority requests for clarity about the basis on which we would be assessing plans. I am pleased to say that most authorities have found the feedback helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): The Under-Secretary rightly says that local councils wanted clear guidance from the Department on how their bids were to be assessed. Does he acknowledge, however, that they found it difficult to draw up preliminary local transport plans because much of the information was given at short notice? Indeed, the Department's guidance on a number of matters was not even prepared by the time that they had to submit. Notwithstanding that, does the Under-Secretary accept that, given the difficulties and the shortage of time, local councils have generally done phenomenally well in producing what they have?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. We were delighted by the quality of responses from the great majority of local transport authorities to the consultation on local transport plans. He is right—there was an element of haste about the process. However, he will also know that we are about to produce a guide to best practice in the submission of local transport plans, a draft of which I have seen. It will be of great value to local transport authorities as they develop their transport plans. We are also refining guidance which we shall issue shortly in relation to the statutory local transport plans.
<P>
In general terms, the process of submission of local transport plans has been widely welcomed and endorsed by the Commission for Integrated Transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> On that specific point, as I am sure the Under-Secretary is well aware, the Local Government Association produced its own report on how local councils had submitted their plans. He will know that in that document the LGA takes the fact that so many people responded to the consultation as proof that many local authorities support the concept of local transport plans. The LGA also supports them. That is in marked contrast to the amendments that were tabled by the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin).
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We are in danger of holding a love-in, but the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right on that, as on so many other issues. He made only one mistake, which was in not putting himself forward as leader of the Liberal Democrats. However, he knows my views on that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath raised an important issue in relation to the Competition Act 1998. I know that he has tabled amendments to the Bill on that and I also know that other colleagues have concerns in that regard. I assure hon. Members that we intend to introduce amendments to ensure that competition legislation does not get in the way of these provisions, especially the new powers for local authorities. We will be able to discuss those Government amendments in due course.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) argued that the Government may be too prescriptive in giving local transport policies a statutory basis, but that is not our experience of local authorities' responses to local transport plans. I mentioned the judgment of the Commission for Integrated Transport, which talked to local authorities and produced a positive report on the process.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath referred to the LGA's support for our proposals. In my direct experience, when attending a succession of regional transport partnership meetings around the country, I perceived a strong feeling that local transport plans represent a welcome advance on past practice. On the whole, we have been extremely impressed by the positive response by local authorities and the generally good standard of plans.
<P>
 I wholly endorse the objective judgement of my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) on the Bill and on our proposals in this part of the Bill. I quote her words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a great step forward after years of neglect by the previous Government'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is an extremely accurate observation, if I may say so. I share her proper concern for consultation. I certainly welcome the RAC's offer to work with the Government to assist in the development of transport plans. It is evidence of this Government's concern for all aspects of transport that we shall have established a motorists' forum. That forum might be an appropriate contact for joint work on this subject. The guidance that we already circulate to local authorities strongly emphasises consultation and work with—I quote contemporary jargon—the stakeholders. The guidance has a section on public participation that says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Local authorities will need actively to involve local people, businesses, transport operators, users health and education providers, and environmental organisations at an early stage''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I know from my direct experience that the local transport plans that have most impressed me demonstrated that degree of consultation—for example, opinion polls among local people on the preferred way forward were carried out. Government offices and officials look to evidence of such participation in responding to the transport planners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): Does that mean that the Government will be doing some opinion polling about their own transport policies? They may find the results a little disappointing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. We do not need to engage in that costly exercise. We see the results of these polls regularly in the media. I am delighted that the public's acceptance, recognition and appreciation of our transport policy show a marked improvement month by month. Let me say finally—

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I will, but it is a rather obvious gift that I am passing over to the hon. Gentleman, in a spirit of friendliness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> You can say that again, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I did not say it at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> A figure of speech, Mr. Gale. I recall two Channel 4 polls that gave the Government an 80 per cent. negative rating on their transport policies. Even a large majority of non-householders, for example, think that motorists pay far too much tax. What polls does the Minister have in mind when he makes his claim that he is making such progress in his public support? Will he give an example to the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman tempts me to go down this path.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Do not be tempted too far, Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I must of course, accept your guidance—somewhat reluctantly—on this matter.
<P>
Let me turn to the remarks by my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) whose succinct analysis of the rightward lurch of the Opposition on transport as in so many other matters, drew attention to the support given by the British Chambers of Commerce to proposals in this part of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central mentioned the RAC's support. The Conservative party clearly stands outside the great national consensus that is developing around our proposals for local transport plans.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) drew attention to the overarching aspects of many transport issues and highlighted the need for co-operation between adjacent boroughs. Of course, we expect the mayor's transport strategy to embrace such concerns.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) was the object of an unwarranted slur when it was suggested that, as a Labour marginal, his constituency benefited from the Bingley bypass. Only five of the 18 schemes announced in our local transport plan settlement last December were in Labour seats. It is monstrous to imply that there is an element of subjectivity or partisanship in the award of the Bingley bypass, which recognised objectively the needs of local people and the outstanding parliamentary campaign conducted by my hon. Friend.
<P>
My hon. Friend made a slashing attack on the Tory record, pointing out the benefits and sheer necessity of transport planning. He contrasted the approach in the guidance document, which, had the term not been misappropriated, I would describe as common sense, with the Opposition's free-market approach. His remarks recalled the famous observation of the late Nicholas Ridley, who has been mentioned before and who, as Secretary of State for Transport, suggested that the appropriate free-market response to traffic congestion in London would be to abolish traffic lights. Fortunately, I have heard nothing so extreme today, unless the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) wants to defend his former colleague.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): What was the context of that remark?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The general insanity that prevailed in the Conservative party in the 1980s.
<P>
In conclusion, the amendments would put the production of local transport plans on a wholly discretionary basis. We recognise that local authorities are best placed to tailor solutions to local circumstances. Moreover, we have given them the scope to do that within a broad national policy framework. We have given them much greater discretion than ever before to use available resources for local transport capital expenditure.
<P>
However, that approach requires certain safeguards. Putting local transport plans on a statutory footing is part of a framework that will enable us to let local authorities get on with things. The basic duties in clauses 92 and 93 will help to ensure that all authorities produce a plan and, just as importantly, do their utmost to implement it.
<P>
The amendments negate the fundamental purpose of putting local transport plans on a statutory footing. I therefore invite hon. Members not to press them to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We have had a broad debate, which may have ranged a little beyond what you would tolerate, Mr. Gale. Local transport needs investment, not more bureaucracy. Compulsory local transport plans will not bring one penny of investment to transport.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath was right to ring the alarm bells, so I am disappointed that he cannot support our amendments. He is going with the flow. The LGA is still controlled by the party of the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), rather than by the Liberal Democrats or the Conservatives, so its views on this matter are hardly surprising. As for the British Chambers of Commerce and the RAC, those organisations have to work with whatever Government are in power: it is our job as Opposition Members to point out the folly that others may be unable to point out.
<P>
We are talking about a matter of simple common sense. When complex issues have to be settled at a local level, the less involvement at the centre, the better. The more involvement and direction from the centre, the more local solutions to local problems—which both the Minister and I crave—will be crowded out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Can the hon. Gentleman tell us of one reputable organisation in the United Kingdom that has publicly supported the so-called common-sense solution that he advocated this morning? [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Conservative party, for one, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) prompts me. A radical, reforming and effective party does not always seek consensus. The consensus that the Government need to build is with the motoring community, and it is sorely lacking from the Government's current policies. The hon. Member for Northampton, South described local transport plans as diktats that he could accept. We do not believe that such diktats will solve traffic problems. I shall deal with the views of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East in a moment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, Central spoke about bus prices. He is obviously unfamiliar with the policy launched by Steve Norris, the London mayoral candidate, on bus transportation in London. Research carried out by Professor Stephen Glaister showed that a substantial cut in London bus prices would significantly increase demand for bus services in the capital and could have a significant impact on reducing congestion and improving traffic flow. That is our policy: we believe that cuts in bus ticket prices—a 70p flat fare across the whole of London—would benefit the capital. We would need significantly more buses, but our policy would increase the number of passengers using the bus system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): From where will the money for that reduction to 70p come?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The interesting aspect of the research—it is available to the public—is that progressive cuts in prices are shown to increase revenues significantly. Unlike the ``fares fair'' policy of the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone), who cut fares when there was no additional capacity available—the system was already running at capacity—our policy would be of positive benefit to people who travel in London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> For goodness' sake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wishes to intervene, I would be happy to give way to him. No, he does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It is interesting that Mr. Norris is now copying the hon. Member for Brent, East in that respect. Is the hon. Member for North Essex prescribing for the rest of Britain a reduction in all bus fares to encourage greater patronage and to discourage people from using the motor car? This is certainly a radical departure for the Conservative party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is foolishly trying to put words into my mouth, The circumstances in London are very particular. All the public transport networks are running at capacity in London, but the one opportunity for increased flexibility is on bus transport. Local circumstances need local solutions, as the Minister would say. Local solutions must be applied to local problems. Central Government could not have come up with and implemented that policy. They are not in a position to dictate these policies, and nor am I. This policy is being led by Steve Norris in his campaign for the mayoralty.
<P>
The hon. Member for Shipley epitomises the dilemma facing new Labour. They get in with a radical anti-car policy and immediately start campaigning for increases in roads investment. He can count himself lucky because, despite the massive cuts in roads investment he got his roads. He should ask the Confederation of British Industry and the British Chambers of Commerce, much loved by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East, how happy they are about investment in the road system. If the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central talks to her friends at the RAC, she will find that they are very unhappy with the cuts in trunk roads, motorway improvements and support for local road investments.
<P>
We must deal with one point concerning how centralising these local transport plans are. Will the Minister first confirm that clause 93(6) is part of the Bill? These local transport plans are subject to the subsection that reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In carrying out their functions under section 92 and this section, a local transport authority must have regard to any guidance concerning—(a) the content of plans, (b) the preparation of plans, (c) the replacement or alteration of plans, and (d) the publication and making available of plans.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are empowering the Secretary of State to issue guidance about the content of local plans. Every now and then, someone will pop up in the Labour party and say: ``You've got to do something about this, Minister, because my local authority is not doing anything about it.''
<P>
Two or three local authorities will get complaints like that from Labour Members and, sooner or later, the Minister will be tempted by the popularity of making a move and will issue guidance that will determine what goes into the transport plans to satisfy the hon. Members pleading against their local authorities. Step by step, the process of centralisation will continue.
<P>
The Under-Secretary referred to the high proportion of local government funding that comes from central Government. It is important to look at the White Paper, and I am grateful to the Minister for Housing and Transport for lending me his copy. I have read it and know it, so I could reach across for it and look for the point that I wish to make. Under local transport plans, it says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we will use the new plans as a basis for an annual block allocation of credit approvals to spend on capital. We will expect local authorities to . . . support integrated transport objectives. Consistency with the local development plan and Regional Planning Guidance will also be a factor in decisions on supporting local transport plans.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That clearly demonstrates that the Government's approval of credit facilities and the allocation of grant will be tied to how much the Government like those local transport plans. The conurbations that have introduced parking charges or congestion taxes will be favoured with extra grant to bribe them into levying the extra taxes that we shall discuss later in the Bill.
<P>
Finally, to put to bed the point about how much support the Government are giving local authorities, yes, there was a settlement of £754.9 million in December to support local transport plans, but I have checked the figures and only £13.5 million was actual grant; the rest was borrowing facility, which falls—both interest and capital—on council tax payers. Borrowing facility is not money that grows on trees; it is a reduction in reserves and additional debt on local authorities. The Government are funding local authority transport plans by saddling local authorities with increasing debt.
<P>
The proportion of grant to credit approval was 1.8 per cent., which compares with 25.5 per cent. in the previous year. The figure had been declining in the two previous years, but the staggering cut inflicted on local authorities in the forthcoming year is without precedent. Let us have no cant from the Government about how generous they are being; they are allowing local authorities to borrow on their own account and are in fact cutting central Government support for local transport plans.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman be surprised to know that, like him, I spent part of the lunch break checking out the figures? Is he surprised to discover that the document that I had prepared for me by the Library, whose figures are rarely challenged, shows under the heading of ``DETR expenditure on local and public transport'' that on a constant price base, the total sum in the final year of the previous Conservative Administration was £3,533 million, whereas under this year's comprehensive spending review, it is £2,798 million. Although, to be fair, I said that we ought to use the end of the CSR period—it goes up slightly to the year 2001–02—as I said earlier, the total sum will be £272 million less than under the previous Administration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am immensely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his help. Unfortunately, I did not have time to go the Library; I merely reached into a filing cabinet.
<P>
The figures come as no surprise. When we come to later clauses and examine the results of local transport plans, we will see that the Government are clearly planning to substitute the income from the new transport taxes on parking and congestion for the traditional central Government support that was provided by the Department.
<P>
The framework for local transport plans is to be imposed on local authorities, but they will be given less money by central Government. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central has just left his place, but projects such as the Croydon tram link scheme, the Manchester Metrolink or the Sheffield supertram, which were traditionally funded by central Government grant, will now be dependent on additional local taxes on motorists. That is what will fund local transport plans in the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. Would he like to give me an assurance to the contrary? I do not think that he is in a position to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I can give the clear example of Northampton's new rapid transit system, which will begin to be constructed this year. It has been financed totally by private funds. The local authority will not be asked to contribute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is fine where private capital can be raised, but the Croydon tram link was funded by central Government grant. That was the commitment that we showed to local transport provision, which is lacking in the hon. Gentleman's Government. He has made the point for me: his local scheme is not getting the financial support that was available to similar schemes during the previous Conservative Administration, as evidenced by the figures given by the hon. Member for Bath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that in different parts of the country there will be different solutions? There will be public investment in some parts and private investment in others. In large areas of the country, there will be a mix of the two. Surely, that is the nature of the beast, with investment coming from all sources and dependent on local need and availability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I agree entirely. However, as new revenue streams become available to local authorities, the Treasury will be far less sympathetic to pleas from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions for a central Government grant to fund such schemes.
<P>
A central Government grant, such as that which funded the Croydon tram link scheme, will not be available in future as local authorities will be told that they are supposed to get their money from revenue-raising schemes. Hypothecation means nothing without additionality, as we shall discuss later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geriant Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman may know that, when I was leader of Croydon council, I accepted money for the tram link from Steve Norris, the then Minister of Transport. As the hon. Gentleman should know, that link received £125 million of Government grant and £75 million of private sector funding. Now, however, local authorities can borrow and pay back the costs of borrowing through income streams such as charging; so there is a facility for major infrastructure works.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman has just made my point for me. I referred to him earlier, but he was not in Committee when I first mentioned the Croydon tram link.
<P>
I have potted the hon. Gentleman in one. As I said, central Government grant was previously available to support such projects so that the burden did not fall on local tax payers. Now, however, those people will have to pay for the public element of schemes such as the Croydon tram link through borrowing approvals—which, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, have to be paid back—and the imposition of extra taxes.
<P>
<B>Ms Claire Ward </B>(Watford) rose—
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> How can I resist the hon. Lady?
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> The hon. Gentleman should take care over his words, as he will make my colleagues wonder.
<P>
I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. The only conclusion I can draw is that he believes that more Government money is needed for such funds. If so, he is surely suggesting that there should be more taxes across the whole income tax base, not local charges alone. Will he clarify that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am not making any promises. No sensible person would expect me to start writing in Committee the comprehensive spending review of the next Conservative Government.
<P>
Transport spending has been cut under the present Administration and taxes on road fuels have been increased. Indeed, new taxes have been introduced. The hon. Lady must face the fact that she was elected on the ticket of no new taxes to fund Government spending plans. However, spending plans have been cut and taxes are going up. As a result, ``stealth taxes'' is the phrase on everyone's lips. There will be stealth taxes on motorists, which breaches the Government's pre-election promises.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am putty in the hon. Lady's hands.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> I wish that I had that effect on everyone.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman tried to remind me of the manifesto on which I stood at the election. I clearly remember that it said that there would be no increase in income tax, and it certainly did not apply that to other taxes. However, I can only infer from the hon. Gentleman's comments that more money should be collected and paid into transport schemes. If so, the logical conclusion is that more money would be promised by the Conservative party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am not making cast-iron promises, but just look at the history books. Throughout the 1980s, we reduced taxation and the rates of tax. We reduced the absolute volume of tax as a proportion of the national income. We reduced the—[Interruption.] I am finding it difficult to make myself heard, Mr. Gale. We reduced taxation as a proportion of the national income and we increased investment in transport: all possible to achieve. It is a mistake to believe that increased taxes lead to a sustainable tax base. That is the mistake that the Government are making. They think that they can increase taxation and not undermine the sustainability of the tax base. Sustainable economics is as much about low taxation as anything else.
<P>
We are, however, getting a little sidetracked on matters of taxation and economic policy—I am perfectly happy to discuss that, but I see a frown darkening your noble visage, Mr. Gale, and I think it is time to move on. We will withdraw these amendments today and we will contribute constructively to the discussion about the local transport plans that the Government wish to impose on local authorities. We have suggestions to make about how local transport plans need to be improved and what issues they need to address to be effective. We attach one caveat to all these suggestions: they should be voluntary. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we move on, I think it is fair to say that we have had a very wide-ranging discussion on the amendments to clause 92 and, indeed, on part II of the Bill, to the point where I was moved to ask the Clerk whether it was an order to move that part II stand part of the Bill. Nevertheless, I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have found the opportunity to have a wide-ranging discussion useful. I now wish the Committee to return quickly to order and to the matters in hand.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 415, page 55, line 4, leave out `develop and implement' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) develop'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 416, 423, 428, 430, 431 and 433, 435 and 436.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I will be brief and I shall stick narrowly to the subject of these amendments. They are necessary to properly reflect the role of metropolitan districts in the production and implementation of local transport plans and bus strategies. Our policy is clear: in metropolitan areas, local transport plans will be produced jointly by the passenger transport authority and the metropolitan districts. The district authorities' responsibilities for traffic, highways and land-use planning in particular are crucial to the success of PTA initiatives on public transport, as well as to the objectives of the plan more generally.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 415 and 416 split the functions of preparing and implementing the local transport plan. That is necessary to give effect to new clause 7. The purpose of new clause 7 is to make it absolutely clear that the preparation of local transport plans and bus strategies shall be carried out by the PTA and metropolitan districts acting jointly.
<P>
Similarly, new clause 7 provides in subsection (2) that implementation of the plan, publication and the requirement to have regard to guidance on the production of plans and strategies are duties of the metropolitan districts as well as the PTA. Let me underline the point that the combined effect of amendments Nos. 415 and 416 and subsection (2) of new clause 7 is to impose a duty to implement the plans on the PTAs in so far as they have the necessary powers and on the metropolitan districts in so far as they have the powers.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 423, 428, 430, 431, 433, 435 and 436 are technical and consequential.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I have no problem whatsoever in supporting all those amendments, some of which are very important. It would be helpful if the Minister would explain amendment No. 423, because, although it is a commendable aim to reduce the total number of words in the Bill, that is all amendment No. 423 will do.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Amendment No. 423 applies to clause 95 and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``leave out from `each' to end of line 9 and insert `authority, council, operator or organisation consulted''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That simply reflects the fact that there will be joint responsibilities. It clarifies the purpose of the provision and is a sensible and satisfactory consequential amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I beg to move amendment No. 483, in page 55, line 5, after `efficient', insert `, accessible'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 460, clause 94, page 56, line 21, at beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`appropriate pedestrian access and other'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 499, in clause 96, page 57, line 33, after `facilities', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`including facilities that improve pedestrian access to bus services'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 527, in clause 119, page 69, line 36, leave out paragraph (a) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) what information on local bus services, including information on pedestrian routes to and from bus services, should be available to the public (``the required information''), and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> First, I should like to say that I greatly enjoyed being in Australia and Singapore with the Select Committee on Transport, looking at various matters such as road pricing, which we shall discuss later. I hope that the Committee has not missed the lance corporal's presence too much. I see that the field marshal, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo), has disappeared to other places, which must reduce the worth of our debates in Committee.
<P>
The amendments are designed to plug a gap in the local plans described in the Bill—that is, the poor integration between all forms of transport and pedestrians. Under amendment No. 483, the word ``accessible'' would be inserted in subsection (1). As well as being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``safe, integrated, efficient and economic''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
transport must also be accessible to pedestrians. We shall deal with accessibility for disabled people later. Under amendment No. 460, the phrase ``appropriate pedestrian access'' would be inserted at the beginning of clause 94(1)(c), which deals with bus services. The important word is ``appropriate''.
<P>
Under amendment No. 499, the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``including facilities that improve pedestrian access''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to other modes of transport would be inserted in clause 96(4)(a). Amendment No. 527 is designed to ensure that information about pedestrian access to modes of transport would be disseminated as widely as possible.
<P>
The purpose of those amendments is twofold. First, everywhere we look we see what happens when pedestrians are not given proper access to public transport. The amendments are intended to encourage greater pedestrian access to other forms of transport. For example, in my constituency, it is absurd that Chippenham bus station is at the far end of the town from the train station. It is also segregated from the town centre by road that cannot be crossed. Traffic zips around the town on a one-way system and it is impossible to go from the town centre to the bus station. Recent representations by several people, including myself, have encouraged the local authority to install a pedestrian crossing to improve access to the bus station. Nevertheless, the system is inefficient. If people take the bus into Chippenham from the surrounding country, they find themselves in an entirely different, windswept part of the town from the train station, from which it is difficult to reach the town centre.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Once again, too many conversations are taking place in Committee. If Members wish to have private conversations, will they please do so outside the Room?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> We are campaigning hard in my constituency to reopen Corsham station, as the Minister knows I hope that I shall soon be able to take representatives of my local authority to see him in his office about our proposals.
<P>
The station will be positioned within a few hundred yards of 590 proposed houses which we are considering whether to allow. That would be ideal, with pedestrian access to the new station allowed. Incidentally, I hope that the Minister will say that such a meeting will be possible. It is good to ask, but we shall have to see whether he allows that to happen.
<P>
It seems sensible to find a way of encouraging greater pedestrian access to trains and buses, but the Bill does not stipulate such an aim. The amendment is designed to help the disabled, about whom we are concerned, and the blind in particular. It is difficult for the disabled to find their way on public transport. No provision is made for local transport plans to encourage access. The Royal National Institute for the Blind has supported our amendments, saying that local public transport should be greatly enhanced for the benefit of the blind and partially sighted. A variety of disabled organisations has noted that there is little encouragement for increased disabled access to public transport.
<P>
I pray in aid no less a group than the National Consumer Council, which favours amendment No. 460 in particular. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The fundamental reason is if bus strategies are to tempt people out of their cars and onto buses, people need to be able to travel to the bus stops easily and safely.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In an earlier briefing it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Roads with inadequate pedestrian crossings can present insurmountable barriers to elderly and disabled people.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is like my Chippenham example.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Women in particular may be reluctant to walk home from the bus stop late at night in dimly lit back streets . . . NCC would favour a new requirement upon local authorities to ensure proper provision of pedestrian''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and also, incidentally—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``cycling access to bus services.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The NCC, a government organisation established in 1975, strongly endorses what we say, especially amendment No. 460. It seems perfect common sense—if I might use the expression—to find a way to encourage proper pedestrian access to railways, buses and other modes of transport. The Bill does not mention pedestrians and that is a significant gap.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): The hon. Member for North Wiltshire kindly introduced our amendment No. 460 and talked in terms that I would like to share. It is important that pedestrians are included. The Minister and his colleagues will be aware that there has been concern in recent days about the dangers and difficulties faced by pedestrians—especially deaths on roads due to car accidents—and their vulnerability. That bus strategies will not tackle their interests is an omission. Every effort should be made to bring them within the Bill's remit, to ensure that they are considered important. We must assume that most people go to bus stops on foot. We hope that the Minister will listen sympathetically to our views on the amendment and respond positively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire and by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore). Pedestrians are possibly the most important part of a local transport strategy. We might talk about 80 per cent. of people being motorists or 75 per cent. of households having access to cars, but we are all pedestrians at some point during the day.
<P>
The towns and cities designed for the pedestrian and for the horse and cart are the most attractive to live in. How many times have we been in a town or city and felt that the traffic engineers had given vehicles too much of an upper hand at the expense of pedestrians? A dual carriageway cuts, on two sides, quite close to the centre of my own town of Colchester, dividing the town. Ambitious projects such as those, which are designed to give people freedom and access, can cut many of them off from the mainstream of their population centre. Unless we encourage local authorities voluntarily to think much more strategically about how they design their town, city and village centres, so that they remain accessible and friendly places for pedestrians, we will lose the sense of community that those places represent. The car is a metal box with windows, which does not provide an equivalent sense of interchange and communication. [Interruption.] I missed the Minister's point. [Interruption.] I think that I have got it now, but it will have to be recorded as an interruption.
<P>
Another example in my constituency is provided by the village of Tiptree, which is famous for its jams. [HON. MEMBERS: ``Traffic jams?''] I urge hon. Members to take the debate seriously. I am not talking about traffic jams, but strawberry jams. The centre of the village is undergoing major redevelopment. Rather than plonking down a supermarket and some out of town suburban-type housing as the solution to the village's problems, which would create barriers and problems—
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Hope </B>(Corby): We have stopped that. People cannot do it any more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> A tremendously exciting agenda has been put on the table by the urban task force. It contains many ideas about creating communities that are accessible by pedestrians, which is important in respect not only of transport systems, but of shops and facilities.
<P>
I congratulate the Pedestrians Association on its work in promoting the interests of pedestrians. It is ironic that the largest interest group in transport is represented by one of the tiniest pressure groups. The association does a disproportionate amount of work for its size, and is beginning to have a dramatic influence on the whole town planning agenda.
<P>
This important factor should be taken into account in local transport plans, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> This has been a short, but interesting and serious, debate. I turn first to the comments of—I get to say it at last—the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. That is a beautiful constituency, which, had I not the great pleasure and privilege of representing Streatham, I would be delighted to represent.
<P>
Having offered those blandishments to the hon. Gentleman, I must say that he was a little churlish in his remarks about the alleged lack of emphasis that the Bill gives pedestrians. I draw his attention to the fact that at the end of clause 92(2), local authorities are specifically required to develop facilities and services for pedestrians. There could be no clearer indication of the emphasis that the Government want local authorities to give to the rights and interests of pedestrians. I suspect that few Bills of recent times have contained such a clear reference to their needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I would hate the Minister to go to bed tonight thinking that I have been churlish in the course of the Committee's proceedings. I should lose sleep myself. I was referring to the bus strategy aspect of the local transport plan, not to the plan in its generality.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I think that I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. We shall return to that matter when we consider the clauses on bus strategies.
<P>
I sympathise with the emphasis that all the Committee members who have spoken have placed on the concerns of pedestrians. The chair of the Pedestrians Association, with whom I have worked closely, is one of my constituents. I have a certain degree of self-interest in the principles and objects of that association. It is on the public record that I am not a driver, although I do not entirely demur at the facilities that are offered by the Government in the shape of the ministerial limo. I have never learned to drive a car and I have always been a passionate user of public transport and a passionate pedestrian.
<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): I am glad the clause refers to the provision of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``facilities and services for pedestrians''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in local transport plans and bus strategies. Does my hon. Friend agree that such facilities are important for people who are blind or partially sighted, and those who have disabilities? They often find it difficult to use public transport if access to such facilities has been constructed without considering the needs of pedestrians.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point—I shall come to it presently.
<P>
I have taken note of the request that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire made for a meeting and I am aware of the representations that he and his local authority have made about Corsham station. I hope that he will not regard it as a brush-off if I say that I shall call him.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the purpose that lies behind the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I do not want to offend him, but there is a slight danger in this brief debate of conflating pedestrian access or pedestrian facilities with disabled access. They are related in many instances, but they are not necessarily the same, and it is important to keep them separate in relation to the amendments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 460, 499 and 527 are primarily geared at pedestrian facilities per se. I repeat that I am sympathetic to the intentions of Opposition Members, but I do not believe that the amendments are necessary. They smack in part of what I call the kitchen sink tendency—the tendency among hon. Members to put everything into Bills except the kitchen sink. We should resist that in the interests of parsimony and good sense, and we should certainly do so in this case. The amendments are not necessary.
<P>
It is axiomatic that every bus journey involves a walk to the bus stop, or at least a walk of some kind at the other end. Under clause 94, a local authority must have regard to ``the transport requirements'' of people in its area. We contend that, for bus users, that necessarily takes into account considerations about how people access local bus services. The question of pedestrian access, with which amendments Nos. 460 and 499 are concerned, is already inherent in, clause 94. It is part and parcel of what we might call the bus experience.
<P>
The current guidance on local transport plans already makes specific reference to the importance of walking, both for short journeys, and for access to public transport. Any guidance under clause 93(6) would echo that. The comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central in this regard were absolutely right. The same would apply to information under clause 119, to which amendment No. 527 refers. Under any reasonable interpretation, local bus information must include information of use to people in order to get to the bus stop. In most cases, that journey will be on foot.
<P>
I give fair warning that I am not willing to accept any of the amendments. I am especially keen to resist amendments Nos. 460, 499 and 527 on the grounds of an element of otiosity. I want to adopt a different approach to amendment No. 483, which was tabled by the hon. Member for North Essex. The purpose of the amendment is to require authorities to develop and implement policies for the promotion of accessible transport facilities. The duty therefore becomes the promotion of safe, integrated, efficient, accessible and economic transport facilities and services. Our intention under subsection (1), and the clauses on local transport plans as a whole, has been to make broad provision to include all the objectives that authorities might reasonably want to pursue. We are keen to avoid too many specifics, and the danger that we create doubt about what we leave out. That issue will arise in relation to later amendments.
<P>
Clearly, authorities should promote more accessible transport policies. Our existing guidance on local transport plans asks them to provide a clear statement of the approach that they intend to adopt in relation to provision for disabled people. We have proposed to make that a requirement of guidance issued under clause 93(6). The use of the words ``safe, integrated, efficient and economic'' is deliberately broad. We do not want to specify. The words do not, in practice, restrict authorities from pursuing the worthy objective of making transport facilities more acceptable. I would have no objection in principle if the clause were to acknowledge the needs of disabled persons more directly.
<P>
On that basis, I am happy to reflect on the matter and introduce a suitably drafted amendment at a later stage, probably along the lines of the formulation in clause 94(3)(a), which requires authorities to have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the transport needs of persons who are elderly or who have mobility problems''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in formulating bus strategies.
<P>
With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be willing to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> This has been a useful debate on an important issue. I welcome the Minister's acceptance that the interests of the disabled and the blind might be better safeguarded by a suitable amendment to clause 92.
<P>
The debate had one or two highlights. It was interesting to hear my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex speak movingly about the people of Tiptree, and I am sure that his speech will have affected the Minister's consideration. I was delighted to see the Minister for Housing and Planning looking up briefly from his careful consideration of ``The Essential Civil Servant'', which he has read in quiet moments during this afternoon's debate. Apparently, we were able to divert him away from that gripping read.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> He is considering a new career.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It is interesting that we had to borrow a copy of the transport White Paper from the Minister. We can tell him a thing or two about the ``The Essential Civil Servant'', however, as we have had a great deal of experience.
<P>
The other highlight that I enjoyed was when the Minister replied that a chair of an organisation in his constituency was also a pedestrian. The notion of a chair also being a pedestrian struck me as curious, although perhaps I am less politically correct than he would be. None the less, I accept his point about the kitchen sink tendency of some legislation. Content in the knowledge that he intends to introduce a provision to safeguard the interests of disabled and blind people, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 416, in page 55, line 6, at end insert `, and (b) carry out their functions so as to implement those policies.'.—[Mr. Hill.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 457, in page 55, line 9, leave out `or visiting'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 458, in page 55, line 10, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and (c) those required to meet the needs of those visiting the authority's area, provided that such facilities and services maintain or enhance the visual and historic amenities of the area.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I hope that this will also be a relatively brief debate, which will give the Minister an opportunity to give his early thoughts on a concern that I have already mentioned about the operation of tour buses in many of our historic cities. Taken together, the amendments would ensure that no services or facilities included in a local transport plan for those visiting an area could damage any of the area's visual or historic amenities.
<P>
I would be the first to admit that the range of services provided to those visiting an area will not be limited to the operation of tour buses: a number of other facilities will be made available, such as ordinary business services and other forms of transport. However, evidence suggests that the largest supplier of services to visitors in many of our historic cities is tour buses. I am worried that a number of these operations in different cities lead to significant congestion, pollution, undue noise and vibration, often causing damage to the ancient foundations. The local transport authority should be under a duty to satisfy itself that tour buses will not add to those problems.
<P>
Members of the Committee might not be aware of the magnitude of the problem, which affects the medieval cities of Chester, York, Edinburgh and my own wonderful city of Bath, as well as many others. Indeed one tour operating company operates in 30 different cities. One reason why the Committee should be concerned about this problem is that, sadly, many of these tour buses add to congestion, pollution, noise and vibration at a time when they have relatively few passengers on board. A recent survey in my constituency showed that during May, June, July and August, the months when one would expect the largest number of tourists to avail themselves of such facilities, the buses were 82 per cent. empty. In the winter months, when many of these vehicles continue to trundle round the ancient cities because of the benefit that they obtain from the fuel duty rebate, they are often almost completely empty.
<P>
That might not matter if the number of vehicles is relatively small, but at present, as part of its local transport plan, Bath and North-East Somerset council is considering introducing a bus gate in the centre of the city of Bath and, as part of its planning, has carried out a survey of the number of vehicles that may use it. The survey shows that, between 10 am and 5 pm, 266 tour buses are expected to pass the point at which the council intends to install the bus gate. That is one tour bus every 1.6 minutes. When we bear in mind that tour buses are, at the height of the season, 82 per cent. empty and at the depth of the tourist season almost entirely empty, I hope that the Committee will agree that there is cause for concern. Therefore, local transport authorities, local councils and traffic commissioners must be given greater powers to control these vehicles. One means of achieving that would be to include in local transport plans measures to ensure that such vehicles do not cause the type of problems that I have described. Amendment No. 458 states that those transport facilities and services should
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): What impact would that proposal have on areas of outstanding natural beauty, such as national parks, in relation to tour buses? That type of tourism adds to the environmental development of such areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that question. It gives me an opportunity to say that although I express concern about tour buses, I am not opposed to them in principle. He referred to areas of outstanding natural beauty. It is important to give people the opportunity to see those areas and to derive pleasure from them, and to do so using forms of mass transport to reduce the number of individual vehicles using those areas.
<P>
The same is true of the compact medieval and historic towns to which I have referred. Tour buses, as a form of mass transit, can help to keep cars out of city centres. However, large numbers of them, sometimes carrying few or even no passengers, do not solve the problem but add to it by adding to the vibration, congestion and noise. I hope that the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) will accept that this is not an attack on tour buses in principle, but a desperate desire on the part of my constituents and those in many other constituencies similar to mine to find a solution to this problem.
<P>
This is one of a number of amendments addressing this question. It is the first of a sequence of amendments, and the Minister may, therefore, wish to use it as an opportunity to give a general reaction to the problem. Alternatively, he may prefer to refer specifically to this question, and leave his response to other suggestions until later. I leave that matter to him, and I am sure that he will act under your guidance as to what would be in order, Mr. Gale. I hope that he and the Committee will acknowledge that we must find a means of resolving this significant problem. It has led to a great deal of anger in my constituency, and in similar cities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman suggested, with his usual courtesy, that I might conduct a more general debate on tour buses at a later point in the Committee's proceedings. That is certainly my intention. I need to drink some water.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> With pleasure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am sure that the Minister understands that my point is a serious one, and I hope that he has now regained his voice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I was prevented by the effects of nocturnal vapours from saying that he is right to express those concerns about the deleterious effects of tour buses, as he represents the finest urban landscape in England. However, I cannot entirely agree with the purpose of the amendment.
<P>
The purpose of amendments Nos. 457 and 458 is to prevent authorities from promoting transport facilities for visitors unless such facilities maintain or enhance the visual and historic amenities of the area. In developing and implementing their plans, authorities will no doubt wish to consider the visual and historic amenities of their areas.
<P>
However, I should stress that local authorities can already take account of special local circumstances in their local transport plans and bus strategies, and it is right that they should. It is not necessary to add all manner of specifics, however worthy, to the deliberately general wording of the Bill. If every desirable objective were added to it, the list would be endless. Doubts would arise about whether other specific issues had been deliberately left outside the provisions of the Bill, when that was not in fact the case. We should try to avoid such uncertainty.
<P>
It is better to keep matters general and flexible, enabling local responses to local circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I fully understand the drift of the Under-Secretary's argument, but will he provide some comfort by saying whether he intends to ensure our place in the guidance that will be offered to local authorities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I find that suggestion interesting and I have taken note of it. I shall consider the way in which it might be developed in the guidance, although I make no guarantees.
<P>
In conclusion, authorities have to balance a range of competing priorities, including, incidentally, provisions for visitors. Those priorities might include not only the environmental amenity of a locality but its economic vitality. For the reasons that I have given, the amendment is unnecessary and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am delighted that the Under-Secretary has at least agreed to consider whether this issue can be referred to in guidance, and I look forward to hearing from him. I thank him for his generous description of my constituency as the finest urban landscape in the country, which indeed it is. In fact, it is the only city that is a recognised world heritage site. He will therefore appreciate my constituents' strength of feeling on this issue, but, as I have said, I do not raise this matter purely on their behalf; many hon. Members have expressed similar concerns about their own constituencies. However, given the Under-Secretary's assurances and the opportunity to debate this issue in a number of different guises, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 459, in page 55, line 10, after `freight', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`including railfreight terminals'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the rail freight issue is considered fully. In recent years, we have witnessed a great increase in rail freight. The Government and the official Opposition may both wish to claim responsibility for that, but we are all keen to see a further increase. I spent much of yesterday in the constituency of the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central, who is not in her place at the moment. I visited the main customer service facility of English, Welsh and Scottish Railways, and had the opportunity to tour one of its many yards and discuss with its representatives the issues that they face. Like many others in the ``Freight on Rail'' action group, they are keen to emphasise the need for rail freight facilities. In drawing up local transport plans, local authorities should fully consider this important and growing part of our national transport network.
<P>
The relative balance between passenger and freight traffic gives rise to major issues, to which we shall return in due course. The Government have highlighted the need for freight to be considered fully; it would seem to be an omission not to include rail freight terminals. As we all know, many good environmental objectives might be achieved if we got more of our transport, especially freight, from road to rail. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment to be constructive and that he will respond positively, if not guarantee to take it on board. I hope that he realises that the amendment is offered not churlishly, but in a spirit of partnership.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I would like to join the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale in his non-churlish efforts to raise the issue of rail freight. I suspect that the Minister will tell us that there is a degree of otiosity in the amendment.
<P>
As the Minister will readily accept, rail freight is one of the acknowledged successes of his inheritance from the previous Government. It is scheduled to increase threefold in the first 10 years of privatisation. We want to facilitate the continuance of the process. If there is an opportunity for local authorities to play a part, they should be encouraged to do so. We want from him an assurance that that will happen in the plans.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I hope that it will not be felt that a cloying consensus is developing in Committee. I am extremely sympathetic to the purposes of the hon. Member for Tweeddale, ``etcetera''! I am willing to go a long way towards acknowledging the contribution made by the previous Administration to rail freight facilities. Provisions in the Railways Act 1993 represented an improvement on the old section 8 rail freight facilities. They were slow to take off, but have proved to be successful.
<P>
The major thrust in rail freight expansion has occurred in the past two and a half years—since the election of the Government. Rail freight carriage has increased by 27 per cent. As the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale will be aware, the Government last year made the largest-ever rail freight facility grant—of about £7 million—to Grangemouth in Scotland. That delighted us, as did the fact that the provisions of the previous Government's legislation have enabled us to pursue this success story.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister report on the efficiency of the grants? How much additional freight has been put on the railways as a result? Is he aware of the potential for the creation of railheads that merely process goods from one road vehicle to another and do not get freight on the railways? They are just freight depots that happened to have a railhead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point which is worth considering. I note in passing that there has been a marked increase in the carriage of rail freight during the period and, as he will be aware, an, albeit slight, decrease in HGV carriage. I would not like to say whether the link was direct or commensurate. I shall reflect on the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
Amendment No. 459 specifies that authorities should include rail freight terminals when promoting facilities for freight. The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale is right: we need to move more freight by rail. Local authorities have an important role to play in enhancing rail freight facilities and routes, in liaison with rail freight companies. We contend, however, that there is no need to specify that in the Bill, not least because it could create doubt about the status of other freight facilities, which could include bulk freight depots, road-rail interchanges and coastal freight facilities, none of which are specified in the Bill or in the amendment. The matter is better covered by guidance. I said that current guidance on local transport plans includes a specific section dealing with sustainable distribution and freight partnerships. The proposed approach is entirely consonant with the Government's purposes, but is unnecessary for the requirements of the Bill, so I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I was so excited about withdrawing my amendment that I have spilt all the water in my glass.
<P>
The Minister described me in three or four times as an hon. Member for north of the border. There are a few more such hon. Members than the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) and I, even if we are the only two in the Room.
<P>
As I said, it is interesting to observe the ding dong between the Government and the official Opposition on who is responsible for the good and the bad things. As the Government had a good story to tell, everything that has happened in the past two and a half years was their responsibility. I suspect that if the story had not been so good, they would blamed the legacy of the previous Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In defence of the Minister, I must say that he grudgingly acknowledged our positive role in the development of rail freight in Britain. Indeed, he referred to the cloying consensus. The hon. Gentleman must not become upset just because he is not a part of that consensus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I wish that I had not given way because I was about to say that I was in danger being churlish again, and I would not want to do that. In the spirit of positiveness, or whatever the word is we are having trouble with our English this afternoon—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 484, in page 55, line 10, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) those required to meet the needs of businesses trading in the authority's area,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I apologise to you, Mr. Gale, and to the Committee for my absence this morning. I had an appointment with a charming pig in Parliament square. As the state of pig farming is a matter of great concern, I decided to devote half an hour to the meeting.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that the transport facilities and services mentioned in clause 92(1) also include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``those required to meet the needs of businesses trading in the authority's area''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It raises the age-old conundrum of how business is properly represented on local government. Unlike business men in the heyday of the Victorian era, when businesses dominated local government, many of today's business men do not have time to take up duties as local councillors. I shall cite two examples affecting rural areas in which there will be conflict between the requirements of rural business and of those who will have a vote. The point is especially pertinent in respect of the Government's plans to impose substantial numbers of houses on rural areas. The current plan is to impose 36,000 new houses on my county of Shropshire, which will create conflicts with those who have businesses. In my area, 97 per cent. of freight is moved by truck and 67 per cent. of the work force—just over two thirds—drive to work. There is already friction in respect of demands for dramatic reductions in village speed limits, some of which are admirable. Such friction also arises in respect of plans to divert heavy goods vehicles around villages, as that will simply push the problem somewhere else. The amendment is sensible and would make it obligatory for the local authority to consider the requirements of business.
<P>
Another local issue relates to the change in the funding of local government. As only a small proportion of local government funds are raised locally, local government tends to bid for pots of centrally distributed money—European money, heritage money, environment money [Interruption.] Does the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) wish to intervene? I heard a sedentary chunter.
<P>
As a result, in order to bid for schemes and for those schemes to be approved, local authorities must pander to the whims and demands set by those who hand out funds centrally—often, experts or civil servants who have an urban background. That has resulted in mayhem in one or two small towns in my constituency, where so-called town enhancement schemes have caused real damage. If it had been incumbent on the local authority to take account of the concerns of local business, some of those conflicts could perhaps have been avoided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> One of the realities of serving on a Committee such as this is that members from Opposition parties usually speak extemporaneously, whereas Ministers reply by reading briefing notes. From time to time, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are assisted in preparing for debates, and I thought that it would make the life of the Committee easier, as well as mine, if I were to read my briefing note, which is revealing. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The aim is to include facilities and services required for the needs of businesses trading in the authority's area. This could be in reference to retailers but such needs (i.e. getting people to shops) would be the same as the needs of the public in that area and are already dealt with in part (a). Requirements for freight are dealt with in part (b), so they cannot be referring to that either. Therefore, it is unclear exactly what needs of the businesses they are referring to but if they come up with some decent suggestions it might be worth supporting.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I thank those who work in my office for that brief. It would be helpful if the hon. Member for Poole could give some specific examples, other than freight or retail, to which the amendment relates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): That was an interesting piece of open government from the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), I support the amendment. I have served in local government and I know that one can be blasé about changes in transport arrangements that can affect local businesses, especially traders and retailers, as the hon. Member for Bath said. Small changes to arrangements in a town can put someone out of business. Therefore, I want to tease out from the Government a little more about their policy and to draw their attention to the fact that the implementation of local transport plans can have implications for people who have worked hard to build up businesses in the local community.
<P>
When I was reading the Sunday newspapers I noticed an article in the financial section of The Mail on Sunday with the headline, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Prescott threat to drugs firm research''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The article said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``American drugs giant Pfizer is refusing to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on research and development because of the government's failure to spend just £1 million on a road link.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The refusal by John Prescott's Department of Environment, Transport and Regions to make the tiny investment has infuriated Pfizer, which has already invested nearly £1 billion in its huge research and development centre at Sandwich, Kent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If a very important business is investing a lot of money in an area that needs some infrastructure, the local transport authority should consult that business to give it the opportunity to raise its concerns, which can then be passed on to the Government when appropriate. We tabled the amendment out of concern for businesses such as Pfizer who do not feel that they are being listened to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have visited that part of Kent. The road in question is the A273 out of Dover.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> To Sandwich.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> From Dover to Sandwich. A large number of people work on the site and it is impossible to deal with the congestion, which is a serious problem. The investment will be lost to Europe. It is a classic example of how under-investment in road infrastructure damages the country's economic future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. When I first became involved in local government, there were non-domestic business ratepayers. People paid more attention to local business because it brought in more rate income. The change to local government finance and the introduction of the unified business rate post poll tax has meant that local authorities do not have as much interest in attracting factories because the income is equalised throughout the country, but there is a good argument for consulting local business because it provides jobs and creates wealth. The infrastructure needs of business should be taken into account. In Sandwich, which is not too far from your constituency, Mr. Gale, there is high unemployment and deprivation. Infrastructure is important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> May I say, on a light-hearted note, that of all the reasons that I have heard for not attending a Committee, an appointment with a pig, which is why the hon. Member for North Shropshire was absent this morning, is a new one? Such appointments may cause hon. Members to be absent from Committees, but they are rarely declared.
<P>
However, he made a number of useful points, speaking as he does on behalf of rural Britain.
<P>
The Government are not unsympathetic to the general drift of the arguments that were deployed by the hon. Members for Bath and for Poole. In response to what the hon. Member for Bath said about jargon, the guidance makes it crystal clear that business is a key local stakeholder. It needs to be a full participant in the elaboration of local transport plans. In my peregrinations around the country to meetings of regional transport partnerships, I have been pleased to see representatives of local business. Local transport plans have stimulated that involvement. That is the positive approach to the involvement of business, but a more negative aspect is its role in statutory planning procedures, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Poole. That is when it often feels under threat. There are powerful arguments for consulting local businesses. We are sympathetic to those, but we have dealt with the matter.
<P>
The hon. Members for Poole and for North Essex raised a point of detail on the east Kent access road. As you come from that neck of the woods, Mr. Gale, you will know that the Government have not refused to fund the road. The scheme has been deferred while the county council completes the necessary appraisal. Interested parties are working actively with local partners to resolve the outstanding issues. That is the real state of play, which is an encouraging message to bring to the Committee.
<P>
The burden of the amendment is that the transport facilities to be promoted by local transport authorities should include those necessary to meet the needs of businesses trading in the authority's area. As I have said before, the introduction of local transport plans has brought freight and the more general needs of business into the mainstream of local transport planning. Under the old transport, policies and programme system, authorities were never encouraged to give real consideration to freight. Our existing guidance on local transport plans make it clear that we expect authorities to develop sustainable freight distribution strategies as part of their plans— and local businesses are a key stakeholder in the development of the plan.
<P>
We support the sentiment behind the amendment, but it is unnecessary, as the needs of businesses are already covered in clause 92. First, subsection (2)(b) explicitly identifies that transport facilities include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``those required for the transportation of freight''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Secondly, businesses also depend on their customers, clients and employees being able to reach them; that is covered in subsection (2)(a), which confirms that transport facilities include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``those required to meet the needs of persons living or working in the authority's area, or visiting or travelling through that area''.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister's most recent remarks echo the words that I read from my brief. Will he congratulate the young student who produced those notes, who works in my office and who was clearly spot on?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Of course that person needs to be congratulated, but let me enter a caveat. I hope that we are not dealing here with cheap labour and that the provisions of the national minimum wage are being properly applied.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister said that subsection (2)(a) provides facilities. A business might feel that if its interests were ignored or if the interests of its workers were ignored, it might affected the viability of the company. I can cite plenty of examples that affect my constituency. For instance, in Colchester town centre, which is not in my constituency, shops and offices have been cut off by the Liberal Democrat council's ludicrous traffic changes. Would they be able to seek judicial review of the local transport plan, now that it is to be set up in statute, on the basis that creating such mayhem in private businesses is contrary to the objectives of the local plan?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that possibility. The short answer is that I have no idea. However, I shall inquire and write to the hon. Gentleman in due course.
<P>
I invite the hon. Member for North Shropshire to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am sorry that hon. Members thought that my appointment with a pig was funny—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not going down that cow-track either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> We learned during the debate of the lamentable state of research in the Liberal Democrat party. I cited two examples, but the Minister did not reply to either of them properly. One was that the requirements of local businesses that generate large volumes of traffic and require substantial numbers of freight lorries conflict with the demands of those coming from urban areas to live in new houses in the area. More important was the problem of central Government funds being distributed under pre-conceived criteria, which might conflict with the needs of isolated rural market towns. We may be able to deal with that at a later date. In the spirit of consensus, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) In complying with section 92, a local authority must consult local groups representative of cyclists, pedestrians, equestrians and disabled people.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We thought that the clause was not broad enough. We wanted to include more categories, and to give hon. Members an opportunity to explore some of the issues relating to those modes of transport.
<P>
The first category is pedestrians, on which we have already had a good discussion. As they are already included in the Bill, I shall not say much more about them. Bicycles are an important subject. We have many representations from cyclists, who do not feel that they are as loved and valued in local transport as they should be, and we sometimes hear different points of view: some organisations prefer dedicated cycle lanes, while others are keen to be part of the mainstream transport system. We have tabled the amendment to enable the Committee to discuss the needs and aspirations of cyclists, of which there are many in this country. The Netherlands, as well as other continental nations, are much more successful in encouraging cycling not only as an environmentally friendly means of transport but as one that is physically good for people. If we have a problem in this country, it is that our physique as a nation is not so good.
<P>
We also want local transport plans to include powered two-wheeled vehicles—in other words, motorcycles. There are occasionally motorcycle rallies in Poole. These days people tend to motorcycle for pleasure rather than from necessity, so they do so at weekends, but many motorcyclists use our major road network and their needs should be taken into account in the local transport plans.
<P>
The reason for including the fourth category, cars, is self-evident, but a great deal more could be done to integrate taxis and private hire vehicles into the transport system. Taxis play an important part in our lives. When one stands outside a supermarket one appreciates how important they are for many people who do not have vehicles of their own, because they enable them to do the weekly shop, load up a car and go home. Such vehicles are an important part of the transport infrastructure and we should listen to what the drivers say. The difficulty is that taxi firms tend to be independent companies that like to do things in their own way, so it is hard to find a system that makes every firm happy; but taxis are an important resource and could be much better integrated into our transport system.
<P>
The reason for including trains and trams is self-evident. We have also added waterways. One of our nation's resources, partly as a result of the industrial revolution, is our canals and fine rivers, which are not used enough in our transport infrastructure. I grew up in Wiltshire, where in post-war years a great deal of effort was put into restoring the Kennet and Avon canal; but wherever one goes in this country there are fine canals, and much more use can be made of our waterways as a means of transport.
<P>
Our intention is to broaden the debate to allow members of the Committee to express views about those important means of transport. Our associated amendment No. 489 seeks consultation with the groups that it mentions, which I am sure authorities will wish to consult anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 480 and 481. Amendment No. 480 would raise the profile of cycling in the Bill, while amendment No. 481 places a specific requirement on local authorities to consult on local transport plans, in particular with respect to cyclists, pedestrians, equestrians—horse riders—and disabled people. We believe that cycling is an important pursuit in the wider picture of our objectives to reduce congestion and pollution, thwart global warming and ensure good health and a better environment.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister may say that such objectives are already implicit in transport facilities. He may convince me that the Government, who have given various assurances, are serious about their objectives for cycling, and there may be an opportunity for withdrawal, but this is an opportunity to stress to my constituents and to the Government the importance of the national cycling strategy which, after all, aims to double the proportion of cycle journeys from 2 to 4 per cent. between 1996 and 2002, and to double it again by 2012.
<P>
That is an achievable objective. In Munich, the proportion of journeys made by cycle has risen from 6 per cent. to 15 per cent. and in York the proportion of people commuting by bicycle is 20 per cent. British statistics show that 23 million cycles are owned and that more cycles than cars are being bought. Against that backdrop, however, the amount of cycling is going down. The point is that people want to cycle, and it is incumbent on the Government and local government to provide an environment in which cycling can be enjoyed in safety and security. We reaffirm the strategic importance of cycling in the wider context of our transport plans and, more specifically, local transport plans.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is lamentable that although many school children own cycles, their use of them for getting to school is limited, and that this, together with the problems of the school run, which most of us know, makes essential that we develop an all-inclusive policy of safety in cycleways to schools? Does he also agree that the Government intend to promote that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for that helpful intervention. It is important to provide safe pathways for our children to go to school so that they are not at risk of being knocked over by speeding motorists. The Opposition have wanted to get rid of speed humps and restrictions but that would militate against this type of provision and endanger children's safety rather than encouraging them to cycle.
<P>
Provisional guidance for local transport plans states explicitly that local authorities will be expected to produce a cycling strategy as part of the local transport plan. That sounds fine, but the difficulty is that the research done by Oxford Brookes university on the provisional local transport plans submitted to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions last year showed that in practice, despite the guidance, cycling strategies have not been effectively integrated locally. Tests on the key descriptors of local transport plans scored against a maximum of four showed that the maximum achieved by a range of local authorities was 2.2, and the minimum 0.4, which was the figure in Stockton.
<P>
Local authorities have a lamentable record on integrating cycling into their plans for road safety, as well as on road audit, reductions in conflicts between vehicles, pedestrians and cycling, and providing priority for cyclists, including access to schools. We are not delivering at the moment. I seek reassurances that Ministers will make it plain that either there will be a provision in the Bill or guidance will be taken seriously, because at present it is not. We want pen to be put to paper on cycling strategies, but ultimately we want action to encourage cycling. That involves dedicated cycling lanes and must include the use of bus lanes, slower traffic—there are ambitions outside the scope of the Bill for 20 mph zones—and less traffic. There are many who want 10 per cent. reductions in town centres, protection of cyclists and a provision for cyclists always to be visible, with, in particular, a prohibition on parking in cycle lanes so that cyclists can be seen and are not knocked down.
<P>
It is essential that town centre planning takes account of the interests of not only pedestrians and the disabled, but cyclists. We have rightly moved away from out-of-town retail development. We are witnessing an enormous growth in retail car parking and traffic congestion in towns, which are, after all, where most people live. We must think clearly about the needs of pedestrians and cyclists in that context.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
More and more people are working in e-commerce, which often means working at home and bypassing commuting. More and more people in e-commerce are retailing at home. That has yet to be seen in the infrastructural development of retailing, but can be discerned in retail stock values on the stock exchange, as analysts realise that traditional retailing is in jeopardy. Local and national planners should take account of that in the terrain for cycling, commuting and retailing. Amendment No. 480 is intended to build cycling—an important part of our future—into the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 481 would require local authorities
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to consult local groups representative of cyclists, pedestrians, equestrians and disabled people.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important to consult all user groups. Under the heading of bus strategies, clause 95(1)(d) states that a local transport authority must consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``organisations appearing to the authority to be representative of users of such services.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill already provides for consultation regarding bus strategies, so the question arises whether there should be a parallel requirement for local transport plans. In practice, it is crucial that consultation takes place. Whether provision is made in the Bill or in the guidance notes is a legitimate issue, but difficult decisions will have to be made regarding local transport plans. We shall be breaking the mould and looking to the future, so it is vital that we take all communities—business, cyclists, pedestrians—with us and grasp the nettle together.
<P>
Without adequate consultation, we shall run into political and other problems, so authorities should be obliged to carry out meaningful consultation. I hope to receive adequate assurances from the Minister on that. The Government must signal their commitment to a culture that encourages cycling and to an environment that makes it safe and enjoyable.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have the honour of being one of the few members of the Committee who arrived at work this morning on my bicycle—[Interruption.] Oh, I see that other members of the Committee make the same claim. It is everyone's privilege to choose the mode of transport that they prefer, and we want to enable people to choose cycling much more easily than at present. The Government could pursue many measures to encourage that.
<P>
The national cycling strategy mentioned by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central was in fact the strategy launched by my combative and aspirant friend, Steve Norris. He intends to pursue the national cycling strategy vigorously when he is elected mayor of London. I can tell the hon. Member for Croydon, Central that Steve Norris's targets when he launched the strategy, which have been adopted by the Government, are becoming the despair of the cycling community. It no longer believes that the targets will be met. We need to debate how best to promote cycling.
<P>
Interestingly, cycling seems to be taking off in certain areas. London is changing and becoming a much more cycling-friendly environment. Contrary to popular opinion, central London is a safe place to ride a bicycle, apart from some hotspots. I do not envy any cyclist trying to negotiate Hyde Park corner: the new crossover there is welcome. Traffic in central London moves slowly so it is safer than many other places for cyclists.
<P>
Motorists' awareness of cycles is definitely changing. More cycles are on the road and motorists are becoming more aware of them, which creates a safer environment for cyclists. It is possible to do a lot more. People say that they do not cycle in this country because of the climate. There are plenty other countries where cycling is much more prevalent than here, such as Denmark or Holland, which have colder and more severe winters that we have in this country, so that is not an excuse.
<P>
People say that this country is too hilly. Cycling in Switzerland is considerably more widespread than it is here. Cycling and hills are not necessarily mutually exclusive. There are plenty of flat parts of the country, such as East Anglia. Cycling is prevalent in many towns and cities, such as Oxford, York and Cambridge. I do not know whether Bath is a cycling city, but much more can be done to make cycling more popular.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, Central referred to schools. The ``safe routes to schools'' policy was another policy that was launched by the previous Government, which I am pleased to see that this Government have taken over. In some schools, 60 per cent. of the pupils of cycle to school, such as those in Ipswich and St. Albans. There is a school in the Isle of Wight where children made it their own project to enable cycling to increase. They lobbied the local authority about cycling facilities to enable them to cycle safely to school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the good policies for cycling and the fact that there is limited progress in the towns to which he refers comes within the climate of the voluntary approach? Under the Bill, the approach is more mandatory and regulatory, and allows the development of cycling strategies along the lines to which he is alluding at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In some towns and cities, cycling is widespread and such activity has been achieved by the voluntary approach. We can achieve far more by consent and consensus than by the Downing street policy unit deciding that cycling will be imposed on communities. That is not the way ahead. The voluntary approach is the right way to change people's attitudes and provide them with choice.
<P>
We must analyse why people leave bicycles in their garages. Many people have bicycles, but never use them. Why are our garages designed so that the car must be taken out of the garage before the bicycle can be removed? Under the Dutch national cycle plan there is guidance that garages must be a certain amount wider than the cars to allow space for bicycles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The hon. Gentleman is shamelessly endearing. On the one hand, he is against any sort of regulation while, on the other, he tells us with some admiration in his voice that the Dutch specify the width of garages so that bikes can be kept in them. I can put my own bloody bike away, without the Dutch telling me how to do it!
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Now we are finding out who the real dinosaurs are. I do not blame the hon. Gentleman. The world has changed a great deal since he first came into the House.
<P>
If we can, we must change the attitude to cycling. Those minor measures that have a disproportionate effect are the ones that we can use to support a voluntary approach rather than have a compulsory blanket national plan for cycling about which I have some scepticism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> As for minor issues, is the hon. Gentleman aware that it is almost impossible for a member of the public to ride a bicycle to visit the Palace of Westminster, given that the current security arrangements and the lack of bicycle storage areas in its vicinity mean that many who would like to cycle here are unable to do so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I agree. I have had discussions about providing more cycling facilities. Indeed, I asked every Department about that, inquiring what facilities they provided for people visiting on bicycle. The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), may remember replying to my inquiry and dealing with brickbats from his colleagues, as some Departments responding to my query were sorely lacking in facilities. Surely Government should put their own house in order before lecturing people and businesses about promoting cycling.
<P>
We must engender an attitudinal change by encouraging people to put the dangers of cycling into proportion. Often, the perception of risk is greater than the reality. Cycling can make a big contribution to traffic reduction—a matter close to the heart of the hon. Member for Bath. Personally, I believe that cycling has an important role in future transport policies.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary reassure us that the Government continue to take the matter seriously? Will he explain how national cycling targets will be achieved? At the moment, it does not seem that they will be met. Will he address school transport and cycling? Parents often believe that letting their children cycle to school is letting them dice with death every day of the week. What measures can be taken to make cycling safe for children going to school? A lot of congestion in towns and city centres is caused by the school run.
<P>
Children are attracted to cycling. Indeed, bicycles are the teenagers' motor car, providing freedom and independence from the charabanc on which they depend, to their parents' chagrin.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The amendment mentions taxis, private hire vehicles and powered two-wheeled vehicles.
<P>
Motor cycles or powered two-wheelers have benefits in rural areas and congested urban areas. They are especially important in rural areas, where transport is inevitably limited and walking may be unrealistic. Motor cycling provides a cheap form of independence and is especially valuable to jobseekers who may not receive much cash for what they do and those going to places of training. The inclusion of powered two-wheeled vehicles would be worth while as it should be incumbent on local authorities to consider parking places for such vehicles.
<P>
I turn briefly to taxis and private hire vehicles. Possibly as a result of drink-driving legislation, taxis have become a common means of transport in rural areas, giving people the benefit of mobility and independence. That should be taken into account when transport plans are drawn up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> This has been an interesting debate on two separate issues. The hon. Member for Poole spoke about arrangements to list groups or modes of travel that could be served by transport facilities promoted under local transport plans. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central spoke about provision for cyclists: a subject that occupied most of the ensuing discussion. I shall address each issue in turn.
<P>
While we would expect to see all modes of transport addressed in a local transport plan, there is no need to include a list of that kind. Indeed, there would be a danger in doing so, because anything that is omitted from the list could be deemed to have been excluded intentionally. Bearing in mind our earlier debate about the importance of business interests, the absence of a reference to HGVs or freight vehicles in the list might be deemed a positively unhelpful measure, discouraging consultation with and provision for such modes of transport. I do not think that I could give a clearer illustration of the danger of lists. I hope that hon. Member for Poole will understand that while we sympathise entirely with the objective of the amendment, we do not feel that including such a list is sensible.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 480 would prescribe that facilities for cyclists be included. Hon. Members will note that we explicitly refer to facilities and services for pedestrians, but there is a good reason for that: in conventional terms, pedestrians are not defined as using a mode of transport. It may not appear to be common sense to us, but that is the usage. If pedestrians were not separately listed and identified, it could be deemed that they had been excluded, whereas people who travel on two, four, six or eight wheels or on boats or other forms of transport are all deemed to be using a mode of transport. That is why there is no need for a separate definition of different modes of transport. While I fully understand the wish of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central to see a specific reference to cycling—I pay tribute to him and to the cycling organisations for the way in which they have raised public awareness of this issue—it is adequately covered already because the generic definition includes cyclists.
<P>
The Government support the national cycling strategy and its central target, which is to quadruple the amount of cycling by 2012. Clearly, these provisions are germane to the question of the hon. Member for North Essex about whether that target is achievable. We believe that it is and it is our objective to achieve it. However, it will not happen if we do not have good plans in place across the country which, among other things, encourage people to use their bicycles. Good progress is being made with the strategy, but the real results will not be seen for a few years, when the improved facilities that we are seeking to encourage come on stream.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath mentioned the facilities here in the Palace of Westminster and the hon. Member for North Essex said that he came here by bicycle, which is thoroughly commendable. He also talked about the questions that he had put to Government Departments. I am pleased to say that I remember the reply that I gave him on that. The DETR has been exemplary in making provision for people who come to work by bike—they should be encouraged in that. We believe in setting an example and encouraging others to do what we suggest. There is no question of us preaching to other people without doing it ourselves.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I cannot resist pointing out that the Under-Secretary's Department has also substantially increased the number of cars in its fleet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The Department is very much larger since we combined the Departments of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The one thing that the hon. Gentleman will notice about the DETR's car fleet is that it has been substantially converted to use liquified petroleum gas and other environmentally friendly fuels, illustrating the Department's commitment to our objectives.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex said that the national cycling strategy had been launched by Steve Norris. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman wants to take every opportunity to mention the good Mr. Norris's name in connection with the forthcoming mayoral elections in London. However, my recollection of Mr. Norris is of someone who is more at home behind the wheel of a BMW than on a bicycle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> He would be most upset. It was a Jaguar. The Minister should be careful if he is going to criticise Jaguar drivers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was simply recalling the fact that in a previous life Mr. Norris had been a BMW salesman. If he had so little confidence in his own product and chose to drive another car, how can I comment? The Department is encouraging all local authorities to improve facilities for cyclists. The guidance for local authorities on local transport plans is clear that local cycling strategies should be formulated as part of the process.
<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton:</B> A number of references have been made to guidance and draft guidance. Would it be possible to circulate them to members of the Committee when we consider the clauses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend has already spoken to my hon. Friend the Member for Streatham about this. I can confirm the assurance that he gave her. We will circulate the existing guidance on the provisional plans as soon as possible. The guidance on the definitive plans is still in preparation, and will be for a while yet. The existing guidance already emphasises that authorities should include policies for improving facilities for cyclists in their local transport plans. That is already provided for in the Bill, as facilities for cyclists are included in the definition of transport facilities.
<P>
Considerable progress has been made in many parts of the country to promote cycling. For example, two thirds of the London cycle network is now complete. I had the considerable privilege of opening a section of the network along the Thames between Woolwich and Thamesmead, which had been successfully developed by Sustrans and the local authority. It is again testimony to what can be done when people work together to improve cycling provision.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex spoke about encouraging pupils to cycle to school. I am pleased to tell him that the recent report of the School Travel Advisory Group, otherwise known as STAG, produced some useful proposals for encouraging cycle travel to school, which we expect to incorporate in the guidance. I hope that that answers his question.
<P>
Amendment No. 481 seeks to specify the need to consult groups that represent cyclists but it presents the same problem as specifying cyclists in the contents of plan—it creates doubt about the groups that are not listed. I hope that my hon. Friend will therefore recognise that while we have every intention of continuing to consult cyclists and we obviously wish local authorities to include cyclists in their development plans, it would be inappropriate to mention cyclists specifically as it would imply that other groups not mentioned should not be consulted. I am sure that it is not his intention.
<P>
Our approach is that all interested group, including transport users, should have the opportunity to participate actively in the development of local transport policies. The need for authorities to achieve effective participation is made very clear in our existing guidance. I am more than happy to make the commitment here to the Committee that the statutory guidance that will be issued under clause 93(6) will be equally clear on the point, including the need for authorities to consult groups that appear, in the opinion of the authority, to represent of cyclists. I hope that on the basis of those undertakings, and the clarification of various issues raised by hon. Members, the Committee will accept that the amendments are not necessary. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his response. Our amendment should be seen in the context of providing a forum for debate rather than an exhaustive list. As he pointed out, we managed to miss out hang-gliders. Nevertheless we have had a useful debate, which has shown that cyclists are important. Twenty million people cycle. If public transport is to be used more, people will have to travel to stations and bus stations, and to where they want to go at the other end. The interaction of cyclists with trains and buses is critical. As Members of Parliament, we know that cyclists are annoyed when there is room for only five bicycles on a train. Occasionally, there are almost fights on train platforms as to who gets a cycle on to a train, and there is often no provision for tandems.
<P>
In the light of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The next amendment is amendment No. 12, with which it will be convenient to take new clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I have not withdrawn my amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman does not have to withdraw his amendment, as it has not been moved. He sought some advice earlier. When amendments are called that relate to other clauses, they are called formally only when they are reached on the selection list, although they may be debated at another time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 55, line 11, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The policies mentioned in subsection (1) must include policies for improving safety for all road users and pedestrians.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 1—National road safety plan—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) The Secretary of State shall develop and implement policies for the promotion of the safety of all road users.
<P>
(2) The Secretary of State shall prepare each year a document which shall be known as the national road safety plan containing his policies under subsection (1), which shall be laid before Parliament for approval by both Houses of Parliament before coming into effect.
<P>
(3) The plan shall contain targets for the reductions of deaths and injuries among all road users and pedestrians and explanations of the means for achieving those reductions.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The key point of amendment No. 12 is to add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must include policies for improving safety for all road users and pedestrians''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to the Bill. For a considerable part of the Committee, we have talked about National Air Traffic Services and the importance of the culture of safety that is part of that business. However, on this part of the Bill, we have not put the strong emphasis on safety that is necessary. All hon. Members realise the importance of road safety and the fact that there are far too many drivers and pedestrians are injured in accidents.
<P>
Our country has a good record in terms of reducing the number of people killed on roads, but none of us can be complacent, because one death is too many. The Economist printed an interesting article on road safety this week. It pointed out that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Britain has a decent record on road safety. Deaths on the roads have been declining and are currently at their lowest level since 1926, when traffic levels were much lower.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are winning the war, but we have a long way to go. There is a black spot on the record: our child fatalities on the road are the second highest after Ireland. We must focus our concern and discussions on the problem of children being knocked down.
<P>
I know that the Government will soon introduce their road safety strategy. It is a pity that it has been delayed as long as it has, but I appreciate that it is important to get things right and that many people have to be consulted. If road safety were an integral part of local transport plans, that would put the focus needed on the issue. When plans for anything are considered, safety must be critical, and we must make it as much a part of the culture in terms of road transport and other forms of transport as it was on the other part of the Bill.
<P>
The key point of new clause 1 is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State shall develop and implement policies for the promotion of the safety of all road users.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is self-evident, and I hope that all members of the Committee aspire to that goal.
<P>
The new clause also states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State shall prepare each year a document which shall be known as the national road safety plan containing his policies under subsection (1), which shall be laid before Parliament for approval by both Houses of Parliament before coming into effect.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is extremely important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): Can the hon. Gentleman square the idea of having a plan that must be produced every year with the comments made earlier by the hon. Member for North Essex?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> rose—
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I think that I should answer the hon. Gentleman. A national plan on road safety is essential. It is easy to make quick political points on a serious subject. I attended a BBC-sponsored debate earlier this week, which was shown on ``Newsnight'', and there is no doubt that there are strong feelings on this subject.
<P>
We are aiming, through the amendments, to focus attention on the safety issue. It is not an add-on, but an integral part of the development of policies that local authorities and national Government must make.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> A major distinction is that the clause directs the Secretary of State to do something rather than local authorities. That is what the law is about—telling Governments what to do. The clause tells the Government to produce an annual road safety plan instead of simply promising it in their manifesto. They promised it for the autumn in their annual report last summer and we are still waiting for their road safety strategy, which is now overdue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for those comments.
<P>
Apart from laying the safety plan before Parliament—
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I shall make a little progress and then give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
New clause 1(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The plan shall contain targets for the reductions of deaths and injuries among all road users and pedestrians and explanations of the means for achieving those reductions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is critical. The trend is downward. The changes in the drink-driving attitude over the past 20 to 30 years have meant that it is now socially unacceptable to drink and drive, and that has changed the whole atmosphere. If we can achieve the same culture for safety, we can make good progress.
<P>
I have no doubt that when the Government produce their new road safety strategy, that, too, will contain targets. We could have a debate on the right targets. We know that Sweden has a zero tolerance target. I found the BBC lecture interesting because it was pointed out that the moment a zero target was adopted, the death rate went up. Nevertheless, it is important to have targets. There are a number of means by which one can meet the targets, apart from within the culture. Road maintenance is one factor in road safety. As local transport plans will make proposals to the Government, which will lead to grant and capital expenditure, it is essential to have a comprehensive plan for proper and sensible road maintenance, which leads to safe driving.
<P>
We all know that excessive speed can lead to more deaths on the road. Road design is another factor. We know that, as technology moves on, the design of roads and the materials used can be a factor in saving people's lives. Should central barriers be installed? The danger is that they can sometimes cause more accidents, but fewer people are killed, because there are fewer head-on collisions. All these factors must be considered in the context of local transport plans. Great strides have already been made in engineering to make vehicles safer, but more can be done. Safe and sensible driver education is needed, as well as pedestrian education. Therefore, the educational role is also critical to safety.
<P>
We believe that the safety issue should be central to national and local Government planning processes if this country is to maintain its good record on road deaths and continue to reduce the numbers killed and injured. We all know of the high cost of accidents to insurance companies, the NHS and everyone else. If can continue our steady improvement, it will not only save lives, but will make society much better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The new clause proposes that the Secretary of State should be required to issue an annual road safety plan, including road safety policies and casualty reduction targets. The plan would have to be approved by both Houses of Parliament before coming into effect. As my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley rightly pointed out, that is somewhat at variance with the philosophy advanced by the hon. Member for North Essex earlier today. He argued that he was opposed to unnecessary bureaucratic impositions that would require people to do things that they would do anyway, without the statutory obligation. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman had to leave the Committee—he passed me a note to explain that he had a meeting at 7 o'clock, and I thank him for that courtesy. I hope that he will not object to my referring to his contribution in his absence, but I must say to the hon. Member for Poole that it was an example of inconsistency.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex also advanced a strange constitutional theory, which I have not previously heard, that the purpose of legislation is to tell the Government what to do. I look forward to the hon. Gentleman's return to the Committee, when we can explore that most interesting constitutional doctrine. It might provide some insight into the future of the Conservative party.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole rightly highlighted the fact that although this country has a good record on road safety, of which we can be proud in many respects, there are many problems, especially in relation to accidents involving children. Much greater focus should be given to further improving our performance. The Government are about to publish a new road safety strategy for the next 10 years, which will include stretching new targets to reduce the number of people who are killed and injured in road accidents. There will be a separate and more demanding target to reduce the number of children who are killed or seriously injured. That will address the concern that the hon. Gentleman rightly highlighted.
<P>
The new strategy will set out a comprehensive package of measures to improve road safety for all road users. It will cover a wide range of road safety issues, including many that the hon. Member for Poole mentioned—driver training and testing, enforcement, speed policy, child safety, safety of vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians, motorcycle safety, driver impairment through drink, drugs or fatigue, safety of road infrastructure and plans for road safety publicity. Progress will be monitored continuously, and formal reviews will be carried out every three years. Those will be overseen by the proposed road safety advisory panel, which will include representatives of all the main stakeholders.
<P>
Improving road safety requires a longer-term plan. Local authorities and others need to factor the Government's policies into their local plans, and have confidence that the approach will not change every year. We need clear long-term casualty reduction targets, which are well understood and supported, and a comprehensive strategic plan. Annual plans, with annually changing targets, simply would not meet that requirement, and could be confusing.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 12 is to require authorities to include a road safety strategy in their local transport plans. Clearly, local authorities should have a strategy for improving road safety, but a specific power in that respect is not necessary. There is a duty under clause 92(1) to include such strategies, and section 39 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 already puts local authorities under a legal duty to promote road safety in their areas and, when a problem with accidents is identified, to take the necessary measures to remedy it.
<P>
However hard we try, we are unlikely to come up with an entirely comprehensive list of which elements should be contained in a plan. Nor can we anticipate developments and what it might be desirable, in due course, to add. The danger in attempting to be more specific is that it would create doubts about whether those elements that are not specified were excluded deliberately.
<P>
The appropriate coverage of plans is much better addressed in the guidance, which appears under clause 93(6). Indeed, our existing guidance already asks authorities to include a road safety strategy in local transport plans, and the guidance under clause 93(6) will require that under future statutory local transport plans. I therefore submit that the amendment is unnecessary, and invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for that answer. I think that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are keenly aware of the importance of saving more lives on the road. In that spirit, I beg to ask to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 446, in page 55, line 13, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In formulating the local transport plan under subsection (3) a local transport authority shall have regard to regional planning guidance and to the local authority development plans for the area and shall seek to further the objectives set out therein.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A theme of our discussions today has been the importance of integration in transport. For example, I referred earlier to concerns about how the needs of the disabled should be addressed. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee acknowledge the importance of integrating those needs into a wide range of different activities.
<P>
Local government and the burgeoning regional arms of government have a number of duties to perform, which are often imposed on them by central Government. We need to ensure that any new requirements that are placed on local government are integrated with the various other relevant functions of local councils and regional arms of government. The amendment merely proposes that there must be integration between those various activities.
<P>
When the Minister responds, he will probably suggest that the matter is appropriately dealt with under the guidance, and seek to persuade me that that is sufficient. Before he does so, however, I should like to say more about the genuine concerns that exist about the lack of integration. As evidence, I cite the example of the Local Government Association's document ``Making Connections'', which surveyed local authority plans for integrated transport. The guidance includes a requirement that there be consultation with a wide range of different bodies and, appropriately, reference is made to the need to consult other authorities.
<P>
It is therefore somewhat disturbing that in their responses to the survey, local authorities admitted that a surprisingly small number of councils consulted their regional development agencies or, in the case of Wales, the Welsh Development Agency. The figures are disappointing. They reflect a failure of some local authorities to consult significantly their regional development agencies. More important, 52 per cent. of the RDAs that were consulted by local councils failed to respond to the councils' requests for comments on their proposed local development plans.
<P>
Local councils want to ensure that there is a two-way flow of information and integration of the various functions of RDAs, regional planning guidance and their own regional development plans. Even if the Minister persuades me that that may be given in guidance, I trust that he will bear in mind my particular concerns and provide comfort that the Department will address why RDAs have not been as supportive and helpful to local councils on local transport plans as the Minister and I would like.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Bath raised a perfectly valid point and I trust that he will not take my reluctance to accept his amendment as an indication that I am less friendly to him than my hon. Friend.
<P>
I confess that I was a little surprised to hear my hon. Friend refer to Bath as the finest urban landscape in the country. I represent a constituency with a claim to that. I have as good a collection of fine historic architecture as Bath; our river is larger than Bath's; and the hon. Gentleman does not have a dome in his constituency.
<P>
However, possible local rivalry does not cloud my judgment in any way. There is nothing objectionable in the principle behind the amendment. However, it is unnecessary because, as the hon. Gentleman anticipated, the matter will be covered in guidance to be issued under clause 93(6). Furthermore, specifying that authorities should have regard to regional planning guidance—specifically development plans—could, as I said earlier, unwittingly create the impression that authorities should not have regard to other guidance, including planning policy guidance issued by the Department. That would be most unfortunate.
<P>
I accept the hon. Gentleman's concern about the relatively poor and disappointing levels of consultation achieved in the first round, especially in relation to RDAs. However, two special factors must be taken into account. First, RDAs had only just come into existence and faced many other critical challenges, notably producing their own regional economic development strategies which, as we were rightly pressing them, should be a top priority.
<P>
Secondly, not all local authorities had got their act together at that preliminary stage. However, they will have done so once the Bill is enacted and the development of local transport plans is an obligation in statute. Therefore, we hope and believe that performance on consultation with RDAs and other appropriate bodies will be better and more effective in future. We shall certainly monitor the position to ensure that that is so. I trust that the hon. Gentleman accepts that his amendment, although entirely well motivated, is unnecessary and could have one or two undesirable consequences. I hope, therefore, that he will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister makes a reasonable and reasoned case, although it was spoilt by his opening remarks. Indeed, it was rather surprising that he dared to mention the dome.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not aware that the Minister is the Member for Xanadu. However, we shall not go down that road.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Far be it from me to go against any ruling, Mr. Gale. However, had you been patient and listened to the next three words that I wanted to utter, you would not have found it necessary to call me to order.
<P>
I anticipated the Minister's likely response in my opening remarks. Nevertheless, it was important to have those assurances on the record. I am grateful to the Minister for providing assurance that RDA consultation will improve. I trust that the Minister will examine the matter personally to ensure that his assurances turn into reality. With those few remarks, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
