<H4><center>MORATORIUM WHERE DIRECTORS</center></H4>
PROPOSE VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 28, line 30, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Functions of the Financial Services Authority<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 45 and 37.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Further to your comments about our making rapid progress, Mr. Gale, all I can say is, ``If only!''
<P>
Three amendments need to be made to take account of the effects of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Part XXIV of the Act sets out the rights of the Financial Services Authority—which I shall refer to as ``the authority''—to participate in insolvency procedures involving regulated persons and companies doing financial services business.
<P>
The basic idea is that the authorities should be able to act in circumstances wherein financial services consumers may not have the resources or the expertise to take any requisite action themselves. The Act gives the authority the same rights as creditors to petition, for example, for the winding up of an insolvent financial services company. It also has the right to attend and speak at creditors' meetings, to apply to the court and to be heard on applications made by another person during insolvency proceedings. It would be inconsistent and leave a gap in the regulatory regime if the authority did not have similar rights in respect of the new company voluntary arrangement provision as it has under other insolvency procedures. The amendments are designed to prevent inconsistencies and gaps.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): As the Minister says, the amendments are a belated attempt to streamline the Bill's moratorium provisions and get them into line with provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 that have yet to come into force. It is a good example of joined-up government swinging into action after the Bill's Second Reading. I wish to make three brief points; I do not expect the Minister to answer them, because such matters should receive further consideration and, if necessary, be discussed on Report.
<P>
A new body, known as ``the authority'', has been introduced into the game. Paragraph 29(2) to new schedule A1 sets out clearly the persons who are to be summoned to a creditors' meeting, so it might be necessary to add a reference to the authority in that list. Proposed new paragraph 43A broadly provides that the Financial Services Authority should have the right in relation to such regulated companies to receive notice and exercise certain rights when a moratorium is in force. Therefore, the nominee is at risk of being fined if he fails to send appropriate notices to the FSA without a reasonable excuse. However, the nominee may not know that he is dealing with a regulated company, so a regulation should be introduced to ensure that the nominee is informed by various officers of the company that he is dealing with a regulated company.
<P>
The Government should make it clear that the information that directors who want a moratorium have to provide to a nominee must state that, if the company has been or is an authorised person or representative in the terms of the FSMA, it has not carried out and is not carrying out a regulated activity within that meaning, to the best of the director's knowledge. That point should be cleared up so that there is no possible confusion.
<P>
The Government should make provision for the FSA to be entitled to apply to the court if it is dissatisfied with any act, omission or decision of the supervisor of a voluntary arrangement that has been implemented following a moratorium. Also, it should be allowed to be heard on any such application brought for another purpose. Amendment No. 43 makes express provision for the FSA to have a right to apply and to be heard in respect of the challenge of decisions. There is a related proposal to amend the Insolvency Act 1986, which also deals with challenges to decisions. Amendment No. 43 makes no corresponding provision in relation to the FSA's right to apply to be heard on challenges to the conduct of a supervisor during the voluntary arrangement. Creditors have a right, which corresponds broadly to the existing power under section 1 of the 1986 Act, to apply to the court to control the activities of the supervisor in a voluntary arrangement agreed without a moratorium. It is clearly desirable for the FSA to have such rights.
<P>
I do not ask the Minister to reply to those points now. If he would like me to write to him in further detail, he has only to give me a nod.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I did nod, but I realise that I should nod standing up rather than sitting down.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 29, leave out lines 3 to 7.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 27, in page 29, line 11, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or by the company.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The amendment is a probing one. We need to understand why the prescriptive procedure is required, and why flexibility should not be provided to allow the management of a company or its creditors access to the normal range of options.
<P>
The intention of the provisions in part VI of the schedule is straightforward: they are designed to give the courts the power to wind up a company when a moratorium has finished without a voluntary arrangement coming into effect. As the Association of Business Recovery Professionals pointed out, there is a difficulty about why further grounds to wind a company up need to be introduced when section 122 of the Insolvency Act 1986 already provides the grounds for such an action in every conceivable eventuality. It has also been argued that moratoriums may terminate without voluntary agreements having been approved and that companies may be rescued using other mechanisms. Alternative insolvency arrangements may be more appropriate.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I welcome the fact that the hon. Gentleman is maintaining a constructive approach in spite of the fact that his neck is frozen. It cannot be easy to be constructive when one is in such pain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am glad that you moved the pain down six inches—most people think that it is my head that is frozen.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I did not move it at all.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Charity gets rebuke.
<P>
Section 122 of the Insolvency Act 1986 lists most of the circumstances in which the court may wind up a company. The amendment effected by paragraph 6 will add to that list circumstances in which, at the end of a moratorium, no voluntary arrangement has been approved. When, at the end of a moratorium, a company has been unable to reach an accommodation with its creditors, it will almost certainly be in considerable financial difficulty, as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) just outlined. Cessation of business is probably almost inevitable, and liquidation is highly likely—and probably appropriate.
<P>
We therefore believe that, when a moratorium has not resulted in the approval and implementation of a voluntary arrangement, that fact should constitute a ground to support a creditor's winding-up petition. That will save a creditor who wants to take that step the expense and delay necessarily involved in showing that the company is insolvent according to the tests laid down in section 123 of the Insolvency Act. However, that does not mean that liquidation will be inevitable, as some have suggested. The court will, of course, retain its discretion on whether to make a winding-up order on such an application. If it does not consider it appropriate to exercise its discretion to make a winding-up order, no order will be made, notwithstanding the fact that the company has failed to secure agreement to a voluntary arrangement following a moratorium. I therefore invite the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> As I said, it is a probing amendment. I did not intend to press it to a Division, unlike in the case of the £500 provision, which made it all right to commit a crime worth £499.99, while for £500 a person's hands would be chopped off. In that spirit of comradeship, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 29, line 18, leave out from `Part 1' to end of line 19.
<P>
The amendment reflects our desire to shorten the Bill in the interests of simplicity. A convincing case can be made for extending the protections of the Insolvency Act 1986, which prevents suppliers of gas, electricity and water from making settlements arrears a condition of future supplies for the period of the moratorium. That is a sensible condition that we all understand. However, I have serious doubts about whether the nominee is likely to be prepared to accept personal liability for future supplies unless he or she has full cash or other security cover. Such security must come from the company. If it is available to the nominee, it should also be available to the utility supplier, and if it is, nothing will be gained by the provision in paragraph 8(2) on page 29. The inclusion of nominees in the list of office holders is, therefore, superfluous and we have a splendid opportunity to simplify and shorten the Bill.
<P>
I appreciate that throwing that at the Minister relatively cold might not be the best way to elicit a satisfactory answer. I hope that he will not take the advice to say no absolutely at this stage, but that he will consider the matter and, perhaps, table an amendment on Report.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I appreciate every attempt to shorten and clarify legislation. However, paragraph 8 extends section 233 of the Insolvency Act 1986 to cover supplies of gas, water and telecommunications services during the period of a moratorium. Consequently, the suppliers of those services may make it a condition of supply during a moratorium that the nominee personally guarantees the payment of the charges for that supply. However, they cannot make it a condition of supply that any charges outstanding when the moratorium starts are paid. The amendment would mean that such service suppliers could hold a company in a moratorium to ransom by forcing it to pay its existing debt as a condition for supply during a moratorium. There is no good reason why a creditor should be able to obtain a preference in this procedure and not in other insolvency procedures.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Does the Minister agree that the provision is analogous to those on leasehold property earlier in the Bill? Without the services, the business cannot function.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I agree. There is a parallel and such provision is an important component of the whole moratorium business.
<P>
We are discussing an important provision that applies to all forms of insolvency procedures, including the current company voluntary arrangement procedure. In our view, no good argument has been advanced as to why the amendment should succeed. I therefore recommend that the hon. Member for South West Hertfordshire asks leave to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I should like to take my amendment away and reconsider it. Its purpose is not as the Minister described. Far be it from me to suggest that he is wrong; he is undoubtedly right and I am mistaken. The amendment is not intended to introduce a ransom provision. Bearing in mind all the amendments that the Government have had to table to rectify omissions in earlier provisions, I delicately suggest that they, too, reconsider the amendment. If necessary, we will table a similar proposal on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Schedule 1, as amended, agreed to.

Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>COMPANY VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Austin Mitchell </B>(Great Grimsby): I beg to move amendment No. 55, in Schedule 2, page 31, line 33, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ab) In subsection (2)(a), after ``creditors'' there is inserted ``and employee representatives''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No.56, in Schedule 2, page 33, line 31, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) after subsection (4) there is inserted—
<P>
``(4A) The supervisor shall owe a duty of care to the employees of the company''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The amendments are straightforward and seek to protect the interests of workers and employees, which should play a larger part in the provisions for voluntary arrangements. Those interests should be paramount, not least as they concern the continued existence and support of the company, and are greater in that respect than those of outside creditors. Such interests can be of greater importance also than those of the company owner or shareholders. That is why it is important that employees' representatives should be present at the creditors' meeting. Employees will, of course, be creditors, as there will presumably be old wagers who can make a claim if the arrangement does not work out. However, there is no formal provision for their representation or any consultation with them. If employees are union members, their trade union will be their representative, although it will not have a direct interest in the liquidation as it is not a creditor with a financial stake. None the less, it will be the most practical and straightforward way of consulting employees and showing that their interests are safeguarded.
<P>
Amendment No. 56 is simple and may be an alternative to providing that the supervisor shall owe a duty of care to the employees of the company. Under the Bill, the supervisor is being allowed an extraordinarily light burden of obligations. To whom is he responsible? How far will he pursue his own interests? Why does not he owe a duty of care to a section of the interest involved? The paramount interest should be that of the employees of the company. It is therefore legitimate, first, to impose a duty of care, and, secondly, to impose a duty of care to employees. Such a provision, which is a voluntary arrangement, can and should be extended to bigger companies as it proves successful.
<P>
I shall probably table amendments on Report—these will be welcomed with glad joy—to increase the size of the companies to which the provision applies. The bigger the company, the better the prospects for the intrusion of workers' views. The pattern should be set for smaller companies to safeguard interests through employee representation or the imposition of a duty of care on the supervisor. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister is concerned about the position of employees in that situation, and I hope that he will at least consider that important issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): One of the problems experienced by many employees of small companies is that much employment protection law does not apply to them. Is it not even more vital that they have protection to ensure that the moratorium works, as their jobs are at stake?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> That is right. That is why it is important to introduce such a degree of protection—to cover the lacunae in the legislative framework. I accept that there might be practical difficulties in implementing the provision. No doubt an enormous number of notes on the practical difficulties will have flowed from civil servants and advisers.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have only one page.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> That is a short list of difficulties. Clearly, my hon. Friend the Minister will welcome the provision with glad enthusiasm if that is the best that the obstacle creators and alarmists can do. The amendment therefore will be more straightforward than I thought. We should consider how the provision could be implemented to ensure protection for workers in the organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I hope that I can provoke the Minister into an explanation of the tort and those individuals who have a right, in tort, against the actions of a supervisor. We have discussed that generally in terms of nominees. It is about 30 years since I attended law lectures and studied tort, and it is a major lacuna in my knowledge. I look forward to hearing what the Minister says about employees' existing rights under tort bearing in mind remoteness and causation. Employees may already have some rights in tort against a supervisor, as the Minister said in his comments on nominees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Simpson </B>(Nottingham, South): I rise to support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). In our previous sitting, I mentioned the closure of Sturmey-Archer in my constituency. I went to the creditors' meeting in Birmingham that dealt with the liquidation and was painfully struck by the fact that some of the workers who had been employed in that company—they had turned up on that fateful Friday morning expecting to be able to work as usual but had been turned away, having been told that there was no work or wages and that they would not get any redundancy packages because the company was insolvent—had made their way to it.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby's point is so important because that meeting was such a shambles that it had to be abandoned and reconvened. Several of the workers who attended it stated that they would not be able to attend the reconvened meeting a week later because they simply had no money at all. Many of them had worked for the company for 30 years and had been paid cash weekly; they had no savings and some of them did not even have bank accounts. They had had to borrow money to get to Birmingham.
<P>
If we are to protect and respect employees' interests, we have to realise that sometimes only the trade union will be able to afford to attend the creditors' meeting. Not to include a specific obligation for that in the Bill would mean that those who have put the best part of their working lives into keeping companies viable are put at the sharpest end of the casualties caused by their collapse. It would be remiss not to recognise that specific provision may be necessary to ensure that employees' interests are not overlooked when they cannot make representations themselves.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that employers will invariably be creditors and can probably—I await the Minister's response—appoint proxies to act for them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simpson:</B> I, too, would welcome my hon. Friend the Minister's clarification on proxies. My only reservation is that the appointment of proxies presumes a knowledge and understanding that one has the right to appoint them. It is difficult to assert a right about which one has no knowledge, as was abundantly clear at the creditors' meeting that I attended. Many of the workers present were bereft of understanding what had happened. The idea that they could appoint someone to represent them had not crossed their minds; it certainly did not cross mine. It is incumbent on us to put such rights positively in place rather than depending on workers discovering them. We have a duty of care to put the people who kept companies going at the forefront of our consideration rather than giving them residual rights that can be exercised only if they know how to do so.
<P>
I therefore hope that the Minister addresses the proposal, even if he cannot accept the form in which it is expressed in the amendment. It is essential to incorporate that component into the Bill because workers in small firms are likely to have fewer rights than those in the mainstream work force. The lack of cover under normal employment protection laws places a burden on us to write a duty of care into the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I welcome this short debate because the issue is important. I have offered to consider on Report any new form of amendment No. 28 that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire might table. In the same spirit, I undertake to consider any new ideas generated by this debate.
<P>
I owe the Committee an explanation of the Government's position. We do not consider amendments Nos. 55 and 56 to be appropriate. If employees are owed wages and are creditors, they will be invited to the creditors' meeting. If employees have been paid up to the day before the moratorium begins but are not creditors or shareholders and have no financial stake in the company—aside from the fact that they are stakeholders and generate the product—we do not consider it appropriate to allow for an employees representatives' meeting to be summoned. My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby said, rightly, that employees have an interest in the agreement of a voluntary arrangement that safeguards their jobs. However, if creditors do not vote for that arrangement, it will not happen.
<P>
The amendments would fundamentally change the law, as employees are not given such rights in any other insolvency proceeding. Amendment No. 56 would provide for the supervisor to owe employees a duty of care. In response to the point made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), I will explain why that is unnecessary. Section (7)(3) of the Insolvency Act 1986 states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If any of the company's creditors or any other person is dissatisfied by any act, omission or decision of the supervisor, he may apply to the court.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Act provides employees who have concerns about the way in which the supervisor is acting with the ability to challenge the orders of the supervisor by seeking an appropriate order.
<P>
An employee who is a creditor will be able to appoint a proxy to act on his or her behalf. I undertake to provide for that in the rules. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson) says that employees may sometimes be in such a parlous state that that proxy alone may represent them, and that they will understand that only if they know their rights. That is the important point. All too often, employees do not know their rights. We must educate employees about the legislation. All too often, people do not realise that the law has changed and do not know about their rights. We must take that problem seriously.
<P>
Each creditor will be sent a form by proxy, with instructions on how to fill it in; that is important, and we will provide for it in the rules. An employee who considers that he has a cause of action in tort is free to pursue such an action; that, I hope, answers the points raised about duty of care. Above all else, employees need a good business rescue. A successful rescue will preserve jobs because people will be needed to conduct the business; that point underpins all others. The flipside is: no rescue, no business, no jobs. We must not take our eyes off that point.
<P>
I hope that I have answered the points raised by hon. Members and that my hon. Friend will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Clearly, the notes saying no have arrived in front of my hon. Friend the Minister, some of whose arguments were a little far-fetched. He says that rights such as those provided in the amendment are unprecedented, but the rights of employees in small businesses are few enough anyway. The thing about the House, the Committee and legislation is that we can do anything that we want—we cannot provide that a man shall be a woman, but we can authorise the operation to achieve that. We have the power; the problem is whether we should use it.
<P>
I believe that we should proceed down the path of innovation and strengthening rights. The Government are committed to that aim and, as legislators, it is the responsibility of all hon. Members to achieve it. I do not accept the argument that we cannot do something because it is not done elsewhere. It is proper to insert workers' rights in an organised fashion, especially because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South pointed out, it is difficult for workers to assert them for themselves. Often, they do not know what their status is and they are likely to be unaware that they are creditors and that, as such, they have power. Unprecedented though it may be to include workers in the jostling mass of creditors, it would insert another element of rights and put the emphasis on keeping the company going in order to protect workers' interests. Even if such a right were another dimension of representation aside from the creditors' simple financial imperative, it should be included in the Bill.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister says that some of those matters will be dealt with in regulations. At the very least, those regulations should ensure that the workers are individually informed of their rights and told that they can be exercised by proxy, perhaps through their trade union. As my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South pointed out, information is important, and the circumstances that I am describing, wherein workers do not know their rights, have arisen in various insolvencies. If workers are not organised, or if their trade union backing is inadequate, there will be general bemusement. They might go to their citizens advice bureaux or to their Member of Parliament for advice, but such matters are specialised and we, too, have to mug up. It would be useful if their rights were made clear in regulation.
<P>
I accept the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Minister that a duty of care may be the best approach. Such an arrangement would put the emphasis on rescue and ensure that employees' interests were included in the equation. It is no use telling us that employees have the right to act under tort. After all, that is to advise workers to exercise their rights retrospectively, by employing more lawyers. It is not my intention to introduce such provision, but to include employees in the overall process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Simpson:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that in creditors' hearings, there is, de facto, a superabundance of external agencies representing creditors' interests? Usually, there is a fine array of some of the country's biggest accountancy houses and law firms. Does he agree that, currently, employees are the only people who do not appear to have professional representation and the opportunity to argue their part of the creditors' interests? They invariably have to represent themselves, if they have any opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> My hon. Friend is right. In the vulture culture, the vultures are extraordinarily well organised. They are big birds, hovering, they have long sight to pick out their prey and they are extremely effective. Think of the humble employees—I do not have a 19th-century view of workers, but in many cases they are genuinely confused, lost and diffident, do not know what to do, and have no strength against other groups.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman not concede the simple fact that if his amendment were made, the only way to enforce it would be through the courts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I do not accept that. The amendment would impose a duty of care in respect of workers. The hon. Gentleman is correct in that every dereliction of duty, every failure, mistake and false move in such a process is subject to action in court, but it remains important to put a general principle into the legislation, rather than allow recourse to the courts. I do not want to use it, as courts are expensive and action is often futile I want a responsibility to be imposed on the practitioner to have a duty of care for the workers, as part of a living process.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister made two important statements. One was that the regulations would take these matters into account. I welcome that; he will frame the regulations. The second was that, although there are difficulties with the amendment, he was prepared to talk about whether we could work for the objective in another way. I love talking to him. His eloquence—what the Welsh call the hwyl of good conversation—is superabundant, and I shall take the opportunity he offers. He has shown himself to be open-minded to the possibility of doing something to protect the rights of workers more effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope </B>(Christchurch): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one way in which progress could be made would be for the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise to have a duty to have regard to the interests of employees? Would that be covered by his amendment, or does he have a further amendment to deal with it?

<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I have often had to appeal to the tender hearts at Customs and Excise, and I know how effective my appeals have been and how amiable and considerate that organisation is to the interests of humble employees and the disadvantaged in such matters. The hon. Gentleman, as a friend of accountants, knows how to pull their heartstrings, but I do not, so I pull someone else's. I was about to say that, in consideration of my hon. Friend the Minister's sensitivity on the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
``7A. Neither the supervisor nor any employee or partner of a company of which he is an employee or partner shall subsequently act as liquidator of the company''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This simple amendment should be dealt with quickly. The Bill should do nothing to create a vested interest in winning more fees by providing for any other role apart from that of rescue operator or supervisor of the arrangement. That role should not be a base for gaining access to fees for acting as a liquidator or providing similar services later. Therefore, the firm that provides the supervisor should not be in the position to act as liquidator of the company. It is a simple provision.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire has tabled a private Member's Bill on the vested interests that come into being when a company acts as an adviser and then takes on its liquidation. That is a scandal, and I do not want the same procedures to prevail in insolvency procedures. The emphasis should be placed on success, rather than the creation of a position in which the supervisor wants the arrangement to fail so that he, as the practitioner, can undertake the liquidation work. The two practices must be kept completely separate, as happens with the Royal Bank of Scotland, as a consequence of which there is a saving in fees and a reduction in the number of liquidations. The same principle should be applied under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I support the argument of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. Does the Minister believe that there should be an incentive for supervisor failure?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The Government believe that the amendment is inappropriate because its effect would be inconsistent with the provisions relating to other insolvency procedures. Despite the plea made by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby about how the Committee can do anything that it wants, there must be coherence throughout business law. The Insolvency Act does not place restrictions on such individuals in other procedures. The only condition is that, to be a liquidator, the individual must be an insolvency practitioner. Moreover, because of an individual's prior involvement in the company, it may be appropriate for, say, the supervisor of a failed voluntary arrangement to be appointed as an office holder in subsequent liquidation proceedings. In general, swapping one individual for another would probably not save fees. If a liquidator were needed, he would have to be paid whether or not he was a former supervisor. I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I am not happy with my hon. Friend's argument. It is the usual excuse that is given when banks put in someone to report on a company, the report recommends liquidation and the insolvency arm of the same firm then acquires the liquidation work. The argument is always that that action saves on fees because the company is known by the firm, but such practice also creates a vested interest in destroying the company, which provides the case for my amendment. Such practices should be stopped: firms that act as supervisors should not be involved in subsequent liquidation work because that creates a vested interested in rigging the situation towards insolvency.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I was asked whether there should be an incentive for failure. It is important to remember that creditors and shareholders decide on the liquidator. If they consider that the supervisor has failed them, it is unlikely that he will have endeared himself to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> In many cases, the supervisor is a member of a much larger firm that offers insolvency services, tax consultancy or management services, which it wants to sell to other firms. That is the problem. If we preclude that firm from acting in any other capacity, we safeguard it under the arrangement, as we do not create a vested interest in closing it down. That is all that my amendment proposes. I accept that regulation of the insolvency practitioners' profession is still to come. Indeed, I hope that it is coming, as the first indications are that we will merely see the creation of another supervisory body. The onus on investigating accountants or supervisors to recommend liquidation and acquire the work for their firm is totally undesirable. As I pointed out, the Royal Bank of Scotland has said that it will not employ the same firm to do liquidation work that it employs to report on companies or, in this case, act as a supervisor. As a result, there has been a dramatic reduction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> That is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> That was the hon. Gentleman's proposal in his private Member's Bill, which I strongly support. In his wandering course through the legislative field, he was at that time wandering down the correct side—I shall not say the right side. The proposal reduces the number of liquidations and cuts the fees. That is what we want to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> As I said, the thrust of the amendment is sound. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the professional rules should prevent what is almost a conflict of interest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I agree. It is extraordinary that the jostling scrum of regulatory bodies eight, I believe, according to the joint counting efforts of my hon. Friend the Minister and I—have not provided for that, and neither has the Department of Trade and Industry. Clearly, it is a pressure to liquidate firms. However, my hon. Friend has turned an adamantine face against it—charming, but adamantine. He said last week that I was a Shi'ite, and I am sure that he would be a Sunni in terms of disposition. However, this time he is adamantine. I accept that the provision must be part of the process of regulation of the whole accountancy profession. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> We have already endeavoured to tease out of the Minister what is the requirement for the nominee who will emerge from routes other than that covered by the licensed practitioners. Our amendment would insert the word ``professional'' before the words ``member of a body''. The purpose—for which I make no apology—is, again, to create a peg on which to hang a request that the Minister provides a little more flesh on the bones. His earlier response, which he may have thought fulsome and overwhelmingly compelling, was in fact sketchy to the point of emaciation—which is not a bad word for me at the moment. The drafters doubtless included it because, again, it seemed at the time like a good way of broadening the general thrust. I invite the Minister, when he responds to my pain-wracked words, to give a little more information.
<P>
The Bill envisages the creation of yet another breed of insolvency practitioner authorised to act as nominees or supervisors, in addition to the long list of bodies that can have their own licensed insolvency practitioners. Such people have only to become a member of a body recognised for that purpose and to provide security. We do not yet know what the body or bodies will be or where they will come from. Will just one extra body emerge or could there be a number of bodies? Does the Minister have any idea? The clause consists of a vague and random series of phrases that contain little substance.
<P>
We must ask whether it is necessary to introduce another breed of insolvency practitioner. I will address the amendments of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, who made the point forcefully that we already have more bodies than we can shake a stick at. Yet the Minister wishes—through some vague, unconnected and, to me, incomprehensible phrases—to introduce yet another player. The Bill has shown the immense complexities with which any nominee who attempts to rescue companies and introduce a moratorium would have to grapple. We have to ensure that that person, through the unknown, unnamed, nebulous body of the future, will be able to operate the full range of options to deal with the various situations that might arise.
<P>
Will the body be able to have as authorised members people who, for example, have failed the qualifying exams for inclusion on the existing list of bodies of licensed insolvency practitioners? I understand that the rate of failure for aspiring licensed insolvency practitioners is over 50 per cent. How tempting it will be for someone who has failed to get into one body to go along to the unknown future body in an attempt to get involved in such activities through the back door. If that were allowed, that authorised person could be more hopeless than the most hopeless licensed insolvency practitioner. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby has his own views on insolvency practitioners, which he has explained to the House and the Committee on several occasions in great detail; I have no doubt that he will describe his amendments in even greater detail.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman implying that my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby does not consider them clever?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I approach the matter from the perspective of creditors, rather than from the other end of the financial telescope.
<P>
The Insolvency Act 1986 introduced regulation for the approval of licensed insolvency practitioners. It has been argued that the scope of their activities should be more tightly regulated in future, as the hon. Member for Great Grimsby suggested. However, I do not believe that it is right for the Committee to approve someone coming forward out of the grey fog without our knowing how he will arrive on the scene and without the Minister giving us a great deal more detail.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On Second Reading, I said that the nominee may be tempted to agree to a moratorium purely because it will be a means of obtaining fees. As we know, in such circumstances, the licensed insolvency practitioner—or, in moratoriums, the nominee who suggests the moratorium—will receive his money first. I am worried that there may not be an incentive to advise or consider a different course, whether it be some other form of rescue, such as rescheduling from a lender or an injection of capital, or, indeed, the insolvency process itself. The question inevitably arises as to whether that advice will be truly independent and objective.
<P>
The moratorium is currently available to companies and individuals and is policed through the court. Under the Bill, a moratorium will be available simply by filing documents with the court. It is therefore even more important that the nominee, whoever he or she might be, is of the highest integrity and technical skill. Indeed, it might be argued that a group of super insolvency practitioners should be available to take on the operation. I look forward to hearing the Minister flesh out the role of whatever the body might be, how it will come into existence and the type of qualification that will be necessary to become an authorised person. Everything hangs on the word ``professional'' in the amendment.
<P>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby comes as no great surprise, as he has, both inside and outside the House, advanced detailed arguments about the practices, education and training of the insolvency profession and the need for independent investigation of individual cases and complaints. I do not go along with everything that he says, but I believe that there would be an advantage in having some form of adjudication over some of the actions. That is one of the reasons why I was so critical of the Bill as a part-measure proposed late in the day, rather than what I would have preferred—a more comprehensive measure that dealt with the results of the insolvency inquiry that should have taken place two or three years ago. We would then have been considering in Committee a Bill to deal with everything in the round, rather than something to which we will have to return later.
<P>
I am aware of the pressures that have been placed on the hon. Member for Great Grimsby by various bodies and practitioners, and I pay tribute to him for his courage in resisting such pressures and sustaining his arguments. However, the implications of the amendment for professional regulative bodies worry me. The hon. Gentleman has severely criticised those bodies, and I agree that a large number are unaccountable, have duplicate functions and waste a lot of paper. The hon. Gentleman published a paper on insolvency practitioner regulation in March 1998 in which he argued that those bodies should be replaced by a single independent regulator. That argument bears detailed examination, although I do not know whether it proposes the right course of action.
<P>
In his article, the hon. Gentleman said that there should be an executive appointed by what was then the Board of Trade, along with an ombudsman with full investigative powers. That is fair enough, but—he may correct me if I am wrong—the amendments under discussion seem to propose not a single regulative body, but the creation within existing bodies of new procedures for the independent adjudication of complaints by one or more ombudsmen. Such a measure would introduce even more complexity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The amendments introduce the issue of regulation, as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said. I hoped that we would be on the same side on that issue because some of the cases that he put on the subject of insolvency while promoting his private Member's Bill were absolutely right. The scandals to which the procedures that we are discussing have given rise show the need for overall and effective independent regulation. He praised that with faint damns, saying that the matter was worth examination. That is a courageous stand in favour of regulation. In fact, the matter merits action, and these proposals allow us to put our case before the Minister.
<P>
The Minister has a problem with legislative time and the chorus of vested interests, with which he must negotiate and deal. I support his case that it is worth putting the Bill, although it is a limited measure, through the interstices of the legislative process in the time available. However, I hope that through continual reiteration of my argument, I will convince him that the Government's position on the major issue of regulation is unsatisfactory.
<P>
There has to be regulation, and the pamphlet that I have recommended so frequently shows that the number of insolvency abuses is enormous. I mention in particular the fee-collecting culture, in which the involvement of insolvency practitioners in liquidations is prolonged as long as possible to generate more fees. That is a scandal, and no effective regulatory body exists to deal with it. The cases mentioned in the pamphlet were referred to the regulators and the Department of Trade and Industry, but no action has resulted. That situation is disastrous.
<P>
We need to help people who face the trauma of liquidation by providing some regulation of nominees and to tilt those practitioners towards a rescue culture. The entire profession should be regulated. There are all sorts of proposals for reform, but the basic point is that there is no independent check on the fees charged by insolvency practitioners. People are hung round with fees. I referred to Josephina Askew, who lacked £4,500 and was subject to insolvency proceedings. Liquidation procedures were instituted and the fees amounted to between £100,000 and £200,000. That is monstrous, and yet there is no route for appeal or redress: legal fees can be questioned and examined, but insolvency practitioners have no duty in that respect.
<P>
Without expensive judicial review, there is no obligation to finalise the insolvency efficiently or cheaply—the notion of cheapness is, of course, laughable, given the fees that are charged, so let us instead say expeditiously. Shareholders in an insolvent company are not informed of the bids made for its assets, so the insolvency practitioner can flog them off to friends, acquaintances and business contacts. That has happened in numerous cases, including that of J. S. Bass in Manchester, to which I have already referred. In such cases, assets are sold at knock-down prices, sometimes even to companies formed by the practitioner. No information is available on the work done because the profession is so secretive. If nominees are to become part of a genuine rescue culture, they must know about the track record of those to whom they turn for advice. The purpose of new clause 4 is to ensure that they can obtain that information. They must be able to ask, ``Are these guys good or bad at rescuing companies and what fees will they charge?'' People cannot embark on difficult and traumatic processes without the information they need to enable them to choose who will deal best with particular cases.
<P>
Naturally, such questions of regulation have been ignored by the profession, which wants things to go on as they are and is happy getting an enormous amount of work. That was especially true under the Conservative Government. I do not think that such work has been as plentiful under the stability policies of the Labour Government—that is a nice party point for which I shall get some brownie points; I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will tell our right hon. Friend the Chancellor how loyal I have been. Even if the work is less abundant, however, it is still inordinately profitable. The Government asked for advice from the insolvency regulation working party, but that consisted of practitioners; it received only five representations from the public and met behind closed doors. It held no open meetings and made available no information about the industry's performance—in other words, figures on the number of jobs that could and should be saved. It is hardly surprising that it wants to retain the current regulatory structure.
<P>
The industry needs an ombudsman—an independent regulator to whom people can turn and have faith that they are not consulting the same insolvency practitioners who are the judges and juries in their own cases and who adjudicate on disputes in their own favour. At the very least, independent regulation and an ombudsman must be introduced. I am trying, in my limited way, to provide such measures in respect of nominees. The amendment is an opportunity to start moving along a path that I hope that the Government will follow. The abuses that I want to prevent will continue to arise in connection with voluntary arrangements.
<P>
I wrote to my hon. Friend the Minister—bearing in mind the amount of mail he receives, he has probably lost sight of my letter—about a case drawn to my attention by Burrells, a Norfolk firm of chartered taxation advisers, chartered accountants and certified accountants. Burrells was representing a firm that had been put into a voluntary arrangement. It wrote letters to the regulators and to the Department to express anxiety about the procedures.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The partners in the firm owed debts to the Inland Revenue, which took action to collect unpaid tax. The firm was then contacted by Messrs. Ratcliffe and Company, insolvency practitioners of Bolton; Burrells speculated that the company had received notification of the claim from publicly available records and knew that the firm was in trouble. The vultures came flying in and advised the firm that it was in its interests to enter into a voluntary arrangement. Clearly, the Bill will be safeguard against some of the actions taken at the time. There were only two creditors: the Inland Revenue and Norfolk county council. The business had an overdraft with Barclays bank, which was unaware of the voluntary arrangement. That will not happen under the Bill, but the business had considerable equity and a substantial excess of assets over liabilities, although it had cash flow problems.
<P>
The best way out of such a position is to make a new financial arrangement, to re-jig the finances, to consult the bank and refinance the business. However, it was in the interests of Ratcliffe and Company, which proposed to collect the fees, to advise the firm to enter into such a voluntary arrangement. The firm duly did so. No advice was given to it about alternative arrangements or refinancing, which it has now been undertaking. Fees were generated by an arrangement that was of little use to the firm, but of some use to Ratcliffe and Company. The matter was referred to the regulator, but no action has so far been taken. It is a classic story.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister may consider the amendments a means by which to regulate by the back door. I plead guilty to that crime, but only because he is not regulating by the front door. The amendments are an attempt to regulate the framework under which the nominees will operate, in the hope of turning them into a genuine instrument of survival and imbuing them with a culture of rescue. It is difficult to provide that in legislative form, but we must attempt to scratch the surface. That will be in the interests of the Government, the wider community and the whole economy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clear up one point about the amendments? As they are structured, an independent adjudication supervisor or ombudsman would be operating for each body. Does he envisage an external body to consider all licensed practitioners, or individual firms to handle each case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> In my inadequate way, I am aiming at one body as a sensible way in which to deal with the problem. It will have an overall view of legitimate charges and the role of the practitioner in such cases. That is the only way to proceed. There should not be a series of bodies, but there should be effective regulation of the new group of persons, to ensure that nominees become genuinely effective agents of rescue and that they provide information that enables firms in difficulties, which might want to use such arrangements, to judge what course is best. That is the purpose of new clause 4, which would require the publication of an annual report on fees and records.
<P>
We are talking about consumer choice. It will be difficult for the consumer to make an effective choice. We have to give him the wherewithal to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> On Thursday, the Minister talked about qualifications and mentioned that only licensed insolvency practitioners may act as nominees and supervisors of voluntary arrangements. However, he also said that other professions could be drawn into the scope of those qualified in due course. I look forward to hearing what changes, if any, he foresees.
<P>
What detailed supervision does the Department of Trade and Industry carry out of the so-called profession of licensed insolvency practitioners? In our debate today, hon. Members have highlighted the inadequacy of the current framework. A plethora of professions can act as licensed insolvency practitioners, and there is little regulation and little opportunity, if any, to challenge bills and so forth. What steps does the Department take to ensure that the standards of licensed insolvency practitioners are equal? What minimum standards are there? Are the qualifications of those already enabled to act adequate? What professional and minimum insurance standards are there? What regulation does he want of practitioners' fees, which are massive? We talked about conflicts of interests, which go to the core of professional standards. What does the Department do to ensure that the abuses that have been highlighted today do not happen again?
<P>
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby mentioned written records. What will be done to ensure that written record of decisions and meetings can be scrutinised by individuals who have been affected by the decisions of such people? Does the Minister believe that there should be a regulator for the profession and that there should be some sort of right of appeal, especially against the outlandish fees that are currently incapable of being challenged?
<P>
I support the tenor of the debate. The Government cannot wash their hands of the matter, but must ensure that there is reasonable recourse for the individuals and companies affected by the actions of practitioners.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> In answer to the questions posed by the hon. Member for South West Hertfordshire, I should make it clear that the new creature will not provide a niche for those who fail their accountancy and law examinations.
<P>
The regime of a body recognised under clause 4 may be different from that of one recognised under section 391(2)(a) of the Insolvency Act 1986, as the members of a body recognised under clause 4 will be authorised to act only as nominees and supervisors, not as insolvency practitioners generally. There is nothing to stop the Secretary of State recognising, under subsection 2, the bodies currently recognised under section 391. If people other than insolvency practitioners have rescue skills and belong to a body that the Secretary of State is prepared to recognise because it has in place an effective and rigorous regime for authorising and regulating its members, we see no reason why they should be prevented from playing a part in the rescue procedure. Indeed, we would want them to do so.
<P>
I was asked whether the new breed of nominee supervisor would recommend only a voluntary arrangement as a solution. The Bill does not deal with the regulation of advice. Bodies are recognised under section 391 of the Insolvency Act 1986 only for the purpose of authorising individuals to act as insolvency practitioners, liquidators or administrators of a company, trustees in bankruptcy or nominees or supervisors. Similarly, recognition of a body under the clause is only for the purpose of authorising individuals to act as nominees or supervisors. Much of our debate has been interesting but is not relevant to the proposals in the Bill. Neither power purports to regulate the provision of advice to a company or debtor in financial difficulty. Such companies and debtors should seek advice from those whom they consider suited to give it. That may or may not be an individual authorised by a body recognised under section 391 or the clause.
<P>
It is therefore important that those who have the skills to achieve a rescue by a voluntary arrangement assist companies and debtors. We do not understand how it could be good for the business of bodies authorised under the clause to recommend voluntary arrangements inappropriately. Where would be the sense in that? It would make for a fairly short career. The amendments also ignore the fact that the authorising body will monitor its members. If a nominee inappropriately recommended voluntary arrangements, that would lead almost certainly to a revocation of his authorisation.
<P>
The main consequence of introducing new section 389A into the Bill will be to allow the Secretary of State to grant recognition to a body that maintains and enforces rules ensuring that its members are fit and proper persons to act as nominees or supervisors and meet acceptable requirements for education, practical training and experience. Those are serious, not inconsequential, requirements. A body seeking to apply for recognition would have to ensure that the regime regulating its members was sufficiently rigorous to ensure that the high standards expected of nominees and supervisors continued to be met. If not, I give a categorical undertaking that the body's recognition would be withdrawn. I ask the Committee to resist the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Concern was expressed by the Trade and Industry Committee, which took the view that it would be prudent to establish a moratorium and regime and to consider altering the existing system of professional authorisation only in the light of the experience of a body's operation and the outcome of the wider review. The Committee recommended that the provision giving the Secretary of State power to authorise professions other than licensed insolvency practitioners to act as nominees or supervisors should be dropped from the Bill and considered within the wider review. The Government noted the Committee's recommendation, but thought that its comment about altering the system of professional authorisation overstated the potential effect of the power proposed for the Secretary of State. They claimed that the criteria that the Secretary of State applied would be the same as applied to current authorisation, and did not accept that the matter could be more appropriately considered in the wider insolvency review.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister has not explained why he is taking that route at this time. Why cannot the matter be left until the wider review of insolvency practitioners begins—if as he says, it is no big deal? Will he identify a group of people aspiring to be nominees who, at the moment, decline to become insolvency practitioners? There is no shortage of practitioners; in fact, some of them are under-used. There is a lot of competition among the licensed members of that professional group, which numbers 1,850. Around 1,000 of those practitioners are active, and 450 firms are active in accepting insolvency appointments.
<P>
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby is worried about fee rates but when professionals are involved, the issue is not the rate charged per hour but the number of hours spent on a job and the quality of the work. To remain preoccupied with the charge-out rate may be to miss the bigger picture; the important thing is to get the best professional advice that is appropriate to the circumstances.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The point of the Bill, and especially of the part with which we are dealing, is to create a culture of rescue, as my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby has called it. As that culture develops, individuals may emerge under proper regulation, offering different skills from those offered by insolvency practitioners. Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that the Committee should take that issue into consideration?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Obviously, I accept that that is a proper consideration. We have already noted that many insolvency practitioners are actively engaged in developing a rescue culture. However, I want the Minister to identify a group of potential participants in the nominee and supervisory role who, for reasons best known to themselves, have chosen not to become registered insolvency practitioners. Surely it would be best to encourage those interested in rescue to join the Insolvency Practitioners Association. They would be able to pursue that interest from that position. Any company wanting a rescue package, as opposed to any other arrangement, would be able to choose the individual or firm from within the large range of practitioners who could deliver on that score.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I am aware that the Insolvency Practitioners Association—or, as it is now called, the Association of Business Recovery Professionals—puts an emphasis on rescue culture. However, the skills involved in rescue are different from those needed for insolvency and liquidation. We want to bifurcate the profession such that one section will deal more with rescue. The skills involved are different and require much greater sensitivity and, perhaps, more patience and less of the ruthless drive for fees that characterises the big practitioners that the hon. Gentleman suggests provide value for money. They do not provide value for money or much information on their success and failure rates.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chope:</B> We mentioned the example of Canary wharf previously, which was a tremendous success. Canary wharf was rescued as a result of insolvency practitioners being committed to a rescue plan rather than to putting the entire business under the hammer. As a result, emerging from the financial difficulties of Canary wharf was a rescue strategy that has been identified by professionals and commentators as a supremely good example of what can be achieved. It was implemented by registered insolvency practitioners, or people who would now call themselves by their new professional title.
<P>
Who are these new people floating around, champing at the bit and wanting to get involved in rescuing companies but who, at the moment, feel excluded? They may not hold professional qualifications, which relates to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire; they may have failed their exams; they may be cowboys. If not, who are they? If such people exist, they already have a professional avenue through which they can carry out such work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman believe that licensed consultancy practitioners are properly regulated with uniformly high standards that can be challenged and which the public can be satisfied are properly regulated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> That is a separate issue. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby detailed some fairly alarming cases in which, on the basis of what he described, standards of professionalism have fallen well below the standards that we would expect of members of a professional body. He also said that the professional body failed to deal with those cases. If that is so, by all means let us introduce regulation to deal with that mischief. I am not defending all insolvency practitioners, be they good, bad or ugly, but we cannot merely say that because of some unprofessional or bad insolvency practitioners, a case can be made automatically for introducing a new group of people who do not possess the necessary skills and who hold what seems by implication to be a lower set of professional qualifications. Why should we let such people loose in the field?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> No new group of people is waiting for the barricades to be lowered so that they can all rush in and get the business. We are discussing the development of rescue skills and a concern for a company's survival in existing practitioners. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the figures in my pamphlet—1,800 practitioners and eight regulatory bodies—are ludicrous, especially as only about 1,200 are practising. However, people within that number will develop the expertise and recruit others. We are suggesting not that an entirely new body of troops is anxious to rush in, but that we should encourage a general division between the interests of existing practitioners in rescue and insolvency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I merely suggested, supported by the other members of the Trade and Industry Committee, that we should see whether the rescue culture develops following the introduction of the moratorium arrangements. The Select Committee suggested that we should examine how the arrangements work with existing professional bodies before inviting other groups of people to jump over the barricades to participate. Why would they want to do that? Perhaps because they see that there are rich pickings, but that is surely the wrong motivation. We should aim to encourage even more of the existing 1,800 licensed insolvency practitioners to think in terms of rescue rather than liquidation. The Government have not addressed the anxieties expressed by Committee members and others in that respect. They could do so by assuring us that they will not introduce the powers now, but will instead wait and see how the moratorium procedure works and try to encourage the development of a rescue culture among existing practitioners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The amendment seeks to flush out the qualifications necessary to become a nominee through the licensing route, which relates to various bodies that are as yet unknown, unnamed and, in some cases, not even in existence. I told the Minister that the procedure under discussion would greatly tempt nominees to recommend moratoriums. However, if I suggested that this would occur in 100 per cent. of cases, I should correct myself I said that licensed practitioners must have skills and qualifications to enable them to deal with the circumstances that affect companies in financial difficulties. I hope that the Minister will resist the temptation to authorise a body that can handle moratoriums only if there is an opportunity to include an organisation that is feeling frozen out—circumstances that were described by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope).
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if nominees must be licensed insolvency practitioners, the least that the Committee can do is to debate the qualification and any shortcomings in it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The hon. Gentleman is tempting me down a path that I do not want to take. We could say that the whole Bill is deficient in relation to many matters. As I said, we are considering only half a Bill; it should have been a complete Bill that dealt with the whole field of insolvency. I agree that the issue to which the hon. Gentleman refers should have been dealt with, but I do not feel that the Government will be amenable or even flexible enough to consider its inclusion at this stage of the Bill's passage. We must bear in mind that they have dealt with the Bill in a cavalier manner by merely throwing its Second Reading into the overspill period. To my mind, that attitude is almost contemptuous of an important matter that touches on the lives of the many business men and women who are caught in the difficult circumstances with which the Bill deals. It should have been dealt with in a full and comprehensive Bill, but we have already galloped over that ground and I shall not seek to do so again.
<P>
The Minister spoke of bodies that may come forward, adapt or do this or that. That approach worries me, as there is a great danger that it will recreate the circumstances that existed before the Insolvency Act 1986 took effect. At that time, the practices and behaviour of a number of people were truly appalling. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby has already been fairly direct in expressing his views on the practices of those who are already licensed practitioners, but the situation before 1986 was very much worse. My worry is that the Minister, in creating the new opportunity, may go all the way back to a situation that was rectified by the 1986 Act.
<P>
In referring to the report of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch put his finger on the problem. How do the bodies looking for recognition and qualification feel ill done by and frozen out? The Minister argues that the measure seemed like a good idea at the time. It was a nice populist bit of spin, but there was no understanding of the consequences that could flow from it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Being disqualified as a director is not a disqualification from running a business. That may surprise the many people who think that if someone is disqualified as a director, ergo he cannot set up an unincorporated business and behave in a fashion similar to that in which he behaved before. My amendments extend the range of sanctions available to use against rogue company directors, and include restraints on their ability to act as unincorporated rogue traders.
<P>
The issue of rogue traders is topical. The hon. Member for Luton, South (Ms Moran) recently introduced a ten-minute Bill to tighten the sanctions available. At Trade and Industry questions last week, the Minister gave three criteria that the Government were trying to achieve in their approach to rogue traders. They wanted better enforcement, to pursue more individual cases and to modernise consumer advice centres. For many concerned about the proliferation of rogue traders, that does not go far enough.
<P>
We might think that the issue of rogue traders should be tackled in a specific consumer protection Bill. The Government have continually promised one during this Parliament, although we have now been told that they shall not propose one during the next Session; indeed, there will not be any DTI Bills. In recognition of that sad omission, I thought that it would help if we could at least tighten up the law in relation to those disqualified as directors who go on to be rogue traders.
<P>
The owner of a firm—Nu Life Windows—in my constituency offers to replace windows and do other building work, and asks for part-payment in advance so that he cam purchase materials. Two constituents have complained to me that they have lost more than £1,000 to that gentleman, who has been operating up and down the south coast. The police are slow and reluctant to intervene, saying that if the work is started and not finished, it is a civil matter. The local newspaper has a dossier on the firm, but it really needs a photograph to be able to run a campaign against the trader. The police say that they cannot make their photograph of the person available to the press. If the rogue had never been a company director, the amendment would not apply to him, but he may have been disqualified from such a position and still be out there ripping off consumers and causing much distress, especially to elderly people.
<P>
I hope that the Minister accepts that there is a big gap in the law. There are many rogue traders and my amendment would deal with those who have been company directors. If a person has been deemed unfit to run a company, why should he be deemed fit to run an unincorporated business? Consumers are often ignorant about the difference between incorporation and non-incorporation, and rogues exploit such differences.
<P>
The amendment would go some way towards meeting the concerns expressed by the 37th report of the Public Accounts Committee on the failure of the existing law to protect consumers against rogue traders. There is a big gap in the ability of the Office of Fair Trading to bring proceedings against rogue traders for persistent breaches of criminal or civil law. The courts have found that to prove persistent breaches, a course of conduct that has resulted in a six or more people having been ripped off must be established before sanctions can be imposed against the rogue trader. The whole purpose of the director's disqualification procedure is to examine his or her conduct over time and, if that is found wanting, to be able to disqualify that person. It is ludicrous that when such a person becomes an unincorporated rogue trader, persistent bad conduct will have to be demonstrated before he can be brought to book. The amendment is modest because it is drafted in the context of company directors, not unincorporated businesses. It would go some way towards dealing with a serious mischief.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy with the hon. Member for Christchurch, as the problem of rogue traders is serious. I was interested to hear him say that the Department of Trade and Industry will not be proposing any pertinent Bills in the coming new year. Obviously, he has read the Queen's Speech. I have not, but I shall be disappointed if what the hon. Gentleman said is true. I have worked hard on this Bill. I very much share his desire to crack down on rogue traders but, with respect, the Bill is not the appropriate vehicle for that.
<P>
The main purpose of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 is to provide the public with protection against those who abuse the privilege of limited liability. Sections 6 and 7 of the Act allow the Secretary of State to apply to court for a disqualification order against the director of an insolvent company whose conduct in relation to the company is such as to make him unfit to be involved in the affairs of a limited company. Section 8 enables the Secretary of State to apply for a disqualification order against the person who has been the subject of a statutory investigation, as provided for under that section, and in the case of whom it appears expedient in the public interest that the person should be disqualified. Similarly, clause 6 will allow the Secretary of State to accept a disqualification undertaking in such circumstances. Whatever the hon. Gentleman may think about disqualified directors being able to trade on their own account—I have a great deal of sympathy with him on that—it would be inappropriate for the Bill to go further by restricting a person's right to do that. Legislation will be properly framed to undertake the tasks that the hon. Gentleman has identified, one of which will be enacted in the new year—the injunctions directive. I hope that we will make good use of that and that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. We have established that this is a piecemeal Bill; adding a bit more piecemeal legislation to a piecemeal Bill would surely be consistent. Ministers can always argue that an issue must be dealt with comprehensively in the future. All I seek to do is to bring immediate relief to a group of consumers who are suffering at the hands of people who set up as rogue traders after having been disqualified as company directors. It is a modest measure—it does not purport to be anything more—and I am disappointed by the Government's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The hon. Gentleman highlights a frequent problem that bedevils a number of our constituents. Does he agree that we should have heard more from the Minister about the injunctions directive—which is supposed to be a panacea—or about other legislation? Does he agree also that the sooner it is done, the better?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I agree with both points. Unfortunately, I have no means of forcing the Minister to be more forthcoming in explaining the injunctions directive. One way to concentrate the Minister's mind would be to press the matter to a Division. I have yet to hear from a Committee member who does not sympathise with what I am trying to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> My hon. Friend made a compelling case. All of us have examples in our constituencies of what he described, and his proposal should be added to the Bill. In view of what the Minister said while dangling a regulation in front of us, the matter requires further investigation. It should be given a wider audience on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> My hon. Friend has great experience as a Minister of how to parry appealing requests from other Members. However, it may not be possible to raise the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The hon. Gentleman should recognise that this is what passes for unity in the Conservative party. When he considers whether to raise the matter again on Report, he should remember that it is not only rogue traders who can protract the business and who cannot be prosecuted until the business is completed. Many insolvency practitioners have been protracting insolvencies for up to 20 years—because they are getting the fees for the business—without intervention from regulators to bring the case to an end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> That is not relevant to my argument, although I recognise the hon. Gentleman's point. I have been puzzling over whether I could expand an amendment on Report and incorporate what he is saying to make the amendment more likely to be selected for debate. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire wants to describe our chances of tabling an amendment that will be selected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> My hon. Friend has been in this game for as long as I have, so he knows the risks. The Minister's most unsatisfactory answer, the fact that we may be asked to consider legislation about which we do not yet know and the many questions that remain unanswered should give those who are responsible for selecting amendments ample justification for allowing us to debate the matter on Report. I am looking to you, Mr. Gale, for a nod or a wink.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has been in the House long enough to know that the selection of amendments for consideration on Report is entirely for the Speaker, and cannot be directed from the Chair. I might add only that the Minister is free to circulate a note about the injunctions directive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I hope that the Minister will respond to your suggestion, Mr. Gale, and distribute a note about the directive.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I would be delighted to issue to Committee members a note on the injunctions directive, which is a fascinating document.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Having benefited from such a note, we may be able to formulate an amendment that would insert into legislation before the Queen's speech some of the good aspects of the directive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> If the Minister is going to take action, an opportunity will arise—as night follows day—to table a suitable amendment and ensure that the matter can be put to rest in front of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I have been thinking carefully about the matter. What appeals to me is the prospect of establishing a large cross-party alliance. Many right hon. and hon. Members from all parties are concerned about the matter and could participate in a debate on Report. Despite his assertion that he is of equal seniority, my hon. Friend is much more senior than me in all respects, so I shall bow to his advice—although I am not setting a precedent by doing so. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The amendment would restrict the Secretary of State's ability to accept disqualification undertakings in particular circumstances. It would do so under section 8 of the Insolvency Act 1986, but would enable him to exercise the ability under section 7 of that Act. I am sure that hon. Members have copies of the Act and will appreciate the distinction between those sections. Section 7 deals with disqualifications that arise from insolvency and reports that the Secretary of State has received from people who are involved in insolvency action. Section 8 deals with matters that are brought to the Secretary of State's attention as a result of inquiries carried out by his officials under the Companies Acts.
<P>
If the Department of Trade and Industry conducts an inquiry into a company from which flows a disqualification recommendation, the matter should be dealt with in the courts, rather than being hidden away with the prospect of an undertaking by the director, perhaps lasting for 15 years. We know that some inquiries under the Companies Acts, such as the Maxwell inquiry, take a very long time. If the conclusion of such an expensive, lengthy inquiry is that a director's conduct warrants disqualification, that decision should surely be given in open court, and not swept under the carpet through undertakings.
<P>
Amendment No. 4 would reduce the maximum period that may be specified in a disqualification undertaking from 15 to four years. I made the point on Second Reading that if someone's conduct were sufficiently serious to warrant disqualification for more than four years, the matter should be ventilated in open court. An analogy can be drawn with speeding motorists. A system of fixed penalty notices for speeding was brought in as a matter of expediency, to save on administrative costs. If a motorist admits that it is a fair cop, he was speeding, he will often get a fixed penalty notice. However, if his speed was excessive—if he were travelling at a speed more than slightly in excess of the speed limit, perhaps at more than 100 mph—he would normally get a summons and be taken to court.
<P>
The prosecuting authorities take the view that a certain degree of criminality warrants an appearance before the court, which will decide what penalty should be imposed. There is a similarity with the situation that we are discussing, because if a director is guilty of such heinous behaviour that he warrants disqualification for more than four years, that should be brought before the courts. People should not be able to give undertakings to accept disqualification for as much as 15 years that will enable them to avoid having the issues raised before a wider audience. It is not possible for people to undertake to be disqualified from driving: that penalty can be imposed only by the courts.
<P>
There is a similar situation in respect of police cautions. There is tremendous frustration that people guilty of offences can be caught by the police and taken to a police station, but end up with a caution that is never the subject of public scrutiny. The caution is essentially an agreement between the police and the individual concerned; there is no transparency or accountability. We must not allow expediency, which seems to be the justification for the disqualification provisions in the Bill, to outweigh transparency and justice.
<P>
The issue of public expense is relevant. The Minister will remember that I drew attention on Second Reading to the fact that there is no mention in the financial memorandum of the disqualification undertaking provisions creating any saving for the Government. I am grateful to the Minister for having sent me a copy of the regulatory impact assessment, which asserts that the benefit to the taxpayer from the consent procedure for undertakings is estimated to be £300,000 a year—a significant sum. There are also said to be an average of 1,200 disqualification orders each year, of which approximately 60 per cent. are not opposed at the final hearing.
<P>
The Minister has not yet said whether it is on the Government's agenda to increase the number of disqualification orders. By so doing, the saving of £300,000 that is identified in the financial memorandum will be absorbed in more disqualification proceedings and orders. That seems to be the only way in which to account for the fact that the financial memorandum—notwithstanding what is said in the regulatory impact assessment—states that there would be no net benefit to the taxpayer of the disqualification undertaking procedure.
<P>
I refer to the costings because they form part of the Government's argument. I anticipate that the Minister will say that, to restrict such procedures to cases in which the undertaking will last for up to four years, not beyond, it would mean that a mass of cases in which undertakings lasting five, 10 or 15 years went before the courts would cost money. I do not have the exact figures to hand, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman can advise me of the position. There is a reasonable case in respect of transparency and justice for saying that heinous behaviour on the part of directors should be brought before the courts.
<P>
Amendment No. 5 incorporates into the process a requirement for additional public transparency. It would require the Secretary of State to agree with anyone giving a disqualification undertaking to issue a statement of facts relating to the conduct of that person. The statement will be published and included in a public register to be kept by the Secretary of State. The matter was considered by the Select Committee on Trade and Industry. I am delighted that the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) is here because I am sure that, as a member of the Trade and Industry Committee, he will want to speak in support of the amendment.
<P>
Paragraph 41 of the Select Committee's unanimous report said that the Department of Trade and Industry, in evidence, emphasised that the Department would still go through the whole process of investigation and production of full documentation and, only at the point at which it would normally issue proceedings, would a decision be taken on whether to seek an undertaking from directors. It stated that the Bill provides for the Secretary of State to be able to appear and present evidence in case of an application to vary or quash an undertaking. It said that there could usefully be explicit provision made for a statement of fact on which the undertaking was based to be available to the court in the event of subsequent proceedings.
<P>
That was a clear recommendation. Although it was linked especially to the issue of subsequent proceedings at which there might be an application by the director who had accepted an undertaking to vary or quash that undertaking, it is also relevant to the fair reporting of the facts and it would help professional bodies who have to deal with consequential disciplinary matters involving directors who have been disqualified. A point could be reached of cut-throat defence, with different directors each blaming another. It is important that, when directors are brought before a professional conduct committee of their profession, adjudicators have a clear view of the extent of the wrongdoing and of where the rights, wrongs and responsibilities lie. That is not currently possible, because there is no agreed statement of facts on which the undertakings could be made. That is the case even under the existing abbreviated procedures. The Bill provides an opportunity to improve that state of affairs significantly and thereby to incorporate a requirement for a statement and consequential public transparency.

<P>
The Minister sounded sympathetic to that idea on Second Reading, but I am disappointed that no Government amendment has been tabled in that respect. I hope that the Minister will respond to amendment No. 5 in a spirit of generosity.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 would limit the application to vary or rescind a disqualification undertaking to a period more than two years after the undertaking was given. That would reinforce the fact that to give an undertaking to be disqualified is a grave matter. It would cut out what might be regarded as trivial applications involving people going back to court within two years of giving an undertaking and seeking to be relieved from its consequences wholly or in part. The amendment would save money. In challenging the Minister to tell the Committee whether he accepts it, I invite him to outline any circumstances in which he thinks a court would change an undertaking within two years of it being given.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> If new documentation came to light to prove the point that the person subject to the disqualification had made in his original defence, surely he should not have to wait two years for that to clear his name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I take the Minister's point, which supports my view that a clear statement should be provided at the time the undertakings are given. In what circumstances would a director accede to an undertaking to be disqualified voluntarily if he felt that documentation that showed he was not guilty of wrongdoing to the extent alleged might become available in the future? It is important that acceptance of an undertaking should be considered with as much seriousness as a disqualification imposed by a court. If a court imposes disqualification, there are very limited opportunities for appeal after the event on the basis of fresh evidence. The Minister seems to be arguing that fresh evidence in terms of culpability would justify an application of the sort that I have described. I would accept that modification of my proposal.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 would link an application to vary an undertaking to the agreed statement of facts. Clearly, it is important that a court considering the possibility of varying an undertaking should be able to base its decision on an agreed statement of facts. It is easy, some years after the event, to claim, ``I only gave that undertaking because x, y or z happened''; it is a matter of one person's word against another's. It is much better that a clear statement of what happened should be established. Exactly that procedure would apply in the Court of Appeal in an appeal against sentence. It would not be open to the prosecution to adduce other evidence than had been adduced at the time of sentencing. It is important that any penalties should be imposed on the basis of an agreed set of facts.
<P>
New clause 2 is grouped with other amendments to clause 6 and it may be convenient to deal with it now. It would fill in the gaping loophole in the rules of accountability for limited companies. Presently, a limited company can be established, trade and solicit subscriptions and donations, but after it has achieved its objectives, it can disappear without ever having to file accounts and without the public ever acquiring information about the remuneration of directors or the value of their shareholdings.
<P>
Provided that no creditor is dissatisfied, the authorities in general—and Companies House in particular—have no penalty or sanction to use against the directors. Such sanctions as are available apply to persistent failure to file accounts. A company may be set up in the knowledge that it will trade and remunerate directors with large sums of money. If it dissolves as a result of a failure to produce accounts, the people who are eager to find out what those accounts might reveal—including the remuneration of directors—will be unable to gain access to that information.
<P>
The loophole in company law came to my attention two years ago when I inquired about a company called People's Trust Ltd. Hon. Members may recall that the company was set up in January 1997 with the avowed aim of championing higher standards in public life. However, the records show that it failed to fulfil its obligations under the Companies Act. It failed to file its accounts. Two reminders were sent in 1998 and a notice was then placed in The London Gazette—all with no response. People's Trust Ltd. was then struck off the register for failing to file its accounts. It was thereby dissolved and unable to trade legally as a company with effect from the beginning of September 1998.
<P>
The chairman and main source of funds of that company—to the extent of £1 million—was Mr. Fayed. When challenged by The Independent about the failure to file accounts, a spokesman for Mr. Fayed said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It appears that there has been an administrative oversight on the part of our legal representatives. That being the case, we will look to rectify this on Monday morning.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Members of the Committee will not be surprised to know that nothing was rectified at all. That was the last we heard of this company. I complained to Companies House and suggested that some sanction should be introduced to gain access to the accounts. That was when I was told about the gap in the law. It cannot be rectified because when the company has been dissolved, it no longer has any obligation to provide information.
<P>
The failure to file accounts, far from being an administrative oversight, was a deliberate and calculated exploitation of the loophole in the Companies Act. In an article published in The Sunday Telegraph on 30 March 1997, Mr. Fayed said of the DTI report into Harrods:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Ten years ago, just before the 1987 election, the Thatcher Government commissioned a report that called me a liar . . . The British Government took away my reputation and good family name after 40 years' hard work. I will not go to my pyramid leaving my children under the shadow of a report that is unfair and untrue. I have seen the arrogance of power at very close quarters. I did not like what I saw. I will campaign for root and branch reform. That is why I gave away £1 million last week to the People's Trust, an independent pressure group dedicated to cleaning up politics.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What happened to that £1 million? How much was used to pay the company directors for past services rendered? How much was left when the company was dissolved by default of filing its accounts and what happened to the donations which the company solicited from possibly naive members of the public?
<P>
People's Trust Ltd. was not a small, insignificant company. It had a turnover in excess of £1 million and had prominent public figures on its board. Apart from Mr. Fayed, it included Michael Cole, Mr. Fayed's then press officer; Andrew Neil, a former editor of The Sunday Times and still a distinguished journalist; Mr. Robert Fallowfield, one of Mr. Fayed's accountants; Lord Alton of Liverpool; and Alex Carlile, a former hon. and learned Member of the House. The full-time secretary was someone called Christopher Graffius, a former researcher for Lord Alton—[Interruption.] I am delighted to hear the murmurs of assent from Labour Members.
<P>
My amendment would require directors to be held to account and to show cause why they should not be disqualified and, if new clause 2 is accepted, People's Trust Ltd. will have achieved something; from its demise, a phoenix will arise to safeguard the principles of public accountability extending to all companies.
<P>
I hope that the Government are as alarmed as I am about that example of exploitation. The Minister knows that Mr. Fayed has been of interest to his Department for a long time. I referred to Mr. Fayed's comment that he would not go to his pyramid without having sorted out the mischief and unfairness that he believes was perpetrated against him by the original DTI report. The Department may feel that it is a pity that there is a loophole in the law because it might be interesting to examine the accounts of People's Trust.
<P>
New clause 1 would require the Secretary of State to publish guidelines from time to time on the circumstances in which he may deem it expedient in the public interest that a disqualification order under section 6 is made. It was tabled in response to my concern that the Government have absolute discretion to decide what is expedient in the public interest in terms of disqualification of directors. The Minister's predecessor took it upon himself to mount a big campaign to increase the number of disqualifications of directors as though that was a worthwhile objective. However, it is not good enough for the Government merely to increase the number of disqualifications; there should be a common standard for the level of wrongdoing. The new clause would require the Secretary of State to publish guidelines from time to time on the circumstances in which he deems it expedient in the public interest to seek a disqualification order.
<P>
There is already provision in the Companies Act to cope with unfit behaviour by a director, but there is a lacuna, in that the Secretary of State is under no obligation to disclose the criteria or guidelines that he will use in deciding whether to bring disqualification proceedings. The Minister has not said whether this part of the Bill will be a precursor to a significant increase in the number of directors against whom proceedings are taken. If that is the agenda, let us be clear and set out the revised criteria to bring many more directors to book than previously. If that is not the agenda—
<P>
It being One o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.

Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
