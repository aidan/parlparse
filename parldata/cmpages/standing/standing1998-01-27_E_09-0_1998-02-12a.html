<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo </B>(South Suffolk): On a point of order, Mr. Benton. The Committee may be labouring under a misapprehension. In the Chamber last night, the Minister for London and Construction announced at col. 489 of Hansard that board members of the development agency for London would be appointed not by the Secretary of State but by the mayor. The mayor does not yet exist. The legislation for electing a mayor has not been passed by the House, or even published.
<P>
My concern is that when we debated clause 2, which provides for the Secretary of State to appoint members of the regional development agency boards, Ministers said nothing about that not applying in London. Apparently, clause 2 will not apply to Greater London. Rather than continuing with debates based on the wrong information, it would be helpful if the Minister would make it clear that not all RDA board members would be appointed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> What happened in the Chamber last night is not a matter for the Committee. That is not to say that the hon. Gentleman has not raised a valid point, but it may be a matter with which to engage on Report. The hon. Gentleman's point of order is not a point for me. That said, perhaps the Minister might be generous enough to take the hon. Gentleman's comments on board whenever he finds it appropriate to do so. In the meantime, we should continue as planned.
<P>
Clauses 14 and 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provision of information etc. to the secretary of state</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> This is a fairly short and, I hope, uncontroversial clause. However, it is potentially far-reaching in that the Secretary of State may require RDAs to provide him
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with such information, advice and assistance as he may"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
see fit. Can the Minister give us some examples of the information, advice or assistance that the Secretary of State is likely to require? We should like some clue to the Government's thinking on that.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Angela Eagle):</B> As the hon. Gentleman has rightlypointed out, the aim of the clause is uncontroversial in simply allowing the Secretary of State to be provided
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with such information, advice and assistance as he may require"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to do the jobs laid down, to issue directions and to ensure that RDAs keep within guidelines. It is potentially about everything that an RDA does in its region and about whatever the Secretary of State requires in order to give directions and guidance. It is as all-encompassing as that.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): On Second Reading, I discussed the risk of competitive subsidies between different RDAs, and the Minister who responded admitted that that was an important matter.
<P>
I have been waiting for the right moment to raise that matter in Committee, and I am advised that I could give it a short run for its money in relation to the clause, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A regional development agency shall provide the Secretary of State with such information, advice and assistance as he may require."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the Under-Secretary believe that the Secretary of State should require the provision of information about aid that is intended, for example, to attract investment? There are development agencies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the Bill will create nine English RDAs. We all know how much competition there is for investment, and I well remember the complaints that have been consistently levelled against the Welsh Development Agency in relation to the south-west. The northern region complained that investment has been attracted to Wales and that the north would suffer. Investment may become more difficult to attract because of the interest rate in the United Kingdom, which is affected by the exchange rate. It may be difficult to ensure that the same investment is not chased by various groups. We do not want more cases like that of LG, which went to Wales at the absolutely monstrous cost to the taxpayer of œ250 million. I do not think that the project will ever be built all we have seen are a few commemorative spades.
<P>
It is in the Government's interest to ensure that there is not competitive bidding for subsidies. What mechanism will the Government use to ensure that they have an overview of the matter? People intending to invest in Britain should not find themselves in the delightful position of having money thrust into their palms by different RDAs to induce them to go to their region. That would distort competition, the logic of the market place and the advantages of certain regions.
<P>
The Secretary of State will have to deal with this genuine problem. He cannot simply say, "We shall deal with it when we get to it." How will the Government prevent the problem arising? The problem is paid for at the taxpayers' expense, it distorts the market and it disadvantages those regions that are less rich in resources than others.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The right hon. Gentleman raises an extremely important issue. He will know of the legacy that the previous Government left us. The work of attracting inward investors to the regions is currently done by regional development organisations, which work out of the Department of Trade and Industry rather than the Department of the Environment,[Angela Eagle]
 Transport and the Regions. Those private companies work with the Invest in Britain Bureau to assist with the promotion of inward investment and they help investors to establish themselves.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman outlined some of the dangers of the system that we inherited, including competitive bidding for inward investment projects. If that practice is allowed to proceed unchecked, public resources will be wasted. The cost to regions of inward investment may be bidded up the regions might have secured such investment at a lower price if bidding had not taken place and I am sure that all Committee members agree that that has to stop. The problem is being considered by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and by other Departments. Indeed, the Prime Minister has taken a close interest in the matter. Appropriate co-ordination will ensure that there is a cohesive and effective national approach to the issue. It will be strengthened with a concordat between different parts of the United Kingdom, the terms of which are still being considered by the Government. Those terms will be announced when they have been finalised. It is something that the Government take extremely seriously.
<P>
For the enlightenment of the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo), who asked for examples of the kinds of information that the Secretary of State might require, the Committee should be mindful that the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament for the RDA's actions. He or she will need to gather information to fulfil that duty and to inform himself or herself in order to make decisions on the future direction of policy. The Secretary of State might want information about the amount of land available for regeneration in a particular region. Alternatively, he might want a profile of an RDA's employees for inclusion in an annual departmental report, or to compile any information that the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions might want to make available to Parliament and the public. The clause attempts to ensure that no RDA would try to conceal such matters from the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am grateful for that response as far as it goes. I am aware that a concordat is being drawn up, but I would like the Under-Secretary to assure us that it will extend to the Scots and Welsh development areas as well as to the English ones. She will be aware that this issue has caused a great deal of ill blood, allegations and rumours. That situation should be resolved.
<P>
Secondly, will the concordat which I assume will become a public document be made available to us before we reach the later stages of considering the Bill? I accept that the Government want mechanisms to be put in place; it would be helpful to know what they are. We should be able to judge the concordat, to see whether it is workable or whether it will be fairly token in its nature. It would be helpful I would say indispensable to be able to get a real sense of what the Government intend before the House concludes its consideration of the Bill. I am asking to see the concordat not during the Committee stage but during the later stages. The concordat has been nurtured for quite a long time; it is taking quite a long time to lay this particular egg. Although I know that interdepartmental discussions can be tortuous I wonder who is being difficult I would be grateful if the Under-Secretary were to acknowledge that she understands why we feel that we should scrutinise the concordat in greater detail. It is an issue of some importance.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> First, the concordat will involve the Scottish and Welsh development agencies. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not be too disappointed to hear that even I cannot provide the Committee with documents that have not yet been finalised or agreed to. The timetable for producing the final documents and the timetable for the Bill are the crucial elements affecting whether the concordat will appear before we complete our consideration of the Bill. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon should bear in mind that the vesting day for the RDAs is in April 1999, and although the concordat might not be in a finished written form before we conclude considering the Bill, it will certainly be available before vesting day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to convey to her colleagues who are negotiating this particular instrument the fact that considerable interest exists in seeing it as soon as possible. Will she make her best efforts to expedite it, in order to prevent all sorts of questions being tabled about when it is going to appear? Will she pass the message back that there is a great deal of interest in the document? The sooner it can be put together and we can see it, the better. There will be a certain amount of Yorkshire persistence in asking.

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> As someone who was born in Yorkshire, I understand all about Yorkshire persistence. I shall pass on the right hon. Gentleman's messages, but he flatters my ability to influence what happens in Government and to expedite a complex procedure on which people are already meeting to try to find a workable and practicable concordat. The right hon. Gentleman and his party were in power for 18 years and never came up with one, so clearly it is not easy. However, I shall pass his comments on to the appropriate Departments and Ministers.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Annual report</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 118, in page 7, line 28, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As soon as reasonably practicable after"<P>

<P>
and insert
<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 119, in page 7, line 37, leave out "Following" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Not less than 14 days after".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Clause 17 deals with the important matter of annual reports, which we touched on during a debate on an earlier amendment. The public will pick up the costs of regional development agencies in one form or another and it is their interests, in theory at least, that the regional development agencies exist to serve. The annual reports are likely to be the public's main source of information about the RDA's activities in their region. The value of that information will lie largely, but not totally, in its quality. Amendment No. 124 sought to ensure that the quality of the information in the annual reports was high and the Minister gave some assurances on that.
<P>
Part of the value of the annual reports and the information which the public will receive from those reports will lie in their time limits. I have had to draw attention to some of the gaps and limited information in the White Paper. I shall not labour the point, but the figures quoted for gross domestic product per capita were five years out of date. Since the Committee started its deliberations, I have obtained some up-to-date figures for the English regions. The Committee may be interested to know that during the three years following the year that was chosen for the figures in the White Paper, the gross domestic product per capita in some English regions rose by 16 per cent. in three years. That is a very fast rate of growth indeed. It seems at least possible to put it no more strongly that if the English regions were achieving such a growth rate during the years 1994, 1995 and 1996, they may have a slightly better showing compared with the European Union average at the end of 1996 than they had in 1993, the year chosen for the information in the White Paper.
<P>
I have used that point to illustrate the importance of time limits when evaluating the quality of information in a document. It is interesting to note the regions which performed well. GDP per capita rose by 16 per cent. in the west midlands and 15 per cent. in Yorkshire and the Humber. In my own area the eastern region where there is very limited demand for a regional development agency, the growth in GDP per capita was in excess of 16 per cent. during those three years. In the present context, I wish to emphasise that annual reports should be up to date if they are to be of any value.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor </B>(North-West Leicestershire): The hon. Gentleman's point is interesting, but does he not agree that the years to which he is referring 1993-96 followed the depths of what some might call a Conservative-inspired recession. Is not that expected in a recovery phase? If an area such as the west midlands I live within five minutes of its borders can do as well as that without the RDA structure, how much better it will be when there is a concerted planning effort.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Who knows what will happen when an RDA is established? In my judgment, the impact of RDAs on GDP per capita in regions such as the west midlands, the eastern region and the south-east will be minimal or even negative. It remains to be seen.
<P>
The crucial point is that the Government chose to present to the public in support of their case for RDAs information which was five years out of date. To make any claim about relative economic performance in different regions of England on the basis of figures that are five years out of date is extremely unsatisfactory. I have managed to pull away some of the lawyers of secrecy that appear to cover that kind of information and to establish that some English regions performed extremely well in growth-rate terms in 1994, 1995 and 1996. I hope that the Government, with all the resources at their command, will, before the end of the Committee or Report stages of the Bill, produce figures for elsewhere in the European Union. Even figures for 1994 or 1995 would be a start.
<P>
I return to the need for annual reports to be timely if they are to serve much purpose. Amendment No. 118 seeks to specify a maximum time after the end of the year during which the RDAs shall prepare a report. The Bill says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As soon as reasonably practicable".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That phrase is better than those used elsewhere which have left too much to the discretion of the Secretary of State. Even so, it would be better to have a clear timetable that left nothing to chance.
<P>
I dare say the Government will claim that they have done everything practicable to obtain up-to-date figures for the economic performance of European Union regions. Even if they did, the information provided is almost completely worthless. I do not want the same situation to arise when RDA reports are made available to the public.
<P>
Putting a maximum time into the Bill would be useful. I have suggested three months, which is adequate time in which to complete thoroughly the necessary work. That may even eliminate the need for the Secretary of State or his officials to chase progress. If the Government feel that three months is too short, we could accept four or six months as better than nothing. Anything is better than the Government thinking that information five years out of date can meet needs.
<P>
Amendment No. 119 deals with a separate question. At present, the clause provides for the RDA to send a report to the Secretary of State. The report does not go to the stakeholders of whom we heard so much a couple of days ago, or to the regional chamber that is supposed to have a special relationship with the RDA and almost to oversee RDA work. It does not go to democratically elected bodies in the RDA's region namely the local authorities. Perhaps not surprisingly in the light of the rest of the Bill, the report goes to the Secretary of State.
<P>
Clause 17(3) provides for the Secretary of State to lay the report before Parliament. Unfortunately, no time limit is specified. Under the terms of the clause, the Secretary of State could hold on to a report for weeks, months, even years before sending it to Parliament. I do not understand why that should be so. I would be less concerned had I received a more interested and co-operative response to my request for timely information on what the Government said was central to their justification for the existence of RDAs.
<P>
On Second Reading and when we debated the sittings motion two and a half weeks ago, the Minister said that one of the main reasons for setting up RDAs was to address the problem of English regions underperforming the European Union average by such a margin. I said that his information was out of date and suggested that greater efforts should be made to produce up-to-date information to allow us to examine[Mr. Yeo]
whether the case, which might have existed in 1993, existed today. The Minister showed no interest, sympathy or concern. His dismissive and contemptuous attitude and response that Parliament of all places should want up-to-date information to test a theory that he had rehearsed on the Floor of the House and in Committee has driven me to press the matter.
<P>
We should not pass a Bill that allows the Secretary of State to sit on an annual report for an indefinite period. He has the power to appoint, remove and compensate members of the board. If he found a report unsatisfactory for example, it might embarrass the Government he could sit on it for six months, in which time some changes might have been made to the RDA board. He could then send the report back and have a few changes made. The scope for preventing the public from receiving timely information, which is made possible by the subsection, is a serious matter which is open to significant abuse.
<P>
Why do the Government believe it necessary to allow the Secretary of State to have that indefinite period? Is it in danger of being used to tinker with the report's contents? What changes might the Government make to reports in the indefinite period? If they do not intend to make changes, they cannot object to my amendment. It would ensure that the annual report was quickly passed on to the House after it had been received by the Minister. Fourteen days is adequate time for the Minister's private office to scrutinise the report's contents and to brief him on anything about which he may be questioned.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning (Mr. Richard Caborn):</B> I shall deal briefly with the statistics in the White Paper. We have gone back to Eurostat. It has not produced more up-to-date figures. We have also made a number of calculations. Even with the growth suggested by the hon. Member for South Suffolk, the position of English regions relative to European regions is the same. He was right to say that we need accurate and reliable dates.
<P>
I am not going to speculate on the relative position of the English regions. We will publish new figures as soon as they are available from Eurostat. The difficulty is in getting statistics from member states. Eurostat has to factor them into the European Union, which takes a little longer. It is not for me to judge whether that is good or bad. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that we are basing the decision to establish RDAs on a single table in the White Paper, he is as far from the truth as some of his contributions, and that is a long way.
<P>
Most non-departmental public bodies are required to produce annual reports, and RDAs will be no different. Clause 17 will provide that their annual reports should be prepared as soon as is reasonably practical after the end of the accounting period in a form and content set by the Secretary of State. The report will be laid before both Houses of Parliament and published. That is in accordance with the procedure for all NDPBs.
<P>
I broadly agree with the intention behind the amendments. Although I cannot accept them, I hope that I can give the hon. Gentleman some assurances on the annual reports.
<P>
Amendment No. 118 would set a deadline of three months after the end of the accounting period within which an RDA's report must be produced. Of course, we shall want to see the annual report as quickly as possible. Normally, my Department likes to see the reports of its non-departmental public bodies by the end of July, but there may be circumstances in which that is not possible. For instance, I expect that we shall ask all RDAs to include in their reports the statement of accounts audited by the National Audit Office. I am sure that the hon. Member for South Suffolk acknowledges that that is a respected body and that it is therefore important that that information be included in annual reports. The amendment would leave a period of only three months within which the statement of accounts would have to be prepared by RDAs and audited by the National Audit Office. So although I hope that RDAs' annual reports will be produced within three months, I do not think that we should accept amendment No. 118.
<P>
Amendment No. 119 would require the Secretary of State to publish the reports and to lay them before both Houses of Parliament within 14 days of receiving them. There is no question of the Government's delaying the publication of information contained in annual reports, but it is not a sensible amendment. We may decide, for instance, to publish all the RDAs' reports on the same day, in which case we might have to wait more than 14 days for all of them to be received by the Department. If we accepted the amendment, the Secretary of State could then be subject to a judicial review which, in these circumstances, would be clearly inappropriate. With that explanation, I ask the hon. Member for South Suffolk to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister referred to fresh calculations about economic performance and GDP per head for regions elsewhere in the European Union. Will he make those calculations available to members of the Committee? If he cannot do so today, will he write to us, and tell us today when we can expect to receive that information? For which years do they apply?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Benton. I think that you received a copy of a two-page letter dated 31 January 1998, addressed to the hon. Member for South Suffolk in response to his question, outlining the current position. I shall ask my officials whether any further statistics are available that would guide the Committee, but I understand that the figures corresponding to the table to which the hon. Gentleman refers, the Eurostat figures, are not available. A judgment can be made, but not an absolute judgment, once those figures are available. I shall try to furnish the Committee with as much up-to-date information as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful for that assurance. I did indeed receive a letter, but wondered whether some additional information had become available in the past 12 days, in the light of the Minister's first response to the amendments.
<P>
I am encouraged to discover that the Government maintain an end-of-July target for the receipt of reports from non-departmental public bodies. In the light of that assurance, I am satisfied that it is not necessary to press amendment No. 118.
<P>
I am, however, still worried about the scope that the Bill allows for Ministers to sit on reports that they receive from RDAs. The Minister said that he might want to publish all reports on the same day. I am not sure what advantage that would give to people in the regions: if someone is anxious about the performance of the Eastern region, it is not satisfactory to be told that the report is not available because there is a delay in receiving the report from the Yorkshire and the Humber region.
<P>
An RDA may experience a problem, such as a dispute, or litigation arising from a transaction, that delays its report. It would not be satisfactory for several months to go by, and for people in other regions to be denied the opportunity to scrutinise what their RDA has done, just because it is administratively convenient to insist that all reports be available on the same day. In the light of that, although I am willing to seek leave to withdraw amendment No. 118, I shall press amendment No. 119 to a Division.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Vesting of land by order</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Clause 19 bestows wide powers on the Secretary of State, particularly the power to transfer to a regional development agency land previously vested in a local authority, a public body or a subsidiary of a public body. Will the Minister enlarge on the Government's thinking? For instance, what sort of land does he envisage being transferred from county councils? Does he envisage land being transferred from a parish council? What purpose will be served by such transfers? More important, what consultation will take place with local authorities before transfers are made?
<P>
Given the Government's reluctance we have evidence of it every time that we attempt to improve the Bill to allow local authorities much say in the operation of regional development agencies, it is important that we are clear what the Government envisage. The clause may directly affect assets owned by local authorities. Is it the Government's intention to consult local authorities at all before activating the provisions of clause 19?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman is at it again. He is asking me to give him lists of the land that is likely to be subjected to the procedure. The plain answer is that until proposals are made to switch the ownership of land, I do not know. We shall have to wait for RDAs to decide what to do. The clause simply allows transfers to be made within public bodies, to put together packages of land with the potential for development or regeneration.
<P>
I am surprised that the hon. Member for South Suffolk does not know the answer to his question, because the provisions of clause 19 replicate section 161 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1933. He may remember voting for that Act; indeed, he was probably a member of the Government when it was passed. That Act set up English Partnerships in exactly the same way. It allows packages of land to be put together in ways that may involve a transfer of land from one public body to another. It simply ensures that transfers can be made in a reasonable time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> It may be a clich\ae, but if that sort of information appeared in the notes on clauses, it would help us all a great deal.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I always found the notes on clauses an interesting experience when I was in opposition. I am glad to have been able to reassure Opposition Members that the clause is a standard one; I should also like to reassure them about the context in which that sort of transfer is likely to take place. It will have to fit in with normal unitary development plans and local planning authorities and will also be subject to the usual planning permission that applies to anything done on the land. The land can be transferred, but the decision whether to grant planning permission to do anything with it subsequently will, as Opposition Members will know, be unaffected by the provisions in the clause. All the conditions of the compulsory purchase order legislation, which I discover is uniquely complex 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Oh no it is not.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Well, it is a fairly complex example of legislation that I suspect would make even the best writer of notes on clauses blanch. All the conditions of the compulsory purchase order process will apply, as will compensation payments for anyone whose land is affected. The transfer will also be covered by the usual affirmative resolution procedure in Parliament. So there will be parliamentary protection, compensation and no exemption from any of the usual planning processes. It[Angela Eagle]
is an expedited way of transferring land from one public body to another for the practical use of setting up packages of land for regeneration purposes something that English Partnerships has done effectively since its formation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon made an important point about the notes on clauses. I do not think that the Minister can have been listening this morning, when her hon. Friend the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning confirmed that his assurance at our sitting last Tuesday that the provisions go no further than the legislation that establishes English Partnerships was wrong. We have had a helpful correction about that. It is no good using the justification of English Partnerships to respond to such concerns. The powers that the Bill gives regional development agencies go wider and further than the powers at present available to English Partnerships; we have established that as a matter of fact.
<P>
If the Minister is trying to get round to saying that she is giving the Committee a bankable assurance that the Government will table their own amendments to the Bill at a later stage to curb the sweeping nature of the powers in the clause, so that they can be applied only in respect of land that could have been the kind of land and for the kind of purposes for which English Partnerships legislation gives authority that is fine. I look forward to those amendments and I can assure the Committee that they will have my full support. However, I do not think that the Minister wants that. I think that she was trying to say that because some of the provisions have been lifted from another piece of legislation but have been greatly extended, in terms of the purposes for which they may be used and the kind of land that may be affected, that is a sufficient justification for them. However, it is not. We need to know more.
<P>
I did not ask the hon. Lady for lists of land again, she was not listening to me. I asked her for examples of the sort of land that would be involved. I want to get a feel for what Suffolk county council may be expected to give up; will the county farms be transferred to the Eastern regional development agency, for example? The Bill gives the Secretary of State such enormous powers that it creates more anxiety each time the Minister refuses to answer our questions. She is reinforcing the anxiety that is felt outside about regional development agencies. Indeed, if the Committee sits for much longer, I suspect that there will be a public revolt against the whole concept of regional development agencies because people will begin to understand that they are just a vast extension of central power exercised by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I do not know what I would do every week without my dose of the hon. Gentleman's characteristic understatement it is truly amazing to behold.
<P>
The clause enables an RDA to put together packages of land, which may be required for regeneration, inward investment or any other development project. The only other way to achieve that would be by compulsory purchase order, which is a lengthy and complicated process. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that we should remove clause 19 and use the compulsory purchase order legislation in its place, he cannot want there to be any development because it would take so long to put together the packages of land that nothing would ever be done. The hon. Gentleman must accept that provisions similar to those in clause 19 have worked in the past. The clause preserves safeguards, but allows for the quicker transfer of land across the public sector, in order to put together packages of land for regional development, be it a big inward investment site or a business park.
<P>
As I have already said, the clause does not exempt the RDA from the usual planning requirements; it only helps it to assemble land. It is then for the RDA or developer, be it a public-private partnership or a private sector partnership, to follow all the usual mechanisms to obtain planning permission. Compensation will be payable on any land that is transferred. Developments will have to fit in with democratically decided urban development plans and the provisions will also be subject to an affirmative resolution of the House. I do not know what other protective measures the hon. Gentleman would like us to include.
<P>
These sorts of provisions have worked well in the past and the only other option is to rely on compulsory purchase order legislation, which is in need of consolidating and updating. That would have the result of preventing economic regeneration. If those are the hon. Gentleman's arguments, they are misplaced. This system is more streamlined than the compulsory purchase order legislation and gives regeneration a chance to go ahead while preserving everyone's rights, as well as the transparency of the process.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am not sure whether the Minister dealt entirely with my question about the extent to which authorities from which land will be taken will be consulted in advance.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that they will wake up one morning and find that land has been taken away from them? I think they would notice that. It will be done in the same way as it has always been done. There will be discretion when decisions are made and compensation will be paid to those authorities which give up land. In our experience and that of English Partnerships, much is achieved by co-operation. The powers in the clause are to be used only as a last resort. It is clearly impossible for any public body to suddenly find that its land has been taken away by compulsory purchase order.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 19 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Schedule 4 agreed to.

<H4><center>Acquisition of land</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 144, in page 9, line 36, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provided that such land shall not include any part of an area which is designated as a national park or an area of outstanding natural beauty under the National Park and Access to the Countryside Act of 1949.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment has a modest and limited aim, to which few people could take exception. I certainly hope that the Committee will not do so, because the Opposition attach great importance to it.
<P>
I regret the fact that the Liberal Democrats are absent from this afternoon's sitting the clause is one of the most important in the Bill. It deals with the power of RDAs to acquire land, which they can do voluntarily, through negotiation with the owner, or compulsorily, using the established procedure. I agree with the Minister who said in our previous sitting that that procedure was extremely complicated. I agree it is certainly not without its flaws. The Government and the Opposition can find common ground and agree that the matter should have a fresh look. I shall certainly consider it in that light over the next few months, and I hope to make suggestions about how to improve it. Pending the outcome of that fresh look we must live with the proposed system.
<P>
My immediate concern is about the type of land over which the powers of acquisition may be exercised. As I read the clause, there are no restrictions about the type of land that could be involved. The relevant RDA can acquire any land, of any type, in any part of England either voluntarily, by agreement, or compulsorily, using the statutory procedure. The only criterion that must be satisfied by an RDA is that the land must be acquired.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for its purposes, or for purposes incidental thereto".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 4 states that the purposes of an RDA are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to further the economic development ... of its area ... to promote ... investment ... in its area ... to promote employment in its area".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One does not need to be a rocket scientist to appreciate that almost any type of land could be designated for the purposes of acquisition. RDAs will be able to say, in respect of any land anywhere in the country, "Ah, yes, we could use that land to promote investment and employment." Other clauses, which we shall discuss later, will give an RDA the opportunity to become the planning authority for any land without any restrictions whatever. The land simply has to be, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, "suitable for development".
<P>
The Committee has not yet discussed those clauses, but I hope that when it does it will reject them or accept my amendments and those of my hon. Friends. For the moment, however, we must proceed on the assumption that those clauses will be enacted. It is therefore possible for RDAs to acquire land inside national parks or in areas of outstanding natural beauty. Some people believe that national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty are situated in regions in which investment and development should be promoted. They may be in regions where people believe that business investment needs to be promoted by RDAs rather than through existing mechanisms. In such regions, it would be possible for RDAs to argue that land in national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty should be acquired in pursuit of their purposes. I do not believe that RDAs should be allowed that power. Such acquisitions would be wrong and would be likely to damage the environment and threaten the special protection that those areas enjoy. Protection has been bestowed on those areas because of the importance of preserving the environment for the benefit of the nation.
<P>
There is an area of outstanding natural beauty on the edge of my constituency called Dedham Vale. It is close to where I live in East Bergholt. Happily, most of it has been preserved so that it differs little from how it was when Constable walked across its meadows almost two centuries ago. It has been immortalised in paintings, some of which belong to the nation. In terms of the value that the local community attaches to it, that area is no doubt little different from many others. However, I happen to know it well and to love it. Others who know it even better may love it even more dearly.
<P>
That area of outstanding natural beauty is under threat from the Bill. The Eastern RDA will be given the power to acquire land in Dedham Vale within the designated area of outstanding natural beauty in the name of promoting investment. Perhaps the Eastern RDA will decide to promote investment there. It may decide to build a new hotel. No doubt it would not be difficult to find a private sector partner who would jump at the chance. [Interruption.] Does my right hon. Friend want to intervene? No.
<P>
<B>Ms Jenny Jones </B>(Wolverhampton, South-West): The hon. Gentleman talks about areas of outstanding natural beauty being destroyed in the name of investment. Is he aware that under the previous Government an Environment Secretary allowed a development by the Black Country urban development corporation to destroy a 700-year-old motte and bailey site in Northampton against the wishes of the elected local authority and residents?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Like so many people on the Government Back Benches, the hon. Lady has still not got used to the fact that Labour is in Government. She is still fighting the last election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> The hon. Lady is right that there have been cases over the years in which Secretaries of State have acted in that way. However, there have not been such a large number, of such significance, in such sensitive areas of the green belt.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Can we get back to the amendment? I remind Members who make interventions to keep them pertinent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Your indulgence is appreciated, Mr. Benton, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) made an important point that is now on the record. I welcome the intervention of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Ms Jones). If she is as concerned as her intervention implied, she will sympathise with my amendment, which is designed to reduce the risk of a recurrence of something that she objected to. She has the chance to vote for an amendment that will prevent the Government from making what she regards as the mistake of a previous Administration.
<P>
Let me return to areas of outstanding natural beauty and Dedham Vale. I am sure that all hon. Members can quote examples from their constituencies or nearby. The Eastern regional development agency might decide, in accordance with the objectives of RDAs, that it should promote investment in its region. It might find a private sector partner only too willing to invest in an hotel in the Dedham Vale. Under the powers in clause 20, the RDA could acquire the land and if there were any difficulties with planning consent, it could go to the Secretary of State and ask to be designated the planning authority for the area. Then, lo and behold, suddenly there might be an hotel where none previously existed.
<P>
That possible sequence of events shows that the threat to national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty is new and serious. It is a threat that has never existed in this country. It has certainly never existed as a result of any powers which a previous Parliament gave to English Partnerships. The purpose of amendment No. 144 is to remove that threat from the Bill. The effectiveness of regional development agencies in delivering the aims enshrined in the Bill would not be reduced in any way if the amendment were accepted. The purpose of regional development agencies would not be served if they bought up chunks of national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty. The success of regional development agencies does not depend on developing land which they have bought in such areas. If I believed that the success of regional development agencies depended on such purchases of land or development, my opposition to the concept of RDAs would be very much more intense than it is. Indeed, it might cause the Committee's proceedings to become more protracted [Laughter.] Hon. Members may laugh, but they have been able to observe during the past three weeks that Conservative Members have done everything to speed the passage of the Bill on to the statute book, merely pausing once or twice to try to introduce some amendments by which the success of regional development agencies might be better assured.
<P>
If people outside the House believed that the success of regional development agencies depended on their having the power to buy up chunks of land in national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, there would be widespread opposition to RDAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if the Government accept an amendment such as No. 144, they will alleviate much of the worry among the public that will give the Government considerable problems and is doing so already? I should have thought that the Government would be keen to accept an assurance such as my hon. Friend is trying to introduce in the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My hon. Friend anticipates the point that I was about to make. The amendment provides an opportunity not only to improve the Bill but to send a valuable signal to all those anxious people around the country who have seen the effect of some recent decisions when the views of local councils and independent planning inspectors have been overruled. If that can happen under existing legislation, people will be fearful of new legislation giving huge powers to unaccountable new quangos. The present philosophy will become far more threatening as a result of the powers in this and other clauses.
<P>
I can hardly believe that the Minister will try to claim that the success of regional development agencies will depend on allowing them to retain this power. I do believe that if the Government are remotely serious about the protection of our environment, the green belt, the countryside, national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, and if their claim to be concerned about such threats is to be given any credence, the Minister must today unequivocally and categorically rule out the possibility. He must put an end to the threat now. If there is any hesitation in his attitude or equivocation in his answer, we will know that somewhere in the great empire that is the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions there lurks among the Government's intentions a wish for an extension of powers. The Government have seen what damage they can do indeed, they have done enough damage with some recent planning decisions but the scope that the Bill gives for even more damaging planning decisions in the future is truly frightening. If the Minister equivocates in his answer we will know that the Government wish at least to keep open the possibility that RDAs might one day want to buy land in national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty, or impose developments on those areas that have previously and rightly received special protection. Until the last few weeks, I had thought that there was bi-partisan support for that special protection.
<P>
I want to make life as easy as I can for the Government. The Government Whip may wish to allow some Labour Members to leave early this afternoon to catch trains back to their constituencies. Some of those trains may even pass through some of the areas that we are considering under this clause. There were rather fewer Labour Members present at one o'clock this morning, but if the Whip wishes to let some of his troops go, I assure him that I will not make any points about the Government's majority dropping.
<P>
I am not sure that I wish to press the amendment to a vote. If the Minister gives a satisfactory response we might temporarily let the matter pass, and even if he gives an unsatisfactory response I will not necessarily press it to a vote. It is an issue of such importance that the House might wish to consider it on Report. If the House has such an opportunity, the intervening period can be used to alert all hon. Members whose constituencies include or abut national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, and even those whose constituents merely value the protection of those areas, to the threat contained in clause 20. If those hon. Members were aware of the true horrors that could be inflicted on previously protected areas as a result of the Bill, they might choose to express their support for an amendment with similar effects to that which I am currently moving, but may wish to withdraw [Laughter.] That will depend on the Minister's response, but it might be necessary for every hon. Member to vote on such an amendment. In an ideal world, the Minister would see sense and decide to accept the amendment. If he is reluctant to do so, we will listen to his reply with great care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I realise that there is some modestly attractive countryside in my hon. Friend's part of the world. He will know that I represent a large part of the Pennine dales, and that those parts of my constituency that are not in the national park are an area of outstanding natural beauty. He will also recognise that the area of outstanding natural beauty comes close to the urban conglomerations: it starts at the outskirts of Leeds and extends into my constituency. I can remember a planning battle of mammoth proportions that centred on a proposal to establish visitor centres at an ice cream factory. The person behind that proposal has now migrated to someone else's constituency.
<P>
The Minister will know, as he has responsibilities for planning, that national parks are often more loved by the people who visit them than by those who live in them. Often that is because inhabitants dislike what they see as pettifogging regulations and a preoccupation with the health of a visitor at the expense of the economic development and welfare of those who live in the national parks. Those of us who represent them find that complaint a leitmotiv in our surgeries. Can the Minister assure us that the national parks will be maintained for the benefit of those who live in them so that they can develop the sorts of lives that will promote rural vitality?
<P>
Areas of outstanding natural beauty are a different kettle of fish. No special planning powers are attached to them. They are merely designated, although they cover much territory. However, I must reprove my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk for missing the important point that the clause contains an even more sinister threat. RDAs might be able to purchase fields, gardens and allotments. The Minister, who represents the north of England, should recognise the importance 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must stress that that is not covered by the amendment and must ask the right hon. Gentleman to keep to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I feared, Mr. Benton, that there had been such extensive debate on the amendment that you might not be minded to allow a stand part debate. In order to assist the Committee, I hoped to ventilate that point now rather than later so as not to detain us longer than necessary.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have made it known that I will insist that we keep to amendments. There will be other opportunities to expand on other points. For the time being, please keep to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Of course I will, Mr. Benton. Perhaps you will note that I shall wish to raise the threat to gardens and allotments and to pigeon lofts on them when we reach clause stand part. For now, I shall confine myself to the national parks, which are held in general high esteem.
<P>
The Minister boasted that a Labour Government set up the parks. I hope that he will be able to make it clear that he intends a transfer of land so that packages of predominantly urban land can be brought together for development purposes. The clause is widely drawn, for which reason it is bound to give rise to alarm. We all know that what Ministers say in Committee can be cited in evidence, so I hope that he will speak categorically so that those fears may recede. My hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk can then withdraw his amendment, and I can return to my preoccupation with allotments and pigeons.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I do not think that I have ever heard a speech full of such controlled hysteria as the one we were treated to by the hon. Member for South Suffolk. He seems to enjoy hysteria and is very good at it. It is very amusing, but I suggest that he carries on taking the pills while we consider the facts.
<P>
Anyone who heard the hon. Gentleman might have thought that land in national parks could not be sold now from one owner to another. It can. Land can be sold to different owners or from the public to the private sector and vice versa. Land in national parks has nothing to do with the protection of national parks in statute. The national parks exist not to protect ownership but to determine what happens on the land, regardless of who owns it.
<P>
We will take no lessons from Conservative Members about the national parks. We set them up in 1949. Just to prove that life went on after he was sacked as Chancellor, Hugh Dalton set up a Labour foundation that is the basis of all our countryside protection legislation. Thanks to the 1945 Labour Government, we have areas of outstanding natural beauty and, in particular, the national parks. We will continue to enhance their protection.
<P>
We should remember that one of the core aims of RDAs is sustainable development, which includes appropriate protection for the environment. We discussed that subject at length previously. It would be unusual if an RDA believed that one of its core objectives involved ploughing up and destroying national parks or putting them under concrete.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon has hinted that those who live in national parks are as entitled to regeneration and development as those who do not. The appropriate safeguards must be in place. In some cases it may be a good idea for an RDA to acquire land in a national park. For example, an RDA may want to acquire land containing an opencast aggregates quarry so that it can help to restore the area. That would enhance the situation in the national park. The amendment would prevent RDAs from acquiring land in national parks. Acquiring land in national parks is not the same as being granted planning permission. The full protection that the law affords to areas of outstanding natural beauty and to national parks will still apply regardless of who owns the land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Under-Secretary is treading on rather dangerous ground in her reference to quarries. There are many quarries in my constituency that are also in the Yorkshire dales national park. Those quarries are significant generators of employment. When I was[Mr. Curry]
first elected to Parliament there was much discussion about the Drax B power station, which uses a gas desulphurisation process, and there was talk about using limestone to feed that process. There was much panic on the "Today" programme about whether that would involve re-opening old quarries. The chairman of the Association of National Park Officers repeated the allegation for days on end. I thought that I would get constituency letters about it by the shovelful. But how many came? Not one, because people prize employment. The Under-Secretary appeared to argue that an RDA might want to acquire land to close a quarry and to landscape the area. Would it also intervene to keep a quarry open?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I was talking about worked out quarries, which leave a tear in the countryside that requires restoration. The amendment would mean that a quarry in a national park could not be acquired by an RDA as part of a package to restore the land, which is absurd.
<P>
If an area in a national park needs regenerating, that has to be done in a way that is in keeping with the national park and that is environmentally sustainable. We are not talking about any old regeneration or any old example of concreting over, which the hon. Member for South Suffolk loves to discuss. The amendment would deny to people who live in national parks near quarries which will be worked out sooner or later all the opportunities that an RDA might offer to restore the land. Regeneration can have beneficial effects in areas of outstanding natural beauty or in national parks. The amendment would deprive those who live in national parks of that opportunity for ever and a day.
<P>
The clause will not give additional powers to develop areas, which are still subject to the proper planning protections. The clause deals only with ownership, and it constitutes no threat whatever to areas of outstanding natural beauty or to national parks. I hope that the hon. Member for South Suffolk will not press his amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am disappointed by the Minister's reply, although I am not surprised by it. She says that, because land in national parks can already be bought and sold, it is okay for the Bill to enable regional development agencies to buy and sell that land. However, the purchase of land by private individuals or others does not represent all the threats to the environment that a purchase by the RDA explicitly represents.
<P>
Until the Bill is enacted, there is no possibility of a body whose aims specifically include the promotion of investment and development acquiring land in a national park. Crucially, if later clauses are agreed to unamended, RDAs can become the planning authorities for the national park. So reliance on the planning process as a means of defence against the damage to the environment that might result from an RDA's acquiring land in a national park is completely worthless.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that all the planning legislation, with which we have all lived and worked, on the statute book offers no protection at all and is completely useless?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I have read subsequent clauses, and it is clear that they give the Secretary of State power to designate an RDA as the planning authority for any part of the land that he chooses. Therefore, it is at least possible, if the clauses are agreed to unamended, that the Secretary of State might designate the RDA as the planning authority for a national park. Having done so, and given the Secretary of State's recent cavalier disregard for the importance of countryside and greenbelt protection, there is every reason for people to fear the Bill's possible consequences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick </B>(Poplar and Canning Town): The hon. Gentleman is running the risk of contradicting himself. He has argued throughout the debates in Committee that this is a matter of urban areas versus the countryside. Is not he neglecting the fact that RDAs also have a role in tourism and in protecting and promoting rural life? Therefore, there is no threat to national parks and places of natural beauty. In fact, they go hand in hand. Is not he contradicting himself in suggesting that he wants to put the matter to the whole House?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The hon. Gentleman rightly refers to the fact that the Opposition are concerned that RDAs might be urban in their focus and primarily concerned with urban needs and problems. That remains a concern of mine. I am deeply disturbed that the lack of familiarity with bodies that have a rural focus is such that the Minister appears not to know the difference between the Countryside Commission and the Rural Development Commission. If that is indicative of the Minister's interest in rural matters, then my anxiety that RDAs might not be much concerned with rural needs is borne out.
<P>
There is no inconsistency between expressing a concern about the lack of RDAs' interest in rural problems and being concerned that the powers under the Bill could be misused to cause considerable environmental damage in areas that have previously enjoyed special protection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Can we return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick)? Does the hon. Gentleman want to deny RDAs the right to help regeneration in some rural areas? That is what the amendments would do. Does the hon. Gentleman want to straightjacket the RDAs? We have now uncovered the real aim of the amendment, which is to shackle the RDAs and prevent them from doing a reasonable job for rural communities. The amendment would limit the agencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We are indeed coming to the heart of the matter. We have teased out from the Minister what I thought he and his colleagues would not want to say. He has admitted that it is essential to the purpose of RDAs that they should have the power to acquire land in national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. Nothing could more clearly confirm that my fears are well grounded than that intervention, which the Minister thought was rather clever.
<P>
If the Minister was familiar with areas of outstanding natural beauty, he would know that they would not want the RDAs buying up chunks of land and imposing a development that may be quite out of character with what is needed. The best the RDAs could do for those areas would be to help the very small businesses the blacksmith who wants to train an apprentice, or the village shop that needs advice about how to remain in business in a small village. Such areas do not need large-scale development.
<P>
The Minister's urban background and his familiarity with urban rather than rural issues lead him to think it necessary to give the agencies the power to come blundering in to areas of outstanding natural beauty, imposing the sort of solutions that may be right for Sheffield but would not be right for rural Suffolk.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman at least concede that it might in theory be a good idea if an RDA could help put back into reasonable order a worked-out quarry that happens to be in a national park?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The hon. Lady referred in her speech not only to worked-out quarries but to working quarries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> No, worked out quarries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The hon. Lady referred in her speech to working quarries. I was going to ask later whether she could indentify any working quarries in national parks with planning consents that do not involve full restoration. She will be aware, I hope, that even those quarries that operate from a period that predates existing legislation have voluntarily agreed to accept the imposition of conditions to restore the area to satisfactory level. We do not need to start spending public money buying up quarries if the owners are already willing to do the job voluntarily.
<P>
<B> Mr. Caborn:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman that a number of quarries are now going through the planning assessment put on the statute book in 1995. However, those environmental and restoration assessments have not yet been completed and are unlikely to be completed soon. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon will know of a recent judgment that has implications for European Union environmental assessments and which could prolong that work for a number of years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I welcome the fact that progress is being made, even if it is slow. However, I suspect that what the Minister said in the past half hour in reply to my earlier remarks that RDAs might do the work of restoration may have sapped the motivation and sense of responsibility and obligation felt by private-sector owners of such quarries.
<P>
It is a great pity that the Minister seems to be off-message. She is saying that we are back to an old Labour solution: that only a public-sector body can do those things, but that we cannot work out solutions in negotiation with private-sector operators. Each time that hint is dropped in Committee, it sends a signal a rather unhelpful signal to operators who might otherwise be persuaded. I realise that it is a slow process; it has been going on for a long time. However, I think that most quarry operators are aware that they have to meet much higher standards; and because such operations tend to be long-term, they accept that reasonable environmental expectations have become much more exacting since they were started.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not really believe that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> It is happening. There are examples of private sector operators who have accepted far more onerous conditions towards the end of the life of their minerals operations than were initially imposed by the planning process.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> All well and good for them, but there are some instances of private developers of such features going bust and leaving the problem behind them. I realise what Wallasey is not a national park. [Interruption.] We shall see what we can do. I have an old brickworks in my constituency that was owned by a private company that milked all that it could out of the clay quarrying it undertook and then went into liquidation, leaving a complete eyesore to be dealt with by public liability. Will not the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the clause merely confers the possibility that a regional development agency could be involved, in public or private partnerships, in restoration or regeneration works in national parks? It is as simple, unthreatening and practical as that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I think that the Minister is trying to justify the retention of the powers by saying that a sledgehammer must be kept in the cupboard in case a mouse appears to chase a bit of cheese. She has not been able to quote a specific example of a minerals operator of a national park going bust; she says that the only solution under those circumstances is to get a regional development agency to acquire the land. I suspect that that is fantasy. The fact is that other operators would be willing to take over uncompleted operations, and the threat that the unamended clause poses to the environments of national parks is far greater than any benefit that might be achieved in the exceptional and unlikely circumstances that the Minister put forward.
<P>
In her first reply to the debate, the Minister said that the Government wanted to enhance the protection of national parks. If so, why does she not accept the amendment? She also said that the Government are concerned about sustainable development. May I remind her that in the legislation sustainable development does not rank equally with the other aims in the amendment: the furthering of economic development, the promotion of business investment or of employment, or the enhancement of the development of skills? Sustainable development is the only one of the five aims listed in clause 4 that is subject to a qualification a qualification that the Opposition sought to remove. The aim of sustainable development is qualified at the sole insistence of the Government. If the Minister is willing to recant that qualification, it is still not too late. The Government could today table an amendment to remove it I am sure it would go through on the nod. She could even take the wording from the amendment that I tabled two weeks ago if she were serious in her claim that the Government[Mr. Yeo]
believe that sustainable development ranks equally with those other aims. Clearly, however, they do not believe that.
<P>
In her first response, the Minister dealt exclusively with the issue of national parks. I did not hear her mention areas of outstanding natural beauty. I should be grateful if she would deal with my points about those.

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman has, in his customary fashion, spent many minutes tilting at windmills. He is wrong to scaremonger about the powers conferred by the clause. The protections to areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks which were enacted by a Labour Government are undiminished by the clause; indeed, the Government are examining the countryside legislation to see whether the protections currently afforded can be enhanced. So the hon. Gentleman is wrong he is scaremongering because the protection is undiminished.
<P>
Amendment No. 144 would exclude those who live in national parks from having any share in regeneration. That is unjustifiable and we hope that the hon. Member for South Suffolk will withdraw the amendment. I remind him yet again that the acquisition of land implies nothing about what is done with it. That will be subject to the usual planning procedures with all the extra protections that apply, especially in areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I was about to say that I was willing to withdraw the amendment, but the Under-Secretary has just said something rather surprising. She said that the acquisition of land implied nothing about what may be done with it. But subsection (1) of clause 20 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A regional development agency may for its purposes, or for purposes incidental thereto, acquire land".
<P>
Surely, in order to satisfy that wording, the acquisition of land does imply something because it must be used to further the purposes of the regional development agency.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Angela Eagle:</B> Of course it must be used to further the purposes of the regional development agency. The Government have a different view from the hon. Gentleman's about the core purpose of sustainable development, as set out in clause 4. But we have already had that debate and I do not intend to discuss it again. The hon. Gentleman obviously refuses to accept the assurances that were given on that occasion and if he refuses to accept reassurances, there is little I can do to reassure him further.
<P>
Clearly, the acquisition of land is for the RDA's purposes, but its purposes are sufficiently wide to ensure that sustainable development will be one of its prime worries. I shall say this for the fourth time and see whether it penetrates: even if land is acquired, nothing can be done with it unless all the plans are approved by the usual planning process, with all the considerable protections that apply in law. The hon. Gentleman should be reassured, therefore, that RDAs will not be able to tear up or destroy large areas of national parks. That is not their intention and it will not happen. The hon. Gentleman is scaremongering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Does not the Under-Secretary understand that if a regional development agency purchases land in either a national park or an area of outstanding beauty, people will automatically assume that something serious is going to happen, which they may not like and which may damage the beauty of the site? The planning procedures, which the hon. Lady says will protect such areas, will involve the decision of a Minister who has invested a lot in the success of the RDA.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> My understanding is that planning permission relating to national parks is considered by the national park authorities, not by Ministers, which is one of the extra protections.
<P>
Anyone, including private sector developers, can purchase land in a national park now. An asbestos mining company could purchase land in a national park and decide that it wanted to establish a centre of asbestos mining or packaging. Anything can happen in theory in national parks, but it must be approved according to the planning process. Ownership of the land is not the key to protecting what goes on in national parks. The protections are strong and undiminished, so Opposition Members need not worry about the implications of the clause for areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We have had a useful debate. It has not achieved the purpose for which I hoped that the amendment would be accepted but it has achieved something else, which may, in the long run, be even more valuable. It has thrown light on the Government's real intentions in relation to the activities of RDAs, in so far as those activities may affect national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. In light of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In the absence of Mr. Breed and Mrs. Ballard, amendments, Nos. 110, 111, 112 and 113 fall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> May I not move them?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, you may move them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 110, in page 9, line 40, leave out "a common," and insert "an".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 111, in schedule 5, page 32, line 1, at end insert "and".
<P>
Amendment No. 112, in schedule 5, page 32, line 2, leave out from "owners" to end of line 3.
<P>
Amendment No. 113, in schedule 6, page 35, line 35, leave out "a common," and insert "an".
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> As I said at the start of the previous debate, I very much regret the absence of the Liberal Democrats from the Committee. I note that they are unable to be present even to move their own amendments, but never mind, the official Opposition have more stamina [Interruption.]  We are happy to debate for as long as the Government Whip remains interested in the proceedings.
<P>
As the amendments have been tabled. I am sure that the Minister's officials will have considered them. It would be useful briefly to explore amendment No. 110. I am not privy to the thinking of the Liberal Democrats who tabled the amendment, so I have been trying to understand it as an outsider. The amendment relates to subsection (3) of clause 20, a subsection which I know is of great interest to my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon, who may wish to raise the question of field garden allotments during the stand part debate. But that is outside the scope of the amendment.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm this, but I believe that subsection (3) enables RDAs to acquire land that may then be given in exchange for the types of land specified in the subsection, which the agency has also acquired. So it seems that the amendment would prevent the Secretary of State from acquiring land that could then be exchanged by the RDA for common land that the RDA sought to acquire. If that is the correct interpretation, I am unsure what advantage Liberal Democrats thought would arise from the amendment. But if I have misinterpreted the clause, no doubt the Minister will explain what the correct interpretation is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving me an opportunity to explain the reasoning behind the clause and to answer what I believe is the thinking behind the amendments. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is unfortunate that the Liberal Democrats are not here to move that amendment.
<P>
The provisions in clause 20 and schedule 5 and 6 of the Bill are standard provisions for the acquisition of land by a public authority. They are the same as provisions that apply to English Partnerships.
<P>
Amendment No. 110 would prevent an RDA from acquiring land to give in exchange for common land or rights over common land that it acquires compulsorily. That means that, with limited exceptions, compulsory purchase orders relating to common land would be subject to special parliamentary procedure. That would make it more difficult for an RDA to acquire common land. But, more important, it would mean that when common land was compulsorily acquired, land could not be given in exchange.
<P>
I am sure that that was not the desired effect. The exchange of land procedure allows for the replacement of common land acquired for development. I can see no better way to ensuring that people are adequately compensated for any loss of amenity in those rare cases in which the RDA finds it necessary to acquire an area of common land.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 111 and 112 are aimed at an RDA that compulsorily acquires new rights over common land. The intention seems to be to prevent an RDA from using the deed poll procedure in the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 to vest those rights in itself when it cannot obtain a deed of grant from the landowner.
<P>
The effect of the amendments seems to be somewhat limited, and I cannot see that they confer any significant benefit on common land. Nor can I see why the process for the compulsory acquisition of new rights over land should be made more difficult for RDAs. Such acquisitions are subject to the normal procedures laid down by the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, which provide for the notification of objections and holding of public inquiries. In the rare cases in which a compulsory purchase might involve common land, existing rights over the land will be an important consideration in determining whether the purchase should be allowed.
<P>
I do not envisage that RDAs will make wide use of these particular powers, but that is not a reason for removing them altogether from the Bill. Sufficient safeguards are provided in the Bill to ensure that people are not unduly disadvantaged by the RDAs' exercise of those powers.
<P>
Paragraph 4 of schedule 6 allows an RDA to disregard Acts relating to common land in general or Acts specifically regulating the area of common land which it has acquired. Without that provision, an RDA might need private legislation to amend or repeal Acts affecting the land which it has purchased, but it does not mean that the RDA can do exactly as it likes. Any use which it, or any person, makes of the land must be in line with planning permission. Schedule 6 does not affect any rights that people have under common law.
<P>
In providing statutory powers for bodies such as the RDAs, we must allow for rare occasions such as the purchase of common land. This does not mean that we expect wide use to be made of such powers it may be that they will never be used. But we have a duty to ensure that the tools are there to deal with such cases. Otherwise, when cases do arise we will be blamed for our lack of foresight. The important thing is that sufficient safeguards should be in place to ensure that the powers cannot be used unreasonably, and to provide that those affected can be properly compensated through the exchange of land.
<P>
I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to put that on the record. I am sure that it will be interesting for those who read the report of our proceedings.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response, in particular for his confirmation that my interpretation of amendment No. 110 was correct. I share his bewilderment at the thinking behind the amendment, but at least we have cleared the matter up to, I think, the satisfaction of both parties currently represented in the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Benton. I realise that it is in order for hon. Members to table amendments and not to move them, but surely it is a discourtesy to the Committee. It is also a discourtesy to the Minister and his officials who have spent time preparing answers. Without the co-operation of hon. Members who move amendments on behalf of absentee members of the Committee, all that time and effort would have been wasted. Is there nothing that you, Mr. Benton, can do to guide the Liberal Democrat members of the Committee on how they should behave?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The matter has not gone unobserved. I think that this is the third time that this[The Chairman]
has happened to me as co-Chairman. I ask you to rely on my discretion to deal with the problem. An amendment is the property of the Committee once it is on the amendment paper. There is nothing untoward about an hon. Member who has not tabled it moving it. I ask hon. Members to allow me to deal with the matter.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I warned you, Mr. Benton, that I wanted a short spot on allotments. An incalculable human tragedy is in the making. People do not appreciate what it takes to look after an allotment. One cannot just dig it over. I moved into my house about 15 years ago and the vegetable garden is only beginning to take shape. It takes that sort of application. Allotments require loving care. A large amount of muck has to be put on them, and their pH has to be tested to see what they will grown. It is a serious business I see that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West agrees.
<P>
<B>Ms Jenny Jones:</B> Yes, I have an allotment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> There you are. We think that we can behave in a cavalier manner, kick people off their allotments and push them off to somewhere else. But new allotments are not the same. Preparing new ground is a serious matter. It can set a person back years. Think of the crops in an allotment. Rhubarb needs several years of muck and application to develop. [Hon. Members: "And asparagus!"] Yes, and asparagus. No doubt the Minister will say that English Partnerships has those powers. If someone had told me about it when I was in charge, I would have stopped the practice immediately. It is outrageous. We must consider the vistas, with corrugated iron, old railings and bits of barbed wire festooning many allotments. It is a real Lowryesque part of the urban landscape; no doubt it could qualify for display in the Tate gallery, and Japanese tourists would consider it a tourist attraction. Anyone who could consider Darlington a tourist attraction in its own right would go anywhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Ooh!
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> If the Minister has every tried to park his car at the weekend in Darlington, he will know what I am talking about.
<P>
In addition, there are chrysanthemums and leek shows: an entire culture is threatened by the Bill. The Minister should pay more attention to that. Moreover, there are often pigeon lofts on allotments; pigeons are being taken by raptors. That is a serious problem for the pigeon-fancying community, about which the Minister is aware. I hope that this is not merely a measure to disorient those pigeons to save them from the raptors. It is a serious matter, to which I hope the Minister will give a reply of the gravity that it deserves.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Although I am not the owner of an allotment, I have grown vegetables in my garden, so I know what a science it is. If the right hon. Gentleman has reached the stage of sophistication of growing rhubarb, mushrooms and other vegetables that are more difficult to grow, I can understand his worry about allotments being hauled up. However, he will be pleased to hear that field garden allotments have the same special protection as common land. Therefore, other than in exceptional circumstances, if an RDA wanted to acquire a field garden allotment, it must provide land to replace it of equal size and amenity. The PhD of the soil might be slightly different, I admit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> pH.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> pH, I am sorry. The pH of the soil may be slightly different, I admit. The gardener affected may therefore have to grow a different variety of vegetables until the land is stabilised or changed. However, clause 20(3) ensures that the RDA can provide replacement land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Will the Under-Secretary make sure that the new land provided is not next to a field where oilseed rape is grown? It is difficult to grow brassicas close to oilseed rape.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> If the right hon. Gentleman is like some of the gardeners whom I know, as I suspect he is, he will relish a challenge, and will be able to adapt to whatever difficult circumstances the RDA may place him in by hauling up his allotment and moving it down the road.
<P>
Without subsection (3), the RDA would not have the power to replace allotment land with land of equal size and amenity. That would be a crying shame. The right hon. Gentleman must remember that if allotments are in the middle of a package of land that needs to be consolidated for development, the public interest may be served by moving them out of the way, even if the standards of the leek competititon go downhill for a few years until the genuis of the gardeners who do all the preparation can get their produce back up to standard.
<P>
However, there are exceptional circumstances in which replacement is not required if the Secretary of State is satisfied that only a small area of land is required, and that exchange land is unnecessary in the interests of those who own rights over the land.
<P>
As the right hon. Gentleman will know if he ever watched old Hollywood movies, pigeon lofts are often on the tops of buildings as well as on allotments. Pigeons are usually quite canny. I am sure that we will have many an opportunity to discuss the threat posed by raptors to the pigeon population. Indeed, I spend half of my time answering questions from right hon. and hon. Members on that subject. I realise how much it exercises the minds of hon. Members. I assure hon. Members that, as we speak, members of my Department are counting raptors so that they can provide Parliament with up-to-date answers to the many questions that we are asked on the issue. If there is any change in the raptor population, I shall let the right hon. Gentleman know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I shall try to allay the alarm that will be felt across the north of England and in my constituency by saying that the Under-Secretary is clearly not a horticulturist, but she is sowing some good will. I shall try to reassure people of that.
<P>
If the Under-Secretary would tell me what "fuel" means in the same line, I should be even more deliriously happy.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Which line?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The same line, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"open space or fuel or field garden allotment".
<P>
Is "fuel" an adjective qualifying garden allotment? It does not make sense otherwise.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is apparently a term of legal art.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Could the Minister explain that?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It means that the land should be no less suitable for the purpose than the land that is being acquired. Whether a neighbouring field of oilseed rape would reduce the amenity of the land would be determined by the courts if necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I may have to return to that on Report.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Acquisition of land</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the fifth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I want to make one point on schedule 5. Paragraph 1(1)(b) seems to make it possible for a delay to occur in reaching decisions about the confirmation of a compulsory purchase order in respect of a piece of land forming part of a larger parcel of land which has been the subject of a submission to the Secretary of State under paragraph 1. In other words, if land has been the subject of a submission to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of State is satisfied that the order should be confirmed in respect of part of that land but not all of it, the consequence would be a delay in making a decision on the rest of the land. It has been suggested to me that that might create blight on the remainder of the land because it would be up for consideration as land to be compulsorily purchased, but the process would not have been carried through.
<P>
I am raising the matter to get the Minister to acknowledge the existence of a potential problem. I am not able to say now how serious it may be, but the point has been made to me and I can see that in theory there could be a problem for the landowner. I do not have a solution, but it is important to flag the Opposition's concern about the possible consequences of any blight that might arise.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Schedule 5 is one of those schedules that tend to appear in legislation because compulsory purchase powers are subject to a set of legal provisions that have not been consolidated for a very long time. Many of the powers relate to the 1960s or earlier and although there is one more recent Act on the statute book the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 it does not provide complete consolidation of the powers of compulsory purchase and that is something that needs to be done. Schedule 5 updates some sections of legislation from the 1960s to bring it up to date for use in the 1990s. The schedule is technical and affects an area which, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon agreed earlier, needs to be considered.

<TR><TD>
<P>

I can take the right hon. Gentleman at his word, by wondering whether the notes on schedules might give an explanation in more sensible language of schedule 5, on the acquisition of land. Let me leave it with the Committee for consideration. The notes say:</B><P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Paragraph 1(1) provides that where a CPO authorising the acquisition of any land is submitted to the Secretary of State in accordance with the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 he may, if he is satisfied that it ought to be confirmed as regards part of the land but has not yet determined whether it ought to be confirmed as regards any other land concerned, confirm the order as respects that part and give directions postponing, until a specified time, consideration of the order insofar as it relates to the other land where he has not determined whether it should be confirmed."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members appreciate the clarity of that. It demonstrates the need to consolidate powers of compulsory purchase, which the Department will consider. Until we do, we are stuck with legislation such as that contained in schedule 5, which is an ad hoc way of bringing some powers up to date. I hope that the Committee accepts that that is the intention of schedule 5.
<P>
On the point made by the hon. Member for South Suffolk about blight because of partial confirmation, any delay in confirmation could not be unreasonable and could be subject to judicial review. In appropriate circumstances, the purchase of remaining land or the serving of a blight order might be required. Some protections exist for those who own land that might be subject to partial confirmation. I crave the indulgence of the Committee in favour of a piece of necessary legislative consolidation.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Schedule 5 agreed to.
