<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021060000286"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good morning everyone. At the start of our
scrutiny proceedings on the Welfare Reform Bill, I have to go through a
script of the usual announcements. Members may, if they feel hot,
remove articles of clothing&#151;I am relaxed about that. I ask
Members to ensure that mobile phones and pagers are turned off or
switched to silent during Committee sittings. I remind the Committee
that there is a money resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of
which are available in the
room.</div><a name="09021060000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also remind Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments.
To be eligible for selection at a Tuesday sitting, amendments must be
tabled by the rise of the House on the previous Thursday. For a
Thursday sitting, amendments must be tabled by the previous Monday. As
a general rule, I and my fellow Chairman, Mr. Jim Hood, do
not intend to call starred amendments. In the recess, it will be
possible to table amendments up to 4.30 pm on Thursday 19 February, for
debate on Tuesday 24 February. I am sure that it would help hon.
Members if amendments were tabled before the rise of the House tomorrow
so that we are able to see them in print before the recess on Thursday.
Any amendments tabled just before the recess onwards may be accompanied
by a brief explanation to be printed on the amendment notice paper.
This is the latest experiment with explanatory statements on
amendments, and the Procedure Committee would welcome Members&#146;
views on those statements. During the week&#146;s break, Members will
no doubt like to reflect on these latest developments, and then pass
their views on to the Speaker and to the Chairmen&#146;s
Panel.</div><a name="09021060000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
everyone is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public
Bill Committees&#151;these are early days&#151;so it might help if
I briefly explain how we will proceed. I should say immediately that we
are indebted to our very wise Clerk. If Members have any queries about
procedure or how to deal with particular issues, I know that our Clerk
would be only too happy to
assist.</div><a name="09021060000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will be first asked to consider the programme motion, on
which debate is limited to half an hour, although we do not have to
take half an hour. We will then proceed to a motion to report written
evidence and then to a motion, which I hope we can take formally, to
permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of the oral
evidence sessions. Assuming that the second of those motions is agreed
to, the Committee will then move into a private session. Once the
Committee has deliberated, the witnesses and members of the public will
be invited back into the room and our oral evidence session will
commence. If the Committee agrees to the programme motion, it will hear
oral 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column2" />Column number: 2</div>evidence today and on Thursday, and revert to the more familiar
proceedings of clause-by-cause scrutiny after the
recess.</div><a name="09021060000010"></a>

welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Amess. I am sure that our
deliberations will be focused, but huge fun at the same time. I have no
doubt that this will be slightly different from the last Bill that I
took through&#151;the Counter-Terrorism Bill&#151;and that there
will be far more harmony this time. The scrutiny unit has said that
during Thursday&#146;s sitting, for which the programme motion
mentions only the Department for Work and Pensions as witness, it is I,
the Under-Secretaries of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friends
the Members for Chatham and Aylesford and for Burnley, and a lead DWP
official who will give evidence. When we discussed that in the
Programming Sub-Committee, I said that I was perfectly happy for this
Committee to choose whomever it wanted to give evidence. I am not clear
that that is by common agreement. The motion still refers to the DWP,
so this does not affect the motion. If, between now and Thursday,
colleagues on the Committee decide they want some variation of DWP
personnel, I am more than amenable to listening. With that one caveat,
I am happy to commend the motion to the Committee.</div>

like to say to the witnesses that while parliamentarians are used to
such proceedings, they can be a bit of an ordeal for people who have
never taken part in them before. Take deep breaths, if you feel nervous
in any way, and relax and enjoy the session. I assure you that Members
of Parliament will not harm you; they will simply ask a number of
questions to gather evidence before they begin detailed scrutiny of the
Bill.</div><a name="09021060000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

but try to shout, because the acoustics are not absolutely brilliant
and the microphones do not pick everything up. It is not only
parliamentarians who have to hear what you say, but the people writing
the record.</div>
<a name="09021060000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
calling the first member of the Committee to ask a question, I remind
all Members that questions should be limited to matters within the
scope of the Bill and that we must stick strictly to the timings in the
programme order. I hope that I will not have to interrupt anyone in
mid-sentence but, if necessary, I
will.</div><a name="09021060000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
we turn to the questions, I would like our two witnesses to make
opening statements about the Bill. You can speak for as long as you
want and comment on the Bill, which will give parliamentarians the
opportunity to reflect on what you have said before the questioning
begins.</div><a name="09021060000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Liz
Sayce:</b></i> Thank you. I would like to concentrate
particularly on the right to control in the Bill but, on a broader
level, RADAR supports the Bill&#146;s general direction. We agree
that nobody should be written off and that disabled people should be
enabled to work and should have the support that they need to work. I
will be happy to take questions on other parts of the Bill, if members
of the Committee wish to ask them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="09021060000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
focus especially on the right to control because it really matters to
disabled people. Having control over the services that you need to live
your life and participate fully in society, including through
education, employment and economic activity, is a huge change from
having services provided as thought fit by service providers.</div>
<a name="09021060000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to give some examples. I talked yesterday to people involved in the
individual budget pilots relating to people with mental health
problems. There are sometimes anxieties that people with mental health
difficulties will not be able manage their individual budgets. There
are some tremendous examples of people developing dementia being
enabled, through the resources available, to carry on doing the
activities that really matter to them&#151;from fishing to watching
sport on TV. Other examples include people who, rather than going to a
day centre, start pursuing their own interests by going to college or
pursuing interests in music, sport and so on, thereby regaining the
confidence and motivation to get back into employment. People are also
pooling resources and joining forces to buy the support that they
jointly want. For example, a couple of people have rented a workshop to
set up their own business, and a group of people have paid an art
teacher, because that is something that they particularly want to
pursue as a
group.</div><a name="09021060000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
therefore think that the right to control is absolutely transformative,
and disabled people around the country really welcome it. It builds on
the important work of the 2005 report &#147;Improving the life
chances of disabled people&#148; and the 2008 independent living
strategy. It also builds on the success of direct payments. Initially,
there were many anxieties about whether disabled parents would be able
to manage direct payments, whether there would be the right staff to
support them, and whether people would run off with the money, but
those fears have not been borne out by the experience of direct
payments. We are confident that the right to control could be just as
successful.</div>
<a name="09021060000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right to
control will give disabled people a kind of guaranteed tool. If they
take on more responsibility to work where they can, which we support,
it is really important that they then have the tools to make that
happen, and the right to control is an important part of that,
alongside other parts of the contract that need to be in place, such as
through the equalities Bill and pathways to work.</div>
<a name="09021060000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
few areas in which we think the Bill could be strengthened or go
further, and I have several examples. First, we welcome the Secretary
of State&#146;s clarification on why community care and health
funding are excluded, but we have experts who have looked at that and
think that it would be preferable to require the pooling of funds. The
whole point of the right to control, as set out in the White Paper, was
that it promised to give disabled people the power to take a range of
funding streams, and people want to be able to access that range of
funding streams and pool resources to achieve what they want in their
lives. If the funding streams remain separate, there is a risk that
part of the White Paper&#146;s goal will not be achieved. We are
looking at that to see whether further amendments might be
helpful.</div><a name="09021060000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
in clauses 31 and 32, we think that there could be better alignment
with the individual budget process. We think that people should
basically have a right to be told the resource allocation up front,
rather 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>than having to ask for it. We also feel that it should be based on a
self-directed assessment, rather than an assessment by the
professional. A person should assess what they need, and then they will
be in control of their plan, with the support of caseworkers or
professionals.</div><a name="09021060000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are slightly worried about the affordability clause. We understand all
too well that public money is limited, but we want to ensure that that
cannot be used as an excuse. We have a few other detailed comments,
which I will be very happy to come back to, but I have one final point.
There is a helpful provision in the Health Bill that recognises the
important role of the voluntary sector in enabling people to use
personal budgets through advocacy and brokerage, and we think that
enabling several people to band together to use budgets would be
helpful. People cannot always use the budgets without the right
support, so such a provision would be
useful.</div><a name="09021060000033"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000291"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you very much indeed for that full and
concise explanation. May we now hear from Oldham
council?</div><a name="09021060000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> I agree with everything that has been said
and will give a little more detail from our perspective. It is worth
saying that Oldham council has taken something of a lead on personal
budgets in adult social care, and that is important because there is a
bit of a worrying point, if I am honest. About 1.75 million people
across the country use adult social care or social care services in one
form or another, but only 10,000 of them have a personal budget, which
is a tiny part of the overall figure&#151;really just a drop in the
ocean.</div>
<a name="09021060000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That reflects
the history of choice and control in adult social care. We have had
direct payments since the 1990s, but progress under the direct payments
legislation has been very slow and disappointing. I make that point
because I think that it contains the seed of a warning for the Bill,
and from my perspective there is no question but that the figure of
10,000 for people with personal budgets, over 2,000 of whom are in
Oldham, is insufficient and represents an insufficient pace. There are
several reasons for that, some of which relate to the difficulty that
organisations&#151;whether central bureaucracies or local
authorities&#151;have in reorganising their services to meet a new
agenda.</div><a name="09021060000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is similar to that expressed by my colleague: the provisions in
the Bill could be more ambitious. Our experience in Oldham&#151;and
it is a strong experience on the numbers alone&#151;is that division
in funding streams is a sovereign recipe for ensuring that people who
use services, or try to negotiate their way through them, do not manage
to make any progress. It is extremely difficult, even when you have
partially integrated funding streams, to deliver success for people,
because the organisations that retain responsibility for that element
of their funding keep their own mechanisms of control, their own routes
and their own way of doing things. For people using the service and
trying to take control of their lives and services, it is frankly a bit
of a nightmare.</div>
<a name="09021060000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">If people do
not have that element of choice and control, we cannot see any other
way by which to empower them to take control of their own lives, to
become co-producers in the delivery of their own services and to
contribute all the good things they have to offer as full citizens.
Within the current adult social care 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>system, none of that takes away from a local authority&#146;s duty of
care&#151;that is not reduced in any sense by any of this.</div>
<a name="09021060000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
that is important, because it seems to me that there are two elements
that need to be picked up: duty of care and affordability. Our
experience in Oldham is that things are unaffordable if you do not
reform your existing systems&#151;that is what causes a problem.
There is a remorseless logic to giving people choice, control and money
but, in doing so, you have to unpick some of your existing
arrangements. That is very difficult and perhaps explains why there are
only 10,000 people with a personal budget.</div>
<a name="09021060000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
some hard questions to be asked once you go down that route. When you
do so, however, you get something of an explosion of creativity among
the people who are using, choosing and controlling their own services.
I will give you a generalised anecdote. If I tell somebody that I spend
&#163;40,000 a year on their care they say, &#147;You must be
joking. I could do considerably better than that for half the
money.&#148; To be honest, they are very often
right.</div><a name="09021060000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are some key lessons that we need to learn about the integration of
funding streams. We need to ensure that there is a system
lead&#151;for want of a better description&#151;for all aspects of
a person&#146;s life, whether it is employment, where they live or
the care services that they receive, if they receive them. We will not
be able to deliver this absolutely fantastic agenda of personalisation
if we do not make things workable for people. You cannot expect people
who have been out of employment for a very long time and may have lost
their skills, or may never have been in employment or had any form of
meaningful day time activity, to exercise choice and control in their
own lives if you do not make the system simple and put in place
guidance and support. If that is not delivered by the Bill, the system
will fail and not deliver what is required.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021060000292"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you very much for that very helpful
evidence.</div><a name="09021060000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><a name="09021060000293"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): Both of you had a
consistent theme of making sure that different funding streams were
integrated and available to individuals. The Bill currently provides
for funding streams from only the Department for Work and Pensions to
be included, and as Liz Sayce said, that does not include the adult
social care funding. The Department has said, in written answers, that
it is going to consult on how its own funding stream should be included
in their pilot programmes and whether the disabled facilities grant and
adult social care should be included. I got the sense, from your
evidence, that you very much think that it should and I want to get a
sense from you of how critical that you both think that is.</div>
<a name="09021060000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are very
supportive of what the Government are doing across Government about
individual budgets, but there is a danger that different Departments
are setting up their own. We already have adult social care: this one
from the Department for Work and Pensions; the Department of Health is
looking at personal budgets for health care; and the Department for
Children, Schools and Families is looking at piloting individual
budgets for disabled children. It seems to me that there is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>danger that we are just going to replicate different Departments and
different funding streams. Individuals will not actually have control
and will have to battle with a number of Departments and a number of
funding streams with different rules, and will not be able to bring
them together. I would like a sense for the Committee, before we debate
the Bill, about how critical it is to grapple all those funding streams
together.</div>
<a name="09021060000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Liz
Sayce:</b></i> It is very important for two reasons. First,
individuals talk to us about the fragmentation of the system and how
difficult it is to navigate through it. People want to have control
through a simple route to access either the pot of money or the right
for that money to be used on their behalf across the different funding
streams. Quite often the Departmental boundaries do not make intuitive
sense to the individuals. There is a lot of overlap in what we call
social care or health care and support for employment. Some of the
things you need for social care might very well help you in your
journey into employment because it might be about having a PA to
support you. That PA helps you to get up and get out of the house but
can also help you to travel to work. These things are all interlinked.
Having to navigate through multiple gateways is a complexity that
people would prefer to do without, to put it mildly.</div>
<a name="09021060000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
thing is that there is a risk of a poor use of resources if you have
multiple assessments and multiple funding schemes. Our sense is that
the right to control with integrated funding streams, where possible,
will lead to a better use of resources because the individual in their
self-assessment will be able to say what they most need such as, as
Paul was saying, &#147;I could do better if I knew how much money
there was across the piece.&#148; It is critical. Obviously there are
real complexities in delivering it. We certainly intend at RADAR to
seek expert advice on potential amendments to this part of the Bill to
see whether some kind of requirement to pool budgets might work better
than simply having an exemption, and what is obviously a very genuine
intention to align the piloting where possible and to consult. There is
a lot of agreement that people want to move towards better alignment.
It is a question of how and at what pace to do it. We do not want that
pace to be too
slow.</div><a name="09021060000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><a name="09021060000294"></a><b class="B">Meg
Munn</b> (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab/Co-op): I share the
frustration about how slow the process is. I worked in social services
in the &#146;90s and remember some early attempts to do precisely the
kind of things that Ms Sayce was talking about, and people&#146;s
fear about what that would mean. It seems to me that, however many
years on, we should be well past that, but we are not. How much do you
feel that what is holding people back is about what is in the
legislation, and that this is an opportunity to do something about
that? How much is about the structural problems which are out there and
will continue to exist, regardless of whether or not we change the
legislation?</div><a name="09021060000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> Speaking from our experience at Oldham, which
probably holds good for many other places, too, we tried to integrate
as many funding streams as possible into our individualised budget
allocation to include just everything we could. Some of it worked
extremely well. For example&#151;and this is not a plea for control
by local authorities&#151;the parts of the funding streams that were
controlled within the local authority were relatively 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>easy to integrate. There was not a significant problem with that because
there was a single source of authority for integrating those streams.
We had some success in integrating Supporting People funding with
support from the Department, because it was within the gift of the
local authority for us to do that through negotiation with the
Department. That works very well. We have had very good success with
integrating continuing health care funding in Oldham, although I know
this is not the universal experience. That is simply through a
co-operative effort with our local primary care trust. It is a bit of
an exemplar for how one can make life easier for people.</div>
<a name="09021060000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where we
struggled was in integrating Access to Work funding. Colleagues in the
DWP worked their socks off to make it work. They really tried very
hard. They were fantastic, but they just could not make it work around
the rules and regulations. Nor could we. That was a real problem for us
and it remains something of a separate stream that we have to work to.
We had a similar frustration with the independent living fund. I know
that that has been much discussed. There are basically two completely
different funding schemes with mutually exclusive assessment systems.
None the less, we managed to get some success in integrating those. In
terms of economy of effort, which is what we are looking for here, a
lot of hard work was required to integrate those funding streams that
were not naturally within the control of one
organisation.</div><a name="09021060000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000295"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> So the issue is about the detail, the requirements,
the criteria and so on that will be in place, because inevitably you
have to limit who is entitled to things and how it is done, as opposed
to, in your case, the unwillingness of one of the organisations to take
part.</div>
<a name="09021060000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I would not say that it was
unwillingness; it was simply inability.</div>
<a name="09021060000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000296"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> If you look at child care legislation on meeting the
needs of a child, other organisations, beyond the local authority, are
required to assist in doing that. I wondered whether, along with
changing criteria around spending, one mechanism might be permissive
criteria within the legislation.</div>
<a name="09021060000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> My gut feeing is that permissive does not do
it. It requires something more direct. For that reason, I am also
concerned about the unreasonable financial burden, because, I suspect,
we are potentially building into this a system of gateways that does
not need to be there, through which those organisations that are
willing and able will pass, and those that are either unwilling or
unable will not. I think that it needs to be something more than
permissive. To deliver something that works, my feeing is that to bring
the full fire&#151;for want of a better description&#151;of all
these different organisations wrapped around the individual, it needs
to be more
directive.</div><a name="09021060000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is good work outside of Government; organisations such as In Control
are looking at how different funding streams can be integrated through
a simple resource allocation system. That is the key; it is about the
individual knowing how much money they have to meet their needs, having
a set of defined outcomes that they have to work towards and having a
vehicle for delivering them. In our experience, where one is able to
integrate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>those funding streams into that single delivery vehicle, wrapped around
the individual, with that individual having choice and control, it
works. What does not work is a load of bureaucratic jiggery-pokery at
the back as organisations try to sort things out, and not always
seamlessly. That is a not the way to ensure that we get people into
employment, meaningful daytime activity or a system of care that suits
them.</div>
<a name="09021060000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><a name="09021060000297"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): May I pick up on a couple of points
relating to the level of support? One thing that concerns me is that in
rural constituencies, which many of us represent, the choice will not
be there and the cost will be greater, so budgets will not go as far as
they ought to. Have you picked up on that
concern?</div>
<a name="09021060000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> Oldham sees itself as a country town really.
A large part of our borough is in a rural area in the national park,
but we also have a densely inhabited section close to Manchester, so we
are a mix. Your concerns are entirely justified, but in the case of
adult social care it is the responsibility of the director of adult
social services to ensure security and sufficiency of supply. None of
that takes away some of the things that we have to do. It is not simply
about giving people the money unconditionally and saying, &#147;There
you are, get on with it. That&#146;s absolutely fine,&#148; and
people discovering that there is nothing to use the money on or that it
does not work for
them.</div><a name="09021060000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is work behind all this that, in my case, a local government agency is
paid to do, which is ensure that supply is available and that there is
a sufficient market, if that is required, or sufficient support, if
that is required, to ensure that people&#146;s needs can be met. That
is part of the needs assessment that needs to take place between
organisations.</div><a name="09021060000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, needs assessment, certainly in adult social care, has centred
on the relationship between health and social care, but it needs to be
broader than that because nobody&#146;s biology is their biography.
It is not just about health or anything else; it is, exactly as my
colleague has said, about where they live, what employment is available
and even, in the case of a very large local authority, what transport
is available, as well as what role the whole council&#151;in my
case&#151;is playing in concert with, for example, voluntary sector
partners to ensure that there is sufficient supply. None of this takes
away that responsibility to make sure that those things are in place to
support the
individual.</div><a name="09021060000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000298"></a>John
Howell:</b> I understand the point you are making about the
duty and how you intend to develop that. Nevertheless, it still prompts
the practical question of how it is possible in a rural area to
encourage new providers to come in and deliver the choice that people
in more urban areas would
expect.</div><a name="09021060000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> In my experience, there is a market. We were
told very early on in Oldham that we would lose. It was a great concern
among our providers, such as those offering domiciliary care, that the
atomisation of the market, due to personal budgets coming in, would
mean no work for anybody and people going out of business&#151;it was
all going to be terrible. In the first year, we more than doubled the
number of providers coming to do business with us. The reason for that
is simple.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div><a name="09021060000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
talked before about something of an explosion of creativity. If the
scope of one&#146;s imagination is the existing traditional system of
support, you are quite right that there are limitations within that,
because it is the way that organisations do business and have done in
the adult social care base since the early 1990s, when community care
came in. But actually, the support that people require is often
non-traditional, things that I could not possibly imagine. I could
never had made up the things that people come back to us to say that
they need support with. Often to my great surprise, though less so now,
the solutions that people reach to meet their own needs are so far away
from the traditional but so effective that the issue of traditional
sources of supply is
minimised.</div><a name="09021060000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
guess that the point I am trying to make is that until you begin to
give people the ability to do this and to control and deploy their own
resources in a way that they feel comfortable with and that meets their
needs, you cannot begin to guess what solutions they will come up with.
Some of those solutions are within their neighbourhoods or often within
their own families&#151;ones that previously would not have been
thought of. They are very unconventional
solutions.</div><a name="09021060000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might help if I give you some facts and figures. Our experience in
Oldham is that about 50 per cent. of the people to whom we give a
personal budget say, &#147;Thank you. I do not want the money. I am
happy either for you to control that or for me to have some element of
control over how that money is spent. You crack on and deliver my
services.&#148; Another 25 per cent. say, &#147;Thank you. I will
take all the money. I will plan, organise and commission my own care
and services, and deliver those. No problem.&#148; The remaining 25
per cent. would say, &#147;Thank you. We will take part of our
mission critical services as a delivered service, but some element of
it as services we will control
ourselves.&#148;</div><a name="09021060000063"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000299"></a>John
Howell:</b> On that point about support, there has been an
increase in the budget of one particular funding stream of Access to
Work. Do you see that leading to it being spread more thinly across a
larger number of people or leading to much higher individual use for
larger
adjustments?</div><a name="09021060000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> It is difficult to say. What I do know is
that we have had a lot of success at delivering people into employment
using Access to Work as a vehicle, but, as I said earlier, it has taken
a lot of effort. It is inevitable that when you make the system easier
for people, more will be empowered to use it and will take advantage of
it. My view is, so much the
better.</div><a name="09021060000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><a name="09021060000300"></a><b class="B">Mr.
James Plaskitt</b> (Warwick and Leamington) (Lab): I have
questions for each of you. I will come to Liz first to give Paul a
rest. In your evidence, you spoke about the importance of what you
described as self-directed assessment, but you also spoke about the
need for support for people to make those decisions. Especially in
cases where we are talking about mental disability, there is a very
difficult line to determine: at one extreme, someone can make all the
decisions about their care and at the other extreme they cannot. There
is a space in the middle where it can be done with support. Are you
confident that the resources are there to give adequate support to make
this
work?</div><a name="09021060000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Liz
Sayce:</b></i> In the spirit of the Mental Capacity
Act 2005 and the principles that lie behind it, there has
been a shift in services around the country towards first 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>assuming that people will have capacity and offering the support to
enable people to make decisions. There is the thinking that sometimes
people might not be able to make decisions on certain things, but let
us try to help them make decisions. I think that that has been very
welcome. It has led to surprise in that some people who would have
previously been thought of as unable to make decisions are now being
seen as able to make them. That is partly why I used some mental health
examples earlier&#151;people with dementia, schizophrenia or learning
disabilities having choice and
control.</div><a name="09021060000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are learning from the individual budgets that people are able to make a
lot more choice and take a lot more control than would have been
thought 10 or 20 years
ago.</div><a name="09021060000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of whether the support is there, it is really important that
there are user-led organisations in every part of the country, as was
laid out in the life chances report. There is, of course, a commitment
to there being user-led organisations in each part of the country that
can provide the kind of peer-led, user-led support that people find
incredibly helpful. So, it is not only the professional, the case
manager or whoever, advising and supporting somebody to create their
own assessment and plan, but other people who have done it
themselves.</div><a name="09021060000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Very
often, people are initially limited in their imagination, but they then
say, &#147;Oh, you mean that rather than go to the day centre I could
have driving lessons. Then I could go to visit my relative or I might
be able to get a job in the next town.&#148; It had not occurred to
them that they could use the money for driving lessons, but once they
have it, they are on a roll and things begin to develop.</div>
<a name="09021060000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, I think
that we are still on a path in terms of the implementation of the 2005
Act; we could do even better to ensure that people&#146;s capacity is
supported. Different parts of the country have different levels of the
sort of peer-led support that I am talking about. That is a major
priority, because some people clearly need advocacy and they need to be
brought together so that collections of people can buy something. Some
things that people want are not just individual. There are a couple of
examples that I use, such as two people renting a warehouse together to
set up a
business.</div><a name="09021060000071"></a>

we want to aim it
at?</div><a name="09021060000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Liz
Sayce:</b></i> At the moment, we are satisfied that that is
taking place in some parts of the country, and to very high quality. We
can see how it can work. But, it is not taking place in every part of
the country, so we would like to see attention given in the
Bill&#151;I mentioned the analogy in relation to the health
bill&#151;to provision for the voluntary sector to make available
that kind of support, including advocacy and brokerage, because without
that the pace of change will not be what Paul and I have said it needs
to be. We need to move on with this at a more rapid pace, and that
needs advocacy and brokerage to be in place around the
country.</div>

13</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000303"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> That is very helpful. Thank you. Paul, picking
up exactly where you finished, in your evidence you raised a concern
about the pace of progress that has taken place, and I think that you
implied that there was a question about the pace going forward from
here&#151;whether it would come through quickly enough. Are you
saying that you have encountered institutional inertia in bits of the
system? Will that still be a problem as the Bill comes into effect? If
you do think that, what can be learned and applied from the Oldham
experience? Does something else need to be done in the Bill to help us
overcome that problem, or is what is here
sufficient?</div><a name="09021060000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> All the tools required to do all this are in
place. All the knowledge and the experience required to make all this
work are in place. As my colleague said, the fact that it is working in
some parts of the country shows that it can be done; there is
absolutely no reason why
not.</div><a name="09021060000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fact that that is not being done more widely is of huge concern: not
only Oldham but all the other individual budget pilot sites were told
very early on that some things would never work, by people who
apparently knew that they would never work. Individual budgets would
never work for people with mental health problems. They would never
work for people with learning disability, or for people who misused
substances, or for people with dementia. Frankly, that is
rubbish&#151;I choose my words with care&#151;and experience shows
that it
is.</div><a name="09021060000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that the centre&#151;the Government&#151;has invested a
lot of time and effort in putting those mechanisms in place and working
up the experience and the tools to make it all happen, and they are all
available, but the direct answer to your question is yes, it seems to
me that there is a lot of inertia in the system.</div>
<a name="09021060000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">It falls into
two parts. Quite honestly, some folks just do not get it, for want of a
better description, and some say, &#147;That&#146;s all in the
&#145;Too difficult&#146; box and we can&#146;t really do
it.&#148; Well, you can; any organisation can. I believe that there
are the resources to provide the support out there, but at the moment
they are doing other
things.</div><a name="09021060000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
you look, for example, at productivity in adult social care, you will
see that the Commission for Social Care Inspection went down at the
same time as investment went up. There are reasons for that, and I
feel&#151;it is not just my own feeling&#151;that a lot of that is
tied up in the front end of services and in the nuts and bolts of
making services work.</div>
<a name="09021060000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to
me that a simplified system of the sort I mentioned earlier would
enable organisations to participate fully, taking full advantage of the
tools that have been put in place to deliver a system that is quicker
and slicker and more effective for people. Unusually for someone from a
local authority, I am not sitting here saying that we need considerably
more resources to be able to do that&#151;not at all. I am saying
that a bit more direction and a bit less permissiveness in the Bill
would unlock all
that.</div><a name="09021060000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
have had the option of direct payments since the 1990s, but across the
country there are people who ask for a direct payment and are told that
they will have to wait until the money becomes available the following
year. I do not think that that is written anywhere in the legislation.
There are issues about unlocking what has to be done.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div><a name="09021060000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to a
point that John Howell asked me about, in the original guidance on the
community care legislation, some cracking good examples were given of
what could be done in large rural areas. One that stuck in my mind was
the suggestion that we could ask the landlord of the local pub to
provide the meals for the elderly population of that rural area. That
never really happened, and local authorities instead commissioned
200,000 frozen meals on wheels a year because we felt more comfortable
with that.</div>
<a name="09021060000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are not
using direction&#151;instruction&#151;and if we are not using good
practice and the good work that is going on to guide and instruct
practice, the pace will not be quick, and it has not been quick so far.
It will remain at a relatively unsatisfactory level if those things are
not in place. The system is a big system, as are all such systems, as
far as the individual is concerned, and they are very difficult to
organise. Unless there is a duty to co-operate and to deliver that
single, wrap-around approach to the individual, the system will not
work. If you do not do it that way, it will require people of good will
and a critical mass within particular leadership
organisations&#151;the local authority or whatever it might
be&#151;to deliver
it.</div><a name="09021060000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also echo the point about user-led organisations. The Government have
been fantastic at saying that they are trying to get away from the
top-down approach and that they want people to be co-producers in this,
but if we are to get the best out of that, we must ensure that there
are in place not only statutory support mechanisms, but non-statutory
mechanisms.</div><a name="09021060000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
responsibility to involve everyone who can help and support an
individual needs to be included, and it needs to be our responsibility.
There needs to be more than just a statement that we can do it or that
we might do it if we feel like
it.</div><a name="09021060000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><a name="09021060000304"></a><b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): I would like to move on to clause
8, which deals with the conditionality aspect for payments of
jobseeker&#146;s allowance and employment and support allowance. The
Government have an ambitious target for getting people off incapacity
benefit and back into work. What are the challenges and what support
and training need to be put in place for Jobcentre Plus to be able to
carry out some of the new powers that are in this
Bill?</div><a name="09021060000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Liz
Sayce:</b></i> First, there are some issues with the
graduated approach to conditionality and the use of the just cause for
people not complying with particular aspects of what is expected under
conditionality. We need to be absolutely sure that included in those
just causes are things like inaccessible processes, transport
difficulties that disabled people may face and issues that the parents
of disabled children may face where perhaps it is much harder for them
to find accessible child care facilities to enable them to take up
their responsibilities in employment. There is a big training need
there to ensure that people get treated fairly through this new
system.</div><a name="09021060000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
Access to Work was mentioned earlier. In relation to work-related
activity, at the moment Access to Work relates to employment but not
necessarily to some of those other vocational activities, training and
so on. Sometimes it is difficult for people to participate in the very
thing that they need to enable them to get 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>back into employment. We would like to see the resources on Access to
Work go into publicising the scheme more and ensuring that it is there
for those other work-related activities, as well as paid employment
itself. There are obviously concerns among disabled people around the
country about conditionality. It is the issue of fairness. The training
point is very important. People should not end up at the end of that
conditionality route being expected to do community-based voluntary
activity in order to get their benefits if the process leading up to
that has not been fair. Some real questions are being raised by a
number of disability organisations about
that.</div><a name="09021060000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final point is about getting skills. During a recession people want to
keep their job if they possibly can or to get into work, and we applaud
the intention not to take the foot off the pedal on welfare-to-work
provisions. However the reality is that some people will be out of
work. What better time for people to refresh and update their skills
and to be ready for exactly the sort of jobs that will exist in the
economy when we come out of the recession? At the moment,
unfortunately, a third of people with no skills in this country and no
qualifications at all are disabled people. Disabled people have been
left behind by the skills revolution. That is an area of major
importance and we need to make sure that the support services, the
right to control, Access to Work and all these budget streams can be
used by people who are seeking to develop their skills and their
qualifications, as well as by those who are directly engaged in the
labour
market.</div><a name="09021060000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><a name="09021060000305"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Lilley</b> (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con): Mr.
Davies, you mentioned that something like a fifth of the people with
personal budgets in the country are in Oldham. Is it reasonable to
suppose that you have probably pushed the process of moving towards
personal budgets as far as is possible within the present legislative
framework? If so, to what extent do you think the measures in the Bill
and the programme of development that the Government have spelled out
will enable you to carry it further or make it easier for other
authorities to develop? Is there anything you would like to see in the
Bill that would enable you and others to carry it further and
faster?</div><a name="09021060000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> We are probably reaching the limits of the
current legislation. In some cases we may have gone beyond those
limits. There is something about the current system being stretched in
terms of how one can manoeuvre within it. That is not to say that it is
not, in some senses, quite permissive. The difficulty with a permissive
system is that you can do it if you want to, or not, as the case may
be, and I think that is what has caused some of the problems.</div>
<a name="09021060000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, in
direct answer to your question, I would like to see something that was
more directive regarding organisations. For example, it is very
difficult for somebody in Jobcentre Plus to understand&#151;through
no fault of their own&#151;some of the difficulties associated with
dealing with people who might have had chronic schizophrenia, or
something similar, for some time. I think that a more directive duty to
work closely with those agencies that understand all of that&#151;and
it is a duty to work together; it is not just a one-way
street&#151;would make a big difference. This is a many-hammers
question, because every individual is a complex person with their own 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>needs and requirements. Unless we can get all those agencies working
together&#151;I truly feel that that has got to be directed; I can
see no other way around it&#151;we will not achieve what we need to
achieve.</div><a name="09021060000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to expand on the point about conditionality. The
Government&#146;s social care reform has conditionality within
it&#151;it is outcome-focused, there is a contractual requirement and
the local authority retains the right to say whether a particular
arrangement will go forward if it is satisfied that that arrangement
makes best use of public money and is safe, among other things. It is
not rocket science to have a similar conditional arrangement around
every other element of this. That conditionality is there elsewhere in
other parts of the Government&#146;s programme. I think that best
practice should be shared, not only across local authorities but across
central Government as well, and I think that would make a huge
difference.</div><a name="09021060000095"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
16</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000306"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> A point which may be as much, if not more, related
to Ms Sayce as to you, is that we are all familiar with the
difficulties different institutions have in co-operating with each
other. I used to say that it was more difficult to get one Government
Department to co-operate with another than it was to get the United
States and the USSR to co-operate at the height of the cold war. I
think that that is true not just in central or local government and in
other institutions, and it is clearly a
problem.</div><a name="09021060000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder to what extent the difficulty that institutions have in
co-operating is that they find that the current rules and the current
control that they have are a way of rationing resources, and that if
they move to personalised budgets, they believe it will lead to an
explosion of demand. The presumption in what both of you have said is
that within a given budget you can get much more well-being, and that
is why you want to move there. Is the reluctance to move towards
creating more well-being due to Departments seeing the existing rules
as enabling them to live within their
budgets?</div><a name="09021060000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> I think that that is entirely true. There is
a school of thought that feels that going down this route will unlock
everything and then there will be no limit to what people will want. I
think that that is a naïve and hugely mistaken view. The
evidence is that, when you co-ordinate funding streams with an element
of each relevant funding stream, you get more than the sum of the
parts.</div>
<a name="09021060000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the case
of adult social care, there is something called a resource allocation
system, which calculates the amount of money available to the
individual according need, on a points-based system. It is very
straightforward. It sounds remarkably simple, but it is something we
have essentially not done since 1945 until about 2000. The previous
system was like many other systems, in that need was assessed but no
resource was set against that need, while some mechanism went on in the
background that ultimately resulted in somebody receiving a
service.</div>
<a name="09021060000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
important, because a transparent resource allocation system that is
able to integrate the different funding streams at whatever level and
according to need deals with a lot of those objections, because the
budget is the budget&#151;it is finite. I am no different from any
other local authority service director, in that my budget is limited
too, and I have to live within that budget. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>However, there is a better mechanism in this arrangement for dealing
with that conundrum. When there is a properly integrated, transparent
system for allocating the money&#151;and it is resource-limited,
because that is the amount of money you have got to spend and you have
to make the best of it&#151;it brings together much more than one
budget alone. To me, that is the means of dealing with what we deal
with now, which are resource-limited capped budgets, and of making
better use of the money than we do at present. I am not sure if that
answers your
question.</div>
<a name="09021060000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><a name="09021060000307"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): My question is about how we
deal with the fact that, as you said, every individual is different; if
I understood you correctly, something like 50 per cent. of your folk
prefer not to take control of the resources, 25 per cent. take full
control and 25 per cent. are somewhere in between.</div>
<a name="09021060000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> That is our experience in
Oldham.</div>
<a name="09021060000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
18</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000308"></a>John
Mason:</b> Is that an ideal position or is the ideal to move
to 100 per cent. control? What do you foresee? I assume that for some
people choice is quite stressful and they do not want it. There is also
the thing about the individual against the community. The example was
of driving lessons against a day centre, and for some people getting
the driving lessons would be right, but others might want the driving
lessons, yet be better off in a day centre. Is that the case?</div>
<a name="09021060000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> That is a good question. I do not have an
optimal position on the number of people we should end up with who
choose to take the money and control their own services&#151;if it is
100 per cent. then it is 100 per cent. The trick is demand management,
which is perfectly possible. There is sufficient experience around now
to judge who would prefer a more traditional service, such as a day
centre; many elderly people in my area still choose that, but others
prefer to take the money and do something different. If the experience
is applied properly, it is sufficient to judge how the money works
itself out and to ensure that one allocates the money and carries out
the calculation accordingly.</div>
<a name="09021060000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">You are right
that choice is stressful for some people, which is why
&#147;choice&#148; is the operative word. People are able to say,
&#147;Thank you very much, but I do not want to deal with that. I
will tell you what my wishes are but please can you deal with
it?&#148; and we happily do that. One live example is that very early
on in Oldham, somebody, who I think was taking the mickey, asked me
whether people with substance misuse problems could have an
individualised budget. The answer was yes, in principle, and, sure
enough, eight weeks later somebody with a substance misuse problem came
along and started managing her own money. She did that very well until
her ex-partner came back on the scene and she said, &#147;If my
partner knows that I have money, he will make me spend it on drugs.
Will you take control of the money and administer it on my behalf
according to my wishes?&#148; We did that.</div>
<a name="09021060000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the stress
and challenge issue, looking at mental health services across the
country, it is no secret that they have&#151;I would not say
connived&#151;co-operated in a system that is aimed at keeping people
unwell, with no sense of &#147;well-being,&#148; which is a very
important word. There is no expectation that people will come through
their illness, to a greater or lesser extent, and find 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>themselves back in employment and living the same lives as the rest of
us enjoy, as far as they are able. It seems to me that a system that
does not take a view that we should be ensuring that everybody can
maximise their potential does not work for
folks.</div><a name="09021060000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the physical delivery, everyone that I deal with needs support, by
definition; the question is how much. That is what we are arguing over
and what we need to put in to ensure that they can maximise their
potential. These are the key elements. First, there is a need for
traditional supply. Even in Oldham we have some traditional supply that
some people choose, but it is more limited than it was and the services
are completely different in complexion and character from those that we
had four years ago. Secondly, as much as anything else it is about a
will to win&#151;a will to deliver and succeed and about putting that
person at the centre to ensure that they are able to maximise their
potential. I keep banging on about more direction rather than
permissiveness because I think that a permissive arrangement for the
agencies involved does not, on present evidence, seem to be delivering
that aspiration in the way that I would like it to be
delivered.</div><a name="09021060000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Liz
Sayce:</b></i> On the question whether it might be better for
some people to be in a day centre, I do not think we can be confident
that the one-size-fits-all supply models have been effective, either in
terms of people&#146;s satisfaction and quality of life, or in terms
of other outcomes, such as the likelihood of people moving towards
employment. On the latter, the evidence is variable, but there is no
real evidence that attending a day centre or a sheltered workshop will
help you on the path back to employment. It is often the reverse,
actually&#151;you get stuck there. Similarly, for the person who
chose to go fishing rather than to a day centre, that was about
preserving the activities that mattered to him with the people that
mattered to him, given that he had developed dementia.</div>
<a name="09021060000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
agree that there is a role for traditional supply, I think it unlikely
that it will be better for people. The evidence shows that, in terms of
what enables people to get back into work, motivation is a key thing,
so if you pursue something that really interests you, rather than going
to a day centre and having whatever happens to be on offer, you are
more likely to be motivated and encouraged. It is not rocket science
that you are more likely to succeed in a job that you want to do, or
that you are more likely to get a qualification for something in which
you are interested. The evidence tends towards the suggestion that
personalisation will deliver better outcomes, and that we do not need
to be too worried about people choosing things that might not be as
good for them as what went
before.</div><a name="09021060000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000309"></a>John
Mason:</b> I take your point that personalisation is generally
better, but clearly some people will make the wrong decisions at times.
On the example of substance abuse, it is tremendous that somebody
actually recognised that there would be a problem if they had cash. I
suspect that other people would not have recognised that. Are you
therefore saying that people should not be proactive, or would you just
allow them to make
mistakes?</div><a name="09021060000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> All this comes into the
issue of risk and whether we are able to proactively manage the risk
associated with particular individuals, their own view of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>choice and control, and what it is they want to deliver, as well as the
risks to public money, safety and so on. There is in existence a
perfectly well developed risk enabling tool that enables agencies to
work with individuals&#151;it is not a big, bureaucratic
process&#151;to assess what the risks are and what the outcomes will
be for them, because as I said earlier, in adult social care it is
conditional on delivering the outcomes. It is not a gift in that sense;
there are outcomes to be
had.</div><a name="09021060000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Oldham, for example, we have a risk enablement panel. The panel has
that title because its purpose is to enable risk rather than to avoid
it in a bureaucratic sense. The panel ensures that the individual can
have a discussion with the agency about the levels of risk, how the
money is managed and how that is tied to their outcomes. As my
colleague rightly said, if the outcome as far as an agency is concerned
is that somebody should sit in a day centre, as has been the case,
smoking their head off for the next 20 years, I am afraid that is not
much of an outcome.</div>
<a name="09021060000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">But if I may
take the Oldham example again&#151;it is the one with which I am most
familiar&#151;the risk enablement panel meets on a regular, if ad
hoc, basis to discuss issues of risk that emerge from particular cases.
The panel has three options: it can refuse the risk because it cannot
live with it, it can agree the risk and state that it is absolutely
fine, or it can agree the risk with certain changes. To my knowledge,
in over 2,000-odd people, I think we have only ever refused about two
plans. The individual&#151;their carer or supporter can also be
there&#151;is part of a conversation with professionals on what that
risk means to them, how it is managed and how they deliver the outcomes
and aspiration in the conditional offer of money from the local
authority. That is a way of developing the self-efficacy argument about
people being part of taking control of their own lives as far as they
are able and encouraged to do so. Having seen the alternative,
particularly in the field of mental health services and vulnerable
adults, which is statutory organisations trying to take a view on what
is best for folks, we have ended up with an awful lot of people on
incapacity benefit and not a lot of movement on
that.</div>
<a name="09021060000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000310"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I have two linked questions for both of you.
First, the Government&#146;s analysis states that the right to
control for these funding streams will be tested in a small number of
authorities from 2010. It seems from what both of you were saying that
the right to control individual budget process has been well tested in
adult social care. You know what works in your authority and there are
examples from across the country of what works. Does the Department
need to pilot this stuff or should it be braver about trying to move
faster?</div>
<a name="09021060000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The linked
part of the question is this: clearly the Department and the Government
will be nervous about going fast and having things not work, but there
is a cost on the other side of going too slowly. If you get better
outcomes for the people themselves and you spend public money better,
particularly in the current climate where that money is very limited,
there seems to be an incredible cost in going slowly: you are forcing
people to get worse outcomes and you are spending public money more
inefficiently. Given that the Bill gives the Secretary of State quite
wide-ranging powers to make regulations, should he be brave and make
regulations that apply to everyone straight away? Then authorities that
want to go faster can, and we can put 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>pressure on. Or should the Department do what it plans to
do&#151;pilot this in a few authorities, potentially for up to three
years? So another three years will pass before we see a great deal of
progress.</div><a name="09021060000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Liz
Sayce:</b></i> Clearly it is very important that evaluation
and learning take place throughout the implementation. In that sense
the trailblazer notion makes sense. There will be learning as this
develops about what works in putting these different funding streams
together. We need to understand the outcomes. We need to understand the
cost-effectiveness and so on. It is important that there should be an
evaluative element. There is a question about pace and cost. One of the
issues that has been raised with us is that it can be more costly to
double-run different systems within a local authority or another public
body. There is a risk that, out of a concern for affordability, we
create an additional cost through the double running of different
systems rather than moving as quickly as possible to the system that we
want and learning as we go.</div>
<a name="09021060000229"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Disabled
people want to ensure that the resources available are spent on choice
and control and in the most effective way possible. It would be worth
considering whether there is another option, such as making it clear
that developments have to happen within a constrained budget. It is not
about implementing programmes that will not be cost-effective, but
without the in-built delay from the piloting. Pace will be important
and we will look for pace. So yes, there are some questions about
it.</div><a name="09021060000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> I can well understand why people would want
to feel the comfort of a pilot and see how that worked; I just do not
agree with it. There is more than sufficient evidence to justify going
straight ahead.</div>
<a name="09021060000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had a wry
smile when I saw that there was provision for an exit strategy. If I
were to go back to any of the people in Oldham who have an
individualised budget and tell them that there was an exit strategy and
that I would take it off them and put them back into the old system, I
probably would not survive very long. There is very strong evidence
that once people get control over their own services and choices, they
value it incredibly and it makes a big difference to them.
Secondly&#151;this is significant in the context of public
services&#151;even where the outcomes are not quite as good as they
thought they might be in the beginning, the sheer fact of having choice
and control makes a big difference and increases enormously the level
of what in another context is described as customer
satisfaction.</div>
<a name="09021060000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will be
strong about this. If the intention is to give control to some of those
people whose lives are currently being wasted because the system is not
supporting them to get back into employment and they are not playing
their full part as citizens and doing all the other things they need to
do, the period that is being suggested is far too long. We need to make
a start on this today. We have the experience and the background
knowledge. There is no reason why there could not be some
conditionality, as was implied, in terms of budgets and so on. I see no
problem with that at all because that is not an unreasonable thing to
say. It seems that the vision is fantastic but the route being
suggested to deliver will not be fit for purpose, for the simple reason
I have already suggested.</div>
<a name="09021060000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come back
to direct payments legislation. It was perfectly possible for a local
authority to run two competing systems, a direct payment system and a
traditionally 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>delivered system in adult social care, as long as the authority had the
money to do so. When the spare money came to an end, people either
could not continue to make those choices or had to wait a year until
the money became available, because the existing money was already tied
up in a system that was not delivering what was required. For some
people it was delivering what was required; I am not knocking all
traditional services and I would never say that the system is broken in
that sense.</div>
<a name="09021060000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the money
is tied up in delivering one set of arrangements it stands to reason
that you cannot then just unpick small parts of it on a piecemeal basis
and take it away and do something different. There is a massive
opportunity cost as well as a financial cost in running two different
systems. Oldham mainstreamed its processes very early on, simply
because it is impossible to get away from the logic of having to extend
the system across all services. A pilot, and possibly a subsequent
pilot, is being suggested. I hope everything I have said makes it clear
that I do not think that fits the
bill.</div><a name="09021060000121"></a>

21</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000311"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> In Oldham, Paul, you have been lucky to have the
co-operation of the primary care trust so you have a firm measure of
control over community services and adult social services. That is not
included in the regulations in this Bill. I am thinking of an example
of a young man who went to university; we had to get everyone together
on a Friday afternoon. The council had agreed its money; the university
had agreed what it was going to do. The PCT was reluctant to finance
the support that young man needed. Will people be able to get the
lifestyle changes that they want without adult and community care
control as well?</div>
<a name="09021060000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> I would say two things. The first is not as
flippant as it sounds&#151;the harder we work, the luckier we get.
Secondly, in terms of the duty to co-operate between the organisations,
you are describing a situation that I am familiar with from across the
country. It is probably the thing I get the most phone calls
about&#151;people asking whether there is a better way to do it. It
is a fine example of not being able to join the whole system together
around that individual.</div>
<a name="09021060000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another stream of work to be done about the duty for other bodies to
co-operate, not just in employment. It is back to the vision and
everyone playing their part in that. As the regulations stand, it is
perfectly possible that someone could be receiving an individualised
social care budget and, as their health deteriorated, move into a
continuing health care arrangement but then find that they had lost all
choice and control in that arrangement because the funding was coming
through a health stream. There is good work going on in the health
stream, looking at integration, but that is only in the health
stream.</div><a name="09021060000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000312"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Should a duty to co-operate be included in the
Bill?</div><a name="09021060000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> I would say so;
yes.</div><a name="09021060000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000313"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We seem to have exhausted our questioning, so
before we thank you, do either of you have any final thoughts that you
wish to leave these parliamentarians with, to have in the back of their
mind as they go on to consider the Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div><a name="09021060000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Liz
Sayce:</b></i> Access to Work is a very successful programme
and brings back about &#163;1.70 for every &#163;1 spent on it. The
recent announcement that the budget for Access to Work is to be
increased is very welcome, but the programme has not delivered
equitably for all disabled people. In particular, it has not worked so
well for people with a fluctuating condition or a mental health
condition. There is a real imperative to use that additional resource,
ideally to make the support into work an entitlement. The support
should be on offer as part of the quid pro quo: you will take
responsibility for taking up employment, if you are able to, and the
Access to Work support should be there, and more equitably so. In the
White Paper there were welcome references to improving these services
for people with fluctuating conditions, including mental health
conditions. It is a very cost-effective programme and the more that can
be done to make it available to everybody who really requires it, on an
equitable basis and almost as of right, the
better.</div><a name="09021060000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Davies:</b></i> I have a couple of things to say. My first
point echoes that last point. Our experience in adult social care with
people with fluctuating conditions is that everybody is assessed as
though they were on their worst day&#151;that is the way things work.
Everyone is not always on their worst day, but they are assessed as if
they were. There is not then the flexibility to deal with changes in
the condition, to be able to roll forward money or take money from a
forthcoming arrangement. That is very much a self-service model, and
one that works for people and reinforces the choice and control. It is
also a more efficient model, as any self-service catering arrangement
demonstrates. So I think there is room for making all this work in a
way that reinforces what I will say next.</div>
<a name="09021060000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
absolutely nobody&#146;s fault, we have socially excluded lots of
people in this country over the years, as much because of systems as
anything else, and this is a fantastic opportunity to link up the
various systems and ensure that they all play their part in delivering
the vision for the individual, which I know is shared around this room.
It is the right moment to do it. If we do not do the things that I and
my colleague have spoken about, we will end up with a lot of people who
never get to maximise their full potential.</div>
<a name="09021060000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">My experience
in Oldham&#151;this is also the experience elsewhere in the
country&#151;is that everybody has something to contribute, and
enabling them to contribute brings to fruition all the things that we
all want. If we insist on keeping people at home and on benefits, we
are losing a marvellous opportunity to get people to play their full
part in our
society.</div><a name="09021060000131"></a>

have been with the charity for nearly five years. Prior to that, I was
the director of the Child Poverty  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>Action Group, so I find it interesting that we have the benefits side
and the drugs side coming together on this
issue.</div><a name="09021060000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.

at DrugScope. I have had two stints at DrugScope, between which I was
head of the policy and parliamentary unit at Mind, the mental health

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000316"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before colleagues ask questions, I invite you
both to make a statement reflecting on the Bill. It does not matter how
long you
take.</div><a name="09021060000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> Going back to the publication of the new
drugs strategy last February and its commitment to improve drug
treatment effectiveness and the outcomes for problem drug users, we
welcome what is very much a new and positive emphasis on the importance
of reintegrating people who are in or completing treatment. Linking the
drugs strategy with the Government&#146;s wider agenda of tackling
worklessness, social exclusion and poverty was a welcome development.
With regard to the Bill, clearly we strongly support the commitment to
provide more support for problem drug users, particularly those in
treatment.</div>
<a name="09021060000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">DrugScope is
a membership body for people who work in the drugs field or similar
professions and basically share a common goal to minimise drug-related
harms. We consulted extensively on the Bill&#146;s proposals, as they
appeared in the Green Paper in the summer, and there was universal
welcome for the commitment to help problem drug users to reintegrate
themselves and to provide more support through the benefits system for
them to engage with training and employment.</div>
<a name="09021060000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there was considerable concern about the conditionality that linked the
requirement to undergo treatment with the benefits system, and some of
the initial proposals intended to enable the Department for Work and
Pensions to identify problem drug users. There were considerable
concerns about some of the initial proposals set out in the Green
Paper, some of which have now been abandoned, particularly the proposal
that it would be a condition of benefit to declare whether you were a
crack cocaine or heroine user. We are pleased that that has not
progressed.</div>
<a name="09021060000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
fair to say, however, that many of our concerns remain, and those come
from members who work with problem drug users day in, day out. Some of
our members who deal with the more challenging and marginally socially
excluded members of our community were concerned about the various
proposals on identification, the sanctions requirements, and the idea
that they would have to undergoing drug treatment at the risk of
benefit
sanctions.</div><a name="09021060000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Roberts:</b></i> I do not have much to add to that, but would
like to underscore a couple of points. The commitment to get more
problem drug users into work and help them along the path to employment
is really welcome, but it is important to be realistic about the
barriers that prevent many such people getting into employment. The
range of barriers includes problems with skills and experience of work,
problems with CV gaps and poor employment histories and problems with
employers&#146; attitudes&#151;that can be described as stigma, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>but it is more generally about employers having anxieties about working
with that group. That is why some of the material in the Gregg review,
about recognising that there are people in the benefits system who
should not simply be abandoned and written off, but are none the less
quite a long way from a place where they could step into mainstream
employment, is important. The issues about how we support that group
are really important, but also quite thorny and tricky and need some
thought.</div>
<a name="09021060000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not only do
we have problems with the impact of the sanctions regimes, but it is
also quite likely that a system that was better at encouraging people
to voluntarily disclose drug problems, which included a promise that,
if they did, they would get proper support, encouragement and help,
could more effectively identify people and bring them forward in ways
that engage them more productively with treatment services than the
stick of sanctions. On that point, the Government&#146;s voluntary
progress2work programme, which I think has been running since 2001, is
linked to jobcentres and helps problem drug users to get into training
and work and provides assistance on issues such as housing and debt. We
would like to see that work being built on, and would have liked to see
more evaluation and thought about the effectiveness of that approach
being fed into the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09021060000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000317"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> In the last session, we heard about the importance
of organisations working together to look at the range of issues for
people who are considering getting back to work or getting into work
for the first time. I assume that we would say exactly the same things
about drug users: it is not about one part of their life, but about the
whole range&#151;it is about accessing treatment, accommodation
issues, other health issues and Access to Work. Are you saying that
there are things in the legislation as drafted that would prevent that?
Are there things that we should be more directive on, as Mr.
Davies said in the last session? There are sanctions, which seem to be
the right thing at some point, but are there other ways in which the
Bill could be improved to deliver the services to assist
people?</div>
<a name="09021060000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> The measures in the Bill specific to problem
drug users, clause 9 and a new schedule, do not articulate what the
positive support for problem drug users will actually be. The proposed
legislation talks about things such as the identification requirement;
the requirement to attend an interview; referrals for a substance
misuse assessment; information sharing with the police, the probation
service and others; the fact that a rehabilitation programme can be
imposed on a claimant; and the fact that somebody can be directed to
attend a specific place or institution for treatment. The Bill does not
articulate what Ministers have described as the vision and aspiration
to provide more support for problem drug users. That is the part of the
Green Paper and the drug strategy that we welcomed and support, hence
our concern about the Bill as it currently stands. There are other
elements of the Bill that give the Secretary of State powers to provide
additional financial support for certain people, such as those on
jobseeker&#146;s allowance. We do not have any similar provisions
specific to problem drug
users.</div><a name="09021060000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are already some fairly positive developments under way. You are
probably aware that the Department of Health is funding what are called
drug co-ordinator posts. Every jobcentre district in England will have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>dedicated staff who will work with local partners to encourage better
understanding and good practice in the DWP and will very much become an
additional resource in terms of building local partnership and
planning. The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse recently
published new guidance to encourage and support better commissioning
practice on supporting problem drug users on to the various pathways to
access training and employment. But that is quite top-level; the
difficulty is getting the partnerships and planning happening on the
ground, and inevitably, that often comes back to the question of
resources.</div><a name="09021060000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the aim of the Bill is delivered in terms of identifying more problem
drug users through the benefit system and trying to get them into
treatment, that will clearly put additional capacity pressures on the
drug treatment system. Although we have seen significant increases in
investment in drug treatment, which has been very positive and
cost-effective and is showing positive outcomes, the pool treatment
budget for the next three years is frozen in cash terms. Furthermore,
the spend per person on drug treatment has been falling, and although
efficiency savings&#151;as they are inevitably called&#151;can no
doubt be found, at a time when drugs services and their partners are
rightly expected to do more for problem drug users by helping them into
housing, training and employment, the resources available to do so are
actually falling in real terms in many
areas.</div><a name="09021060000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Roberts:</b></i> May I just make three very quick points on
why the Bill might not help in accessing some of that other
support?</div>
<a name="09021060000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, a lot
of the Bill is about getting people to disclose problem drug use,
because if they disclose that they have a drug problem they can be
helped and supported. I think it is important to contextualise that,
because people&#146;s experience will be that disclosing drug
problems is a consistent barrier to their accessing support, whether it
relates to housing or employment. It is important to be aware of the
reasons why people might be reluctant to
disclose.</div><a name="09021060000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
and more directly, I think that one impact of benefit sanctions could
be damaging to some of the recovery capital that people rely on in a
very direct way. For example, we recently held a seminar to discuss
such issues with Adfam, a charity that works with the families and
carers who work with drug users. Its concern was that, where benefit
sanctions are applied, families, parents and so on will quite often
pick up the financial slack. That could damage the supportive family
environments that can help people get their life back on
track.</div>
<a name="09021060000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last point
is a more general one about the political discourse. If you have a
political discourse that portrays drug users on benefits as people
whose primary problem is that they are not sufficiently motivated and
may need to be sanctioned into actively seeking work and help, that
creates a picture in the eyes of employers and others who might provide
things like housing that does not speak positively of this
group.</div><a name="09021060000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
27</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000318"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> I am sorry; are you saying that people currently
have a very positive image of drug users and that the Bill will make it
worse?</div><a name="09021060000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Roberts:</b></i> No; I am not. I am saying that people
currently have quite a negative perception of drug users, and that that
in itself is a substantial barrier to their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>accessing things such as work and housing. If we are serious about
getting that group socially included and into work and support, part of
what we need to do is to help remove some of those perceptions, or work
with people in ways that support them to engage more positively with
that
group.</div><a name="09021060000152"></a>

28</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000319"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> I am not quarrelling with you about that general
aim, which is clearly the aim of the legislation. I am saying that I do
not see that the sanction conflicts with that. The sanction is a
mechanism for encouraging motivation and allowing people to access
support and move forward, rather than something that centres on how a
drug user may or may not be seen more
widely.</div><a name="09021060000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> There has been a concern about the proposals
to link benefit entitlement with the requirement to undertake
treatment. Our understanding is that it was inserted into the drug
strategy document quite late on. I remember having a conversation with
an official at the Home Office and getting an off-the-record briefing
on what was likely to be in the document. When I was told that it would
include a proposal to reform the benefit system to introduce that form
of conditionality, I remember saying to the official, &#147;You do
realise what will dominate the press coverage on this?&#148; The
official responded by saying, &#147;No, there is lots of other stuff
in here; it is about positive investment in drug treatment.&#148; On
the day that the strategy was published, however, most of the coverage
given to the new strategy was on precisely this proposal, with
headlines such as, &#147;benefit addicts to lose benefits,&#148;
which created and reinforced the idea of being &#147;tough&#148; on
what is&#151;yes&#151;an extremely unpopular and often very
stigmatised and stereotyped group.</div>
<a name="09021060000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
when the Green Paper was published, we were informed that there had
been a lot of effort, by some Government Departments who had a stake in
this agenda, to ensure that the press were not directed towards those
measures specific to problem drug users. While I take the point that
there are quite specific and precise issues about how the sanctions
may, or may not, motivate problem drug users, the Bill and these
proposals also need to be seen on a wider canvas. Unfortunately, there
is a concern that the driver for the proposals is partly either that it
plays well to certain sections of the media gallery, or that it could
act as a lightning-rod to focus attention on this particular unpopular
group, rather than other aspects of the Bill. That is a legitimate
concern that we have had, reinforced by the way that&#151;as we
understand it&#151;this issue has been played to the media by the
Government. It also is a concern among many of our members who can,
first-hand, confirm how stigma and stereotyping can be a genuine
barrier to people in drug treatment accessing basic support and
services, whether it is housing, training or the reluctant attitude of
employers.</div><a name="09021060000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000320"></a>Meg

any sanctions in relation to benefits for drug
users?</div><a name="09021060000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin

are already as potentially likely to be sanctioned as other claimants
for JSA. For example, from April&#151;</div>

that there should not, ever, be sanctions in relation to drug
users.</div><a name="09021060000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> To be more precise, I do not think that the
evidence is there and it is not just our view, but also that of the UK
Drug Policy Commission, which has recently done a lot of research,
exploring the barriers for problem drug users trying to access training
and employment. The evidence is not there to show that the use of
sanctions and compulsion, in terms of the requirement to undergo
treatment, will actually be
effective.</div><a name="09021060000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

no?</div><a name="09021060000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin

require people to declare their problem drug use and whether they are
receiving treatment&#151;I could explain in more detail our concerns
about that particular proposal&#151;the requirement to undergo a
substance misuse assessment and the requirement to undergo drug
treatment as a condition of receiving benefit, as it is currently
framed in the legislation.</div>

32</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000323"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> We are not clear about whether you have answered to
the question. My question is whether there are any circumstances in
which drug users should be sanctioned, in terms of their
benefits.</div><a name="09021060000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> As I said, a problem drug user can currently
be sanctioned for a number of reasons within the benefit system. The
question you are posing is not one I can give a yes or no answer to,
because unless you are precise in where that sanction might
apply&#151;</div><a name="09021060000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000324"></a>Meg

where it might be appropriate to
sanction?</div><a name="09021060000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> Yes, because currently if a problem drug user
is not fulfilling the actively seeking work requirement of the JSA, or
attending interviews when required to do so, they can be
sanctioned&#151;as can any other JSA claimant. Problem drug users are
not being dealt with as some exceptional group within the benefit
system at the moment. The difficulty is that they are often invisible
within the benefit system and do not get the help and support they
require. That is why we support that commitment to provide better
support for problem drug users. We have serious concerns about the
proposals in the
Bill.</div><a name="09021060000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000325"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> That was helpful clarification. First, by way of
preamble, one of you mentioned progress2work. I visited the service
that is delivered by Turning Point in Cardiff. I talked to some of the
staff and clients. I got some flavour of the complexity of getting them
either into work or back into work. I support what you said on
that.</div>
<a name="09021060000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following up
on the point made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley, if someone
is on out-of-work benefits because of their drug or alcohol problem,
why should they not have to seek some treatment for that problem if it
is the barrier to their getting into work? Certainly those looking from
outside, those who work and pay taxes, cannot see why someone whose
problem relates to their drug or alcohol abuse should continue to get
taxpayers&#146; money if they are not willing to take some steps to
sort that problem out. Why should they not be required to sort it out?
I will ask you in a moment about the extent to which that treatment is
available and the capacity. But in terms of the principle, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>is your objection to compulsion and threatening to withhold benefits if
they do not undergo treatment philosophical or practical? Is your view
on that driven by what you think the practical outcomes will be, or do
you think it is wrong in
principle?</div><a name="09021060000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> I think it is primarily on the practical
issues, but there is also a wider concern. I have had conversations
with the chief executive of a leading mental health charity, who has
concerns about these proposals because of the potential for them to be
extended to other groups. Why not, for example, require a person whose
main barrier to work is perceived by the DWP as being a mental health
problem to undergo appropriate treatment to reduce or sort out that
mental health problem if that is indeed the main barrier to work? That
is a genuine concern expressed to me by a chief executive of a mental
health
charity.</div><a name="09021060000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
main route to drug treatment tends to be voluntary. We have seen a
significant expansion through the criminal justice system and the drug
intervention programme to try to get people who have tested positive
for a class A drug into treatment. Indeed, we supported that. The Bill
is taking that much further. For the first time the state will require
someone not just to engage with an adviser and have an assessment for
drug treatment, but to undertake drug treatment as a condition of
getting benefit. At present, that type of requirement can only be
imposed under conditional bail requirements. A person can be required
as a condition of bail to attend for drug treatment or, if they have
been charged, sentenced and convicted, the sentence could include a
requirement to undergo some form of drug treatment. The context of that
is quite different from what is proposed in the Bill: to require
somebody to undergo drug treatment as a condition of getting their
benefit.</div>
<a name="09021060000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am told by
the NTA that 80 per cent. of drug services are delivered by the NHS or
by third parties it has contracted to deliver. The NHS constitution
says that you have a right to accept or refuse treatment that is
offered to you and not to be given any physical examination or
treatment unless you have given valid consent. I suggest that such
consent can only be valid and only truly consensual where it is not
made in the context of otherwise possibly losing benefit, with all the
consequences of
that.</div><a name="09021060000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
NHS constitution also says that you have the right to
privacy and confidentiality and to expect the NHS to keep your
confidential information safe and secure. I suggest that that is not
compatible with the requirement in the Bill to answer questions either
about your drug use or about whether you are in drug treatment. The
constitution also says that you have the right to be involved in
discussions and decisions about your health care. I suggest that that
is not compatible with the power of the Secretary of State to impose,
as set out in the Bill, a requirement to comply with a rehabilitation
plan and to be directed to a place or institution that provides drug
treatment. As the Bill is worded, that direction can mean that somebody
is required, for example, to be a resident in a place that provides
residential rehab. That will or may specify not just that somebody has
to undergo drug treatment, but potentially the form of that treatment
as well. How can that be compatible with what the Government reasonably
have set out for every patient in the NHS
constitution?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000326"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Dr. Roberts, do you want to add
anything?</div><a name="09021060000230"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Roberts:</b></i> The point is one of effectiveness rather
than principles. There are both sorts of points. People will be
identified and pushed forward through the investigative process set out
in the Bill, which might include their initially being interviewed, and
at some point having to submit to a drugs test, and the police perhaps
being requested to provide information about them. Is someone emerging
from that process likely to form a productive and constructive
therapeutic relationship with the treatment service? Developing a
system that is more effective in incentivising voluntary disclosure has
more potential to engage more people in effective therapeutic
relationships that will address their drug problems and help them back
into work. I think that does speak to the issue about sanctioning,
because anything that offers a positive incentive inherently has a
stick attached to it. People who do not go down that route do not get
the benefits associated with it, which might for example include, under
the treatment allowance proposals, their not being required to abide by
the normal job-seeking requirements for a period of time, to give them
some space and time to focus on getting their drug problem under
control. That, for me, is a carrot that can pull people into a
voluntary form of disclosure and get them involved, which is likely to
be more effective than a stick, although neither of those mechanisms
will identify everyone who could
benefit.</div><a name="09021060000172"></a>

36</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000327"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b><b class="B"> </b>Given that you focus on the practical, what
would your response be to the man in the street who does not think it
right that he has to go to work and pay taxes to fund
benefits for someone whose primary reason for not going to work is a
drug problem and who is not willing to do something about it, when the
man in the street can see that continuing for year upon
year? How do we, as politicians, say to that person,
&#147;That is
okay&#148;?</div><a name="09021060000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> I can understand the issue that you have
outlined. The difficulty is the way that the DWP is attempting to
address that in the Bill; that is where our concern lies. There are a
number of ways in which people can be required to access drug
treatment, as I have mentioned, not least through the drug intervention
programme. If you have somebody in that situation who is not willing to
engage with drug treatment, it is first important to understand why.
Some people have had quite bad experiences of the treatment system and
that might well be echoing around now, informing their perception of
the support and help that is available. It is also important to
understand the problems, barriers and difficulty that many problem drug
users face. Addaction, for example, consulted many of its service users
who are parents, and they expressed the concern that their children
would be taken away if they declared their problem drug use. Some drug
services are simply not sufficiently geared to supporting younger
people, women or some people from black and minority ethnic groups, for
example. So, it is not as straightforward as somebody just being
reluctant to undergo drug treatment. There might be reasons why that
person is in that space at that time, but has the DWP tried the
supportive, voluntary approach? We do not have evidence of that unless
it is particular schemes such as progress2work, which has been shown to
be incredibly effective as a voluntary programme for getting problem
drug users into training and support.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div><a name="09021060000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
question is whether treatment will be successful if the person
is of the mindset that they do not want to engage with drug treatment.
If the motivation and the support structure are not there, the
chances are that the person might well drop out of the
system or relapse at an early stage. Part of the
difficulty with the Bill and these proposals is perhaps a
lack of understanding and appreciation of the
sheer complexities, not only of supporting problem drug users
but of how nuanced, sophisticated and varied drug treatments sometimes
need to be to achieve the desirable outcomes.</div>
<a name="09021060000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming back
to asking the man in the street, when the Government consulted on the
drugs strategy I got no sense that people were banging on the door to
say that they were concerned about the number of problem drug users on
benefits. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> You might laugh, but that
did not come through in the consultation. Can I come back to the point
of why you laugh? Probably because you pick up the attitude to problem
drug users. Take yesterday&#146;s headline in <i class="I">The Daily
Telegraph</i>.</div><a name="09021060000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000328"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> Could we just be clear? I have estates in my
constituency which periodically suffer a great deal as a result of
people who have problem drug use. These are the people&#151;Mark
talks about the man or woman in the street&#151;who come up and ask
these questions. They are not the people who are going to respond to a
consultation, but I can assure you this is an issue that most Members
of Parliament will at times come across and people will raise it. To
suggest that people do not think this is a problem is wrong. We are not
raising this because we see it in the media; we are raising it because
we see it on the streets of our
constituencies.</div><a name="09021060000177"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> The issue you are highlighting is an entirely
right, fair and appropriate one and that is why it is right that the
Government are putting the investment into the drugs strategy and
particularly into drug treatment. We need to support, defend and make
the case for drug treatment because it has been attacked unfairly and
unreasonably in the media and some politicians have also unfairly and
unreasonably attacked the drug treatment system, claiming that it is
not effective and that it is a waste of money. The tangible benefits
are there and we know we can do more to improve them. That is a
commitment from the Government, from the NTA and from our members. It
is symptomatic of a wider issue because perceptions about drug use are
slightly on the increase.</div>
<a name="09021060000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government see this as a problem because, despite the rightful
investment in the drugs strategy and treatment, public perception of
the problem is going in the other direction. I am not saying at all
that people do not perceive problem drug use as something to be
tackled. The question&#151;and it is your role to ask it when you
come down to the specifics of the Bill&#151;is whether this is the
right way forward. The powers that are currently given to the Secretary
of State and the DWP to make that link between benefit claim and
attending treatment is what we have concerns about. We do not have any
concerns about trying to tackle the problem of drug use in this country
and particularly getting more people into treatment, better treatment
and aftercare.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000329"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Let me give you the opportunity to say something
about treatment and the capacity to deal with a large increase. The
reason people are concerned&#151;it was probably the genesis of the
story you were about to refer to&#151;is not out-of-work benefits but
disability living allowance. You have portrayed a background over the
last few years of increased drug treatment availability but over that
period there has been a fourfold increase in the number of people
claiming disability living allowance whose main reason for claiming has
been alcohol or drug addiction. If treatment is increasingly available
but there are more people claiming benefits as a result of their drug
addiction, there is clearly a problem getting people to access that
treatment. If we accept, for the sake of argument, that the Bill is
effective&#151;I know you do not think it will be, but let us
assume&#151;and there is a significant increase in the number of
people on out-of-work benefits or DLA wanting to access treatment, what
will they find? Is there sufficient capacity and treatment available
across the piece? When they put up their hand and say,
&#147;Actually, I&#146;d like to get my drug or alcohol problem
sorted out,&#148; will they find that there is no help
available?</div><a name="09021060000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> I will answer that, I promise, but first I
want to comment on the apparent increase in the number of problem drug
users claiming benefits. I do not think that we know why there has been
an apparent increase. On one level it feels counter-intuitive, because
drug use, overall, is falling and the number of problem drug users
accessing treatment has significantly expanded&#151;it has doubled
over the past five to six years. In part, it might be that because
people are engaging more with services, they are prepared to admit and
confront their problem drug use, but again I do not have evidence to
support that. You made the point that those numbers also include
problem alcohol users, so we need to unpick what proportion of that
increase in claimants are problem drug users, who are heroin and crack
cocaine users for the purposes of the Bill, and what proportion use
other substances.</div>
<a name="09021060000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000330"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The Bill tackles both. The powers in the Bill are
not only for illegal drug use; they are also for alcohol.</div>
<a name="09021060000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> That is right, but the initial intention is
to prioritise crack cocaine and heroin users. The other point in the
context of benefit claims is that a significant proportion of problem
drug users also have other problems, not least mental health problems.
The main reason for the benefit claim might be an identified drug
problem, but there could well be other reasons contributing to that
person&#146;s inability to work, not least mental health problems.
Some estimates suggest that up to 70 per cent. of people in drug
treatment also have some form of mental health
problem.</div><a name="09021060000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer your question about what a problem drug user would find, we have
seen waiting times significantly reduce. I think that there is now an
average wait across the country of three weeks, and there has been a
very significant increase in capacity in the treatment system, but it
is fair to say that it is variable. In some parts of the country,
retention rates and waiting times are particularly good and improving,
but in other parts of the country waiting times are longer and
retention rates are not quite as good, so variability is still an
issue.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div><a name="09021060000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the proposals go ahead, it is difficult to predict how much additional
capacity we would be talking about. The impact report suggests a very
upward figure of anything around 60,000 people a year, but that is on
the high side; it would effectively be a 40 per cent. increase in the
number of people accessing drug treatment. With current resources and
investment, and likely resources and investment over the next two to
three years, I cannot see how the system could cope if that number were
achieved, but as I said, I think that it is
unlikely.</div>
<a name="09021060000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000331"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> So you are saying that if the measures in the Bill
are enacted and are successful&#151;let us assume that they will be,
because that will be the Department&#146;s argument&#151;the
problem will be that, unless something changes, the treatment will not
be available for the people that you identify as problem drug users
mandated to access treatment, because of that significant increase in
demand?</div>
<a name="09021060000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> What may happen&#151;and it is worded this
way in the impact assessment, which addresses the question of
resourcing&#151;is that the Department of Health will achieve it
through &#147;reprioritisation&#148; within the system. That
increased capacity might be dealt with by the people who are referred
via this route jumping to the front of the queue. That is what I
understand by reprioritisation.</div>
<a name="09021060000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
41</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000332"></a>John
Mason:</b> I have a couple of points. The first concerns
children and child poverty. You have mentioned the possible effect on
families of a sanctions regime. One suggestion was that the wider
family could pick up the slack, which might suggest that the children
themselves just carry on. It is always a difficult decision with
children when one of the parents is a drug addict: do you leave them
with the family, at a certain amount of risk, or do you take them into
care? Have you done any work on the effect that that might have on
children? Would more children be taken into care?</div>
<a name="09021060000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> It is difficult to say, because we have not
done any particular work or research on that. If a family on a low
income have their benefit reduced, it is intuitive that that can have
significant and serious negative consequences. With regard to children
who live with parents or adults who are problem drug users, that is an
area that the Government have given a particular commitment to in the
drugs strategy. It is now six years since the Advisory Council on the
Misuse of Drugs published its report, &#147;Hidden Harm: Responding
to the Needs of Children of Problem Drug Users,&#148; which really
put the issue on the policy agenda. It estimated that about a third of
1 million children might be in that situation, and in many respects
they are vulnerable, and it is right that the Government have given the
issue a higher priority than it had before the drugs strategy was
published.</div>
<a name="09021060000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
cannot see how benefit sanctions, which remove benefits and reduce
income, can have anything but negative consequences for the well-being
of the family and the children. I understand that witnesses from the
Child Poverty Action Group are giving evidence to the Committee this
afternoon, and they will no doubt talk more widely about the potential
impact of sanctions on child poverty and the welfare of
families.</div><a name="09021060000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000333"></a>John
Mason:</b> You said earlier that many problem drug users have
underlying problems, which might relate to mental health or be much
more general. It seems to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>me that there is not much point in getting a person off drugs if you do
not deal with the underlying problem, because they will just go back to
drugs, alcohol or gambling. What is your experience of the time scales
for people working through some of those
problems?</div><a name="09021060000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> If someone has been a long-term heroin user,
the experience of our members suggests that getting that person,
ultimately, drug-free can take several treatment interventions and
could take six to seven years on average. There is no silver bullet for
long-term, problematic drug users. It is the case that many problem
drug users have other underlying problems, issues and needs, and they
can be the most complex of the complex groups. I have mentioned mental
health problems and poor physical health, and many of them will
probably have had difficult experiences in the past, perhaps in
childhood, which could have been significant contributing factors to
their problem drug use.</div>
<a name="09021060000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unemployment
and poor housing are also important to consider. Homeless Link, for
example, in its submission to the Green Paper, suggested that problem
drug users are seven times more likely to be homeless, and low
self-esteem and poor numeracy and literacy skills are also factors. In
2004 the National Audit Office published what was then really a
watershed report, which stated that the role of drug treatment was not
just to treat the substance, but also to deal with the wider needs of
the person. That report was very much the catalyst for taking forward
what is now more widely called the treatment effectiveness strategy. It
is not only about addressing the misuse of the substance, but about
looking at the wraparound aftercare support in order to achieve a
successful outcome in drug treatment. If those underlying issues are
not addressed, the chances are that you are keeping in place the
factors that could lead someone to relapse
later.</div><a name="09021060000193"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Roberts:</b></i> I agree with much of that. Another relevant
point is that under the Bill&#146;s provisions people will be
required to comply with treatment, and there is an issue about how you
address the fact that most people&#146;s journey out of a serious
drug problem will naturally involve periods of relapse. Underlying the
Bill there seems to be a view of treatment that sees it as a fairly
short-term and straightforward process, but the challenge is in how you
accommodate the rest of the structure to those long-term, complicated
treatment
journeys.</div><a name="09021060000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000334"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I have two questions. The first goes back to the
issue of resources. We are told that there are 240,000 addicts on
benefits. What proportion are currently getting treatment, and what
would be the additional cost, in your view, of getting everybody on a
course of treatment&#151;if all 240,000 were to be put through the
system?</div><a name="09021060000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> These estimates are, in turn, based on
estimates, so there is a question about how robust the figures are. The
estimate is that about 100,000 of the 240,000 are not currently engaged
with drug treatment services. According to NTA estimates, of the
problem drug-using population as a whole, around one third of a million
people are using heroin, crack or both. Some 60 to 70 per cent. of them
are engaged with drug treatment in some
form.</div><a name="09021060000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer your question about the likely cost, I must admit that I have
not done the calculation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div><a name="09021060000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000335"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> The Government have not either. That is why I am
asking the
question.</div><a name="09021060000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> Let us say that we try to get those 100,000
people into treatment. We could take a bold approach and try to get
them all in at the same time. Considering that, at the moment, 200,000
people a year access drug treatment in England, to increase the
capacity by another 100,000&#151;these are very much
back-of-the-envelope calculations&#151;I would suggest at least a 50
per cent. increase in drug treatment funding, and that is based on the
current level of provision. As I said earlier, the opportunity as well
as the challenge at the moment is to make treatment even better, to
make sure that people stay in longer and that we get people genuinely
completing the treatment journey, and to link up with issues of
housing, training, employment and
support.</div><a name="09021060000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
drug treatment system is doing a good job, but it is now trying to do
more with less money over the next couple of years. In real terms, the
full treatment budget will be frozen. Obviously other funding can come
in locally, and the spend per person in treatment has actually been
going down, largely because of the increase in capacity. A lot of work
is being done on the cost and effectiveness of treatment, and it is
starting to deliver, but to return to your point, getting 100,000
people into the treatment system simply could not be done on the
current level of resourcing if we want the outcomes that I think we
want. Obviously, 100,000 is a ballpark
figure.</div><a name="09021060000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000336"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> This is a slightly different question. There is a
group of drug addicts who are addicted to tranquilizers. Do you have an
estimate of the numbers who have been put on treatment through no fault
of their own? Again, what kind of support would be needed if this
regime were to be implemented for
them?</div><a name="09021060000201"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> The focus, as intended, is primarily around
heroin and crack cocaine users. Even those problem drug users could be
misusing other drugs as well, not least alcohol. Obviously, drug
treatment services try to engage with and respond to the issue of
polydrug use&#151;people misusing a range of different
drugs&#151;but that can be particularly difficult and
challenging.</div><a name="09021060000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know the answer to your question about the number of people who
are misusing or dependent on tranquilisers, and it might be quite
difficult to get evidence. The all-party group on drugs misuse recently
published a report about the misuse of prescription and
over-the-counter drugs, and one of the points that it made is that we
simply do not know enough about the extent of dependency on prescribed
drugs and medicines that have always had a legitimate use. What we do
know, particularly from the evidence that was given to the all-party
group&#146;s inquiry, is that people who have a problem with the
misuse of or dependency on such drugs often find it very
difficult to access treatment and
support.</div><a name="09021060000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
difficulty is that investment in drug treatment has been largely driven
by the link with crime, and the focus is still very much on heroin and
crack cocaine users. People, particularly adults, who have problems
with other drugs, not least alcohol, do not always access the help and
support that they need. There is often lack of support and provision
for stimulant users and those who misuse drugs such as amphetamines. A
drug that is not of particular concern at the moment, because,
thankfully, its use is still quite low level, is crystal meth. There is
an issue about the range of support that the existing capacity of
treatment services can provide.</div>

question was not asked in my
absence.</div><a name="09021060000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
you argued your case and raised doubts about the element of compulsion
and sanction in the Bill regarding drug users taking treatment, I was
struck by the fact that you essentially based it on speculation about
adverse outcomes, just as the Government and most of my constituents
probably base their case on speculation about users and benefits. Are
there any studies from countries such as Sweden that have used a more
coercive approach that suggest that there is a beneficial effect when
people are required to take treatment&#151;the element of requiring
people to take treatment is now built into the criminal justice system?
Clearly, as far as my constituents are concerned, if the system is
going to work, they have no compunction about requiring people to take
treatment.</div><a name="09021060000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> We do have some evidence in terms of an
evaluation of the impact of measures in the current drug intervention
programme. It is fair to say that there is not enough research, and in
some respects, particularly regarding the impact of drug testing on
arrest and the required assessment, evaluations on reducing reoffending
are not as positive as you would
expect.</div><a name="09021060000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposals in the drug intervention programme are that people may be
required to undergo drug treatment as a form of community sentence or
penalty. I think the evidence shows that outcomes can be at least as
good as those for people who have entered the treatment system
voluntarily. There is a difference with these proposals. I am not aware
of international evidence, although there might be some in the United
States, given its welfare structure, but is linking benefit
conditionality and the requirement to undergo treatment likely to be
effective?</div><a name="09021060000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
welcome Ministers&#146; commitment that this is about
support&#151;we think that the commitment is genuine&#151;but when
you come down to what is in the Bill and the actual powers that will be
given to the Secretary of State and the DWP, we and many of our members
have concerns. This comes back to what I said earlier and the new stuff
from the NHS constitution. At the end of the day, drug treatment should
be seen as therapeutic. The relationship between the person
in treatment and the key worker is more effective when there
is a genuine therapeutic relationship. Introducing compulsion,
coercion, information-revealing requirements, or undermining
confidentiality, at least as perceived by the problem drug user and
their key worker, suggests that you could undermine the therapeutic
relationship and, potentially, the effectiveness and outcome of that
drug
treatment.</div><a name="09021060000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
mentioned resources, and if we try to force people into drug treatment
through such an unproven route, there is a question of whether it will
be effective in terms of not just the outcome for individuals, but the
impact on treatment services, and the time, resources and energy that
the DWP will put in. Voluntary approaches, the evaluation so far, and
progress2work show that it is possible to engage people constructively,
not just in treatment, but in helping them into training and
employment.</div><a name="09021060000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to mention two other aspects on which a lot of research has
been done. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
recently published guidance saying that contingency management
approaches&#151;it is a horrible term, but it is what is
used&#151;where essentially you are trying to incentivise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>somebody to take part in drug treatment, can have tangible and positive
outcomes. That was reported in the media as given problem drug users
iPods, which was absolute nonsense; it is about acknowledging in some
way the progress that is being made. Research shows that people in
treatment or considering treatment respond effectively to voluntary
motivational triggers and
supporters.</div><a name="09021060000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other issue, just in case there is not time to deal with it at another
point, is that much as we support the commitment to help problem drug
users into training and employment, we also need to address the supply
side&#151;the reluctance of many employers to recruit and employ
problem drug users when the problem is known. We are concerned about
confidentiality in respect of these proposals and the way in which that
could have an impact on not just criminal proceedings and the
safeguards there, but, perhaps, the well-being of problem drug users in
other contexts or civil
proceedings.</div><a name="09021060000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Research
shows that some 60 per cent. of employers will not want to employ
somebody with a past history of problem drug or alcohol use, so giving
a commitment to this group could be a way to start tackling issues
involving stigma and barriers to employment, including the reluctance
of employers. Equally, if employers are being encouraged to employ
problem drug users, but perceive that a person is essentially motivated
by the stick rather than the carrot, will they be any more likely to
take them on knowing that they have a history of problem drug use? They
want to see somebody who has demonstrated that they are motivated and
committed to tackling the problem. The research shows that problem drug
users can end up as very good employees once they are given support and
such
opportunities.</div><a name="09021060000213"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><a name="09021060000338"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Baron</b> (Billericay) (Con): May I press you on
resources, Mr. Barnes&#151;you are in demand at the
moment? Although I accept that the estimates are not precise, if the
Bill becomes law, you could have up to 100,000 additional addicts
seeking treatment. We have discussed the limitation on resources. As
the resources are presently constituted, can you give us your best
guess&#151;I know this is a difficult question&#151;as to how many
extra addicts could be
treated?</div><a name="09021060000214"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> Oh, gosh. That is a very difficult question
to answer. Also, the situation varies, because some parts of the
country are being allocated additional resources within the pooled
treatment budget as an attempt to enable more people in the local area
to get into treatment. Some areas are seeing decreases in resources,
and projections for the next two to three years show that some areas
could see a reduction in pooled treatment funding of anything from 20
per cent. to 30 per cent. The issue of resources is therefore
increasingly localised. In terms of what the system currently can cope
with in respect of extra numbers, I could give you an opinion, but I
could not give you something concrete and say, &#147;That is hard and
fast.&#148;</div><a name="09021060000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021060000339"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> An opinion would be
welcome.</div><a name="09021060000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> In respect of where we are with the treatment
system, it was right initially to focus on increasing capacity,
catching up on years of underinvestment and getting the work force in
place. Now, since this is and should be about improving effectiveness,
the resource pressure will inevitably increase, because you are trying 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>to get people in treatment linking up to the housing and training
providers, to get better access to primary health care, and to get in
place the advocacy and support networks that would help people&#146;s
treatment and longer term outcomes. At the moment, the budget is being
frozen at a time while drug treatment providers&#151;many of our
members&#151;are trying to do more with fewer
resources.</div><a name="09021060000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
also an important issue in respect of supporting the work force. One of
our criticisms of the drug strategy is that there simply has not been
enough commitment, attention and resource put into ensuring that people
who work with problem drug users&#151;not just in specialised
environments, but in more generic services as well&#151;have the
knowledge, expertise and know-how to respond to the increasing
pressures and expectations on them. It is always easy for any charity
or group to say, &#147;We need more money.&#148; You hear that all
the time, but the world is not like that at the moment. There is
pressure on the treatment system to demonstrate effectiveness, but if
we are talking about significant increases in capacity, I do not
believe that the system can handle that and achieve the outcomes that
we want with the current resource
allocation.</div><a name="09021060000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000340"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> May I be a little unfair and return to my original
question? Can you give us your best guess? Are we talking about the
lower end&#151;10,000 or 20,000? Accepting everything you say, and
that these figures are not precise, I would just like an indication of
whether you think that we do not stand a chance at all, or whether, if
we all pull together, there would be some chance of getting at least
halfway.</div><a name="09021060000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> I might sound like I am trying to avoid your
question, but I am also thinking it through. The difficulty is that if
we are talking about 20,000 people, how will that work geographically?
Are there more people going into the system in some parts of the
country than in others? How does that match up with current treatment
provision? Also, what are the allocations likely to be over the next
two to three years? Flexibility is built into the allocations; they are
not cast in stone over the next two to three years. We are expecting
the treatment allocation for the next financial year to be announced
pretty soon&#151;it was due last
week.</div><a name="09021060000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
honest answer would be, given that the treatment system has achieved
its target to more than double the number of people accessing
treatment, that going beyond the 200,000 on average accessing every
year would be extremely difficult without additional resources. In some
parts of the country, there is undoubtedly additional capacity, but the
situation is far from
uniform.</div><a name="09021060000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
49</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000341"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> Let me press you a little bit more. Taking a
slightly longer term perspective, if budgets were frozen, would there
be any additional resources that could be brought in from other areas
to help with regard to this possibly quite sudden uplift in treatment
need?</div><a name="09021060000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> The pooled treatment budget is the primary
source of funding, but local authorities and local partners can also
allocate from within their own budgets. Part of the challenge in
respect of the drug strategy and investment in drug treatment is
ensuring that it is seen as a local priority. There is a reason why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>the Government put a ring fence around the pooled treatment budget and
why they set up the NTA: if they had not done so, chances are that the
additional investment and spend on drug treatment, once this got down
to local decision makers, would probably have been allocated elsewhere.
That brings me back to the need for us still to make the case for why
investing in drug treatment is the right thing to do and to say that it
can be cost-effective. Unfortunately, that issue has become party
polarised.</div><a name="09021060000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
partners have the capacity to put in additional resources. I think
that, from April, the Government and the NTA will be piloting new
initiatives that will try to free up the way that local partners,
including drug action teams, can allocate funding within their areas to
better address what are regarded as more local needs and priorities.
That might, depending on the evaluation, give us some lessons and
learning on how better to get people pooling resources and allocating
funding.</div><a name="09021060000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="09021060000342"></a>The

seconds, does either witness want to say anything to the Committee that
they had forgotten to share?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div><a name="09021060000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Barnes:</b></i> I think that we have covered this in detail.
Obviously, we will be seeking to brief and put forward more precise and
detailed amendments with regard to particular concerns. It is not that
we have problems in any way with the commitment to provide additional
support, which can only be positive. However, from my
experience&#151;both from consulting our members at DrugScope, from
CPAG, and from working as a benefits advisor&#151;I know that there
can be distance between a policy objective and what Ministers want, and
what can actually happen at the front line on the ground, particularly
when resources are limited and DWP and Jobcentre offices are under
pressure, as they are at the moment. There can be a gap between the
policy intent and the outcome and impact on
individuals.</div><a name="09021060000226"></a>
