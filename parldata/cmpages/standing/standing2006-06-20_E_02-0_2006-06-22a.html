<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000184"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Mr. Atkinson, I reiterate my welcome to the Chair
that I gave to you and your brother Chairman, Mr. Caton. It is good to
be under your firm but wise leadership.</div>
<a name="06062244000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">All three amendments deal with
the question of whether the law should encourage the public to behave
in a responsible and safe manner when enjoying leisure pursuits. Their
purpose is to look at whether there should be a legal duty to comply
with safety instructions and similar such points, because it is
important that somebody who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol,
or behaving in an obviously reckless way, should shoulder the burden
rather than others. The British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and
Attractions, the Field Studies Council and others make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 44</div>the point that in other jurisdictions it has been possible to make that
more clear than in English law.</div>
<a name="06062244000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">New South Wales, for example,
has a clear formal position for dealing with claimants who are drunk or
under the influence of drugs when they behave in a particular way and
damage themselves. In the case of Radcliffe <i class="I">v</i> McConnell Jones
and the Governors of Harper Adams Agricultural College, his honour
Judge Brunning found the college 60 per cent. liable for the
claimant&#146;s tetraplegia. In that case, a student who had been
drinking dived into the shallow end of a college swimming pool. The
Court of Appeal, in overruling the decision, made the point that the
risk&#151;that in diving the claimant might hit his head on the
bottom of the pool&#151;was common and obvious to most adults, and
that it was important to bear that in mind. One of the judges
said:</div><a name="06062244000143"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
unfortunate that a number of high spirited young men will take serious
risks with their own safety and do things that they know are forbidden.
Often they are disinhibited by drink and the encouragement of their
friends. It is the danger and the fact that it is forbidden that
provides the thrill. But if the risk materialises, they cannot blame
others for their rashness&#148;.</div>
<a name="06062244000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another similar case was Donoghue <i class="I">v
</i>Folkestone Properties Ltd. in 2003. Is there scope for clarifying
the law and making it clear, as clause 1 does in other contexts, that
it would be a defence if people undertaking activities completely
ignored the instructions that they were given by, say, the leisure park
or organiser of the activity, or were drunk or high on
drugs?</div><a name="06062244000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062244000185"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Michael Clapham</b> (Barnsley, West and Penistone) (Lab): Is
there not a danger of putting people who are doing a job of work into a
difficult position from which it would be difficult to draw back? Let
me give the hon. Gentleman the example of a fireman who willingly
enters a building as part of his job and is injured. Linking the case
to the concept of desirability, if we accept the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s proposals, could we not be creating a situation
whereby such a person would find that he had accepted the
risk?</div><a name="06062244000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000186"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I fully appreciate that it would be a bad thing if
that were what I am proposing, but it is not. Amendment No. 10, to
which I spoke first, would require the court to have regard
to</div><a name="06062244000144"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the extent to which
the person undertaking the activity obeyed the instructions given by
the person providing the
activities&#148;</div><a name="06062244000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">and whether
the person was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Neither of
those would apply in the case that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.
Amendment No. 13 relates to a person who willingly accepts a risk with
the intention of committing an offence. Of course the fireman would not
intend to commit an offence. Proposed subsection (3)
begins:</div><a name="06062244000145"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
determining whether a risk was accepted for the purposes of paragraph
2(a)&#148;,</div><a name="06062244000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">which refers back
to entering a premises willingly but with the intention to commit an
offence. I am alive to the concern raised by the hon. Gentleman, but it
need not exist.</div><a name="06062244000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
could call amendment No. 13 the Tony Martin defence. It covers a
situation in which somebody enters premises willing to commit an
offence and thereby exposes himself to
risk.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 45</div><a name="06062244000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062244000187"></a><b class="B">Lembit
&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): My reading of
amendment No. 13 suggests that proposed subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b)
actually work slightly separately. They state that they relate to
someone who
has</div><a name="06062244000146"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;willingly accepted a
risk as his, or ... entered onto land or into premises with the
intention of committing an
offence.&#148;</div><a name="06062244000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would that not
mean that a fireman who enters premises and gets injured in the course
of trying to put out a fire would not necessarily find it so easy to
sue the owner of the premises? There may be problems in considering
compensation for people wounded in the conduct of their work, but it
would seem unreasonable for the owner of a house that must necessarily
be a danger as it is burning to end up being sued by somebody who is
pursuing his work. There are two issues to consider and I suggest that
the hon. Gentleman is right to say that the amendment would afford some
protection against vexatious
claims.</div><a name="06062244000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000188"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I am certainly always willing to be corrected on my
interpretation of my amendments, and if the Minister says that I have
got it wrong and wants to come up with an even better version on
Report, nobody will be happier than
I.</div><a name="06062244000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062244000189"></a><b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): As the debate has turned to
firefighters and my youngest daughter is a firefighter, I feel
compelled to
contribute.</div><a name="06062244000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
always a leading hand or senior officer in charge of proceedings in a
dangerous situation. There may be a case in which firefighters who have
entered a building and are in communication with the organisers of the
operation outside encounter unforeseen circumstances. They then have to
make a quick decision on their own back. I am not sure how legislation
can account for such a situation or who could be held responsible
should those firefighters sustain injury having acted in accordance
with their training and made a sudden decision that takes account of
circumstances unknown to the leading hand outside. Such a case might
come under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. How can such
circumstances be accounted
for?</div><a name="06062244000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000190"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> That makes me think a little more about the point
that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) made. I
believe that under the law of negligence it has always been the case
that if somebody is working in their normal job, going about lawful
activities and is injured, and there is fault, the employer can be
found liable for damages. However, it has always been said that if the
worker acts wholly outside the normal ambit of his work and does
something reckless or completely out of line with his duties&#151;I
think it was called a &#147;frolic of his own&#148; in a case
called Hilton <i class="I">v. </i>Thomas Burton (Rhodes) Ltd.&#151;the workman
cannot say to the employer, &#147;Look, it&#146;s your system of
work or the way you&#146;ve employed me that is the root of the
problem&#148;. It was always open to the employer to use the defence,
&#147;You acted outside your instructions in a way that wasn&#146;t
envisaged.&#148; It is important that that protection should remain,
provided that it is properly decided on. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point is a good one. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 46</div>If the amendment is not drafted as well as it should be, I know that the
Minister will tell me. However, the point about accepting
risk&#151;or acting in a criminal way&#151;is that there should be
a defence available for the occupier or employer.</div>
<a name="06062244000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
amendment in the group deals with the situation of children. It is an
attempt to consider the duty that applies, even to trespassers, under
the Occupiers Liability Act 1984 and to reflect a view of the current
situation and the intention of that Act. The case of British Railways
Board <i class="I">v.</i> Herrington led to that law. A child of six trespassed
over a broken fence and was injured. It was found that the British
Railways Board was liable because it was an obvious risk that a child
would go over the fence to roam and explore. The intention of the
amendment is to restrict the application of that measure to children.
We can all understand that a child is likely to climb over a fence if
it is not high enough. The amendment aims to say that while, yes, if a
child is involved, there should be liability, if someone
older&#151;perhaps someone in their late teens or older&#151;acts
recklessly and goes on to land, the situation is different. I am
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views on that.</div>
<a name="06062244000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The basic point that I am
trying to make in the group of amendments is that individuals should
have some responsibility to behave responsibly. There have been
dreadful examples of people behaving recklessly in leisure parks. As a
society, we believe that individuals should take responsibility for
their actions. The question is whether the law can be improved in these
three areas.</div>
<a name="06062244000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062244000191"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Julian Brazier</b> (Canterbury) (Con): I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Atkinson. The issues that we are dealing with are
fundamental to the workings of the first part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="06062244000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I start by making a quick point
that reinforces that made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) about firefighters. I have great respect for
firefighters. My constituency headquarters burned down just before a
general election. A young man was a tenant in the floor upstairs. The
firemen arrived and had a terrible battle with the
blaze&#151;although none of them was injured&#151;and the building
was completely gutted. The student&#146;s car was outside and we
thought that we had a tragedy on our hands, but mercifully it
transpired that he was sleeping elsewhere that night.</div>
<a name="06062244000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a parallel with the
armed forces. I ask my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Barnsley,
West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) to bear in mind that we are dealing
with claims of negligence and of breach of statutory duty. The normal
route for a fireman injured on duty would not, of course, be a
negligence claim against his employer any more than would the normal
route for a soldier injured in action be a negligence claim against the
Army. The point is well made, but it is not that a fireman, through
using his initiative and seeing that he had to do something outside his
instructions, would lose the framework of protection for people injured
on duty. Far from it. We are dealing with negligence claims that are
issued against people who break the law, behave grossly irresponsibly
in disobeying instructions, or are drunk or
drugged.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 47</div><a name="06062244000158"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="06062244000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I did on a
number of occasions in our previous sitting, I quote Andrew Caplan, the
legal adviser to the Scouts. He says:</div>
<a name="06062244000147"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am aware that the
matters listed below may be taken into consideration currently by the
court when considering the question of contributory negligence but the
law on contribution often allows the courts to make an award to the
claimant whilst recognising he was in part to blame for his own
misfortunes. The problem for the defendant is that they have to proceed
through the whole litigation process incurring significant costs and
the discount for contribution is usually very small. In addition the
defendant has to pay all the claimant&#146;s and his own costs which
together far outweigh the cost of the damages in the majority of
cases.&#148;</div><a name="06062244000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend cited BALPPA, which says:</div>
<a name="06062244000148"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the law should encourage the
public to behave in a responsible and safe manner when enjoying leisure
pursuits. This would place participants under a legal duty to comply
with the safety instructions they receive both visually and verbally
when enjoying leisure pursuits. Whilst the current law provides a
system of contributory negligence, the Courts seldom make a finding
especially where the claimant is a child under the control of the
parent at the material time. Even where a finding is made, it is almost
unheard of for the amount to exceed 50 per cent. and more often the
figure is around 20 per cent. and fails to reflect an individual's
responsibility.&#148;</div><a name="06062244000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me relate that to a particular example. I have twice taken my children
to a commercial leisure activity centre with the rather colourful name
&#147;Going Ape&#148;. Visitors have two safety ropes attached to
them and run around through a series of obstacles up in the trees.
First, a simple model is used to show the children how to operate the
equipment, after which their parents supervise them as they go round.
As somebody with quite a lot of experience of such activity from the
airborne forces, I must say that the safety standards in both the parks
that I visited were extremely high.</div>
<a name="06062244000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a horrible suspicion,
however, that the time will come when a parent manifestly fails to do
the simple check that they should do before their child attempts each
obstacle, and the child will be injured. Given the heights involved,
the accident could be very serious, and the operation would probably
close if a successful case were brought against it. Such operations
offer teenagers the opportunity, under strictly controlled safety
conditions, to have a hell of a lot of fun, but the court will not take
into account the fact that teenagers who are not offered such
opportunities&#151;I will not go over the same ground as last
time&#151;will often find other, far more dangerous ways to amuse
themselves.</div> <a name="06062244000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">BALPPA
goes on to say that the Colorado ski industry in the USA was saved from
closure by a change in the law. A series of claims was successfully
brought against the industry, but it is now written into the law in
Colorado that those who disobey the clear notices telling them to ski
on piste and so on cannot bring a negligence case against the ski slope
operators. In Australia, as my hon. Friend mentioned, many states have
rewritten their laws on negligence. The wording in Western Australia
reminds the court that personal negligence can be responsible for 100
per cent. of the case.</div>
<a name="06062244000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me end by giving an example
of a case that did not go to court. It involves the British Canoe
Union, which settled the case on legal advice. The BCU sent details of
the case to me because it was concerned 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 48</div>about that legal advice. It was told that it had to settle the case;
otherwise it would face a long and costly court case, which it was
likely to lose. The BCU says that, in its marathon two years
ago,</div> <a name="06062244000149"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;crews were
competing over a 30 mile course in racing kayaks. Part of the course
passed through a narrow, half-mile long cutting. A volunteer marshal
was positioned at each end of the cutting to warn crews entering it
about any powered craft which could present a danger to it.</div>
<a name="06062244000150"></a><div class="hs_brev">A power boat entered the
cutting and four minutes later a kayak arrived at the cutting
travelling in the same direction. The
marshal&#148;,</div><a name="06062244000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">who was
standing on the
bank,</div><a name="06062244000151"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;allowed it to
enter on the strict understanding that there was a powered craft in the
cutting and that they should not try to overtake
it.&#148;</div><a name="06062244000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was no
question but that they had heard the instruction, but they ignored it
and overtook the boat. Fortunately, no one was injured, but there was a
collision and the power boat was severely damaged. The BCU
said:</div><a name="06062244000152"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A claim
was made against the volunteer marshal alleging he should have assumed
the crew would have ignored his instruction and he was therefore
negligent.&#148;</div><a name="06062244000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing
in mind the background&#151;which is that although one can bring
contributory negligence in court, it almost never exceeds 50 per cent,
and rarely exceeds 20 per cent&#151;it was good legal advice that the
marshal would be better off settling than fighting back. The
BCU&#146;s insurers paid up, but the result has been a substantial
increase in insurance costs for all subsequent races, and the volunteer
in question will never offer his services
again.</div><a name="06062244000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
made it clear to the Committee that he is not particularly wedded to
his wording; if the Government want to improve on it, that is fine. If
we want a country in which young people have the opportunity to take
risks, we must make sure that the courts do not penalise those who,
whether as volunteers&#151;that is my main concern&#151;or in a
commercial context, provide the opportunity for young people to take
risks in a properly structured way. On the very rare occasions when
some of them behave grossly irresponsibly&#151;when they are drunk,
manifestly disobeying instructions or whatever&#151;the courts should
not penalise the organisers, because if they do, we will go down the
route of losing even more of the remaining adventure training
opportunities. The result will not be fewer tragedies, as even the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents has pointed out;
youngsters will go off and find alternatives, in canals and pools and
on railway lines, and in other unsupervised activities, and so there
will be far more tragedies, not
fewer.</div><a name="06062244000042"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000192"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark
and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) has asked me to apologise on his behalf
for his absence for part of this morning; he has to attend the funeral
of his former colleague, Mick Heaney, and I hope that the Committee
will be understanding about that.</div>
<a name="06062244000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend and I very much
support amendment No. 10, which seems to introduce a degree of common
sense. It would allow the courts to take into consideration the
influence of drugs and alcohol. To be more precise, the amendment would
require 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 49</div>judges and courts to take account of an individual&#146;s decision to
compromise their capabilities by taking drugs or alcohol before
undertaking a given activity. It would be an eminently sensible
addition to the Bill. Although individuals may lose the capacity to act
responsibly after taking drugs or alcohol, they are nevertheless
responsible for putting themselves in a position in which their reduced
capacity leads to an accident. For that reason, it seems eminently
reasonable to include some provision directing courts to take seriously
the contributory negligence of an individual who has necessarily
compromised their abilities prior to embarking on an activity that may
lead to them being injured or, in some cases,
killed.</div><a name="06062244000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Minister to provide her perspective on this very important matter. The
hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)&#151;he is my hon. Friend
for these purposes&#151;has given a couple of examples, and I know of
a couple more specifically involving people who are incapacitated in
some way or another. I hope that the Minister can provide us with a
helpful perspective on amendment No.
10.</div><a name="06062244000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two things
to say about amendment No. 13. I actually think that it is well
drafted. Separating proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) with the
conjunction &#147;or&#148; is quite sensible. As has already been
made clear in this debate, nothing in amendment No. 13 would compromise
a firefighter&#146;s ability to seek compensation when they have been
injured as a result of carrying out their duties, but it makes it more
difficult for individuals to launch vexatious and unreasonable
compensation claims against the owner of premises that have caught
fire. Obviously, if premises have caught fire, something has gone wrong
and there has been a breakdown of some sort.</div>
<a name="06062244000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">If firefighters could sue
owners of property for negligence, almost every fire could be blamed on
the proprietor or at least there could be a &#147;have a go&#148;
compensation claimant in each case. Thankfully, in this country we have
a noble body of firefighters who, on the whole, would not dream of
attempting to sue individuals who own premises that have subsequently
caught fire. There is nothing to be concerned about in the amendment
because it does not prevent legitimate compensation from being paid out
to firefighters who have been injured as a result of carrying out their
duties.</div><a name="06062244000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
subsection (2)(b), the Martin case has been mentioned. One of the news
stories that greatly vexes the public is when an individual commits an
offence and then succeeds in suing the victim of their offence. I do
not want to get too far into the philosophical debate, but I should be
interested to hear the Government&#146;s view of what, on the face of
it, seems to be a reasonable modification to the Bill. It makes it more
difficult for someone who is breaking the law and, by inference,
depriving an individual of their rights, to then sue that individual. I
recognise that the Minister may wish to stay silent on this because it
opens large gates to even bigger debates that impinge on some of her
colleagues&#146; areas of work, but if she does say something the
Committee would be most
grateful.</div><a name="06062244000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally I
turn to amendment No. 14. I recall the tribulations of Pete Jones, one
of my constituents, who runs the Red Ridge outdoor pursuits centre. It
is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 50</div>because of him that I initially got involved in this field of policy. He
has suffered frivolous and vexatious claims on a number of occasions.
They often come from parents, who, having allowed their offspring to
enjoy the benefits of going to the Red Ridge centre, try to sue Pete
Jones and his organisation for things such as banging heads on the
bottom of a bunk bed when sitting up too quickly in the middle of the
night.</div>
<a name="06062244000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="06062244000193"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> Lest anyone in the Committee believes that the
points about banging heads on bunk beds are lightly made, I understand
from the Girl Guides that they have had a number of claims for exactly
that. This is what we have come to in this
country.</div><a name="06062244000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000194"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for
Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) for making that point. There is a breakdown of
common sense when people make such claims. The injury is negligible,
but the cost is
enormous.</div><a name="06062244000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062244000195"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Kevan Jones</b> (North Durham) (Lab): I am considering their
comments carefully, but are not both the hon. Gentleman and the hon.
Member for Canterbury indulging in what was described at Second Reading
as the myth of the compensation culture? Could the hon. Gentleman give
some specific examples of where someone has sued for banging a head on
a bunk
bed?</div><a name="06062244000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000196"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> This is an actual example. Pete Jones at the
Red Ridge centre had to defend himself against a compensation claim
made by parents on the basis that their offspring had banged their head
on the bunk bed above the one in which they had been sleeping. In order
to furnish the hon. Gentleman with further information, should it not
be ruled out of order, I shall share the names with him between now and
the afternoon sitting in order to assure him that this is not a
myth&#151;I do not wish to enter the names on the record because I do
not want to exacerbate the situation. The example that I gave is
real.</div> <a name="06062244000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the
hon. Member for Canterbury can provide examples from the Girl Guides,
where real compensation claims have been made against real people who
have acted in good faith in attempting to supply services for the Girl
Guides and for other
organisations.</div><a name="06062244000159"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div>
<a name="06062244000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000197"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> I have cited several direct examples from the
Scouts, who have a policy of fighting such cases and have provided
chapter and verse. The Girl Guides organisation has a policy of never
releasing the names involved in cases. However, I can tell the hon.
Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) that a member of the Guides council
who comes regularly to our meetings told us that an action had been
brought by a girl who banged her head; not only that, but a payout was
made in a case of a girl getting burnt by fat spurting on to her hand
from cooking sausages over a fire&#151;she was not camping but was in
the garden of the Guide hut. These are not middle-class myths; they are
actual cases.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div><a name="06062244000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000198"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> This highlights the disappearance of common
sense and reasonableness from the compensation environment. I say to
the hon. Member for North Durham that none of us is trying to prevent
legitimate compensation claims from being pursued through the courts.
The hon. Member for Canterbury and all the rest of us involved in the
all-party group on adventure and recreation in society are not trying
to prevent negligent activity and irresponsible behaviour by those
providing the services from experiencing the full force of the law. We
are trying to prevent individuals who act in good faith and provide a
net social benefit from being the victim of the &#147;have a
go&#148; compensation culture, where individuals, far from seeking
compensation to get redress for real suffering that has been caused,
instead come to the view that they might be able to make a few bob on
the side by taking something like this through
court.</div><a name="06062244000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress to the
hon. Member for North Durham, and to the Committee as a whole, that the
difficulty is that being found innocent is still extremely expensive,
because one still has to pay one&#146;s costs. I shall give way to
the hon. Gentleman, but I am a bit cautious about doing so because we
might be straying a bit far from amendment No. 14 and the points that I
was making.</div>
<a name="06062244000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000199"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> The hon. Gentleman shows a great degree of
ignorance of compensation and legal cases, because the case involving a
young girl being burnt by fat would not succeed unless there was
negligence and unless an horrific burn was involved. We are not talking
about a splashing of fat out of a fire. I am sorry that he is again
using inflammatory language about the idea that there is a compensation
culture. We heard on Second Reading and in Committee that there is no
evidence for it. I am sure that he and his fellow Liberal Democrats
would be the first to cry wolf if, for example, someone was injured on
a school trip.</div>
<a name="06062244000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000200"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> I have a great personal affection for the
hon. Gentleman for reasons that stretch right back to our Newcastle
city council days. I could have sued him for flicking my ears on at
least one occasion during a council meeting. It was an unprovoked
attack and I could have accused him of assault. Despite that affection,
I must say that it is he, rather than ourselves, who is making
unsubstantiated criticisms. I can and will furnish him with the details
of the example that I have cited from Pete Jones&#146;s Red Ridge
centre. I challenge him to illustrate why he thinks there is not a
perception of a compensation culture and why he thinks that all the
examples we have given were legitimate claims. If he really feels that
way, what is he doing on this Committee? Why is he supporting the
Government&#146;s Bill, which seeks to redress a balance that the
Minister validly thinks is an issue?</div>
<a name="06062244000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000201"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> Does the hon. Member for North Durham not
appreciate that we are desperately short of Scout masters and Guide
leaders because of those cases? He was in his place when I described
the Manchester case, which took place six days after the first debate
in the House of Lords&#151;it was in the middle of the process there.
In that case, an award was made against the Scouts of &#163;15,000. A
Brownie attending a pantomime put on by the Scouts as a kindness to
younger children 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 52</div>allegedly cut herself when she put her hand under her chair in an
auditorium that had been separately inspected twice&#151;once by the
Scout master and once by the licensing officer from the council. I read
out the details, and the hon. Gentleman was
there&#151;</div><a name="06062244000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000202"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. That intervention is rather
long.</div><a name="06062244000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000203"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> I am tempted to suggest that we are straying
into the realms of a Second Reading or Third Reading debate rather than
talking about the amendments. However, Mr. Atkinson, the hon. Member
for North Durham provoked us. He sought to distract the Committee from
its legitimate activity; in the normal world, he could be open to
charges of libel for the upset and emotional distress that he has
caused. </div><a name="06062244000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fairness
to the hon. Member for North Durham&#151;I always try to seek the
positive in his contributions&#151;what he said relates directly to
proposed subsection (2)(b) in amendment No. 14. It
states:</div><a name="06062244000153"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
considering whether an activity is a desirable activity for the
purposes of this Part, the court shall have regard to the age of the
claimant and in particular whether the claimant is...under 14
years of age but can prove that he did not have the capacity to
understand the nature of his
actions.&#148;</div><a name="06062244000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman and the Committee would obviously be highly sympathetic to
that sentiment.</div> <a name="06062244000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
someone under the age of 14 did not understand the consequences of what
was going on, one would infer that he had acted in good faith. If he
came to grief, the court would want to consider that fact when judging
whether sufficient care and attention had been taken by the provider of
the service, and it would draw the appropriate conclusion. However, it
also works the other way round. If it can be shown that someone under
the age of 14 who had the capacity to understand the nature of his
actions had acted in what could be regarded as an irresponsible
fashion, that would afford some protection to providers of services who
in good faith genuinely believed that they had sufficiently warned
their relatively young clients of the dangers of straying from the
recommended path.</div>
<a name="06062244000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000204"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> In clause 1, we are consider whether an activity is
&#147;desirable&#148; when deciding a negligence claim. However, in
the amendments we are considering whether cases that have already been
decided at the highest level should go further. For instance, we ask
whether an occupier should be liable in circumstances in which harm had
arisen because of an individual&#146;s choice to engage in a
dangerous activity. By and large, those cases seem to suggest that the
occupier should not be
liable.</div><a name="06062244000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000205"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s observation is
valid. I hope that the Minister can provide some perspective, for the
benefit of the record, on how the courts should interpret negligence in
such circumstances&#151;we have given many examples this
morning&#151;when the providers of services have done everything that
they reasonably can to ensure that their clients understand
the dangers, but the latter nevertheless act in what used to be called,
in non-legal terms, an irresponsible way.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div><a name="06062244000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that one of my
questions may be beyond the remit that the Minister chooses to take on
today, but I hope that she will be able to give quite a complete reply
on amendments Nos. 10 and
14.</div><a name="06062244000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062244000206"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Philip Hollobone</b> (Kettering) (Con): It may be worth
dealing, during discussion about what is or is not a desirable
activity, with the terrible dilemma faced by many police officers in
responding to emergency calls. I recently spent 22 days with the
Northamptonshire police force as part of the police parliamentary
scheme and I learned that there are three grades of police
driver&#151;advanced, standard and basic. In a nutshell, only someone
with an advanced or standard driving qualification with the
Northamptonshire police is allowed to exceed the speed limit in
responding to emergency calls.</div>
<a name="06062244000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Each police officer has on
their person an alarm button that they are encouraged to press if they
are under threat of personal attack. If they press it, every police
officer in the county knows that that police officer is under threat,
and is advised to get to the scene of the incident as quickly as
possible. That presents a huge dilemma for the Northamptonshire police
officer who has only a police basic qualification. Should he or she
proceed to rescue his or her colleague within the speed limit, or
exceed the speed limit to get there as quickly as possible?</div>
<a name="06062244000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should have thought that most
of us would consider it a desirable activity for that police officer to
respond to the call as quickly as he or she could, but the advice that
they are given is that if they exceed the speed limit and something
goes wrong they will be personally liable and will be likely to lose
their job. In response to the amendments I should welcome the
Minister&#146;s advice and guidance on whether that dilemma could be
solved by Government
action.</div><a name="06062244000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062244000207"></a><b class="B">John
Mann</b> (Bassetlaw) (Lab): I wanted to make a few remarks on
the amendments, whose underlying tone suggests an intoxicating cocktail
of Conservatives and Liberals working together. To illustrate my
remarks I want to use an example that may be from your area, Mr.
Atkinson; as I recall, Otterburn is in or near your constituency. I
used to run outward bound courses at Otterburn so I have some
first-hand experience of the issues.</div>
<a name="06062244000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill grapples with two
major dilemmas, which the amendments handle rather badly. The first
concerns drugs and alcohol. I cannot recall whether Otterburn was one
of the locations where the dilemma arose, but it did arise at others
that I have used. One of the key dilemmas for an organiser&#151;and I
was organising both for youths and for adults&#151;was whether to
have a bar open, and how often.</div>
<a name="06062244000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">If someone is organising what I
might call adventure pursuits and chooses to have a bar open in the
middle of the day there is clearly direct and contributory negligence.
It may be, however, that the operation being operated or hired is a
commercial one. One of the big battles that I used to have either in
those situations or in general education was about persuading the venue
to close the bar that it wanted to profit from, particularly at midday
but also, potentially, into the early hours of the morning.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 54</div><a name="06062244000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of my hon. Friends may
recall my horrific success in closing the TUC bar at its national
education centre, at midday, precisely because there was no reason why
anyone doing trade union studies would need the benefit of alcohol. If
the context is one of more dangerous pursuits than the genteel learning
of employment or industrial tribunal law, there is a dilemma. One of
the issues emanating from the amendments that the Minister needs to
contemplate is that there is a clear difference between a commercial
organisation that operates for profit, where the pressure to maximise
income generation, including from alcohol, is part of the
consideration, and a purely voluntary organisation. Some thought needs
to be given to the difference between voluntary and commercial
activities.</div><a name="06062244000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second issue relates to the question of children. The amendment is
particularly bad in that context, although well
meaning.</div><a name="06062244000160"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000208"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="06062244000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000209"></a>John
Mann:</b> If I may follow through the logic, I am sure that
the hon. Gentleman will want to intervene
then.</div><a name="06062244000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">A culture is
growing in this country of what one might call the adrenalin junkie,
whereby outdoor pursuits are taken to the limit. I chair the
parliamentary mountaineering club. In some sports, the concept of
&#147;limit&#148; is clearly defined, but outdoor pursuits are
generally different. I recall a particularly horrific case involving
schoolchildren from, I believe, Leeds&#151;certainly from west
Yorkshire. They were river running under adult supervision. I do not
know the precise details, but I do know from my experience that what
tends to happen is that the adult organiser, who may be an adrenalin
junkie themselves, pushes the boundaries of outdoor activities, and
moves beyond some genteel walking, caving, climbing, abseiling and
canoeing.</div><a name="06062244000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such a
culture has begun to build up. It has been reined in a little, but one
could find oneself on a course in the Lake district going down rivers,
going down some fairly high mountains and walking down reasonably
tricky footpaths. On Helvellyn, people were attempting to parachute
down becks.</div><a name="06062244000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that the Minister will give some thought to this critical point,
particularly in respect of young people: these were adult-initiated
pursuits. The child was going on an adventure holiday and in reality
had no say over which combination of pursuits they participated in, and
the parent at home would probably have had no idea whatever about the
activities. They may have had a general picture, but they may not have
even heard of some of the more adrenalin-fixated pursuits that have
started to creep in. That kind of differentiation is important in this
context, as the adult is making the decisions, in some cases
irrationally.</div><a name="06062244000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000210"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that Arthur
Wainwright states in &#147;The Eastern Fells&#148; that the safest
way off a hill if the mist comes in is down a beck? There is a question
about introducing nanny state concepts. The fact is that most hill
walkers would go down the beck in such
circumstances.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 55</div><a name="06062244000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000211"></a>John

[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Yes it is.&#148;] No,
it is
not.</div><a name="06062244000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000212"></a>Mr.

tomorrow.</div><a name="06062244000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000213"></a>John
Mann:</b> The hon. Gentleman is misunderstanding Wainwright
and also my remarks. How one escapes from a mountain following the
course of a beck or a river&#151;going down and wading
through&#151;is fundamentally different, particularly in bad weather.
No mountain guide would advise people to go through water to try to
descend a mountain, as body temperature would be reduced. Indeed,
avoiding the water is fundamental. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The hon.
Gentleman has reinterpreted
Wainwright.</div><a name="06062244000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000214"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but I
would not expect to walk down the middle of the
river.</div><a name="06062244000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000215"></a>John
Mann:</b> That is my precise point. Some of the
adrenalin-junkie outdoor pursuits do precisely that. In other words,
one walks part way up Helvellyn and goes down the beck. That may or may
not be a legitimate pursuit, but a balance needs to be drawn, for young
people in particular, and included in legislation, so that the
extension of the adrenalin-based society with, from my experience, the
outdoor pursuits organiser at the forefront, is brought into the
context of what is and is not legitimate. In particular, there is a
need to clarify what is free choice.</div>
<a name="06062244000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the course leader of a group
of young people, if they liked my leadership style I could persuade
them to do the most absurd things if I chose to do so. Indeed, in a
non-dangerous context, not in adventure pursuits but through the power
of the paper-based exercises that formed part of the development and
learning, we put groups into absurd positions. I could have
devised&#151;I am aware of others who have done so&#151;dangerous
pursuits in the same context. Such projects are to do with
team-building, group interactions and communication skills, but the
difference between building danger and non-danger into that is often
divided by a fairly thin line. My only point is to point out that the
adrenalin-based nature of many new pursuits is itself a potential
danger that clouds part of the debate.</div>
<a name="06062244000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000216"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. I
have two quick points. First, I understand that the number of children
killed in adventure training pursuits across sport, adventure training,
school trips and the rest is an average of about three per year. Large
numbers of young people are dying of drug addiction, some are dying of
alcoholism and large numbers are killed in accidents pursuing things.
My second point is that for those people whose parents cannot afford
expensive adventure training holidays of the sort described by the hon.
Gentleman, the opportunities are getting thinner and thinner and so
they are going out and finding their own ways of amusing
themselves.</div>
<a name="06062244000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000217"></a>John
Mann:</b> The hon. Gentleman does not, in my view, make a
legitimate point. I also happen to be the chair of the all-party group
on youth hostelling and we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 56</div>provide 25,000 places for young, disadvantaged people. I provided some
myself this week for free for young people with poor backgrounds in my
constituency so that they can do well-organised activities outdoors. We
must not confuse the rightful fear produced by such adventure and
risk-taking&#151;which is felt by definition during pursuits such as
mountaineering&#151;with the adrenalin-junkie nature of some of the
new pursuits. People rightly want to be able to pursue legal cases
should such pursuits go wrong. That is part of the balance of reining
them in.</div>
<a name="06062244000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000218"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="06062244000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000219"></a>John
Mann:</b> I will give way to the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire.</div><a name="06062244000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000220"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> The amendments have prompted a useful debate.
What we are discussing is in line with amendment No. 14, in particular.
In that context I have two observations. Is the hon. Gentleman aware of
the theory that we are each attracted to varying levels of risk and
that that is built into us as individuals? As I have said before,
Professor Heinz Wolff calls it vitamin R, where R stands for risk.
Would the hon. Gentleman accept that through history each of us has had
a different threshold of risk but that we will fulfil the need for our
relative levels of risk? If he accepts that, I would challenge his
assumption that we are becoming adrenalin junkies. There has not been a
change in the relative need for risk, but a suppression of the
opportunity to fulfil that need in a legitimate way.</div>
<a name="06062244000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point was a statistic
that I sought to research. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that we were
looking into trying to compare how many deaths per thousand or per
million occur during organised and supervised adventure activities
against a control sample of individuals of the same age group and
social background who are not in supervised adventure activities? It
seems that the death rate and injury rate are lower in the supervised
activities than in the control sample. In other words it is safer, even
with the deaths and injuries that he has described, to have people on
those adventure activities than not.</div>
<a name="06062244000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000221"></a>John
Mann:</b> I agree. That is why we need a balance in the law.
The point of what I intended to be a short contribution but which has
been widely intervened on was to ensure a balance in the debate, too. I
disagree on the issue of adrenalin junkie growth, because that is what
I observe. Admittedly, it is a small part of the activities that take
place but, with regard to the river running exercise that led to the
tragedies in the Yorkshire dales, I can see, having organised such
pursuits for many years, no logic whatever that suggests that there is
any added value in organising that kind of activity for young people.
It seems to me that the move into new ways of finding adventure and
excitement is potentially beyond the bounds of what is legitimate if
they are for young
people.</div><a name="06062244000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Member for Montgomeryshire&#151;at his more venerable
age&#151;wishes to climb mountains and try to shimmy down rivers, he
is welcome to do so, but he should not be allowed to do so with a group
of young people whose parents have perhaps paid him to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 57</div>do so without realising precisely what is going on and knowing the
risks. It is not rational to say, as the amendment does, that a young
person is capable of making a personal decision in relation to a group
activity. That is not
coherent.</div><a name="06062244000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000222"></a>Mr.
Clapham:</b> My hon. Friend has extensive experience of
working with younger people. In his experience, would a judge deciding
on a case of negligence consider the nature of the instruction given,
whether the person bringing the claim had failed to take into
consideration the instruction given, and whether the person had
indulged in alcohol or
drugs?</div><a name="06062244000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000223"></a>John
Mann:</b> Although I am not the greatest lover of judges, my
experience is that those factors are likely to be taken into account. I
would not want to give the impression that I believe that the danger of
the compensation culture does not exist, because there are examples of
that, and I will give one relating to mountaineering in order to
balance things
out.</div><a name="06062244000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was the
absurd case of a young person, educated not within&#151;it is not
within yet&#151;but on the borders of my constituency, who employed a
professional mountain guide to climb Mount Everest and died in the
process and whose father is suing the mountain guide. That is where the
illegitimacy comes. Decisions taken in such a context can be wrong and
of course there can be negligence, but if one has determined to climb
Mount Everest and does any research, one knows that the likelihood of
death can be, depending on the time of year, anything from one in 10 to
one in 20 and therefore it is a highly dangerous activity. One knows
that, at those heights, even the most experienced mountain guide is not
necessarily going to be working at 100 per cent., because of lack of
oxygen. To sue on that basis is illegitimate.</div>
<a name="06062244000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Canterbury
rightly made the point that if one sues, there is the dilemma of
whether to settle because the legal costs are so great. That is exactly
what the Bill needs to address. We need to bring into this
context&#151;this includes organisations such as the
Scouts&#151;the way in which adults can make determinations for
children. Some years ago, when I first went on a Scout camp&#151;no,
this was pre-Scouts; it was a Cub camp&#151;the instruction was,
&#147;You will do this; you will do this; you will do this.&#148;
As I catapulted down from the first tree, luckily the level of mud was
such that I did not break a leg. However, it was not my choice to do
that aged eight or nine; in reality, it was the leader&#146;s choice.
The peer group pressure meant, in essence, that the activity was
compulsory&#151;&#147;You will do that.&#148;</div>
<a name="06062244000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is where we need to get
the balance right. Adults make those decisions for children. It is
right and proper that, in ensuring that we rein in the compensation
culture, we do not reduce in any way the improvements in risk
assessment or health and safety in such activities. That is the dilemma
that the Minister and the Department have been handling and I hope that
she will bear in mind the points that I have
made.</div><a name="06062244000161"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="06062244000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000224"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> The mountaineering case to which I referred in
the last sitting but could not name was Hedley <i class="I">v</i>. Cuthbertson in
1997, a summary of which is in the Library brief. I hope that the
Committee will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div>forgive me for making that point after the thoughtful contribution that
we have just heard, and that it is in order for me to do so. It was an
equally shocking case and one in which the instructor lost.</div>
<a name="06062244000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Bassetlaw
(John Mann) has a tremendous reputation for his knowledge about
alcohol&#151;a sentence that I phrase quite carefully. I remember
that when we received our Home Office brief, his was one of the most
respected voices in the House on the matter. I am sure that he would
accept that his point about alcohol could be easily coped with by
modifying the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire. The provisions should not be nullified, but tightened up
where there is an incentive to provide alcohol or where people have
chosen to provide it.</div>
<a name="06062244000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make two points about
the wider issues that the hon. Gentleman raised. First, the Youth
Hostels Association, to which he referred, is a splendid body. I cannot
claim as close an involvement with it as he can, but I can tell him
that it was one of a number of youth groups that wrote in support of my
Promotion of Volunteering Bill, which sought to set a much higher
standard for negligence cases. The YHA not only wrote to support the
Bill, but was a co-signatory, along with the Scouts, Guides and other
youth organisations, to a letter written in support of the Bill that
appeared in <i class="I">The
Times</i>.</div><a name="06062244000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
felt towards the end of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution that,
unusually for him, what he was saying did not bear directly on the
other amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire said that the gist of the other two amendments was that
the law should be different where people have deliberately disobeyed
instructions or where someone has criminal intent. The hon. Gentleman,
however, seemed to be saying that where an adult had given someone an
illegitimate instruction to do something dangerous, they would get
caught by that. Reading my hon. Friend&#146;s amendments, I cannot
see that, but even if it were the case, a drafting improvement would be
needed, rather than an attempt to strike against the main import of
what my hon. Friend is trying to achieve. I think that the hon.
Gentleman is actually with us on this
issue.</div><a name="06062244000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000225"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman finishes, and to
prevent me from making a second speech of my own, will he tell us
whether he agrees on another interesting observation made by the hon.
Member for Bassetlaw? I have not considered before&#151;but it must
be correct&#151;that one of the most unpleasant experiences that
children have at school is of being forced to do things that are
outside their risk envelope; in other words, being forced to operate in
an environment that exceeds their need for
risk.</div><a name="06062244000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
observations that arises from the thoughtful contribution that the hon.
Member for Bassetlaw made, and on which we should all reflect, is that
we need to protect young people from being forced to operate in a risk
environment that far exceeds their own desires. Such activity not only
provides very little educational benefit, but can lead to unnecessary
psychological pressure and risk for the individuals participating in
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000226"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, but the
case for the amendments seems to me overwhelming, although my hon.
Friend made it clear that he is not particularly wedded to the wording
of any of them. Indeed, on the narrow point of where someone supplies
alcohol, the hon. Member for Bassetlaw was quite right: the wording
could do with some tweaking. However, I urge the Minister and the
Committee to support the
amendments.</div><a name="06062244000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000227"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs
(Bridget Prentice):</b> This has been a wide-ranging and
useful debate, from which I have certainly learned a great deal. I did
not realise how many experts the Committee has on all sorts of
adventurous activities. I feel very unadventurous in comparison with
some hon. Members present, although I have managed to abseil down
Citibank in Lewisham. That is about as much as I can
manage.</div><a name="06062244000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000228"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b>
Wow!</div><a name="06062244000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000229"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is suitably
impressed.</div><a name="06062244000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I very much
welcome the thinking behind the amendments and agree that we need to
strike a balance, with people behaving responsibly and an element of
common sense brought back into the situation. That is why I hope that
we can reach some agreement&#151;we began to see agreement between
the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and my hon. Friend the Member for
Bassetlaw towards the end of the debate&#151;about the way in which
we treat young people. Making them go beyond their adventurous
abilities is something that must be considered.</div>
<a name="06062244000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, I ask the hon.
Member for North-East Hertfordshire not to press the amendments. I
shall try not to take up too much of the Committee&#146;s time,
because we have had a thorough debate, but I can say that my main
reasons for arguing against the amendments are that there is already
sufficient legislation to cover what he is trying to achieve, and that
there are some drafting errors, which as he recognises, is often
inevitable when one puts together amendments in this way.</div>
<a name="06062244000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate that it is
important to ensure that people take responsibility for their actions,
and that a proper balance is struck between the individual&#146;s
rights and responsibilities. The Law Reform (Contributory Negligence)
Act 1945 already allows the court to take into account all aspects of a
claimant&#146;s behaviour and the extent to which his or her
negligence might have contributed to the injury suffered. The hon.
Member for North-East Hertfordshire said that his amendment could be
called the Tony Martin amendment, but it would not have protected Tony
Martin, because he was sued for the deliberate tort of battery, not for
negligence. Also, section 329 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 already
makes it much more difficult for any criminal to sue for battery; I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will take that into
account.</div><a name="06062244000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
drunkenness, the court will reduce damages on account of the
carelessness of a drunken claimant not because he was drunk, but
because he was careless. It might interest hon. Members to know that a
drunk 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 60</div>cannot use drunkenness as an excuse for not taking care of himself, or
as much care of himself as if he had been sober, but of course, the
court will always decide on the evidence before it.</div>
<a name="06062244000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Canterbury
talked about his canoe case, which was obviously a difficult one, but
as it did not go to court, we cannot speculate on what the court might
have
decided.</div><a name="06062244000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000230"></a>Mr.
Brazier:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for coming to that
point. Of the cases about which I have given the Committee specific
details, that is the only one that was settled out of court. Does she
accept the testimony from the legal sources that I quoted that
contributory negligence in this country is never above 50 per cent. and
rarely above 20 per cent.? On that basis, the legal advice was pretty
understandable.</div><a name="06062244000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000231"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> First, I do not accept that contributory
negligence is never more than 50 per cent. While the hon. Gentleman was
speaking, I was looking at a list of cases in which contributory
negligence was up to 90 per cent. I shall come back to that point in a
minute when I find the example. Just because someone disobeys
instructions, it does not mean that the defendant was not negligent
also; one or two of my hon. Friends made that point.</div>
<a name="06062244000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
contributory negligence. A workman climbed up and interfered with
unfenced transmission machinery and was injured as a result, with 90
per cent. contributory negligence. A machinery attendant climbed on
unfenced transmission machinery to catch a pigeon roosting behind it,
with 80 per cent. A metal moulder who failed to wear protective legwear
suffered burns to his ankles from molten metal splashes, with 75 per
cent. contributory negligence. I have a number of other
examples.</div><a name="06062244000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000232"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> The concern is that when such an instance is
overwhelmingly the individual&#146;s fault, it should not come to the
point where the court says, &#147;It&#146;s your fault.&#148; If
somebody is so reckless as to be 90 per cent. responsible, surely the
court should just say, &#147;No, you haven&#146;t got a claim,
because it&#146;s your
fault.&#148;</div><a name="06062244000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000233"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> In many cases, the court does say that. Often,
where damages are given, they are derisory damages to send a message
that the court does not see such claims as sensible. That should give
lawyers the message&#151;I think that this is the point to which the
hon. Member for Canterbury was alluding&#151;that they should not
encourage their clients to pursue such
cases.</div><a name="06062244000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
the amendments. There are drafting difficulties with amendment No. 10.
It is not clear what is meant by a court determining negligence. It
could mean that the court is to have regard to such factors at any
stage of its determination of a claim, including any assessment of
damage, or it might be construed to mean that the court could regard
them when considering liability. Nor is it clear whether the court
would be required to have regard to each factor as a separate matter
wherever it arises, or to have regard to the extent to which the
instructions were followed and the effect of drugs or
alcohol.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div><a name="06062244000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">On drugs and alcohol, although I
realise the difficulty, the amendment does not include a definition of
the term &#147;drugs&#148;. It could be interpreted rather widely,
and might even include situations where someone was taking a
prescription medicine. I do not think that that is what the hon. Member
for North-East Hertfordshire was trying to
achieve.</div><a name="06062244000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000234"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> The Minister seeks to take an extremely
pedantic view of the amendment&#151;a remark that sounded worse than
I intended. Surely she accepts that no measure would be that precise. I
understand from her previous comments, and especially from the examples
that she has given, that she agrees with the amendment&#146;s intent.
She hopes that courts would take account of individual decisions to act
irresponsibly, such as by getting drunk or taking drugs, prior to going
on an adventure activity. Will she confirm that even if she does not
like the amendment&#146;s wording, she respects its
intent?</div><a name="06062244000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000235"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I have much sympathy with the amendment&#146;s
intent. We need to return to a situation where people take some
responsibility for their own actions, albeit with the caveats mentioned
by my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw, particularly in relation to
young people. I shall also talk about adults with learning
difficulties, for example, who could be taken on adventure holidays.
When we talk about desirable activities, we do not want to start
reducing any particular group&#146;s opportunity to participate in
such activities. I have been known to say&#151;in particular, I shall
say it when we discuss claims farmers&#151;that sometimes accidents
happen. An accident is an accident and we must be very careful about
pursuing
it.</div><a name="06062244000162"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06062244000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, we
do not have a claims or compensation culture in this country, and one
reason for introducing the Bill is to ensure that we do not go down
that road. My hon. Friend was right to try to persuade Opposition
Members to draw back from their suggestion that the compensation
culture was as widespread as might have appeared from earlier comments
in the
debate.</div><a name="06062244000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 13 is unnecessary and disproportionate. There may be some confusion
about the matter because it would require the court in considering the
nature of the activity to have particular regard to whether the
claimant</div> <a name="06062244000154"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
willingly accepted a risk as his,
or&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062244000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress the
word
&#147;or&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062244000155"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(b)
entered onto land...with the intention of committing an
offence.&#148;</div><a name="06062244000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is difficult
to see how those factors, which are concerned with what was in the
claimant&#146;s mind, might be relevant to whether the activity
itself was desirable.</div>
<a name="06062244000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is also
unnecessary because we have already taken action in section 329 of the
Criminal Justice Act to limit considerably the possibility of a civil
claim from a criminal for trespass to the person. Nothing has changed
since that Act was passed&#151;either by way of evidence of cases in
which the courts might have found in favour of the criminals or for any
other reason&#151;to justify a different approach
now.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div><a name="06062244000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000236"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> The point about clause 1 is that it is a
restatement of the law to persuade people organising trips and so on of
what the law actually is. One aspect of the decision in Tomlinson,
which has guided clause 1 and which is not dealt with, is that an
occupier should not generally be liable where the danger and harm arose
from the choice of the individual to engage in a dangerous activity.
Why cannot that point be restated,
too?</div><a name="06062244000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062244000237"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> It is not necessary to restate that because it
is clear in the Occupiers Liability Act. The occupier would not be held
liable where a person decides of their own accord to pursue a dangerous
activity. There was a lengthy discussion about a firefighter going into
a house. It would be the householder&#146;s common duty of care under
the Occupiers Liability Act to take such care as is reasonable in all
the circumstances to see that the visitor, in this case the
firefighter, is reasonably safe in using the premises.</div>
<a name="06062244000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the case of a fire, however,
it would be difficult to see how the occupier would be able to make it
any safer for a member of the fire brigade. It might be different if
the firefighter had been called to the house to free someone from
railings and the premises were dangerous in some way and the
firefighter was injured. As so often in such cases, and in the examples
that hon. Members have cited, it very much depends on the circumstances
of the case.</div> <a name="06062244000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far
as criminals are concerned, the courts already take the circumstances
of the case into account and a number of factors limit the likelihood
of any claim by a criminal succeeding. For example, courts will take
into account why a trespasser was on the property. That is clearly
relevant to foreseeability and the steps that it is reasonable to take
to avoid risk of injury to the person or the property. The amendment
seems to go further than that, because it would provide for the courts
to take into account the intention of the trespasser. Courts are
already perfectly capable of doing that.</div>
<a name="06062244000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any claim by a criminal is
likely to raise the common law maxim that an action does not arise from
an unjust cause. It would be difficult in practical terms to assess the
intentions of a claimant and establish whether they entered the land
intending to commit an offence. It might be more obvious in the case of
a burglar who went on to the land in the dead of night, but not all
cases will be so clear-cut. As I said, the Occupiers Liability Act
contains detailed provisions about liability in reference to
trespassers. Another question is whether accepting a risk would be
decided on the same principles as cases where one person has a duty of
care to another.</div>
<a name="06062244000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are similar problems with
amendment No. 14. The factors that relate to the claimant&#146;s age
and understanding would have to be taken into account by the court in
deciding whether the activity is desirable, and there is a danger that
that would be unworkable. It is extremely difficult to see how those
factors that are concerned with what a claimant might be expected to
understand are relevant to the issue of whether the activity is
desirable. For example, would the activities at a Scout or Girl Guide
camp be considered more desirable if the children involved were under
the age of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 63</div>10 or if they were over it but the claimant were under that age? How
would the provision apply to children with learning difficulties, or
even adults with learning difficulties? The amendment would require the
court to wrestle with such questions. Therefore, it could easily sow
seeds of confusion and uncertainty to no useful
purpose.</div><a name="06062244000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Putting those
issues aside, the amendment is unnecessary and a potential source of
confusion and unfairness. Courts already take into account the relevant
factors when determining the duty that is owed with what is required to
meet it. That includes the age, experience and awareness of the
claimant and any disability that he or she has. In its report that led
to the Occupiers Liability Act, the Law Commission said that
</div><a name="06062244000156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;among the
circumstances which will be taken into account are the nature of the
trespassory entry and the age and the character of the
trespasser.&#148;</div> <a name="06062244000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">To impose a
requirement to consider those issues in regard to a particular age
group is superfluous. It also has the potential to raise anomalies. For
example, as it stands, the amendment would not apply to adults with
learning difficulties, some of whom may have the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 64</div>mental capacity of a person under the age of 10. For those reasons, I
ask the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire to withdraw the
amendment.</div> <a name="06062244000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
sake of the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone), who
explained to me that he had to go to another Committee and who asked
about a police officer who exceeds the speed limit, I put on the record
the following point. Anyone who exceeds the speed limit commits a
criminal offence. In a civil claim for compensation if, for example, a
pedestrian is injured by a speeding police car, the courts would take
all the circumstances into account. I hope that that answers the
question that he raised, but if it does not, I am happy to write to him
to give him a more detailed response.</div>
