<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) is not with us this morning. I hope that he is all right, but I suspect that after yesterday he is visiting his local authority to sort everything out. We look forward to a report from him in due course.
<P>
I regret that the amendments are rather technical, and I admit that I shall have to stick pretty closely to my brief. The grouping of the amendments and new clauses is very convenient for the debate. Although the principle that we shall be dealing with is simple, Bills are about putting principles into practice. That takes up a fair chunk of this Bill,
<P>
I cannot recall whether you were in the Chair on 15 February, Mr. O'Brien, when we voted down clause 29-which dealt with the calculation of the state second pension-and moved a new order of consideration. We wanted a proper debate, and to proceed as we had originally intended would not have been conducive to that. I am grateful for the co-operation of all members of the Committee and both Opposition parties in dealing with the matter. I am also grateful to those who did background work in preparing the amendments and new clauses.
<P>
I must enter a caveat. Although the Government do not want to raise any substantive issues on Report, we have already pointed out that technical drafting amendments will be necessary to the child support measures in the early part of the Bill, arising from the rush to have the Bill printed in December. The same may apply to this part of the Bill, but if so, only minor drafting amendments will be involved. To reach the point we are at today-I nearly said that a lot of fingers had to be pulled out, but I do not intend any criticism-much speedy work had to be done to draft the amendments and new clauses, and it might be necessary to table the odd technical amendment on Report, but nothing of substance will be required.
<P>
The group of new clauses and amendments do four things. There is a slight problem because the numbers of the new clauses are similar to the numbers of the clauses in the Bill, so for the avoidance of doubt and to help Hansard, I may have to repeat myself.
<P>
First, new clause 26 and new schedule 1 replace the old clause 29, which dealt with the state second pension calculation. Secondly, new schedule 1 introduces the state second pension top-up provisions for those people who are contracted out. That means that the calculation for those who are contracted in and those who are contracted out will be dealt with in one place. Thirdly, the group of new clauses and amendments amend some of the rebate provisions to enable the new rebate structure to be implemented. Finally, amendments Nos. 348 to 353 make a series of consequential amendments to other parts of the legislation.
<P>
On several occasions, we have discussed how the state second pension will boost the additional pension of low and moderate earners. In addition, I have assured the Committee that, for those who are contracted out, this extra help will apply not only in stage 1 of the state second pension but in stage 2-the so-called flat-rate stage.
<P>
During previous discussions, the Committee had not had the benefit of seeing the legislation through which we intend to achieve those objectives. However, the Committee has now had that opportunity, so I am sure that everything is much clearer. We must consider in detail what the provisions mean for those who contract out of the state scheme. I should also like to take this opportunity to remind the Committee of what the state second pension will do more generally.
<P>
As I said during Question Time yesterday, the state second pension is intended to improve the state earnings-related pension scheme. SERPS has many strengths, but because it is purely earnings related, the lowest earners receive least from it. Therefore, it is possible for someone to spend a lifetime in low-paid work and not build up a sufficient pension from SERPS, together with the basic pension, to lift him or her above the minimum income guarantee level. That cannot be right, and our reforms are designed to ensure that that will not happen in future.
<P>
The state second pension has been designed to give much more help to the lowest earners: that is those who earn between the lower earnings level of approximately £3,400 a year and £9,500. They will all be treated as if they had earned £9,500 in that year for the purposes of the additional pension-the state second pension. Of course, there will be extra help for those who earn between £9,500 and £21,600-all those people will gain from these measures. However, it is the Government's intention to try to persuade moderate earners to move into funded schemes.
<P>
In addition, we recognise that many people have breaks from working due to periods of caring or disability. The state second pension will enable people to build up a decent second pension during such periods. The state scheme will generally be the right vehicle for low earners who do not have access to an occupational scheme because funded pensions are unlikely to be cost-efficient for them. Moderate earners will be encouraged to opt out of the state scheme and build up funded pensions.
<P>
Our proposals will ensure that people with private pension provision in stakeholder or other personal or occupational pension schemes will benefit from the extra help that the state second pension will bring. In practice, that means a real boost to the income in retirement of low and moderate earners in funded arrangements.
<P>
The extra help for members of personal pension schemes, including stakeholder schemes, will be delivered through a combination of extra rebates and a state scheme top-up. Rebates from national insurance contributions for the scheme will be enhanced to reflect the new three-part accrual in the state second pension. Everyone on earnings up to £21,600 will therefore benefit from higher rebates. People earning less than £9,500 will receive more than twice the help that they are currently given, as applies under the state second pension. Their rebate will double from a pension accrual rate of 20 per cent. to 40 per cent. In addition, low earners will receive a state second pension top-up payment to match the earnings boost to £9,500 that low earners in the state scheme will receive, payable from the state pension age. The rebates will be paid directly into people's pension arrangements, providing an immediate boost to savings.
<P>
Equal support is provided for people in occupational schemes, but in a slightly different way. For low and moderate earners in such schemes, the extra help will be delivered entirely through an extended state second pension top-up, payable at pension age. We are committed to supporting occupational pension provision, which is nearly always the best choice for employees. Generally speaking, if employees have the opportunity to join an occupational pension scheme, they will be well advised to do so. That is general advice; one cannot be specific, because there will always be odd individuals for whom such schemes are not appropriate, but the majority of people should get into an occupational pension scheme if they have the chance to do so. We do not want people to think that the state second pension is a better option, so, to protect them, a top-up will apply to earnings of up to £21,600.
<P>
The state second pension top-up payment will do two things for low earners in occupational schemes. First, because their rebate will remain unchanged, it will deliver the difference between the 20 per cent. rebate on their actual earnings and the 40 per cent. accrual rate in the state second pension. Secondly, it will pay the full 40 per cent. accrual on the boost between their actual earnings of, say, £6,000, and £9,500-so £3,500 would be the boost in such a case. For moderate earners, the top-up payment will reflect the extra help given in the state second pension, with the payment tapering away on earnings of between £9,500 and £21,600. That approach minimises disruption to employers, who would otherwise have to redesign their occupational schemes. It also means that employees will not have to make difficult decisions on whether they are better off in the state or occupational schemes.
<P>
Such help will continue to be given even when the state second pension becomes flat rate in stage 2. It will avoid the creation of perverse incentives for low earners to rejoin the state scheme, and ensure that moderate earners have an earnings-related incentive to save for their retirement in funded pensions. As well as providing a boost to individual savings, it ensures that there is no disruption for employers. That was a particular concern of the pensions industry, and we have responded positively to it.
<P>
Overall, we are investing an additional £400 million in extra rebates from the outset of the reforms. That will rise to an extra £4.5 billion in 2010. The long-term state second pension benefit costs, including the top-up, will increase by a net figure of some £6.2 billion a year in 2050, which is radically increased help for people on below average earnings. We have discussed some of the net costs in previous debates.
<P>
Part III of new schedule l sets out how the top-up provisions will work, and refers to three separate amounts: A, B and C. As I said, if the theory is simple, it is a question of putting it into practical legislation. Amount A is the amount of earnings related state second pension an individual would receive if they had not contracted out. Amount B is the amount of the pension represented by the contracted out rebate. The difference between the two is amount C, which is the state second pension top up for the year. That is added to the other amounts for each year of the working life, whether contracted in or out, and divided first by the number of years between 1978-the start of SERPS-and the year before the state pension age and then by 52 to find the weekly amount.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is an integral part of a computerised state second pension calculation and does not require employers to provide any additional information in order to calculate the amount due. The whole calculation is made by a computer, automatically, at the press of a button. [Laughter] I said that with a straight face. It would not be possible to do these calculations manually because of the numbers involved. It is dependent on IT-or on the legacy of the previous Government buying NIRS2. [HON. MEMBERS: ``Oh.''] I apologise for that, it was below the belt.
<P>
New schedule 1 deals with the calculation of the state second pension, including top ups. Rebates are dealt with under new clause 28, not the original clause 28 in the Bill. The new clause amends the Pension Schemes Act 1993 to enable a different rebate structure to be implemented using secondary legislation. I should add that the Government Actuary is due to begin the next rebate review later this year. He will issue a consultation paper setting out the assumptions for future levels of rebate, including certain factors that underline the rebate. Orders setting out the level of the new rebates under state second pension will be laid before April 2001 and will be effective from April 2002. Those orders are dealt with under the affirmative procedure of the House, so there is scope for further debate in both Houses over the level of the rebates adopted. There can be no discussion of the level of rebates in the Committee as we do not know what they will be.
<P>
People who are contracted out will benefit from the extra help that the reforms will bring in both the first and the second stage of the state second pension. No one will be worse off if they contract out of the scheme, which means there are no hard decisions for individuals to make. There is also no disruption to employers and no additional burdens placed on them. This group of amendments proves beyond doubt our commitment to boosting the income in retirement of all low and moderate earners whether they be contracted in or contracted out.
<P>
Amendment (a) to new schedule 1 is grouped with these amendments, and I am sure that Opposition Members will want to speak to it. We are surprised that it was tabled, as it is an attempt to reopen earlier discussions on part years for the state second pension, which we have already debated and voted on. There can be no part years. I recall that debate and it is a difficult issue. I repeat what I have said previously, low earners, carers and long-term disabled people must satisfy the conditions for the whole of the year in order to qualify for the state second pension. Not only would it be wrong to give someone who met the qualifying conditions for a short period the same pension as someone who met them for a whole year, but it is technically impossible. So leaving aside the policy aspects, operationally it cannot be done. The state second pension operates on an annual basis, and to take account of part years would involve moving to a weekly calculation. That beggars belief and is not possible. [Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is being too unkind to the Liberal Democrats. We would be happy to consider any suggestions as to how to calculate pension accruals on a weekly basis, but we do not believe that it is possible. It does not happen anywhere.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am about to sit down.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar. He has not gone to call the Liberal Democrat-controlled local council to account, but to a longstanding engagement.
<P>
As the Minister of State said, the concept is simple but the content is complex. It mirrors and reinforces the complexity of the original suggestion, which shoots a large hole through the Government's much-vaunted commitment-if they are to be believed-to simplify the pensions system. I am glad that computers understand what is going on, because it is too difficult for normal human beings. We did not table amendments because we wanted to hear what the Government had to say. I shall respond broadly to the Minister's comments, but we may decide, on reflection, to return to the detail.
<P>
A hugely complex system is being made more complex. It has been described as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a nightmare of complexity even by the standards of pensions regulations
<P>
</UL></FONT>and, although I listened with care to the Minister, who was reasonable enough to speak slowly, I have to agree. If someone is contracted out through a personal pension, the Government's rebate structure mirrors the humpback approach to accrual rates that we debated earlier. Earnings that are below the lower earnings threshold are topped up because the rebates are based on actual earnings, but in the case of a state second pension, the assumption is that a person has earned up to the lower earnings threshold even if he or she has not. If someone is above the lower earnings threshold and has a personal pension, the rebates will offset the benefits of the state second pension, so there is no top up.
<P>
The Minister focused on occupational pensions. There is broad agreement that they are often the most generous, but the trend is away from occupational pensions. I am not convinced that the Bill will reinforce an employer's determination to reintroduce an occupational pension or establish a new occupational pension scheme. For people who are in an occupational pension, the rebate structure remains that of SERPS, as the Minister said, but if they are below the lower earnings threshold, they get an extra top up, not just because the notional earnings are higher than actual earnings, but because the 40 per cent. accrual rate that applies to S2P is higher than the 20 per cent. rebate rate. Finally, people who are in occupational pensions but above the lower earnings threshold receive a bit of a rebate. That makes up the difference between S2P, for which the average accrual rate will remain high despite falling to 10 per cent. on marginal earnings above the lower earnings threshold, and the 20 per cent. accrual rate implied by the rebate. That would be simple if anyone could understand it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): Will my hon. Friend go more slowly so that we might follow her.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> There is huge pressure to get through the final clauses, but I understand my hon. Friend's problems with the hugely complex matters, which are difficult to understand. If we had not already grasped the complexity of the system, we now have an idea of it.
<P>
There is a question about where the line is drawn between the use of rebates and the use of top-ups to offset the impact of the state second pension. The proposed dividing line is drawn between occupational and personal pensions, sacrificing the level playing field between personal, occupational and stakeholder pensions. During consultation, the Government found that maintaining the level playing field would be complex, producing excessive administrative burdens. Although we have discussed the matter, our concern is less with maintaining that than with where the Government have chosen to draw the line. Organisations such as the Association of British Insurers have made their concerns clear. I would be grateful if the Minister set out the Government's views.
<P>
If one accepts the Government's overall structure, the need for top-ups, rather than deeper rebates, for defined benefit schemes is understandable, given the problems with getting the advantages of the rebates to filter through to lower-paid scheme members. Defined benefit schemes tend to be occupational schemes.
<P>
The reason why the rebate approach is not also applied to money purchase or defined contribution occupational schemes is less clear. The line should be drawn not between occupational and personal pensions, but between defined benefits and money purchase schemes. I shall not introduce another set of initials to confuse us further; I am sure that everyone understands the short forms for the schemes. We shall call them ``defined benefit'' and ``money purchase''.
<P>
The danger of the Government's approach is that personal pensions might seem more attractive than occupational money purchase schemes because of the deeper rebates. In theory, state second pension top-ups should take care of the matter. However, for obvious reasons, we have discovered over the past few years that individuals might not be impressed by the idea of the Government providing a little more jam in 30 or 40 years' time and that they might not trust them to do so. The Minister's figure of £6 billion by 2050 is a sign of increased Government spending and, when it is divided by the expected number of pensioners, of how little jam there might be.
<P>
The proposals will probably add to providers' costs; we must consider the problems of stakeholder providers and the 1 per cent. limit. Many insurers have moved out of salary-related defined benefit schemes in recent years and focused on money purchase schemes. Like personal pensions, money purchase schemes can run off the same systems. The Government's proposals will require systems to be reinvented to account for the fact that two sets of money purchase schemes will operate under different contracting-out regimes.
<P>
The Minister says that that will have no effect on employers providing occupational pensions schemes, but providers of other schemes will run into big increases in costs. The ABI commented in its submission to the Department in January that it did not know the source of the costings, but that they appeared to be low; that seems axiomatic.
<P>
The Department fears that, were there to be different regimes for occupational pension schemes, schemes could be established to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. It is not clear whether the proposal involves a bigger risk than the current arrangements, but the Department of Social Security should be aware of the dangers. It should be especially aware given the complexity of pensions and the ingenuity of people in the industry to develop products to meet the much-feared tax breaks referred to in the Government's press release about concurrency for stakeholders.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If we are trying to encourage people to take out pensions, we should make it as easy as possible for them to do so. That includes ensuring that people can use the maximum amount of money that they are legally allowed to invest tax free. Adding another layer of complexity merely allows providers to create products that will slide through the barriers. The Minister explained how the rebates would work and referred to the incentives built into the scheme. Interestingly, he referred almost entirely to occupational pension schemes and ignored other types of scheme, including the Government's stakeholder pensions. As he said, the stakeholder pension is geared to the market about which he spoke: the low and moderate earners. He will recall the Opposition saying during our debate on clause 29 that once the Government move to stage 2 of the state second pension, they will be forcing people into stakeholder schemes. The way in which the rebates will operate suggests that people could face a difficult decision between moving out of the state second pension and into stakeholder arrangements.
<P>
In stage 1 of the state second pension, rebates are actuarially neutral and there is no particular reason to contract out, as the right hon. Gentleman made perfectly clear-indeed, the point is quite understandable given his overall policy. At stage 2, however, the rebates and top-ups will continue to mimic stage 1 for people whose earnings exceed the lower earnings threshold. At that stage, the rebates will become incentives. Apart from the avoidance of disruption of the two-stage change for pension providers, a desire to incentivise people into contracting out is the only possible reason for keeping the top-ups and extra rebates. It appears, however, that the Government will be unwilling to steer people on the merits of contracting out until stage 2 is reached.
<P>
What is curious about that approach is that stage 2 is supposed to arise only when stakeholders have become established. It is, however, at that point that the Government will start to provide incentives and a generic statement on which individuals would have an interest in contracting out. I can understand the Government's difficulties with regard to accusations of mis-selling pensions, but the problem remains. People will not be able to make a decision, and some people could find that, because of the rebates system, staying in the flat rate of the state second pension may be better in the long run than moving into the stakeholder pension or into any form of private provision. The right hon. Gentleman's comments seemed to relate entirely to occupational pensions. He defined benefit schemes, but that did not read across to defined purchase schemes. Will he comment on that point?
<P>
The actuarially neutral rebates, which reflect the stakeholder charging cap, present a further problem. As I said, the rebates do not reflect the cost of advice, but advice will be necessary. As the ABI has pointed out and as we have all agreed, the system will be too complex and people will look to the Government or to a third party for advice. However, the Government are not likely to give advice until too late. If they want to give advice earlier, it would be useful to know, because the matter informs the whole debate about the second stage of S2P. However, the cost of a third party giving advice is not covered by the rebates. That will leave people with a real problem when the Government decide to introduce stage 2. I merely issue a friendly word of advice. People may make the wrong decisions and, when they come to retire, discover that they have not followed the best advice, because the Government did not provide it and there was no mechanism for helping people, especially stakeholders, to make a complex decision.
<P>
New schedule 1 provides that people will be eligible for a state second pension top-up if they are in employment with a contracted out pension for each week of the tax year-I think the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) referred to that. That measure does not help people who switch in and out of employment. We have mentioned that problem in relation to pensions, and the whole system of credits is devised to help low earners who switch in and out of employment. Indeed, people whose earnings are either side of the £9,500 break often switch in and out of employment. I do not necessarily support the hon. Gentleman's approach but the Government should consider how they can most effectively help that group with something less than the blockbuster approach.
<P>
The reference to the deceased spouse in paragraph (2) of new schedule 4A, inserted by new schedule 1, caught my eye, then the penny dropped. We have not discussed the transferability of the state second pension between husband and wife as we have discussed that matter in relation to the state earnings-related pension. I remember discussing that at length when we considered the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999. [Interruption.] The Minister says, from a sedentary position, that it is the same as for SERPS, but SERPS may change. It should change, but the Government have put a hold on the change. I want an assurance from the right hon. Gentleman that the issue of S2P will be covered.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I can answer the hon. Lady now because I have a little note on that. The hon. Lady asked whether surviving spouses would be able to inherit the state second pension as they can inherit SERPS. The answer is yes, the state second pension will be inheritable under the same rules as those that apply to SERPS. It is true that some changes will be made to SERPS, but whatever arrangements are made for inheriting SERPS will also apply to the state second pension.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that assurance. On another technical point, will that provision be introduced by regulations made under the Bill? Will a report be published? How will it be dealt with?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I could be wrong, but if I am I shall correct my remarks. The state second pension is legally an additional pension. It is the same as SERPS, so the definition covers both. One of the reasons why I referred back to 1978 was because that is when the additional pension started.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful for that clarification because it means that we do not have to consider the matter in detail.
<P>
I want to throw in one other issue, to which we may return later. Despite equality legislation, women tend to be lower earners than men. If, as is usually the case, the woman is widowed, she will have a state second pension in her own right-for the sake of argument, let us say that it will be £9,500-and half, or the full amount, of her husband's state second pension. However, if the man outlives his wife he will-I am sorry, Mr. O'Brien, I am thinking out loud. I am wondering whether there will be a difference between what a widower and a widow would receive of the two state second pensions. There will be no difference if the Government maintain 100 per cent. SERPS. If they revert to 50 per cent., there will be a difference between what a widower and a widow could expect to inherit under the state second pension scheme. Have the Government taken account of that in their consideration of what to do about inherited SERPS?
<P>
I have made just as a complicated a speech as the Minister of State, but I hope that I have made some of our concerns clear. I am sure that other hon. Members will try to tease out from the right hon. Gentleman some of the other difficulties, but I suspect that we shall probably want to return to the matter later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I thank the Minister of State for introducing the new clauses so clearly. I shall go one stage further, and through the Minister, thank his officials for the additional notes that they produced. I was sitting in a slightly darkened room a week ago, trying to get my head around these matters, and I found those notes helpful. My questions result from my reading of those notes, other material that the pension industry has produced about the new clauses and its general consideration of the contracting arrangements. Some of my questions follow on from what was said by the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait).
<P>
I start with inheritance rights, which the Minister of State has comprehensively dealt with. My question is specifically about the explanatory notes, to check whether I am wrong-as, indeed, I should be. The explanatory notes state that the new provisions are the same as those used under SERPS for those widowed from 6 April 1999 onwards. I thought that the date in everyone's mind was 2000, so I put a question mark on it and hope that the Minister can tell us whether 6 April is to do with something else. As the provision deals with all additional pension arrangements-whether SERPS, second state pension or other additional pension-the same rules should apply.
<P>
I shall speak to amendment (a), which stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. George), to explain why we seem to have returned to that question, despite the fact that the Minister has already given the Government's reasons for not supporting it. However, in an earlier exchange on the original version of the new schedule, I spoke about the number of people who would, as a result of the reforms, probably become dependent on the minimum income guarantee.
<P>
On 10 February, at column 466, I cited a figure of one in four people, and the Minister rightly queried that figure and asked where I found it. This seems a good time to put on the record the source of that figure. It was given in a written answer given to my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) by the Under-Secretary. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On the basis of existing policies, estimates suggest that 1 in 3 (3.5 million) pensioners . . . could rely on Income Support. Even if no behavioural changes are assumed, our proposals in our new insurance contract for pensions will mean that these estimates are reduced to approximately 1 in 4 (2.5 million) pensioners receiving income from the Minimum Income Guarantee in 2050.-[Official Report, 27 January 1999; Vol. 324, c. 286W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, I accept that another written answer might have contained different figures, because the one I have quoted is rather old.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Material on contracting-out options, especially the second option, questions whether, because of the extent to which the Government rely on top ups, they will achieve their stated strategic objective-the Minister has set this out clearly-of moving from a 60:40 split to a 40:60 between state and private responsibilities for providing pensions. Will the split be achievable by 2050? If not, what will be the split between state and private liabilities?
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham said that the rebate structure is strictly neutral, but the Government's desired aim of sending a powerful signal to people to move out of the state sector into private provision has raised concerns about that neutrality. The Minister of State referred to the benefits of moving into occupational pensions. He suggested that people should not look a gift horse in the mouth-if one is available, go for it. However, because the structure is neutral, it might not be sufficiently strong to encourage contracting out. Why do the Government believe that the signal will be powerful enough to achieve their strategic goal?
<P>
It is possible that the second option will create anomalies. For example, a low-paid employee who joins a scheme at the same time as a higher paid employee will get a state top up that his colleague does not. If their length of service is the same and they retire on the same earnings, the first will get a state top up as well as a company pension, but his colleague, who is part of a salary related scheme, will get the basic company pension and no top up. The boost at the beginning leads to inequity at the end. The Minister should debunk that anomaly.
<P>
Much of what I have read reveals the hellish complexity of the current system of contracting out, which includes salary related schemes, money purchase schemes and personal pensions. The Government are proposing to add three bands to calculate entitlement to accruals in contracting-out payments and top ups. They are making a complicated system more complicated. The Minister said that it has to be complicated to achieve the Government's principles, but those complications raise questions about the quality and quantity of advice that will be provided by the Benefits Agency and independent financial advisers.
<P>
We should consider what support, advice and training independent financial advisers receive to ensure that they are competent to give advice to people who have to make the important decision whether to stay in the state second pension scheme or to opt out into another arrangement. The Committee discussed the matter last Thursday, but will the Minister say a bit more about it now? The advice and information burden appears to fall largely on the individual, who must go out into the market to talk to independent financial advisers. However, concerns about the level of sophistication, education and awareness among the bulk of the population must be addressed before the measures are introduced. I am not certain whether people will avail themselves of the advice and support of financial advisers unless changes are made.
<P>
An administrative cost will be incurred, especially in respect of stakeholder pensions, and it has a clear ceiling. It has been stated that it is possible to make a 1 per cent. charge, albeit with the proviso that the provision of advice can be charged for separately. I am trying to flag up our concern about people spending large sums of money, relative to their incomes, to secure advice on difficult decisions. Will the Minister explain the role of the agency and his Department in providing the minimum floor of basic advice necessary to enable people to make judgments for themselves? The complexity of the decisions means that people require much more simple, plain and understandable information to help them through the difficult choices that they will have to make.
<P>
The Government have not gone for option one of the two contracting-out proposals, but I should like to ask about an element that might find its way into option two. Option one proposed that people on lower earnings with deferred pensions are evaluated in line with S2P, rather than with prices, which are the current basis for evaluation. As I understand it, that approach would mean that the state second pension entitlement forgone by people who contract out of salary related occupational pensions but leave their companies early will exceed their deferred rights. I am sure that the matter is dealt with in the detail, and I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I have not properly absorbed it. I do not understand, however, whether the potential downside of a forgone state second pension accumulating at a greater rate than preserved rights rolls into the second option. If it does not, will the Minister explain why? If it does, will he explain why it is not a problem? Finally, if it is a problem, what can be done to make people aware of it?
<P>
The Minister was right to say that proposed amendment (a) to new schedule 1 attempts to express once more a concern to which we shall probably not return on Report, but it seeks also to clarify the new schedule. The explanatory notes to part IV of the new schedule tell us that paragraph 9 provides for regulations to be made calculating the amount of any state second pension in a year for those cases not covered by parts II or III. It goes on to say that, in the main, those would be cases in which the pensions entitlement changed during the course of the year. That final point made me think that, although our earlier suggestion of a weekly calculation mechanism was perhaps not appropriate and our argument was not forceful enough, the proposal expressed the kernel of a concern shared by the Government.
<P>
We are anxious about people caring for part of the year and not receiving credit for that period. We do not propose that somebody should obtain a full year's credit for a part-year's caring. One of the Government's concerns about our original amendment was that that would be its consequence. Nothing could be further from the truth, and it was not our intention to cause such a problem. We are asking the Government merely to consider the matter. The new schedule, which gives the Government power to make regulations, appears to enable them to address our concern without accepting the amendment. Is our understanding of part IV of the new schedule correct? Could a Government use the regulating-making power to give effect to a mechanism to recognise part-year caring and to give a part-year credit?
<P>
We have neatly avoided using the formula, apart from amounts A, B and C, which are much easier to follow than QEFs, UELs, LETs and other phrases.

<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> A joy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) ably took us through them a few weeks ago. I hope that the Minister will address the concerns brought to my attention. That would help to clarify the way in which the scheme will work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I shall not detain the Committee for long because, despite those who have observed that only a fool can talk at length on a subject, the extent to which one can speak intelligently is proportionate to one's understanding.
<P>
You might recall, Mr. O'Brien, that when we discussed some of the algebraic constructions to which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred, I was scathing of their complexity and suggested that even a labrador might master them. I might have been wrong. I was convinced when I listened to the Minister that, despite his lucidity, I would not have understood a word had I not had the benefit of his letter to members of the Committee of 21 February and the useful enclosure to which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred.
<P>
However, even getting through the lucid explanatory notes was a trial. It is easy to sit in the Library and to read a couple of pages of the brief, only to discover that one is thinking about something else having forgotten what one read, and that one must study the passage two or three times. The Committee has had much else to consider since 21 February and we had to come to the necessarily complex subject late.
<P>
I am therefore glad that Conservative Members do not need to speak to amendments; I am not sure that I am capable of framing any. I am virtually certain that any amendment that I might introduce would be no less complex than the new schedule; it might be more complex.
<P>
I wish that we could espouse a principle for making matters transparent for legislators and the general public. They clearly are not. The new schedule will undoubtedly make an already complex issue more complex, but the Bill would be longer and more complex even if we tried to reduce the overall complexity. It would be better not to go on at length about that; rather, we should ask whether the Government are right.
<P>
I am not convinced that they have got the proposal right because the top-up and rebate regime that the Minister described has been applied on the basis of different pensions. I am unsure whether that distinction is correct. A great limitation of my mathematical education was that halfway through my O-level-about two years into a three-year course-traditional maths was discarded and a new syllabus called modern maths was adopted. One of the few benefits of modern maths was the introduction of Venn diagrams, and a Venn diagram would assist the Committee in its current deliberations. I have drawn one for my own benefit to help understand the issue, and I shall describe it to the Committee.
<P>
The Venn diagram has two sets. Into one set I have placed occupational pensions and into the other I have put money purchase pensions. Personal pensions are a subset of money purchase pensions because I am not aware of any personal pension that would provide a defined benefit salary. Therefore, there are two sets but there is an overlap in the middle that represents those money purchase pensions that are occupational schemes. However, the new clause creates a distinction-an important distinction because it determines the rebate or top-up-between occupational schemes and personal schemes. I do not see any difference in principle between an occupational scheme that is a money purchase scheme and a personal pension, which is inevitably a money purchase scheme.
<P>
I need to think about that a little more, but I should be interested to hear the Minister explain why the regime of rebates and top-ups has been applied to those categories, namely occupational versus personal pensions, rather than to defined benefits versus money purchase pensions. I hope that there is a plausible theory behind that, rather than it merely being a matter of administrative convenience. If administrative convenience has led to that distinction rather than to what I would describe as the proper distinction, I am sure that it will lead to all sorts of distortions in the market, which we shall later live to regret.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): I, too, would like to hear the Minister explain why the dividing line has been drawn where it has, but I shall not repeat what my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West just said. I shall be brief. In fact, I shall not speak for more than a minute or two.
<P>
The complexity with which we are wrestling at the moment is a product of the fact that the whole new state second pension design is complex. If it had been simple, the Bill could have been simple. I remember that, at the start of the Committee, hon. Members said how useful it would have been-this is no one's fault, it is just the system we have-to have had the opportunity to study the whole pensions industry, including how it works, what pensions provide and what they are expected to provide, before passing legislation on it. I do not know what the Modernisation of the House of Commons Select Committee is up to, but I hope that it or another Committee will make some proposals to enable Select Committees to study proposed legislation before it goes to the Floor of the House.
<P>
We are not dealing with matters that can easily be changed. By their very nature, pensions extend over a long period of time and are extremely important to people. What concerns me is not only that we might do or say the wrong things, as we probably have done, but that when people come to decide between one type of pension scheme and another, or whether to stay contracted in or to contract out, they will have a very difficult decision to make. I am pretty certain that only a few people will understand what they are being asked to decide, and that they will struggle to understand the detail. They will not know whether their decision is right in the long term, because of what may happen between the decision being made and reaching pensionable age. We must find a way to make those decisions as simple as we can. It may be too late to do that in the Bill, but we must find a way to advise those who do not spend their nights and days studying pensions, so that they can make the right decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> On that last point, I cannot resist a jibe. What the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) said does not ring true, given that his party is about to announce a policy that would make the basic state pension voluntary and would then leave people on their own. As I understand it, the idea is to cast people adrift on a voluntary scheme-they should not bother with the basic state pension, and should stand on their own two feet. That would make matters even worse.
<P>
As well as not agreeing with taxes, it seems that the Conservative party does not agree with pensions or benefits. It does not make sense, matters would be even more complex if people were cast adrift without the basic pension. I assume that the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, like all Opposition Members, speaks for his party. That certainly was the assumption that people made about Labour Members when we were in opposition.
<P>
I shall deal with the issues that have been raised, and I shall stick to my notes-as ever, I am grateful for that back up. We do not have all the answers, but we have thought about many of the issues that have been raised and I hope that I shall be able to explain our reasoning.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham asked about the extra costs to providers. We are not really sure about that. As I have said, the Government are putting additional money into personal pension schemes through the extra rebates. The pension providers will not have to change their systems. Occupational schemes will not have to do anything extra; we do not understand why they should allege that costs should increase. The Association of British Insurers, in its comments on the extra costs referred to option one, the contracting out option, which we rejected. Our choice may have been a surprise to the industry-perhaps all its word processors are now producing the wrong brief-but we do not understand why.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham also mentioned the treatment of deferred contributions in occupational pension schemes. The argument is that money purchase schemes should attract the same rebates as personal pensions. We took the conscious decision to treat rebates to occupational schemes in the same way. We have the history of the past few years on our side. If incentives are great enough, schemes will switch their method of contracting out to gain financial advantage without necessarily passing on that advantage in the form increased benefits for their members.
<P>
We know what has happened in the past few years. When age-related rebates were introduced in 1997, almost 800 salary-related pension schemes opted to contract out on a money purchase basis. Not all those schemes were guilty of manipulating the system, but a great many were. As a result, we changed the rebates from April 1999 to remove that incentive. That happened because of poor decision making by our predecessors, and we do not want to fall into that trap. Occupational pension schemes will be treated equally to ensure that perverse incentives do not creep back into the system. It is a seductive argument, but we should learn the lessons of the past.
<P>
Our aim is to encourage individuals to join or remain in funded arrangements. We have made no secret of the fact that the proposal is a combination of additional rebates and state top ups. The result is extra money for pensions. It will make all funded arrangements more attractive, especially in stage 2. There is an incentive, so we do not accept the criticism. It is the outcome that matters. A few formulae and lots of pages and words might look complicated, but I want people to build up pension benefits and rights over their working lives-I almost said in pounds, shillings and pence. [Interruption.] I thought that would strike a cord. We must keep that consideration uppermost. Legislation must be right, but we must also keep our eye on the ball, which in this case is the outcome for individuals.
<P>
I think that that answer meets some of the concerns about complexity. I know that the Bill looks complicated, but any legislation with a formula looks complicated to Members of Parliament and journalists who probably do not understand anything with numbers except their expense accounts. The theory is simple; the difficulty is translating it so that it can become part of a computer programme and is judge-proof. The law must be the same for everyone-it must be the law of the land-and that involves complex drafting. It is our responsibility to get it right. I do not accept that the state second pension and SERPS are complex. Translating them and writing the manual to get from A to B may seem complex to people who are not interested, but the outcome is a simple concept.
<P>
The hon. Lady talked about providing incentives in stage 2 for people to move into contracted-out schemes. We intend to encourage people to provide for themselves through funded policies where possible, which brings me to the point made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. We want to shift expenditure on pension provision from 60 per cent. state, 40 per cent private to 60 per cent. private, 40 per cent. state. Top ups are designed to remove awkward choices. We want it to be self-evident which way people should jump. That should not be complicated by discussions about the size of the rebate and the type of pension scheme. Stakeholder and state second pensions are part of a total pension package, but for the purposes of legislation, they have to be dealt with in isolation.
<P>
The hon. Lady said that there would be no incentive to contract out in stage 1. I cannot say how long stage 1 will last, and we have already debated that issue, but the hon. Lady has got the argument the wrong way round. Currently, personal pension schemes do not offer good value for people on moderate earnings. Frankly, there would not be billions of people without any second pension provision if those schemes offered good value and had been marketed properly, because they passed many people by on the other side of the road. Schemes are not currently available for people to contract into, which is why stakeholder schemes are being set up.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I must choose my words carefully because the state second pension and SERPS are legally defined as additional pensions. However, the inherited additional pension is additional to any pension in a person's own right-I referred to spouses in my previous answer to the hon. Lady-up to a prescribed amount, currently £125 a week, which is the maximum amount of SERPS. By the time the state second pension is introduced, the new bereavement benefits will be in place and, therefore, widows and widowers will be treated exactly the same. There will be no question of people being treated unfairly. The state second pension and SERPS are individual and will not be treated like income support. Therefore, if there is a right to pass on all or part of the pension, that right will exist irrespective of the other person's income-and quite right too.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam raised an issue about 1999 and 2000. I am sorry but I neglected to bring with me a copy of the notes that I sent to hon. Members this morning, and I know that I had been provided with an answer to that question. The reference in the Bill is not to the inheritance of SERPS but to how the amount is calculated, because the number of years will be taken into account in the calculation. That change took effect from April 1999, the same year in which the change from the best 20 years to a full working life was also introduced.
<P>
On the issue of the proportions into MIG, the hon. Gentleman quoted from some parliamentary questions tabled in January last year, which my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle) was responsible for answering, although I suspect that it would be unfair to ask her to repeat the answers. On the basis that there are no changes, one in three pensioners would retire on to MIG in 2050. With S2P, the figure will fall to one in four. We have used the one in five figure overall to account for all the pension changes. Obviously, one in three, one in four and one in five of 10 million to 15 million pensioners is a lot of people. The SP2 alone will create an increase from one in three to one in four, and the rest of the pension package will make the figure one in five. That is one in five of a much larger number of people than at present.
<P>
Under both contracting out options, we are on course to achieve the 60:40 split to which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred. The hon. Gentleman also asked about the complexity of the scheme. We do not want SP2 to create any disincentive to contract out of the state scheme at any level of earnings. I was quite taken with the example he gave of two people who started work on the same day, but that is one of the experiences of life. I had wrongly assumed that everyone starts off in life as a low earner. That was when we had a debate about lords of the manor and being born with a silver spoon in one's mouth.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I do not remember that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> We did indeed. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar and I were vying with each other about our working class credentials.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That is the point that I was making. I was not saying that we should eschew the complexity, which may be necessary to deliver particular outcomes. I was asking about the quality, affordability and reliability of the information being supplied to people in the circumstances that I described, and the choices that they will make as a consequence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> As I said last week, by the time the decisions are made and the individuals in the two examples can be compared, they will have their annual pension forecast. I am not suggesting that that will solve the problem, but it will avoid the difficulties and set up a new series of questions. Indeed, it will make a major contribution in that respect.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked about revaluation for early leavers under option two. The top-ups will take care of the difference in the revaluation methods used for people in defined benefit schemes. Low-paid early leavers will not be worse off and occupational schemes will not have to change under the option that we have chosen. I have not gone into great detail about both options, but have stuck to the one that we have chosen, which was an easier way of explaining the provisions.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about part-year carers. In theory, it is possible to introduce part-year provision for carers, but in reality it is operationally impossible. Once the low earner is above the lower earnings level, he will be on the £9,500 threshold. We cannot be certain about the rest of the year. In theory, we could set the earnings out on a weekly basis, but, as I have told the hon. Gentleman, we must forget about that proposal, which does not even begin to be a runner operationally.
<P>
I was pleased that the hon. Member for Beckenham said that the Opposition would return to the matter later. As that is so, I shall conclude my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I have suddenly come to the realisation that I am not a clever man. [Hon. Members: ``Oh.''] No. I am having a mid-life crisis after almost l7 years in Parliament. I have been trying to understand what the Minister has been saying and to concentrate on his remarks at least occasionally, which is more than a lot of Committee members have tried to do. I have also tried to concentrate on the questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham. The Minister and my hon. Friend are dedicated and skilful parliamentarians and have done their best. Indeed, the Minister's response was a tour de force. There is, however, something worrying about our procedure if it means that we impose on people legislation that is so complex that they are incapable of understanding it. [Interruption.] I hear muttering on the Labour Benches. Perhaps I have said the wrong thing, and people will understand the Bill. We have been considering it for several weeks, and I hope that we are people of moderate intelligence and assiduity. If we cannot understand it, how will the people? I shall leave that point aside.
<P>
I understand the Minister's point. He is saying that we should keep our eye on the outcome, which is important. Further, the present system does not work and we want to get more people into funded schemes. The process for achieving that is bound to be complex. The Minister asks us to trust him or, rather, the computer-it will work out on the night.
<P>
When one is trying to do something worthwhile in politics, one should have a big idea that people understand, such as the creation of the welfare state, the national health service, or the basic state pension, introduced by Lloyd George and built up in the 1940s. Will people look back on the debates and say that the Minister created something dynamic and important? I am not sure that they will. People's understanding and commitment to the new system, and the commitment of successive Governments, will be undermined by the complexity of the process and the mix of the private and public sectors, with a range of pension vehicles in both.
<P>
What I have heard after two or three weeks of debates on pensions convinces me that what I said at the beginning was right. The pension vehicle devised by other nations is more satisfactory. It is not fashionable to mention Chile this week, but the Select Committee studied the vehicle devised there, which has been copied by other nations. That vehicle requires people of all income streams to put a proportion of their salary into a funded system. I accept what the Minister said-it might be necessary to top up the personal funded pensions of those on lower incomes to make them worth while. We would not be having the debate if personal pensions were suited to people on lower incomes. On a low or intermittent income, one cannot sustain the contributions that would make it worthwhile opting out of the state system.
<P>
If the Government are committed to the concept of rebates and top-ups, I do not understand for the life of me why we do not take one more step and say that we shall create an exciting system. The Minister attempted to answer that point two or three weeks ago. We cannot do that for existing pensioners or for those approaching retirement. I am not suggesting that everybody should be forced into the private sector; rather, everybody should be forced into a simple single funded system, starting with younger people. If they do not have sufficient confidence in the private sector, I am happy for them to opt for the state to run their scheme, so long as it is funded, personal to them, they get a report every year and it is not raided for other purposes.
<P>
Privatising everything is unfashionable; I understand people's concern with forcing everything into the private sector, and am not suggesting doing that. We should do away with the differences between stakeholder pensions, second state pensions, occupational pensions and private pensions, and have a single system. I am not an actuary or a pensions expert and my idea might be so simple that it could not happen. However, despite what I have heard today, I am still convinced that simple ideas work, make an impression and create a better society. Someone who had a poor year or who took a few years to start contributing would receive the extra benefit of the state second pension, whereas someone earning a lot more in the same years of his life would not. The result would depend on the way in which benefits were built up through a person's working life. That is bound to be the case, and I do not see how it could be otherwise. Comparisons such as those made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will always be made, as slightly different outcomes will always be reached. The outcomes applying to a particular person will depend on the way in which his or her pension has been built up during his or her working life. Differences will arise because of variations in earning power and because people were not earning the same on day one or year one, and were therefore unable to accrue the necessary benefits. I hope that the Minister will forgive me, but he has not convinced me that the system that he has devised is the best system nor that it will last.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy with my hon. Friend's views. I would hate to think that the state was able to organise a funded pension; the money would probably be invested in gilts, and we would then suffer from the state's misselling of pensions. People in the public sector are not the most alive to best investment potential.
<P>
The Minister of State should be rather more careful in what he says about potential Conservative party policy statements, because he could find himself dealing with a situation similar to the sale of council houses. I imagine that, when we first came up with that idea, the right hon. Gentleman derided it; but he is now completely convinced of its merits. We shall set that debate aside. I suggest that he holds his horses and waits to see what we suggest. In the long run, he may find himself defending our suggestions.
<P>
I share the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), as does the Minister of State. We have said time and again that the Committee format in which Bills are debated does not provide the best way to deal with such complicated matters. I am grateful to the Minister and to you, Mr. O'Brien, and your co-Chairmen, for allowing us to have what amounts to a clause stand part debate on those changes. We were happy to acquiesce in that decision. Our message about how to organise the Committee stage is that we need a more effective way to debate such complex changes, perhaps using modern technology to explain what is meant.
<P>
We all agree that it is a hugely complex matter and that, however skilled we may be in rhetoric and the other parliamentary arts, conveying such ideas is difficult. The Government may have come to power saying that they would simplify pensions, but the Bill's provisions on pensions and stakeholders have subverted their big idea. I am sure that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam would agree that stakeholder pensions are just another product, but that complexity is now built into the state system.
<P>
The Minister was kind enough to comment on the various points raised by my hon. Friends and myself, many of which give us pause for thought. For instance, he spoke of a residual argument about the extra cost to providers and about an incentive against the state, which I want to consider further. On that basis, I give notice that we shall return to the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Member for Beckenham said that the Committee may not be the best place to deal with some aspects of the Bill. However, I suggest that it will be even more difficult and inappropriate to deal with some aspects of the Bill on Report. I strongly commend the Special Committee route that we have used to scrutinise draft Bills. We would then have the opportunity to exchange views and to make a report. The Select Committee proceedings gave us that sort of opportunity for part of the Bill, but not for the pensions provisions, which would have been useful. Perhaps that process will be rolled out for other Bills.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough referred to simple ideas, and we shall wait to see whether the trip to New York brings forward simple ideas. Some simple ideas can have awful consequences. If, as the Minister of State says, we are more interested in the outcome than complexity, I would be concerned that simple ideas might lead to the further erosion or even the removal of the basic state pension, small foundation though it is.
<P>
As our amendment is part of this group it cannot be withdrawn. However, I hear what the Minister has to say. I hope he will forgive us if we continue to examine the issue, try to achieve something that is workable and take it up again with the Department.

<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I do not think that the question with which I ended requires a great deal of new technology procedures for an answer. It struck me as a very simple question. I believe that I have read the new clause correctly although I think it would be excusable if I had not and were mistaken, but let us suppose that two persons in similar circumstances enjoy the protection of two very similar money purchase pension schemes, one of whom has a different regime vis-à-vis top-ups and rebates from the other on the basis that his scheme is a personal pension scheme whereas that of the other individual is an occupational scheme. I do not understand why that level of complexity is introduced into the system and I am not sure that I have had a satisfactory answer.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>

<H4><center>REVALUATION OF EARNINGS FACTORS</center></H4>

<P>
(b) since such other date (whether earlier or later) as he may determine;

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government new clause 36-modification of earnings factors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The two clauses make some technical and practical changes to SERPS that are beneficial. I shall deal first with new clause 27. Each year an earnings revaluation order is laid. It serves two main purposes. First, it revalues to present-day terms an individual's earnings on which SERPS entitlements have built up. This ensures that awards of SERPS when a person reaches state pension age reflect present-day earnings levels rather than those that prevailed over the person's past working life. Secondly, the order performs a similar function in respect of any entitlements built up in a contracted-out salary-related scheme between 6 April 1978 and 5 April 1997. This was the broad equivalent of SERPS, known as the guaranteed minimum pension, or GMP. GMPs have to be worked out not just for those who reach state pension age but also when a person leaves a scheme early.
<P>
The figures for the revaluation order come from the December earnings data. We are in the hands of the Office for National Statistics for these figures. In a good year, they can be available from around mid-March. In a bad year, they may not be available until May or even later. Pension schemes need the revaluation figures by 6 April each year and we have to deal with their inquiries whether we have the new numbers or not. We have been asked, therefore, if we can make them available earlier.
<P>
Our proposal is to use the September earnings figures rather than the December ones from next year, 2001. This amendment gives us the flexibility to do that. We will still use the same earnings index, looking at the change over a full year. We will still publish a statutory instrument each year: we will just base it on an earlier month-September, rather than December. That way, the figures should be available in time for the new tax year and pension schemes will not spend their time in February and March faxing and phoning the Department to ask for information we do not yet have.
<P>
New clause 36 is a technical measure to correct an oversight in previous legislation. Its objective is to make sure that SERPS pension calculations can carry on as they are at present. People who have earnings in a single tax year from both contracted-out employment and from contracted-in employment need to have an adjustment made to their SERPS calculations because the contracted out employment does not count towards SERPS. This amendment allows us to continue to make this part-year adjustment, as we do at the moment.
<P>
This should have been a consequential amendment to the Pensions Act 1995 but it was missed at the time. Among other things, that Act changed the calculation of SERPS from 6 April 2000-a point that I referred to earlier. The regulations that dealt with part-years, however, were not changed. This amendment allows us to bring them up to date and to maintain the status quo. I hope the Committee will accept the two new clauses.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The Council of the European Union-which is sometimes like a red rag to a bull-adopted Council directive 98/49/EC on 29 June 1998. Its purpose is to safeguard the occupational pension rights of employed and self-employed workers who move within the European Community and thereby promote the free movement of workers. Occupational pension schemes in the UK already operate within the spirit of that directive, but there is nothing in our existing legislation that places an obligation on schemes to comply with two specific requirements in the directive.
<P>
The purpose of the new clause is twofold. First, it will prevent occupational pension schemes from having scheme rules that allow the accrued pension entitlement of members or beneficiaries to be altered because the member or beneficiary wants payment to be made anywhere outside of the UK. Secondly, the new clause will allow UK workers who work outside the UK to continue membership of their employer's UK occupational pension scheme. Any such scheme members, and the sponsoring employer, will be able to continue to make contributions to the scheme, subject only to the limitations imposed by the Inland Revenue.
<P>
The new clause will ensure that the rights of workers who belong to UK occupational pension schemes will be protected. Members of occupational pension schemes will have the same level of protection whether they live in another EU member state or anywhere else in the world. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will accept this new clause.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I understand what the Government are trying to do. I have always thought that the single market was a good idea, so anything that enables people to move around within the EU has also got to be a help.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> And out of it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> And out of it, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West says. Indeed, this clause goes wider than just the EU, but it stems from an EU directive. So in order to build up the flexibility that people want, to be able to travel and work throughout the world as we become a global economy, anything to help in that direction has got to be useful. Part of the original drive towards the single market was to be able to liberalise investment. Pension plans throughout the EU are of totally different types and characters and some are more controlled and some are less controlled. Given our propensity in this country for gold-plating of EU directives, I just want to ensure that any changes that come in the expected draft directive on investment cannot be slipped through in the UK under this particular clause. It is still a very live debate within the EU as to how pension provision is made throughout the Community.
<P>
In Germany, for instance, there are very restrictive conditions on how a pension plan can be invested: a certain percentage within the EU, a certain percentage in different areas. That is something that we in the UK would find very difficult to accept. The same applies in Holland. The only thing that matters is the best return possible for pensioners from any legal investment.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
France has developed a different way of funding pensions-some through the insurance companies. Both France and Germany have a very large state pension system. There are, quite rightly, moves to change that approach to a system that the UK would find more congenial. Indeed, it would be of huge benefit to this country and to the City of London experts in developing investment, insurance and pension policies. They also know how to manage money in a way that other parts of the EU are only just beginning to learn as they liberalise their economies and move more of their basic industries out into the private sector-some of them faster than others.
<P>
I am seeking the Minister's assurance that nothing in the new clause will in any way tie the Government's hands in negotiation to try to get a pension system that is acceptable to the EU but which will not leave us on the back foot and unable to continue the liberal investment regime that has been of such benefit to British pensioners and has provided a wall of investment money in the private sector.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Perhaps I can answer that question before the pit bull terriers behind the hon. Lady start to have a good go. There is nothing in the new clause that would in any way allow anything to be slipped through in the EU investment directive. It is in its very early days: it is up for discussion. It is not in any way connected with the content of this new clause.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I accept the right hon. Gentleman's assurance. I am glad that we have got it on the record, and we shall bear it in mind when we discuss any liberalisation of the investment policy of pension schemes in the EU.

<B>The Chairman:</B> It is at the bottom of page 694.
<P>
<B>Burstow:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
The new clause was tabled by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Mackinlay), who is not a Committee member. It would add to the Bill a provision for annual reporting on service pensions, war pensions and war widows' pensions.
<P>
The Government have adopted a general approach of forecasting annual pensions. The new clause would add another element to that commitment, specifying that beneficiaries of such pensions know how they work. I shall not speak to new clause 21, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Beckenham. However, war pensions and war widows pensions cause many people great anxiety.
<P>
The more that we make the operation of systems open, transparent and readily understood, the better. My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives and I added our names to the amendment some weeks ago because we felt that an annual reporting service on pensions would be a useful addition. Will the Minister explain how the Government could progress the idea?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> We added our names to new clause 4 because we believe that an annual report to Parliament on the war widows pension is sensible. Indeed, a general concern about war widows led us to table new clause 21. We shall be delighted if the Government reassure us that progress will be made on both matters. If we make no more progress than we have done in previous debates, we may wish to return to the matter later.
<P>
New clause 4 could be accepted more or less instantly under the provisions for the annual statement. That would be preferable to submitting a weighty tome to Parliament. It would be a simple matter for the War Pensions Agency to produce an annual pension statement for war widows and service widows in the same way as the Contributions Agency does for other recipients of pensions. We would be delighted if the Minister of State reassured us that that would happen. Indeed, we would acclaim such a decision. I would be saddened if war widows and others covered by the new clause did not receive the courtesy given to other pensioners in this country. If, by chance, the Government have overlooked this particular group, I am sure that the Minister of State will assure us that the same provision will be made for them and we need have no worries.
<P>
I am more concerned about the fate of war widows since 1973. The issue was debated quite recently by Baroness Strange, who fought a doughty fight in another place on behalf of these ladies and their families. It is incumbent on us to continue the battle, and we are delighted to do so.
<P>
I do not need to declare an interest but, as I have told the Committee before, I am the daughter of a war widow. She is now 87, so is unaffected by the amendment. I have great sympathy for the younger widows, who often have young families. The wives of some of the younger men killed in wars may be pregnant. Those mothers are left to bring up the family alone, which is a big struggle for them. Only about 2,600 people are involved, but regional conflicts often break out nowadays, so we never know when that number will, unfortunately, increase. I would be surprised if there are no additions over the coming years. However small our forces, they are always at the forefront of battles. They are superb fighting forces and are recognised as such. Whenever invited to take part in conflicts, British forces are only too willing to go, but the inevitable and invariable consequence is that some people will be left behind who will find life extraordinarily difficult.
<P>
I am advised by the War Widows Association of Great Britain that very few widows remarry. Although there are only around 2,600 widows in that predicament, one of the Government's concerns is the read across to other groups. If pensions are provided for war widows, the Government may have to make the same provision for the police service, the fire brigade and others. According to the association, over the past five years there have been 138 widows of men serving in the forces, but only 28 police widows and 13 for the fire brigade. It is a tragedy for anyone who has to face that situation, but those figures provide an index of the scale of the problem. I understand that the in service gratuities provided for the police and the fire brigade are different from those for the military. The read across cannot be said to be on an equal basis.
<P>
Many of us who have debated the issue for a long time know that there have been many reports, and that Governments of all complexions usually state that they will wait for reports to be published before taking action. That applied to the 1995 report. The Conservative Government said that they would wait for that report before taking action: I confess that we took no action. The present Government-and the Minister of State-are saying the same thing: they are awaiting a report, which is due this summer. It would be a great step forward if the Minister gave us an assurance that the Government will implement the report's recommendations. The War Widows Association believes that, whatever the report may say, as every previous report has recommended pensions, there can be no argument against them just because another five years have passed.
<P>
It would be much appreciated if the right hon. Gentleman could give this group of widows, for whom I know he has great sympathy, some hope. Perhaps we could make progress in the knowledge that the Government were committed to help that small group of people who have been identified as those who need most help. If the Minister of State could satisfy us about that, I should be happy to withdraw the motion.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Thurrock, who is not a member of the Committee, is interesting. We can often be cynical about proposals suggesting annual reports. We can sometimes be even more cynical about Governments who make that suggestion because it can be considered as a device simply to brush away a difficult issue. When faced by a particularly difficult issue, we feel good because we can say, ``We have managed to get a report every year''. Few people read such reports. Do they achieve a great deal?
<P>
A useful purpose might be served in this case. I do not know who drafted the new clause, but it is laid out rather well. It would serve the purpose of putting the Government on the spot. I do not say that nastily; the Government cannot be accused of behaving any better or worse than any other Government towards war widows, who form such a tiny group that they have become the forgotten people. There are some wonderful people who sit in Parliament, such as Baroness Strange, who take up the cudgels on behalf of that group, but it does not figure largely in our debates.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Perhaps this is an oversight, for which I apologise, but we should commend the work done by Michael Colvin, who was a doughty fighter on behalf of war widows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is a great pleasure to pay tribute to Michael Colvin, whom we all miss. He is an example of a wonderful Member of Parliament who had no great regard for his own career but took up causes, especially in defence matters, with great skill and persistence. He was a gentleman in every sense of the word, and we miss him very much. We recognise the work that he did for war widows.
<P>
Such work does not sway general elections or win vast numbers of votes. As full-scale wars become increasingly remote it is not a subject that affects many people's lives, but it does have a devastating effect on the lives of the few people involved. That is why I draw the Minister's attention to the new clause. I want him to be conscious of the fact that it would serve a useful purpose. What sort of debate would it generate every year? We would have to consider the number of people in receipt of such pensions, which would be a useful exercise. We would have to make
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an assessment of whether the payments made during the year in respect of those pensions have been sufficient to prevent their recipients suffering any unnecessary hardship.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I see no harm in forcing the Government to consider that matter. lt is not good enough for them to say that they have fulfilled their obligations by increasing the pension by whatever amount. Such matters must be looked at objectively rather than just financially.
<P>
The new clause asks us to consider whether recipients really have suffered unnecessary hardship and then to consider what plans, if any, the Government have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to improve the well-being of those recipients, whether by means of changes to the level of payments made in respect of those pensions or otherwise.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is where an annual report becomes more of a think piece. It forces the Government to realise that they cannot just decide that they have fulfilled our obligations and obeyed the rules; they must think every year about how they could improve the system and the well-being of recipients.
<P>
Lastly, and this is why the new clause is particularly good, it asks the Government to consider the representations made to them by organisations or individuals and to consult them when they prepare these reports. Given the relatively simple issues and low numbers involved and all the resources that are available to the Government, I cannot believe that this will impose any undue burden or hardship on them. Will it? After all, this small group of people have paid an appalling price. Given all the other things that are done in government, is it too much to ask that every year we produce a report in which we try to think through whether we have fulfilled our obligations to them? I hope that, even if the Government cannot accept the new clause today, they will consider it and table an amendment on Report. They would receive nothing but credit if they did. Both sides of the House would applaud the Minister if he came back on Report to accept the amendment or something like it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I suppose the criticism that outsiders watching our proceedings might make of the new clause is that it delivers nothing to alleviate the problem faced by war widows and those in receipt of war pensions. It does not give them anything to improve the quality of their lives, but merely produces a report. But I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough that the report itself provides a powerful tool to drive reform. I draw the Committee's attention particularly to paragraph (b) which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an assessment of whether the payments made during the year in respect of those pensions have been sufficient to prevent their recipients suffering any unnecessary hardship.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I know that my hon. Friend quoted that paragraph. It is worth repeating because the production of that information will itself provide the moral imperative for reform.
<P>
I speak with some experience of these matters. I sit as a board member of a regimental benevolent fund. I am staggered at the modesty of the claims that are made on our funds for trivial sums every year. They bear real testimony to the inadequacy of people's pension. They do not come with some trifling concern. All the cases that come before our benevolent fund have been rigorously inspected by SSAFA and other agencies. That people who have made such sacrifices should have to come to a charitable organisation over such trifling sums for such heartrending purposes is an indictment of the system that we have implemented. An annual report on that subject would be a powerful tool for reform.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> First, may I reiterate and support the remarks that have been made about Michael Colvin. I know that, as a long-standing Member of Parliament, he was dedicated to this subject. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock. I hope that it will be an object lesson to my hon. Friends that they do not have to be members of a Committee to get a debate going. [Laughter.] It is not a criticism. It is a good example of a Member using the rules-we do not have many of them. Obviously, someone has to move an amendment if the Member who tabled it is not present in Committee. However, hon. Members do not have to feel cut out of a Bill if they want an issue raised.
<P>
I may be putting myself in the hot seat by saying this, but if I were a Back Bencher, I would go for it. As a Minister, I shall, of course, explain why we should not proceed down that road. I shall give good reasons and hope to take the Committee with me. However, I have considerable sympathy with the issue, which has been raised many times in the House of Commons. It may be difficult to win more money or form new policy, but one has to use the levers and hooks in this place to secure change. The requirement on Governments to produce information annually offers an important lever for change. Looking at the annunciator, I am reminded of Westminster Hall, which allows an additional 200 Back-Bench debates a year in this place. That is a powerful and important weapon in holding the Government to account.
<P>
I shall deal with the substance of new clause 4. I shall not nit pick the details, but some of its provisions are wholly impractical and it is important for me to explain why, in case my argument does not satisfy hon. Members and they wish to examine it again. The issue raised by the new clause gets more sophisticated as it goes along. It has been raised on more than one occasion already-by Lord Alf Morris in 1998 and by others since. We can all agree that the provision for war pensioners should be accountable.
<P>
I shall detail some of the existing provisions, not as an excuse for failing to make changes, but because it is important to put them on the record. Comprehensive reports on service and war pensions are already presented to Parliament each year in accordance with statutory requirements. Details of armed forces pensions, including ill-health and attributable injury benefits, are published in Orders in Council for the Royal Navy, in the Army Pensions Warrant and in the Queen's Regulations for the RAF. Those documents describe the rules of entitlement and record the levels at which pensions are set.
<P>
The war pensioners' report is laid before Parliament each year by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. It provides details of the war pensions scheme, including war pensions provisions, the number of war pensions in payment, supplementary allowances in payment, analysis by age and degree of disability of the war pensioner and reports on matters discussed at the Central Advisory Committee. The War Pensions Agency, which is affiliated to my Department, also publishes its annual report and accounts, which provides details of the administration of the pensions in terms of cost and performance.
<P>
For 2001, Departments will publish resource accounts, which will give current and past comparative details of programme expenditure, including the cost of principal benefits such as war pensions, and a statement on the armed forces pension scheme. None of those reports is available within a month of the end of the financial year, as suggested in the new clause. It takes time to close ledgers and to reconcile and balance the accounts before they can be prepared, externally audited and referred to the National Audit Office. When the Comptroller and Auditor General is satisfied with the accounts, they are printed, published and laid before the House. That must be completed within 10 months, but the War Pensions Agency normally achieves it within four months; it could not be done by the end of April as proposed in the new clause.
<P>
<H5>12.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The new clause refers to the need to ensure that ex-service people do not suffer any unnecessary hardship and to report plans to improve their well-being. Those terms are not defined, but we all know what they mean. It would appear that the term ``unnecessary hardship'' relates to the level of financial provision. The term ``well-being'' is taken to refer to broader welfare considerations.
<P>
The armed forces pension scheme compares favourably with other schemes. Retirement is at 55 years and pensions are increased annually in line with inflation. Benefits are greater than most other public service or similar pension schemes. The Government Actuary carries out a five-yearly evaluation. Immediate benefits are paid after 16 years' service. Attributable benefits are paid to service people injured as a result of their work. People may also qualify for a Department of Social Security war pension. War pensions are higher than comparable social security benefits. The maximum rates are much higher and can be supplemented by a range of allowances. War pensions are tax free. The war pension welfare service is available to disabled ex-service personnel and their widows to discuss benefits and provisions. The veterans unit in the Ministry of Defence puts ex-service personnel in touch with various organisations that can assist them. National health service priority treatment is available for conditions attributable to the war disablement injury.
<P>
It is proposed in the new clause that the Secretary of State should consider representations from ex-service pensioners and their organisations and undertake appropriate consultation. Ministers from the Ministry of Defence and the DSS meet people from the ex-service community and attend functions. We value those meetings and have every intention of continuing them. Long before I arrived at the DSS, discussions took place about whether the War Pensions Agency should be part of the MOD or the DSS. I attended last year's annual meeting with ex-service people on pensions and assure hon. Members that they did not want the War Pensions Agency transferred to the MOD.
<P>
The Central Advisory Committee on War Pensions-a statutory body, consisting of ex-service people, war pension committee chairmen and officials-meets Ministers twice a year and considers matters put to it for advice. Those matters are either in the public domain or legislative provisions exist for taking such actions. Even if no legislative provision exists-as with consultation, for example-we shall continue to take those actions.
<P>
A further report is unnecessary because it would not assist ex-service personnel or improve accountability. However, the current system may provide the totality of information from various organisations, but it does so at different times of the year and does not necessarily cover all the issues implied in the phrases used in the new clause. Therefore, I shall consider how to take such matters forward.
<P>
On the issue raised by the hon. Member for New Forest, West, there is no doubt that regimental associations and similar bodies do an enormous amount of good work. I expect that every Committee member has referred inquirers to SSAFA.
<P>
Over the years, some of those funds have accumulated enormous sums which, in my constituency experience, is not always directed at those for whom it is intended. About 20 years ago, I discovered that the war pensioners' fund of one regimental association was being used to fund the annual regimental dinner. We soon put a stop to that. That association never thought about using the fund to find potential recipients, so we changed that as well.
<P>
Not all the funds are perfect. We are dealing with people who may not want to apply for such funds. As the widow of one of my constituents told me before her husband died: ``Nothing comes into this house unless it is paid for.'' In other words, nothing was ordered unless it could be paid for. The association, however, told the couple that it would pay for their fuel-which, at the time, was coal-once they had received a bill. My constituent's widow was adamant that nothing came into the house unless it could be paid for. Eventually we persuaded her to order the coal, as payment could be guaranteed.
<P>
People of that generation have a certain attitude that we must take into account when examining such funds. The war pensions report is, to a certain extent, joined up, as the Secretaries of State for Social Security, for Health, for Scotland and for Wales share responsibility for it. However, we could examine how to extend and improve that and incorporate certain information, such as the rates of war pensions and allowances, expenditure, average weekly amounts and allowances, the average total of pensioners' income compared with that of the general population, and, when possible, future plans for war pensions and war pensioners.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> As usual, the Minister is treating the matter fairly. We do not argue with what he said about the generosity of service pensions and the number of reports being published. Indeed, he made fair points on both matters. However, does he accept that we are making a reasonable point on war widows? Would it not be possible to produce a simple comprehensible report dealing with them and their problems? Collating information on a range of reports is not helpful for that particular group. Will the Minister examine the matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> With respect, I am dealing with new clause 4 and wish to stick to that. Going down the byways on war widows is not helpful, as I want to tackle new clause 21.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> New clause 4 mentions war widows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I accept that. However, I am offering Committee members ideas for improving matters. We are open to consultation on how to improve a report in which the War Pensions Agency and the National Audit Office are involved but which, ultimately, is under ministerial control. 
<P>
The Secretary of State's war pensions report could be improved to incorporate much of the information sought by the new clause. We shall not only take action to change certain things; but are prepared to open up a dialogue on the issue so as to produce something that is better for the House and for those outside. I am not excluding anything, and wish to be as positive as possible. Indeed, it may be possible for the report to deal specifically with war widows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's positive assurance. The Minister referred to the joined-up nature of the report on which his Department leads, and he mentioned the Department of Health. While that does not go to the heart of well-being as he and other hon. Members might understand it-it probably should be seen as a broader term than that-health is undoubtedly an important part of a person's well-being. Could he talk to his colleagues at either an official or ministerial level about the possible inclusion of some sections, maybe based on surveys of issues affecting people's health and well-being, in such a report?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> We shall certainly consider that suggestion. I should just like to pick up on a couple of points that were raised about pension forecasts. In the Ministry of Defence pension schemes, forecasts are available on request. War pensions are a different matter. They are awarded only as a result of injury or death as a result of service, so they are not quite the same as pensions accrued over a working life. The armed forces pensions are based on codes for ranks and length of service and are published annually. Pension forecasts are not relevant in that sense.
<P>
Having been positive with the Committee, I turn to negative mode. New clause 21 concerns an issue that was raised on Report of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 and I dealt with it on the Floor of the House on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence. We are dealing with a social security Bill here. Currently-I will not repeat the whole story-service widows' pensions cease on remarriage but the pension for dependent children continues. The matter was fully debated in both Houses last year and around four months ago I told the House that this important matter was being considered concurrently in the context of a major review of the armed forces pension scheme. We said that it would not be wise to do individual parts of the scheme in isolation, as it would prejudice the review.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence is expecting to report on this work during the summer and full public consultation will follow when hon. Members and the House as a whole can have an input. I have no idea about the timetable of the rest of the Bill. I have no idea whether we will have anything more positive to say on Report. I cannot define summer, but I hope that it is before the summer recess as that is how I would define the parliamentary summer. It is not a matter for which I or my colleagues at the DSS are responsible, it is a matter for the Ministry of Defence. Having run the horse around the course, I hope that the hon. Member will withdraw new clause 21 and take my comments on new clause 4 in the wholly positive spirit in which they were intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's helpful response. He has persuaded me that the Government are listening and, if they will not engage with us on this point, I hope that they will engage with others outside the Committee. On that basis I would be prepared to withdraw the new clause but I cannot, as other hon. Members may wish to press it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Like the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, I was encouraged by what the Minister said about new clause 4. I am glad that it has focused the Government's attention on the provision of information and the dialogue. The Minister gave me the impression that he will now have a think about how that information can be collated, and come forward with some proposals. On the grounds that he can make some proposals by Report, I would be prepared to withdraw the new clause.
<P>
I am glad to hear that the report is expected by the parliamentary summer. Let us hope that, unlike other Government proposals, it is stuck to and that the summer is still the summer and not the autumn or the winter. It is not on the right hon. Gentleman's watch and so perhaps I and others will look to the MOD to confirm that. Thereafter consultation will take place. I hope that it will be meaningful consultation and that the war widows-
