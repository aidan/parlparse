four and five are talking about where the negotiations go now, and that
question is addressed to anyone involved in the negotiations.
Obviously, you cannot talk about the details of the negotiations, but
do you think that constructive negotiations are proceeding, following
the introduction of the Bill? Is it possible to engage in constructive
negotiations? Do legal or strike action, or threats of strike action,
add to the process of potentially coming to a resolution or do they
detract from it? How do you see things going from here?<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000015">&#160;</a>

agreement. As matters develop—I think that they will develop
quite rapidly—we will be in a position to make judgments about

union, as a matter of policy—as part of its DNA—would
want to exhaust all forms of negotiation before we considered
industrial action. That is exactly the position we are in. We are in
the discussions with the Cabinet Office at the moment, and we are
seeking to make progress on those. We will make a decision and a
recommendation to our members based on the quality of the output of
those negotiations. We should bear in mind that we have been there
before. We were one of the unions that came to an agreement with the
previous Government. So industrial action will be considered in the

that we have achieved in the negotiations and at what we recommend to

up perfectly when he said it is a blunt instrument in the debate last

process. From our perspective, particularly as a union that reached an

the negotiations that are taking place just now did so with no strings
attached and no blunt instrument that is acting as a threat if those
negotiations do not produce an outcome that the Government find
acceptable. As Charlie says, in 15 years of dealing with negotiations
in the civil service—I am not as old as Charlie—I have
never seen a tactic like this, and it is not particularly helpful from
our perspective, as a union trying to reach

the Public and Commercial Services Union, although I happened to be a
witness in the case. The Council of Civil Service Unions currently has
legal advice from leading counsel, and we are seeking further
clarification from him in time for a meeting that we have next week.
But we certainly have a view that there is an argument to be made about
accrued rights, which picks up the point that I think was developed in
your session this morning about the Human Rights Act 1998, and the
right to hold property, wages being deemed to be property, and about
case law, which demonstrates that pensions are property. In the
particular context of the civil service compensation scheme and its
statutory basis, an argument flows through from that that provides
protection. It is certainly an argument that is coherent. It is equally
an argument that has never been fully tested in either the UK courts,
other than during the judicial review process, and certainly has not
been to Europe.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000027">&#160;</a>

think of the threshold. What actually determines low pay in your mind?

protection? Again, I would be very interested in your views on that

                           </em> The union that has the highest proportion
of low-paid people is the PCS, so you may want to ask some of those
detailed questions to them. One of the concerns that we have is not
just about the lower paid—I will deliberately use the words
“lower paid”, rather than “lowest paid”.
Evidence, I think, was given this morning that about 50% of civil
servants earn less than £22,000 a year, which gives you a
flavour. But the Bill has a particular and fairly crude impact on
long-serving staff, many of whom can be lower paid. We have many
examples of people who have been administrative officers in the civil
service for 40 years who would be very much affected by that. The Bill
would have an immediate impact on anyone who has probably got more than
14 years’ service, whether they are earning £20,000 a
year or £40,000 a
year.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000029">&#160;</a>

of the low pay, Prospect has a significant number of members who are
low paid and, I have to say, highly-qualified low-paid people; for
example, curators in museums are highly qualified, highly skilled and
low paid. In terms of what we tried to do in our negotiations with the
previous Labour Government, we would come up with a formula that
effectively meant that anybody below around £20,000 could still
earn up to three years

                           </div>compensation as part of the compensation scheme. But that would taper
out to those people to around £30,000 on a very slow basis on
the way through. Our view was, in a balance of judgments—I fully
accept the balance of judgments of any two unions may be different on
these matters—that, together with the protection that we had
negotiated for those within 10 years of retirement, that meant that for
most people on lower pay we had given the right level of protection as
a balance in an overall package. So that was, if you like, what we
sought to do.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000030">&#160;</a>

the figure of £22,000, in terms of the average of pay in the
civil service, is an interesting one. We had a look at pay figures from
1997 to 2008 and private sector pay went up by 55%, public sector pay
by 54% and the civil service by 45%. So you are not looking at a part
of the population that has had a huge largesse in recent years in terms
of pay awards.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000031">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is interesting that you say that, because of
course we heard evidence this morning from a different group of
witnesses suggesting that, in fact, there had been, if you take average
incomes across the private and public sector, quite substantial
relative increases in the public sector versus the private sector.
Indeed, if you look at average weekly earnings in the private and
public sector, there is now a discrepancy in favour of the public
sector. What we are trying to understand is the whole compensation
compact, which to me includes hourly earnings, pensions and, indeed,
redundancy pay, and make sure that we have something that is fair and
equable across the whole of the work force, whether public or private
sector. I would be interested in your views on whether you feel that
does or does not exist

                           </em> In terms of any comparison between the public
and private sectors, you have to compare like for like. Part of the
problem when making those comparisons relates to the proportion of the
skilled work force that resides in the public sector, as opposed to the
general economy, because the general economy, by and large, does not
have the same level of people doing complex and highly skilled work as
the pubic sector. An awful lot of that is a product of previous
outsourcing and privatisation when, by and large, the low-hanging
fruit—the service work—was outsourced, so you cannot make
that comparison in a similar way. The point that I was trying to make
was that if you look back over the period from 1997 to 2008, you will
see that the pay growth in the civil service has lagged behind both the
public and private sectors.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000033">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In terms of
comparisons between the reward packages for civil servants on
redundancies, it is a highly complex issue. If you were to ask,
“Are the redundancy packages for civil servants overall more
generous than the rest of the economy?”, the answer is that they
are. However, the problem is that disentangling that is incredibly
complex.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In terms of
the legal issues surrounding how those packages have been arrived at
over many decades, being able to come to some form of agreement and
resolve some of those anomalies presents not only the employer with a
lot of problems, but the trade unions, frankly, with a lot of problems.
That is why the union that I represent was one of the five that made an
agreement with the previous Labour Government, notwithstanding the
legal advice that we received, which, by the way, was 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 39<a class="bkMark" name="Column39">&#160;</a>
                           </div>consistent with all the unions—we all knew exactly what legal
advice we had. It was the best compromise that we could arrive at
between bringing civil service redundancy terms into line with the rest
of the public sector and protecting the legal rights and entitlements
of our members. It is a more complex issue than simply a broad, crude
comparison.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000035">&#160;</a>

morning’s evidence session that, for FDA members at the more
senior end of the civil service, there is no comparison between terms
and pay, as was accepted by those giving evidence. Senior civil
servants, once they reach about £30,000 or £40,000, are
significantly behind the rest of the public sector, and even more
significantly behind the rest of the private sector, even when you take
account of pension provision. There is a very complex issue here is
relation to comparable pay if you are simply going to look at public
and private sectors, because you must also look at the civil service,
which is at the bottom of the public sector pay league. We must take
account of all those issues when considering what the deal is for civil
servants, as civil servants do when they choose what type of career

hon. Friend the Member for Devizes, can we just clarify with you all
that, when oral evidence was given on 27 July, the reasons given by the
PCS for not agreeing to the agreement put forward in the negotiations
with the previous Government was that the majority of its civil
servants earned less than £22,000 and that<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000042">&#160;</a>

point for us in the last negotiations was over the level of protection
there was to the lower paid in the Civil Service”?<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000240">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Evidence given by
either yourselves or your representatives from the same unions
confirmed that the deal on the table for those who earned less than
£20,000 was a retained three years’ pay. To quote the FDA
representative, I think that you felt that it was the right balance in
the agreement that everybody under £20,000 should retain pretty
much the terms that they had.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000043">&#160;</a>

in my mind is this. If the deal on the table for the lower-paid members
of your unions was pretty good and the people who would miss out were
predominantly the better-paid members, why did the largest union, which
represents predominantly the lower-paid and has the largest number of
them, turn down the deal? Can you explain to the Committee what the
rationale was? Would you not agree that they have made a fundamental
mistake in letting down the union’s lower-paid
members?<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000044">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Can I answer that? I am not trying to duck your
immediate question, but in any complex package—I have been a
full-time officer of a trade union for 25 years and active
in the trade union movement for nearly 30, and I have never handled or
been involved in such a complex set of negotiations—a number of
different parameters come into play at the same time: legal, political
and timing. The agreements themselves were complex, covering a large
range of people.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What we did
as a union was to take the entire package—not just the bit for
the low-paid, but what we had negotiated as a complete agreement. We
took the complete offer that was on the table in the final session,
including the bit for the low-paid; Prospect does have low-paid
members. As a package, we recommended that. I would be slightly
reluctant to unpick bits of it, in reality, because that is the way
that we put the issue to our members. In response to the question put
directly by Tessa Jowell as to whether we would reopen discussions in
February on that basis, that really has to be my answer. If it is that
package, then yes, and it does include what you
describe.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000050">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> But you would surely recognise, would you not,
that the reason why this Government are introducing the Superannuation
Bill is precisely that the previous package was ultimately rejected, as
it happens, by the largest of the trade unions, and that reverting to
the previous package is therefore simply not a practical option?
Although you are obviously reluctant to separate out parts of the
package, can you confirm what Jonathan Baume of the FDA said? He said
specifically:<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000051">&#160;</a>

that statement says that what was on the table was attractive to the

Penman:</strong>
                           </em> As you are quoting my general secretary, the
point that we are making as a union that has very few low-paid
members—although we do have some—is that we were looking
to ensure that any package on the table in those negotiations was as
fair, broadly, as possible. As a trade union, we are not simply
interested in a narrow group of members, whether it is one particular
group of our members or across the whole. We recognise that any deal
was only going to be sustainable if it addressed a number of the
issues, and the issue about the lowest-paid was a particular one. We as
a union felt at the time that the balance was right in relation to the
deal in February. It provided value for the taxpayer in producing
£500 million worth of savings, addressed a number of age
discrimination issues and provided some protection for our members.
Inevitably, in a complex set of negotiations, you are looking at that
in its entirety. That is the judgment that we came to.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As we said,
you will have to ask PCS about the decision that it came to. As an
independent union it is free to make that decision. What I would
say—given the judicial review and the decision in relation to
it—is that it was open for this Government, in relation to the
compensation scheme, to put on the table a set of terms that would have
been more acceptable to my union and the unions that signed up to the
agreement in February. But they have chosen—to quote the
Minister again—the blunt instrument of the Bill that is going
through now: 12 months on compulsory redundancy and 15 months on
voluntary. I think that makes a deal more difficult, certainly for us
as unions that engage constructively and tried to reach agreement with
the previous Government. It makes it more difficult in relation to the
current negotiations. I don’t think that was an inevitable
result of the judicial review and the rejection of the PCS. I think
there were a number of options that could have been taken in relation
to the Superannuation
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000054">&#160;</a>

negotiations. The problem is that that is not on the table. What is on
the table, I have to repeat, is a very crude Bill that seeks to impose
arbitrary and draconian—if I can say it—caps on civil
service compensation payments. If introduced and implemented—and
we have to work on the basis that that is the Government’s
intention—those caps would have a dramatic impact on the
compensation received by our members, whether they are from PCS, FDA or
Prospect, in the current situation. There are a number of people here
this afternoon able to give evidence of what that impact would
be.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000057">&#160;</a>

organisations, so I have no power—nor do I seek it—to say
to you now what my members would or would not accept. We don’t
operate in that way, nor should we. We did a consultation exercise
based on the agreement we reached in February with our members. We
canvassed views extensively, and put out a significant amount of
literature explaining what we did. Yes, there were reservations, but
overall our members accepted the judgment we made, why we made it and

possibility of a judicial review, that the judicial review might be won

review. But we said, “Let’s take a look at what may
happen in the light of that and, therefore, balance the agreement that
we have arrived at, which we think was the right balance between the
different conflicting interests of our members.” They concurred
that our judgment was correct. I have nothing in front of me to date

Operation Banner and normalisation, at a time when significant
reductions were being made, he was offered £77,000, of which
£14,000 was the financial recognition award, the additional
payment on offer at the time. He was then asked if he would be one of
those who stayed on, to ensure continuity of service to the Ministry of

COI has announced that it is making 287 of its 750-odd posts redundant,
which amounts to just under a 40% cut in staff. I am a typical person
who will be affected, and I am, by no means, the only one who will be
affected by the cap. If the cap comes into play and I am compulsorily
made redundant in November, which is the timetable at the moment, I
will be worse off to the tune of just over £17,000. For me, that
is the difference between giving me another six to eight months
breathing space to find another job, which when I am in my 40s is
perhaps not the easiest thing to do. If I am voluntarily made
redundant, I will be worse off to the tune of an £8,500
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000077">&#160;</a>

ago, which was the relative pay in the public and private sectors. It

public and private sector pay. Can I invite our witnesses to elaborate

Cochrane:</strong>
                           </em> Perhaps I can start, although certainly my
colleagues who will be speaking later from the PCS can give a lot more
detail about the pay. It is a bit of a stereotype, but I think that
there is a lot of truth in it. Many people who join the civil service
join as a career, with the expectation of working in the civil service
for 40 years. When they joined, they knew that the pay was not very
good, but they thought that it had a reasonable pension and that it was
a secure job. Many of those civil servants are aware that there were
reasonable provisions in place to compensate them if they lost that
job. It is an old-fashioned phrase, but it is still very valid: it was
about loss of office. It goes back to the point that was being made by
one of your colleagues about the compact. That was the deal that people
bought into, and certainly their expectations about pay have been
proved correct over many, many
years.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
can demonstrate fairly conclusively that the civil service is the major
area of the public sector where the pay has been unreformed for as
along as I have been involved. We have just muddled on with constant
talks about pay reform in the civil service, but they never lead to
anything. We have yet another round of them going on now. The witnesses
this morning made a valid point about comparisons between the private
sector and the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 45<a class="bkMark" name="Column45">&#160;</a>
                           </div>public sector, but the comparison that we have to
make is with the specific of the civil service. Every bit of evidence
that we have got demonstrates that the civil service does badly on pay
at almost any level that we look at, from the most senior downwards.
The figure that was quoted by me and also by Dusty Amroliwala this
morning about 50% of the civil service earning less than £22,000
a year—bear in mind many of those work in major
conurbations—does demonstrate the scale of the problem. It can
also be borne out by data that can be produced from official statistics
about the levels of public sector pensions and so forth.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is also
worth making the point that, while the impression is given that people
are departing the civil service under a compensation scheme and are
getting five, six and seven times pay, when the question was
asked this morning, my colleagues on the management side
were unable to give any figures for that. The reality is that the
overwhelming bulk of people who have left the civil service in the last
three or four years are people in very junior grades in the Department
for Work and Pensions, the Office for National Statistics, Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the Ministry of Defence and so
forth. We are talking about very much lower levels of compensation,
borne out by Karen’s example. Looking at that whole context, it
is not an over-generous scheme at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000083">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Charlie perhaps covered some of them. It is
important to distinguish between public sector comparisons and civil
service comparisons. That point was raised earlier today in this
Committee and at interventions in the debate on Second Reading last
week as well. I do not think it was gotten across by those raising it,
because it was repeated time and again, so perhaps it needs to be
answered time and again that public sector is not civil service. The
effect of the Bill would see civil service redundancy terms far below
the rest of the public sector as well. Not only would median pay still
be £21,000 per annum, which is below public sector—that
is why it is important to distinguish them—but they would also
have a redundancy package that was worse as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is another point to make, and it is brought out not just by trade
unionists representing civil servants. Whenever there are debates about
pension provision—the Pensions Policy Institute is a well
regarded independent think-tank in this area—it always makes the
point about why it does not make much sense to compare overall headline
pay rates in the public sector with the private sector. Not only is
that not a civil service example, but it does not take into account the
types of jobs done there. If you control for level of qualification,
for example, as the Pensions Policy Institute does, you will see that
pay is not comparable between the public and private sector at all. Of
course, over years, if you contract out a lot of the lower paid jobs
from the public sector, that has the nice headline effect of increasing
average public sector pay, but it has not done anything to any one
individual’s pay within the public sector, so I think there are
perhaps a couple of reasons why those comparisons are not the best ones
to
make.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000086">&#160;</a>

question for the negotiators, although it is also relevant to all civil
servants. If you were here earlier, you would have heard from the civil
servant, who told the Committee what advice he would give to the
Government had they not changed, if the judicial review had gone
through as it did. His advice to the Labour party in government would
have been exactly the same, which is to go down this sort of route,
effectively, to remove the veto to any change. It is not good news to
be made redundant; there is no question about that. You cannot pretend
that that is good news in any
way.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000096">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
what other areas, other than looking at the overall package, would the
civil service unions look for things to be done? The example made by
the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington was a good one, looking at an
exceptional case where perhaps a person made a specific decision at the
request of the Government and where there should be some exceptions. I
have talked in the past about a constituent who happens to be in a
household with two civil servants, who approached me and asked whether
there was any way to ensure that we do not have both civil servants
made redundant in the same household by allowing someone who has been
made redundant to nominate someone else not to be made redundant. Is it
possible, for instance, to arrange for sabbaticals for people? In the
interest of trying to balance out different people, is it possible to
move

point about all that is that it is a very difficult situation. Nobody
would want to be in it. There may be things that can be done by being
flexible. I think that the example made by hon. Member for Birmingham,
Erdington was a good one, where there is a specific injustice, which
will happen in a number of cases, that should be dealt with as part of
the negotiations. Are they the sorts of things you think should be

                           </em> There are a number of responses to what is
quite a complicated question. Certainly, we have two more witnesses who
are part of the PCS delegation, who will be able to give you more
examples to follow on from the ones from Karen and the one from
Northern Ireland. They all demonstrate the same point: the longer your
service is, regardless of what you earn, the greater you are a victim
of the Bill if it goes
through.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000099">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have had a great deal of experience in the civil service over the last
three or four years, both on the management and trade union sides, in
dealing with redundancies. You will be aware that the size of the civil
service has declined by something like 86,000 to 90,000. Large numbers
of people have left the civil service. We have been quite successful in
trying to deal with that without recourse to many compulsory
redundancies, but by the use of a wide range of sophisticated
techniques, including some of the ideas that you have mentioned,
particularly looking at redeployment, giving people new skills and
running voluntary schemes where they work. We have done very well on
that, and I think we can continue to do well because the objective of
all of us is to try to avoid people being made compulsory redundant.
One of the significant tools in doing that is having good quality
voluntary redundancy schemes. That is one of the things that has helped
people go and helped them deal with the consequences, because many
civil servants have specific civil service skills and are in locations
where it is not easy to find other work. However, the changes under the
Bill do not help that process at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000100">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
morning, a question was asked of one of your other witnesses: could the
Government deal with the redundancies that we fear will come under the
present arrangements? I think my answer would be that it would be
difficult, but it can be done, because it is about managing. An
important point to be made is that voluntary redundancy is a very
valuable tool. At the end of the day, it is one that is under
management’s control. Management, provided it makes an equality
impact assessment, can determine who can go on a voluntary basis and
who cannot. That gives it the control to keep people with essential
skills and have some idea of costs. That is what we have been doing for
the past four or five years, and, in my view, we can continue doing
that. The Bill is not necessary to help with that process.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000101">&#160;</a>

Hudd:</strong>
                           </em> Can I deal with the specifics of the point that
you raised? Mr Dromey raised a specific example. It is unfortunate that
this Bill will have a devastating 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 48<a class="bkMark" name="Column48">&#160;</a>
                           </div>effect on some well-drawn plans for restructuring in
a number of Departments. Let me give you a small example. Ordnance
Survey is making technical changes and is switching the nature of its
work force. By the way, I used to be employed by that organisation, so
I declare an interest. It used to employ 2,000 surveyors in every major
town in the UK. Technology means that it needs fewer survey staff in
the future and more staff who use the data to create mapping and so on.
So it can see ahead a skill change within the organisation. It is a net
contributor to the Treasury, so it calls on no public funds in that
sense. It has a plan to redeploy its work force over the next three to
four years. The impact of this blunt Bill will set it a problem. Many
workers have been able to adjust to when they go, the terms on which
they go and what they do with their lives. So that organisation will go
through a very difficult transition period, which means that it will
either have to truncate that process or, as Charlie says, face
significant problems. That is not the only Department. A number of
other departments face the same situation as a consequence of the cuts
that were planned under the previous Labour regime. The sensitivity to
that will be lost completely if this Bill goes ahead. It will have a
major damaging effect on real business drivers on changing parts of the
civil service.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000102">&#160;</a>

Penman:</strong>
                           </em> I was interested in the discussions this
morning and in some of the questions that were asked of the witnesses.
There was almost an assumption that the civil service does not know
what it is doing with this, and here were some ideas to help it along.
I should like to pay testament to the work that civil
servants—particularly, but not exclusively, from the Cabinet
Office—and Charlie and the Council of Civil Service Unions have
done in managing a significant rundown in the work force. The
organisation has reduced its work force by more than 80,000, relocated
more than 20,000 jobs out of London in the past five years and done so
without having to resort to more than about 80 compulsory redundancies
through sophisticated management techniques, including the use of a
range of voluntary redundancy arrangements. The civil service does not
have one voluntary redundancy arrangement; it has a series of
arrangements that can get used at different times and are more or less
expensive depending on the circumstances. The civil service has been
excellent in meeting that significant challenge and doing it in
collaboration with the trade unions. It is a wonderful success story.
As has been indicated, if we end up with a blunt instrument of the Bill
that is going through, management will not have that sophisticated
mechanism for managing that
change.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000103">&#160;</a>

the junior staff who tend to find themselves made redundant first and
make up a large number of those who are given redundancy. Would you
agree that one of the points behind the cap in the Bill is to try and
get around that particular problem, because historically it is those
who are too expensive to let go who stay in their jobs, and it is those
who are last in with the fewest rights accrued who are let go first.

                        <p class="tabbed">Until
recently, I felt very proud of being a civil servant and the fact that
what I do is worth while, makes a difference and impacts on
people’s lives. We are committed to doing the best possible job
we can for other people, although the fact that we have reasonable
terms and conditions was a good element—I do not disagree with
that. Until recently, I quite happily thought I would be in my present
role until I retired. Even if I did not get promotion, I would be happy
to stay doing the job I love and that I felt was worth while. There are
so many people in our organisation and the wider civil service who feel
the same, but now they just feel as though they are being cast aside
and thrown away with little more than a backward
glance.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000117">&#160;</a>

civil servants across the board. We know what excellent work they do
and that goes without saying. We have been referring to the comparisons
on occasion between the private sector and the public sector, and we
heard that it was apples and pears and we should not be making that
comparison. Can I get some comments on the public perception? Given the
difficult times that the economy has been going through recently, the
private sector has taken a huge hit and a large number of companies
have been laying people off for months at a time or putting them on
three-day weeks. There has been a lot of pain. Do you believe that the
civil service understands that the pubic expect some shared
pain—if you like—unfortunate though it is? We have to
make the comparison, because the private sector has taken a big hit and
many of its workers have had to be laid off for several
months.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000118">&#160;</a>

time, they were in the public sector and they now find themselves

trying to do in the civil service, as Dave has said, and working our
socks off, jointly with management, to avoid redundancy, recognising

on Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West
Norwood raised the lack of information about the impact assessment of
the Bill, particularly on equalities and other matters, with which I
concur. What assessment have you undertaken of the impact of the Bill,
particularly on equalities issues and how it will damage
people’s lives? We have had individual submissions, to which we
referred at length today, which relate to the “compact”,
as it has been described. People have planned their careers and their
lives around the compact—the balance between pay and the
security of compensation arrangements on redundancy and the
pension—but the Bill will tear up that compact. As we have seen
in the individual statements, it will severely damage the lives of your
members.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000125">&#160;</a>

comments, in terms of whether the Bill has helped or hindered, it has
hindered. I have no doubt that it is an unnecessary diversion. It is a
threat and many of our members feel it very deeply. I think Karen is
testimony to that, but she is only an example of many thousands of
civil servants who feel similarly let down by the Government as an
employer.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000126">&#160;</a>

economic pressures. I know there is a view that we may not have gone as
far in dealing with those economic pressures as we might have, but
there are complexities around the legal standing of civil servants in
these particular terms that constrain all the negotiations. However, we
responded by coming up with a package that would have saved £500
million, so I believe in that sense we acted in a way that was fair not
only to our members but to society at

Walsh:</strong>
                           </em> Bearing in mind the time, I will try to be
very brief. Obviously, the equality impact assessment with the Bill
was, let us be fair, practically non-existent, and it covered over
quite a few issues that are very important to our
members.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000129">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
aspect is age discrimination. You could say that there is age
discrimination in the terms of the Bill itself, and you could also say
that it fails to deal with the age discriminatory aspects of the
existing terms, which the February agreement did deal with. So, for
example, if a civil servant is made redundant at age 35 with five
years’ service, they will get compensation of five
months’ pay. If they had the same service, job, grade and
experience but were 40 instead, their compensation would be double
that. That was something that the February agreement would have dealt
with. It would have removed the discrimination. Obviously, the terms of
the Bill do not deal with it and could, arguably, introduce further age
discrimination.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also a particular impact on part-time workers. The existing terms as
they stand allow for recognition of the impact on people who have
recently gone part-time. For example, if a female civil servant has
recently gone part-time in order to look after children, which is not
uncommon, and is made redundant, the admittedly complicated formula of
the current terms would allow for some of their full-time pay to be
taken into account on the basis of recognising that they would
eventually probably go back to full-time earning. They are not losing a
part-time job; they are losing a part-time job that may revert to
full-time hours once the child is of school age. This blunt Bill does
not do anything about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
existing terms may give someone three times earnings, but that is
reduced down to one. The effect would be far higher on part-time
workers. Obviously, part-time workers are more proportionately women.
There is a direct impact on part-time workers and an indirect impact on
female civil servants, and the fact that that was not drawn out in the
equality impact assessment is somewhat bewildering. Those are just two
examples—I do not have time to go through
others.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000132">&#160;</a>

feeling among members, as you can probably imagine, it is quite an
uncomfortable time to be a civil servant just now. Many of our members
are facing a three-year pay freeze, because the senior civil service
had a pay freeze imposed on it this year, as well as the further
two-year pay freeze that has been announced. Everyone is just sitting
and waiting for an attack on the pension scheme—the gold-plated
pension scheme that the tabloids love to talk about. They are
anticipating an

to 40% potential cuts in jobs in many Departments, yet at the same time
the redundancy arrangements that they have come to rely on and, in the
case of our members, had reached agreement on in February, have been
significantly cut as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is having a very real impact on our members. We are getting a lot of
messages now, and we talk to members about how they feel about these
constant attacks, never mind what we can only describe as derogatory
comments at times about the value of civil and public servants as well.
Ultimately, our members are the same people the Government want to
deliver their programme and policies, whether that is at a local
benefit office, collecting tax or prosecuting
crime.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000134">&#160;</a>

Government need to understand the cumulative effect of all of that in a
very short period of time on committed public servants. For many of
them, the Bill is only one tranche of those attacks, and because of the

instrument that has been used, I think that at times they almost feel
that they are political footballs rather than valued public
servants.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000135">&#160;</a>

answer to that is, “Absolutely not”. I really do not. I
mentioned earlier that I think the Bill is irrelevant to the assessment
that my union, as an independent union, will make about where we get to
in negotiations. I say that because, as I explained earlier, there must
be a balance between what Justice Sales has now said are our accrued
rights, what the scheme will look like going 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 54<a class="bkMark" name="Column54">&#160;</a>
                           </div>forward and what the enduring parts of the scheme, including any
transition arrangements, will be. We will have to take that balance
into account.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If, for
example, the balance we come to is that the issue of accrued rights has
not been sufficiently recognised, not only will we have to reject it
but we will also have to do so because otherwise we could potentially
face legal challenges from our members. Our members will say that a
judicial review has made a decision on accrued rights and accrued
rights are not reflected in the agreement that I am putting to them.
They will say, “Not only am I going to sue the Government, but I
am going to sue my union, because you have not recognised
that”.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000141">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That is my
point about complexity. I know that it is more comfortable for some
people to draw broad private-public sector issues, but this is a very
complex scheme and the legal premise about the entitlements of civil
servants has to be taken into account in the discussion. Without
wishing to over-repeat the point, my union felt that the balance we
struck with the last Labour Government did that. It put the balance in
terms of accrued rights and a good scheme going forward, and it gave
the Government significant savings. Frankly, no other scheme that does
not reflect that balance stands a cat in hell’s chance of
getting off the ground. Otherwise, what we will face from all six
unions is a legal battle that I can tell you now will be fierce,
strongly fought on every corner and that will last a significant number
of years. And if it does not come back to haunt this Government, it
will come back to haunt a future

Central and Acton to public perception. On pay, can I put it to you,
very quickly, that in the year to March 2010 pay in the private sector
went up, according to the Office for National Statistics, by 3.6% but
in the public sector it went up by 2.8%? Incomes Data Services
estimates that in the next year, from April 2010 onwards, the average
private sector pay rise will be 4% while the average public sector pay
rise will be 1%.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000144">&#160;</a>

compensation. We are pleased that the judicial review outcome supported
our concern that accrued rights should not be changed except by
agreement. We are very much concerned to ensure that the current
negotiations are successful and that they lead to an agreement. We

question. Certainly I am sure that we are very much in a position,
looking immediately ahead to 20 October and the announcement

about the huge extent of cuts we believe may be made in the services
that Government Departments of various types provide, and the huge job

Cochrane, said a lot, which I do not

protocols that we have agreed—for trying to avoid compulsory
redundancies. Clearly, that is going to be extremely difficult, and if
there is not a satisfactory set of voluntary redundancy terms available
we are going to find that compulsory terms on extremely poor levels of
compensation become the norm, if this Bill is enacted. That would be an

negotiations? If the Bill were to receive Royal Assent by the end of
October, my understanding in respect of current employees who have
stated redundancy terms as of now, is that those which apply currently
would still apply up until the Bill receives Royal Assent. Does that
have an impact in terms of the timing of your willingness to come to a

negotiations to proceed as quickly as possible. We make ourselves
available to the extent that is needed to get a negotiated outcome that
we could then present to our members as a potential agreement. What we
find is that, to an extent, the existence of the Bill puts us in
something of a straitjacket situation in trying to complete
negotiations rapidly. As I see it, if I have this construction right,
the sunset clause will be operative or the Bill itself may lapse if an
agreement emerges. Whether it is going to be possible to get to the
point of reaching agreement in the sort of time scale that we appear to
be into with the parliamentary process, I do not know. I think that
will be very

the PCS view of the February deal, because that might be helpful to the
Committee in understanding 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 57<a class="bkMark" name="Column57">&#160;</a>
                           </div>where we are coming from. I ought to start by making it clear that the
PCS is by far and away the largest trade union in the civil service. We
have close to 300,000 members who are civil servants—there are
about 280,000—and other members who are in the private sector.
That is probably two and a half times more civil service members than
the other five unions added together. It is certainly double the size
of membership in all the other five unions that reached the February
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
we looked at the terms of that deal, earlier this year, we found that
it did give a degree of protection to some of the
lower-paid—those who were on a £20,000 salary or less.
From the civil service statistics, we know that that represented
something like 40% of civil servants in total—the £20,000
threshold and that degree of protection. But that left some of what we
would regard as still being lower-paid people—certainly people
on less than the average salary of civil servants; I am not saying that
is my definition of low pay—plus a lot of other people who were
on salaries in the £25,000 bracket. When we looked at those
statistics, what that told us was that the deal on offer had probably
given some reasonable protection for the lower-paid, in the
£20,000 and below bracket, but that there was another 50% of our

was why we decided that we should reject the deal and recommend to our

the accrued rights should not be interfered with. They can be changed
at a given date, but those accrued rights that are already in place
should not be interfered with, except by means of reaching an agreement
to that effect. It was on that basis, therefore, that we felt we had no
real choice but to pursue the judicial review, with the outcome that
you are all aware

will have gathered, the questioning from the Opposition side and, I
think, from some hon. Members on the Government side has been very much
to establish what the ball park for a negotiated settlement is, so we
keep coming back to the February 2010 agreement. I think that it would
be difficult if the view conveyed to the Committee is that that remains
inadequate. However, as you said, Mr Lewtas, the PCS took the previous
Government to judicial review and won, so that deal was essentially
struck down and could only be resurrected if the issues of contention,
particularly in relation to accrued rights, were resolved by
negotiation. The Minister said during the debate that, had an agreement
been reached, there would have been a pressing case to honour it. As a
national officer, you speak for the union, so if that deal were put
back on the table with a view to reaching a negotiated settlement
without the disruption of industrial action or, indeed, the damage that
imposing the Bill’s powers would do, are you optimistic that the
PCS would find an accommodation that would not lead to a further
judicial review or leave the Bill’s provisions as the only
available option on the
table?<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000171">&#160;</a>

negotiating process if we had the terms of the February deal as a start
point. We would like to move on from there and would very much like to
reach an agreement. In doing so, we will reflect further on the
judgment that we arrived at earlier this year on the extent to which
what was eventually on offer satisfied sufficiently our concern to
protect accrued rights to an extent where we felt not only that the
bulk of the lower-paid were adequately protected—it was really
only some of the lower-paid whom we felt were adequately
protected—but that some of the very longest-serving, loyal civil
servants whom we also represent were protected, which is a very
important point in relation to the Bill. I think that is the damage
that the Bill does. There are people who have given fairly lengthy
service and who have been in the civil service for 20 years or
more—that is the case in the context of very many of our
members—and considerable damage will be done to the levels of
compensation that they can expect if the Bill is
enacted.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000172">&#160;</a>

you separate, or do you treat as exactly the same, the question of the

“rights” attached to provisions for
superannuation?<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000178">&#160;</a>

you regard the “accrued rights” of provisions for
redundancy as accrued rights in the same way that a pension scheme
accrues a pot of money that builds up during service with that
organisation?<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000180">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>Can I turn to Geoff Lewtas, who represents
PCS? During the verbal evidence given on 27 July, as you may have heard
earlier, I put to some of the gentlemen representing other unions the
quotation from your colleague, Hugh Lanning, who
said:<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the
sticking point for us in the last negotiations was over the level of
protection there was to the lower paid in the Civil
Service.”<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
gather he also said that half of the 300,000 civil servants who are
your members earn under £22,000 a year. Under the negotiations
held by the last Government, anyone who earned under £20,000
would have retained three years’ pay. What makes you think that
you will be able to achieve a better settlement than that for the
lower-paid, given that all the other unions believed that that was a
fair deal?<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000183">&#160;</a>

negotiating position earlier this year was very much that, given the
protection that was essentially afforded to people on £20,000 or
less, they should still ultimately, if they had done sufficiently long
service, achieve a £60,000 compensation payment. The statistics
produced by ONS on civil service staff numbers demonstrated to us that
something like 40%, perhaps a few more, of our members had that degree
of protection. That left a substantial number, at least another 50% of
our own membership, in a less advantageous position. To cite a phrase
used by one of my other union colleagues in an earlier session, we did
not believe that the balance in the deal on offer was acceptable. It
needed to shift in the right direction more than it had
done.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000184">&#160;</a>

has been put to me that the turnout in the ballot was no more than 20%.
If a narrow majority of that took the union’s position that it
should reject the offer on the table, the question in my mind is
whether that really represents the interests of more than half your
members—150,000 people—who form the category of the
lower-paid. If very few of them actually responded to the ballot, or
voted in favour of it, I wonder whether the question is the extent to

the ballot being based on such a low percentage as you suggest. But,
rather than say that you are wrong, it is better that I get the figures
and supply you with them, so that you are able to take them into
account. What I would say about industrial action ballots, or other
ballots, is that when we have a ballot, we have to make judgments
before action is called about whether there is sufficient strength
there. If a union gets a yes vote but it is not a particularly strong
vote, the union would not automatically decide to authorise the
industrial action. So we will have consciously taken a decision, based
on the ballot outcome, about whether it was a

this morning? It is important that we get the PCS’s view on the
record for other Members. You have heard the comments from other trade

negotiations? That is the first question that we asked the others, and
it would be helpful to have your view.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, you
heard this morning the discussions on the legal opinions. In the last
round of negotiations, the Government lawyers were adamant that the PCS
had no case in law. You went to court, and you won, and the judge
determined that these were accrued rights. May I ask you the same
question that we asked the civil servant this morning? Given that track
record, how robust is your legal opinion this time around, in relation

                           </div>to resorting to Europe in terms of human rights, and how strongly are
you advised that you would win? Your deputy general secretary said
before the Public Administration Committee that the union would, if
necessary, resort to law. So that strength of opinion is

the Bill help or hinder? I think that I have said enough about its
unacceptable interference in the bargaining process to indicate that I
think that it really does hinder the negotiating process considerably.
It is likely to mean that the individuals—the
officials—that we are negotiating with take a more difficult
approach to the negotiating process and make it more difficult to free
up the issues and the details that need to be talked through, and make
it more difficult to get the negotiating position of their side moved
on in the right direction towards the possibility of reaching an
agreement, I would suggest. I regret that. I think that if the Bill
were taken away from the current scenery that surrounds us, it would be
a helpful move, quite frankly.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000203">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On the
question of the law, you had a very important contribution from my
colleague Dai Hudd in the earlier session. He made it clear that the
situation that we are now in legally, arising from the judicial review,
means that as well as unions having the potential to pursue legal
action, individuals might also contemplate doing that. They have got a
fairly clear, well-written legal judgment from Mr Justice Sales, which
sets out how the accrued rights are regarded in law and that currently,
certainly before this Bill is enacted, you cannot make detrimental
changes to accrued rights without an agreement being reached. That is
the situation in law as it stands at the moment.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000204">&#160;</a>

arrive—I genuinely very much hope that we will not—at a
situation where there is not a negotiated agreement but an imposition
of terms arising from this Bill, then we will certainly be looking to
the law to answer our concern about the impact that that will have. We
have taken advice, as has been said by my colleague Charles Cochrane,
from leading counsel. That advice is that there is a strong case for us
to pursue in the event that we do not deal with this in a more
satisfactory way; in the event that there is imposition of seriously
worse terms for individual civil
servants.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000205">&#160;</a>

Barton:</strong>
                           </em> Thanks, Geoff. I have been in the civil
service for 27 years, and because of that long service, I would attract
the highest terms around the compensation scheme three years’
salary. For most of my civil service career, I have been on relatively
low pay and worked my way through the grades. I suddenly find myself,
as a grade 7, as a relatively high earner. The impact of the
Superannuation Bill on me would be to reduce from 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 62<a class="bkMark" name="Column62">&#160;</a>
                           </div>three years to one year the amount of compensation that I would get,
which is a very real situation for me because I work in the Government
office network. As I am sure you are aware, Eric Pickles has indicated,
in principle, the decision to abolish the Government office network, so
this is hugely relevant for me at the moment. Three years salary for
me, currently under the existing terms, would amount to
£138,000. Sure, some people will have a view on a civil servant
attracting that sort of sum, but the new terms will mean that that will
go down by £92,000 to £46,000 before taxation.
Irrespective of the sums involved, I am sure that you would agree that
£92,000 is a huge amount to think about suddenly, in terms of
planning for your future.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I see the
compensation scheme as a safety net. I never really thought of the
money in the compensation scheme as money in my pocket; I thought it
was more there to help secure my tenure in employment, because that is
really what I want to do. After 27 years as a public servant, I would
really like to stay in public service. It is what I enjoy doing. I have
had options in the past to leave the civil service and move into the
banking or insurance fields, but I took a calculated decision at that
time. Although I did not earn as much money as some of my friends at
that particular point in my career, on balance, the overall employment
package—taking into account pensions and the security of my
job—is why I wanted to stay in the civil service. I thought that
that was important. I considered the compensation scheme a critical
part of that overall employment
package.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
find myself now having to think about future plans with potential
redundancy. We all know about the reduction in public sector job
opportunities. With the hit that the public sector is going to take, it
is going to be difficult to be redeployed. If the safety net of the
compensation scheme is reduced in that way, the decisions that we all
face in life—putting children through university, looking after
elderly parents and all those things that I am sure are pertinent to
you as well—will become very real issues for me now.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
other things about seeking redeployment, as well, or looking for
employment outside in the private sector, is that the skills that you
tend to pick up as a long-term civil servant are very generalist
skills. From some of the research that I have been doing, other
employment opportunities tend to call for very specific skills, whereas
you learn a generalist skill set in the civil service, so I am not sure
where that positions me for opportunities within the private sector. It
is a difficult time.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I suppose
that there is a question as well about what sort of terms I would have
been able to attract had I been a private sector employee for 27 years,
earning around £45,000. I do not know whether I would go on a
statutory minimum; I do not know whether I would have the opportunity,
perhaps, to negotiate a better package for myself than the statutory
minimum. It is an interesting
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am also a representative at GO East, so I get a flavour of the opinion
among the members there. We have about 90 members. Just as an aside, it
is worth noting that of those 90 members, I have only identified two
who attract the headline figure of six years’ compensation
terms. Only two of 90 members whom we have identified attract that,
which perhaps gives some sense of the scale of numbers involved
there.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Certainly,
the majority of members see the changes in the Superannuation Bill as
hugely detrimental to the life decisions that they will take. People
have taken decisions, for example, not to take out mortgage protection
insurance, because they believed that they had secure jobs, but they
now find themselves in a situation where their jobs are under threat.
At the same time, they have taken the double whammy that their
compensation payments will be considerably reduced by the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000213">&#160;</a>

partner is registered disabled. I need the kind of employment that the
civil service offers someone like me, and those terms and conditions.
It is very unlikely that I would be able to secure a similar job. The

civil service with other parts of the public sector and the private
sector, specifically the banking and finance areas of the private
sector. All three counts of comparison demonstrate that the civil
service is well behind, with much lower salary levels. They are, on

to negotiate a settlement, but we need to know on behalf of Parliament
whether a negotiated settlement is possible. Reference was made earlier
by Members on both sides about the offer that was put forward in
February 2010. What would happen if that were put back on the table? Do
I conclude from what you said earlier that if that were put back on the
table, in terms of quantum and shape, that might form the basis for a
settlement if some of the issues about the shape of the package were
addressed?<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000229">&#160;</a>

to answer. I do not have the authority to give you a straightforward

of how seriously the negotiations are taking place. None of us is party
to them on a day-to-day basis, but it is the backdrop to the Bill. Of
particular interest is the degree to which your union is engaged with
the process. As I understand it, the meetings are regular, quite
intense—almost daily, I think that the Minister for the Cabinet
Office said. Can you confirm whether the PCS has attended all the
meetings, or give us a sense of what proportion of meetings you have
attended and, therefore, the degree to which you are actively engaged
in trying to negotiate a
settlement?<a class="bkMark" name="10091461000233">&#160;</a>

that has to be taken very seriously by Parliament and by this Committee
