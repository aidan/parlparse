the money and the Ways and Means resolutions. The timetabling of

proceedings? There are no amendments to the Bill, so we will move
straight to a clause stand part debate on each clause, should members
of the Committee wish to debate the clauses one by one. I remind

thanks to the Clerk for the help that the Public Bill Office has
offered and to those who assisted with the drafting of the Bill, not
least members of the grocery market action group, ably chaired by the
hon. Member for St. Ives. The action group, as members of the Committee
know, consists of numerous organisations ranging from farming unions,
the British Brands Group, ActionAid, the Association of Convenience
Stores and the Rural Shops Alliance. What binds those diverse groups
together is the concept of fair trading. I pay 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                        </div>special thanks to the Farmers Union of Wales, particularly my local
branch, for concentrating my mind soon after my election to the House
in 2001 on the issue of unfair trading in the grocery market. In the
intervening years, there has been a concerted effort by producers,
suppliers and others to institute fairness in the grocery market supply
chain. Clause 1 and the Bill aim to do just that; it is about fairness
and fair trading.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000025">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">I want to
address, on the record, concerns that some hon. Members expressed on
Second Reading. The Bill is not about price setting; it is simply about
fair trading and setting up an ombudsman to oversee the new code of
practice that came into force this year. It is not about vested
interests, nor was it devised on the back of an envelope; it is a
response to a wide and comprehensive Competition Commission inquiry
into the unfair practices of major retailers. The Bill is also about
introducing a strong referee, as recommended by the Competition
Commission report, which made it clear that we need both a strong code
and a strong referee&#151;the ombudsman &#151;to oversee the code.
The principle of the ombudsman has cross-party support and, indeed, it
unites the Front Benchers of all the major parties. I respect the fact
that the Government are consulting on the ombudsman&#146;s role. The
main Opposition party has reservations about the exact location and
resources of the ombudsman&#146;s office. The concerns of both
Government and the Conservative Members are valid, but they have
travelled a long way, and they have arrived at the right destination,
namely the principle of fair
trading.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000026">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">I
will, as is right and proper, explain how clause 1(4) deals with the
question of how the ombudsman should be independent of the Office of
Fair Trading. The ombudsman should be independent and impartial. They
should be independent of Government, independent of the supermarkets,
and independent of groups with vested interests. Those basic principles
will give the ombudsman the status required to fulfil the role, and the
entire grocery market supply chain confidence that the code is being
monitored and adhered to in an honest, open, transparent and
unrestricted manner, as outlined by the clause and the important
recommendations of the Competition Commission. That is the primary aim
of the Bill and the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000027">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">The
ombudsman&#146;s location is a secondary concern. Of course, any
ombudsman must have at their disposal adequate resources to carry out
their functions. I fully understand the concerns of this and any future
Government about not wanting to create a super-quango.

do not want to create a massive empire or a super-quango of any nature.
It makes sense to share certain resources and information with the OFT,
but the independent status of the grocery market ombudsman must never
be compromised. It is for that reason that the Bill does not tie this
or any future Government down to housing the ombudsman in any
particular place, or to a specific amount of resources. That can be

			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>
                        </div>done at a later date. I repeat, however, that it is of the upmost
importance that the principle of the independence of the role and
functions of the ombudsman is enshrined in the Bill. The meaning of the
remainder of the clause is clear and does not divert from the
recommendation of the Competition Commission
report.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000031">&#160;</a>

follow the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n. May I reciprocate his kind
words by congratulating him on handling the issue extremely well during
our various debates? All parties are now united behind the Bill. We may
debate some of the detail, but it is important to recognise that there
is cross-party support for it&#151;and not before time. I should also
declare an interest, as I chair the grocery market action group, an
organisation in which I have no pecuniary interest. I am not paid and
see my duty merely as an extension of my role as a parliamentarian
facilitating that important campaign.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000032">&#160;</a>

                     <p class="tabbed">I also
endorse the hon. Gentleman&#146;s words in relation to the Farmers
Union of Wales which, probably more than any other farming
organisation, has steadfastly pursued the issue over many years. I
would also like to put on the record my congratulations to the
Competition Commission on undertaking an extremely thorough
investigation into the issue. Its objectivity and the manner in which
it has clinically analysed and scrutinised the groceries supply chain
will stand the future work of a supermarket ombudsman in good
stead.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000033">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">I
stress the importance of clause 1(4). I understand the cost
implications of the resources required by a grocery market ombudsman
and the benefits of basing the ombudsman in a particular building so
that overhead costs can be shared with another organisation&#151;I
entirely endorse that approach across Government, as it makes a lot of
sense&#151;but ensuring that the body has executive independence is
fundamental to the success of the initiative. In whatever form the
proposal ultimately goes forward, that element of executive
independence is

again. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys M&#244;n

am a member of this important Committee, on which it is a privilege to
serve. We must work together to ensure that we push the Bill forward,

seen to be done. That is a good way to proceed. Let us hope that we can

                        </span> It is a great pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I
declare an interest as the owner of a small retail convenience store in
Swansea. I congratulate the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n on being
lucky enough to be drawn in the ballot for private Members&#146;
Bills and on having the common sense to introduce a measure that really
unites the House.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000036">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">Such a
measure was unnecessary 40 or 50 years ago, because no group had the
kind of clout that is now centred in a small number of hands. The
retail market 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 6<a class="bkMark" name="Column6">&#160;</a>
                        </div>has changed dramatically since my grandfather opened his retail
convenience store in Swansea in the 1930s. It was only in the 1960s
when my father managed the store that supermarkets came on to the high
streets in any sort of fashion. Now, of course, a small number of
supermarkets are completely dominant, particularly in their
relationships with certain suppliers.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000037">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">Farmers have
been mentioned. I represent an agricultural constituency, the hon.
Member for Chorley represents many farmers, and the hon. Member for
Ynys M&#244;n also has many farmers in his beautiful constituency. We
know that clout has shifted completely in negotiations and that the
farmers, who in many ways are a disparate group, and have become a
desperate group because of the clout of a small number of supermarkets.
We need to redress that balance: alarm bells are now ringing in the
retail trade, because its members are wary of that body coming forward.
They have nothing to fear if they abide by the existing code. I do not
think that there is a problem, as all they need to do is abide by their
own code, and then I do not believe that the ombudsman will be too
troubled.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000038">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">The
ombudsman&#146;s position is laid out in clause 1, and I was grateful
to hear what the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n said about the amount
of money that will be provided for that particular body. We do not yet
know exactly how much work the ombudsman will have and how big the
office will be, but I hope that it will not be large. I also hope that
we will not get ourselves into the situation whereby we create yet
another body to add to the huge number already out there that earn
enormous sums of money from the public sector. When the hon. Member for
Chorley and I served on the erstwhile Trade and Industry Committee we
heard from the Ofcom lady, who was earning &#163;217,000 a year to
work a three-day week. We were absolutely
baffled.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000039">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">A
huge number of people from organisations such as the one we are
creating are on six-figure salaries for doing a few days a week or,
indeed, for doing non-jobs. I know that the incoming Conservative
Government will have a look at many of these so-called quangos and sort
them out, but I hope that this new body will be streamlined from the
very beginning in the way we would want all quangos and
non-governmental departmental bodies to operate. That is absolutely
right. I congratulate the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n yet again,
and I hope that we can get the Bill on the statute book while this
Parliament is still
sitting.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000040">&#160;</a>

                     <p class="tabbed"> I add my congratulations to those expressed to the
Member for Ynys M&#244;n on promoting the Bill, which, if we are
realistic and honest, is a rehearsal for a game that will be played
presumably later in the year, depending on the result of the general
election and bearing in mind the commitments already made by the major
parties.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000041">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Gentleman rightly says, there are issues of distinction. The Government
have gone out to consultation, so clearly we do not have a defined
Government approach. We, the Opposition, have said that there are two
particular issues. First, we believe that the ombudsman&#146;s office
should be within the Office of Fair Trading&#151;I will come back to
that&#151;and, secondly, the major suppliers, by which I mean
multinationals 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 7<a class="bkMark" name="Column7">&#160;</a>
                        </div>such as Coca-Cola and Kraft, should be excluded on the basis that they
have as much clout as many of the supermarkets. Not everybody agrees
with that approach. I have received a briefing from ActionAid&#151;I
met representatives of that organisation last week&#151;which
believes that that is not the right way forward, and that no one should
be excluded. However, we are obviously open to comment upon
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000042">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">I
have a few general remarks to make about clause 1. I wish to remind the
Committee that the Competition Commission&#146;s objective relates to
consumer interest. Despite my recognised support for farmers, the
Competition Commission proposed this code and ombudsman not out of
sympathy for farmers but because of consumer interests and the belief
that the supply trade and, therefore, consumers would suffer in the
long term. The Competition Commission is right in that, because there
is ample evidence to show that suppliers are being affected by some
very unfair practices.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000043">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Ynys M&#244;n primarily has livestock farmers in his area.
My area deals almost entirely with fresh produce, and those concerned
with that industry have numerous contracts with all the major and minor
supermarkets. The same issues arise&#151;retrospective discounting,
expecting farmers or growers to pay for shelf space, sometimes
expecting them to supply labour unexpectedly and to take produce back
that is clearly perishable and useless. There is a whole raft of
different practices that are wrong, and those are fundamentally
addressed by the new code, which supermarkets all welcomed and agreed
to comply with. All terms of trade will have to be in the code and be
properly explained in it. There should be no verbal terms, of which we
are all aware. I have certainly had growers and packers receive the
threat that if they supply one of the discount chains, they will not be
allowed to supply one of the others. All sorts of unacceptable verbal
threats have been made, and they need to stop. That will be stopped by
the
code.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000044">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">The
British Retail Consortium believes that it speaks on behalf of the
supermarkets. I say &#147;believes&#148; because the supermarkets
themselves have generally been much more relaxed about an ombudsman
than the BRC. I am sure that all members of the Committee had the same
briefing as me, which was pretty vitriolic in its opposition to the
measure. As others have said, if supermarkets comply with the code
properly, the ombudsman will have very little to do. However, to
suggest&#151;as the BRC does&#151;that we should wait two years to
see how the code beds down is to ignore the fundamental point that the
ombudsman&#146;s purpose is to know whether the code is bedding down
and how it is operating in practice. The two go together, and I am
pleased that my party has agreed to this approach, which recognises the
power of the Competition Commission&#146;s inquiry and the arguments
that have been made by hon. Members from all parties, as has rightly
been stated.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000045">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
Let me
deal with the OFT, because I know that hon. Members may question the
issue. I fully understand that clause 4&#151;I appreciate that we are
not yet debating it&#151;covers the OFT and how it fits in. We are
certainly not suggesting&#151;it seems wrong to start a sentence with
a negative&#151;that the matter should be under the OFT&#146;s
control, and I want to make that absolutely clear. All we 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 8<a class="bkMark" name="Column8">&#160;</a>
                     </div>are doing is trying to reduce the potential cost of the operation. If
the supermarkets comply with the code, the ombudsman&#146;s role will
be pretty small and they will not need a lot of office space and staff,
so it would be sensible to house them within the OFT&#146;s
facilities. We do not expect the OFT to supervise the
ombudsman&#146;s role. They would have to be independent, as the hon.
Member for Ynys M&#244;n desires, and that is essential if the system
is to
work.<p class="tabbed">We
have already been round this course to some extent. Hon. Members will
remember that an earlier code of practice was introduced by the OFT. It
was much vaguer, and left too much to individual interpretation, but it
is arguable that if the OFT had monitored and enforced it more
effectively, we might not have reached the current position. However,
this is where we
are.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000046">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments
about the previous voluntary code of practice. He suggested that the
ombudsman might be housed within the OFT&#146;s offices, but has he
been there and identified that there would be space? His assumption is
that the OFT has unused space for such a
function.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000047">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> The straightforward answer is no, I have not, but I
do not mean literally in the same building. We all know that when a new
public body is set up, a whole panjandrum of boards and so on is often
also set up. We do not need all that. We just need a discrete little
organisation operating within the OFT&#146;s facilities. That is
relevant because one concern that the supermarkets rightly expressed is
regulatory creep, and that the ombudsman, especially if they do not
have much to do, will look for more things to do to expand their role.
As expected from a political party that views all regulation with an
element of suspicion and wants to keep the burden of regulation on
business down, we do not want that mission creep, and it would be
slightly restrained if the ombudsman operated within the OFT&#146;s
facilities. That is hugely
important.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000048">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">Our
view is that funding should come entirely from the supermarkets through
whatever process the ombudsman comes up with. Again, that would be a
control mechanism against mission creep, because if funding suddenly
increased massively, the supermarkets would quickly speak to my
colleagues in the DTI or whatever Department will be responsible. There
would be that opportunity to
complain.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000049">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">I
believe that that is the right way forward, and that it is hugely
important for consumers, the supply trade and British farmers, many of
whom we represent in different ways. ActionAid has expressed concern
that indirect suppliers&#151;for example, a farmer who supplies a
dairy, which supplies a supermarket&#151;would not be protected. That
concern is not restricted to the UK, and a cocoa bean producer in
Africa who supplies a middleman might not be protected. I understand
that concern, and there is a grave risk&#151;perhaps the Minister
will comment on this&#151;of opening up a huge amount of mission
creep. Such suppliers should have the opportunity to complain to the
ombudsman&#151;the code would not apply to second-tier suppliers, and
the ombudsman&#146;s direct role should not apply to them&#151;and
to have complaints investigated. Otherwise, the organisation that
supplies the supermarkets will simply pass down what may be pretty
onerous terms directly to the supplier.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000050">&#160;</a>

                     <p class="tabbed">I
will finish with this warning, Mr. O&#146;Hara, which I
have expressed at many meetings up and down the country, not that I
expected to be reported this afternoon. There is a feeling among the
farming community that somehow an ombudsman is its salvation. I expect
the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n would agree with me that it is not.
This is not going to put the price of milk up by 3p a litre or whatever
farmers may seek. It would be foolish to allow that belief to get
currency, because it is not going to happen. However, it is a step
towards balancing an extremely unfair market situation, with 10,000 or
11,000 milk producers producing for a handful of processors of cheese
and liquid milk. It is a step forward, whatever the product, including
for overseas development.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000051">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">We support
the objectives of the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n in the Bill,
though I do not think it has a chance of becoming legislation before
the election. It probably should not have, as we have not had time to
scrutinise every line with due diligence. There clearly is not time to
do that. It is a worthwhile rehearsal for what is likely to come later
in the year, from whoever wins the election. The sooner an ombudsman in
some capacity is in position, the better for the consumer and
producer.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000052">&#160;</a>

                     <p class="tabbed">I join the
tributes to you, Chair, and to the Bill&#146;s promoter. We clearly
know that having laws and codes does not make everyone obey them. There
would not be 2 million Americans in jail tonight if laws stopped
offences. We have to be aware that many retailers suffer with
perishable goods in the same way that suppliers do. It is not only
fresh produce; some publishers dump periodicals on retailers causing
them a great deal of trouble. I go along with those who object strongly
to retailers being told they have to allow retrospective discounts
without negotiation.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000054">&#160;</a>

                     <p class="tabbed">I am a great
believer in trade unions, trade associations and federations of
businesses, so that people can have a more equal way of dealing with
folk. One reason for having Members of Parliament is not just to hold
Government to account, but to raise a voice on behalf of the small
trader&#151;whether a street, shop or stall trader&#151;to say when
things are not fair. When there are sufficient examples and MPs have
been sufficiently persistent, as the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n
has been with his Bill, action is likely to follow. So I pay
tribute to him.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000055">&#160;</a>

Bill can be agreed in the wash-up is above my pay grade, but I believe
that we are making progress. Whether in this Parliament or the next, I
hope progress is made, and that the ombudsman will try to use publicity
as much as diktats and directives to make the situation significantly
better. I hope there will be frequent reports on how the consequence of
this initiative has been good for the consumer, by being fair to
suppliers and retailers
alike.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000056">&#160;</a>

the Government&#146;s position on the Bill, there is a lot of genuine
agreement between Front-Bench teams on this matter. To echo the remarks
of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, the Conservative
spokesman, this is ultimately about the consumer. That was the purpose
of the Competition Commission inquiry and the basis on which the
Government decided to support the creation of an enforcer&#151;or
ombudsman&#151;of the code. That was done because of the
danger&#151;clearly identified in a serious piece of work by the

                     <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friend will know, on Second Reading, the Government took a
neutral stance on the Bill. We support its general principles, but as
has been mentioned, there is a consultation out at the moment. Before
today&#146;s Committee, I received briefing papers from several
organisations with an interest in the outcome of the Bill. None of them
has yet submitted formal detailed responses to the consultation, but I
look forward to receiving those. Of course, different organisations
have differing opinions about some of the detail that we are
debating.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000060">&#160;</a>

                     <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to detain the Committee long because the Government made
their position clear on Second Reading. We support the Bill in
principle, but as we have outlined, there is an ongoing consultation
and the Government will want to see the result of that regarding how
far the legislation progresses and at what
pace.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000061">&#160;</a>

                     <p class="tabbed"> I will respond briefly to the comments made by hon.
Members on both sides of the Committee. The hon. Member for St. Ives
was right to thank the Competition Commission for a thorough
investigation&#151;I should have done that in my opening remarks. He
highlighted the issue of cost, which we are all concerned about, and we
all want to ensure that the ombudsman is independent, impartial and
well resourced to do the job. The hon. Member for South-East
Cambridgeshire was right to say that two years&#151;which is what
some of the retailers are calling for&#151;is too long. We want to
know straightway and get this provision bedded down as soon as possible
to see how the code is working. The best way to do that is to have an
independent ombudsman.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000062">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Chorley is right: we are talking about fair
play&#151;nothing more, nothing less. There is no hidden agenda and
we are following the Competition Commission&#146;s recommendations.
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley is a regular visitor to Ynys
M&#244;n, and he is right when he speaks from personal experience and
says how beautiful it is. I echo that. He talks from experience as
someone who has grown up in the grocery business and understands the
changes that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 11<a class="bkMark" name="Column11">&#160;</a>
                        </div>have taken place. As a constituency Member of Parliament, he also
understands the situation that farmers have found themselves in when on
the receiving end of a powerful retailer. He was right to echo the
points raised on Second Reading that retailers have nothing to fear
from the code, or from an ombudsman overseeing it.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000063">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for South-East Cambridgeshire may feel that this is a dummy run
or a dress rehearsal, but we are providing an appropriate vehicle to
take the provision forward. He talked about issues of distinction and
suggested that certain suppliers should be exempt. I am not clear about
that, as I feel that the Bill could deal with such a matter. Complaints
can be brought against powerful suppliers just as they can be brought
against powerful retailers, and there is scope in the Bill to deal with
that. He was right to say that this is not about providing a lifeline
for small producers and farmers. It is about the market failure and
helping the consumer in the long run. I was glad that he repeated his
opinions on the OFT. He has been a long-term supporter of it, and I pay
tribute to him. However, the OFT must not play the role of a supervisor
for the ombudsman, although it could help with wages, rations, support
and other things.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000064">&#160;</a>

                     <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Worthing, West is right to say that MPs are elected to the
House to voice the concerns of the small trader against large
retailers&#151;David versus Goliath. He is also right to say that we
do not want retailers being brought to book in that way; we want them
to be named and shamed. Once the code beds down and an ombudsman is in
place, the retailers will come on board and support it. It will be in
their interest, as well as that of the consumer and supplier.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000065">&#160;</a>

am one of the few MPs who can say that they have walked every inch
around the coastline of their constituency. He made a serious point: we
are here as much because of the consumer as the Competition Commission
or anybody else. I am a little disappointed that people have not
responded to the consultation in a direct and detailed way. The
Government had a neutral stance. I am hopeful that we are prodding and
moving them in the right direction, as we and other parties have tried
to do over a long period. The Bill exists because of the perseverance

unnecessarily, but I want to rattle off three quick points for the
promoter of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000072">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">First,
in view of earlier exchanges, it would be worthwhile to revisit the
definition of a supplier in the code, so that it is clear that not only
the ultimate supplier to the supermarket may instigate an
ombudsman&#146;s investigation. A number of suppliers in the supply
chain have a justifiable interest in being able to instigate an
investigation.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000073">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
I want to emphasise the point made by the hon. Member for Ynys
M&#244;n in concluding the clause 1 stand part debate, in response to
the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire: unfair or fair dealing
cuts both ways. I would be glad of clarification from the hon. Member
for Ynys M&#244;n, but as I understand subsections (1)(c) and (2)(c),
a retailer can instigate an investigation. It therefore cuts both ways.
It is important that that principle is established. Unfair dealing, in
whichever direction, needs to be driven out of the system, ultimately
for the benefit of the
consumer.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000074">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
finally and most importantly, the Bill needs to be strengthened to
ensure that the ombudsman can operate proactively. The ombudsman
appears to have only one mechanism for instigating their own
investigations. Identifying complainants can discourage them from
coming forward, as has been found under the voluntary code of practice,
which small suppliers were simply not prepared to use for fear of
reprisals. It is important that the ombudsman is able to instigate
their own investigations. That could create a cloud so that a
supermarket, for example, would not know where the complaint had come
from. That would create a greater safety mechanism and allow complaints
to come forward
confidentially.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000075">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the hon. Member
for Ynys M&#244;n may have received few submissions because people
were fearful that, if they said that they wanted the ombudsman to crack
the whip against the supermarkets, the goods that they supplied might
have been stopped, which could have ended their livelihoods overnight?
Therefore, what the hon. Member for St. Ives is suggesting now is
eminently sensible.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000076">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
intervention. All those involved in the Competition Commission&#146;s
investigations clearly identified the point made in the OFT&#146;s
report&#151;published in 2002, I think&#151;that unless there is an
element of proactivity, we will lose the opportunity to ensure that the
new grocery supply code of practice will be as effective as we hope in
driving out unfair dealing.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000077">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> That is a very good point. I wonder whether the
code will cover people who broker deals. Has the hon. Gentleman had any
thoughts on that issue? Obviously, my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys
M&#244;n might have some, and he might refer to them when he sums
up.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000078">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point, and I
am grateful to him for that intervention. I go back to the code itself,
which of course has been enforced by the Competition Commission since 4
February. The Competition Commission has the power to enforce the code;
it does not have the power to implement the ombudsman and that is why
we are here today. Within the code, a supplier is clearly defined. The
code primarily 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 13<a class="bkMark" name="Column13">&#160;</a>
                        </div>identifies the supplier as the ultimate supplier to
the supermarket. It does not mention brokers or other facilitators in
the supply chain, as I recollect; I do not have the code with me at
present. The identification and definition of a supplier is very
important from the point of view of the sustainability of British
agriculture, including farmers and growers. In addition, we all know
that ActionAid, Traidcraft and a number of other organisations in this
country have an honourable reputation for standing up for producers
from the developing world. So fair&#146;s fair; there should be fair
dealing for their supply chain, too, particularly for goods that come
from tropical climates into this country.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000079">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> As we travel round and talk to suppliers from
industry or agriculture, I wonder whether we ourselves&#151;Members
of Parliament&#151;might get a feeling that something is unfair in
this sector. I gave an example about milk earlier, whereby it was
costing farmers more to produce milk than they were getting from the
retailer. We MPs might wish to refer a generalised case&#151;for
example, about the milk industry&#151;to the ombudsman to
investigate.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000080">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> Absolutely. However, I must caution the hon.
Gentleman that we do not want vexatious complaints to be made
mischievously, purely to stop or slow down the whole trading
environment, or to make it very difficult to proceed with. Therefore,
the code must be used appropriately. Of course, at the end of the day,
it is down to the ombudsman to ensure at an early stage that their
resources are well deployed. However, I hope that the hon. Member for
Ynys M&#244;n will accept my primary point about proactivity. In
other words, the ombudsman should be able to instigate the inquiries,
rather than just sitting back and reactively waiting for
complaints.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000081">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> I am grateful to the hon. Member for St. Ives for
the points that he raised. He was right to talk in his opening remarks
about the entire supply chain. We are not just talking about the
supermarkets and the major suppliers; we are talking about the whole
ethos of fairness, too. Both he and the hon. Member for South-East
Cambridgeshire, who is the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, referred
to overseas traders and various other things. It is important to deal
with the whole supply chain.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000082">&#160;</a>

                     </h4>
                     <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for St. Ives was right about the code. I do not have a copy
of the code here either, but my understanding is that it deals with the
direct suppliers. None the less, I believe that the spirit of the Bill
cuts both ways. In his intervention, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley
rightly asked about the role of MPs. I imagine that we could complain
to the OFT, and if there was a trend, we could ask the OFT to take the
matter forward. That would be one avenue. The three main avenues are
the supplier, the retailer and the OFT. We do not want to open this up
to people who make spurious complaints because they are not happy with
the price that they are getting.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000083">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">Proactivity
is not in the Bill, although that is its intended spirit. If the OFT
brought to the ombudsman&#146;s attention an issue with the milk
industry, it could be looked into proactively. The ombudsman could say,

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 14<a class="bkMark" name="Column14">&#160;</a>
                        </div>&#147;We haven&#146;t received a complaint, but we have a job to
protect.&#148; I am trying to bring everything together. Most
importantly, we need to eradicate and remove that climate of fear. The
purpose of having a strengthened code and an ombudsman is to ensure
that we can all be open and transparent about what is happening in the
grocery
market.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000084">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> Our constituents are all consumers and they will go
into supermarkets and specifically buy fair-trade bananas, coffee or
tea, because they want to ensure that the people who have supplied
those goods, mostly in developing countries, are getting a fair price
for them. This measure may open up all sorts of opportunities for
supermarkets to start to sell UK-produced fair-trade goods, which state
that they are ensuring that the supplier gets a fair
price.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000085">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> Yes, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. We
dealt with that issue on Second Reading. The supermarkets and the major
retailers have nothing to fear from the Bill; it will be good for the
whole grocery market, because it will increase choice for the consumer
in the long run. The contracts will be under scrutiny and there will
greater choice for the
consumer.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000086">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">Going
back to the point made by the hon. Member for St. Ives, the intent of
the Bill is to create a proactive ombudsman in whom everyone can have
confidence. People must feel that they can approach the ombudsman in
the knowledge that, if there are any issues, then he or she can look at
them to ensure that they are dealt with. I agree with the hon.
Gentleman, but I am responding from my memory of what the code says, so
I am at a slight disadvantage. The spirit of the Bill is to ensure
fairness and a proactive ombudsman who will look at the whole grocery
market and the entire supply chain, as he
suggests.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000087">&#160;</a>

under your chairmanship, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I shall not
detain the Committee very long, but I should like to ask my
hon. Friend the Member for Ynys M&#244;n a question. Subsection (1)
says that when an investigation is not pursued by the ombudsman, it
will be explained in writing to the complainant and the OFT. Is the
implication that that explanation will eventually be made public? I am
aware that clause 4 links to clause 10 in terms of reporting
requirements, but I am interested to know what happens. To my mind,
this should be about transparency. When an investigation is clearly
taken forward, the reporting procedures ensure that that will be made
known, that there will be a report and that the report will be made
public. I want to know that when there is no reason for the ombudsman
to take an investigation forward, it will still be published, because 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 15<a class="bkMark" name="Column15">&#160;</a>
                        </div>that way the general public will have some idea that a complaint was
made and that a decision was taken not to pursue
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000090">&#160;</a>

                     <p class="tabbed"> We give the responsibility to the ombudsman. None
the less, my hon. Friend is right that we need to have transparency. If
he remembers, the formula works on the number of complaints and the

ombudsman should have that right and responsibility to put into the

ombudsman it doesn&#146;t really matter because at the end of the day
it is pretty meaningless anyway.&#148;<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000097">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">We want to
ensure that the clause will make the ombudsman respected and make
everyone who is involved in any way, whether in providing evidence,
making a complaint or being criticised, judged, adjudicated or possibly
even punished by the ombudsman, take the whole process sufficiently
seriously to make it a worthwhile exercise. Are there are any further
plans afoot to clarify the way that the Secretary of State may go about
this and will my hon. Friend make every effort to ensure that the
clause is strengthened as much as it can
be?<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000098">&#160;</a>

                     <p class="tabbed"> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Worthing, West
and my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli. I did not understand what
the hon. Gentleman meant but he made the point earlier when he said
that simply highlighting problems would be an embarrassment for the
retailers. That is one of the biggest penalties. To have it exposed in
the newspapers and in trade journals would be a huge disincentive to
any retailer. In later clauses it will become clear that the Secretary
of State will lay regulations before the House and that those
regulations will have to be agreed by both Houses. That will strengthen
the penalties even further where necessary. It is up to the ombudsman.
We will give him the freedom to do the job and to carry out the role
that we expect of him. There will be the ability to have penalties, but
I emphasise that naming and shaming is also a tough
penalty.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000099">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> I agree that naming and shaming is most important.
Nobody wants it emblazoned across the six o&#146;clock news that
unfair practices have taken place. However, on fines, none of us knows
what sort of sums we are talking about at this stage. Where would he
envisage the money ending
up?<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000100">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> The formula says that it is self-financing, so it
would end up in the ombudsman&#146;s department. The OFT would
collect the money. I am looking to the Minister to help me here. The
point of the Bill is that there will be monetary penalties. That will
be paid for in the formula. That formula will be looked at annually.
The OFT and the ombudsman would be able to consult if they needed to
vary any of the penalties. I do not have a direct answer for the hon.
Gentleman but I can assure him that we are trying to ensure that the
code and the penalties work. They can be reviewed regularly but they
have to be agreed by both
Houses.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000101">&#160;</a>

                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> Briefly, may I highlight the point made by the
hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n that there should be a positive side to
the Bill? I see the potential for it in clause 10(1)(c) on the annual
ombudsman&#146;s report. It has always been my view that if
supermarkets have nothing to hide, they have nothing to fear from an
ombudsman. They should welcome the opportunity to open themselves up to
any investigation. They might embrace this initiative when the annual
report comes out and gives them the clean bill of health that they
presumably
anticipate.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000106">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">I
would go further and suggest that the annual report might stray further
and identify examples of good practice, or at least the
non-identification of bad practice. Ultimately, the supermarkets may
use the ombudsman&#146;s reports in their marketing if they have been
found to engage in fair practices with their suppliers or have been 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 17<a class="bkMark" name="Column17">&#160;</a>
                        </div>identified for good or exemplary practice. I see this measure not as
something for supermarkets to fear, but as something for them to
embrace.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000107">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">I
hope that when we go out from this place and explain the purpose of the
measure, people will identify it as a positive contribution and a
reassurance to the consumer. It should be a report not purely for the
trade press and those in the supply chain, but for the consumer because
it came about to counter concerns about the impact on the consumer.
Having such information in the public domain might reassure shoppers
that they can feel comfortable with their favoured supermarket or
grocer because it has been shown objectively by the ombudsman to engage
in fair
dealing.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000108">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> Supermarkets do plenty of good things. We have not
come here to bash supermarkets by any stretch of the imagination. I am
sure we all get involved in the distribution of computers by Tesco and
the collection of Sainsbury&#146;s vouchers for sports equipment for
schools. Booths, a regional supermarket in the north-west of England
that has stores in my constituency, does an enormous amount to support
local farming initiatives and community projects. We know that
supermarkets do a lot of good, but we are embarking on this procedure
because of the imbalance in the market that has been pointed
out.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000109">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">I
do not think it is right to put in the Bill how the publications ought
to be made. However, I hope that we start to think about the
cost-effectiveness of publishing such reports. We all remember when the
Government used to introduce annual reports&#151;the famous Tony
Blair reports&#151;that nobody read. They were distributed to
supermarkets, put on shelves and that is where they stayed until they
were returned to goodness knows where to be pulped ready for the next
year&#146;s editions. Even the Prime Minister himself decided at some
stage to stop the farce of those annual reports. It may well be that
streamlining and cost effectiveness mean that these reports will be
published on the internet, rather than physically published. It would
therefore be easy for everybody to not only look at them, but cross
reference them on the internet.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000110">&#160;</a>

                     </h4>
                     <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for St. Ives was talking about all the good things that
supermarkets do, and the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n said that
shaming the supermarkets should be sufficient for them to follow the
code that they say they wish to follow. If a particular supermarket
chain or, indeed, a particular store&#151;if it has sufficient clout
and it is a single store that has been complained about in one
area&#151;has been found guilty of a breach of conduct, it might be
appropriate for a poster to be displayed in the store, so that people
can see what the supermarket has done and what action the supermarket
has then taken to ensure that it has corrected the breach. All of those
things could be considered in relation to ensuring that the information
is got out to the public, so that the shaming aspect that the hon.
Gentleman mentioned is a sufficient deterrent for them not to breach
the code in the first
place.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000111">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> I am grateful to have the opportunity to respond to
those points. First, on the comments of the hon. Member for St. Ives,
it has always been my 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 18<a class="bkMark" name="Column18">&#160;</a>
                        </div>intention&#151;and it is certainly that of the Bill&#151;to be
positive. I think he is right: clause 10(1)(b), which talks about the
annual report, could be used positively. To link with what the hon.
Member for Ribble Valley said, I am sure that supermarkets that have
had the least complaints or no complaints at all will boast about that
and, in a competitive manner, encourage others to come through their
doors. The hon. Gentleman is also right to say that we have all got
good links with supermarkets. Just last weekend, the First Minister of
the Welsh Assembly and I went to a new Waitrose in my constituency
&#151;the first in north
Wales.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000112">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> Very
posh.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000113">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> Indeed. Waitrose is very posh. I did not buy
anything. I just walked around and smiled, because it is that time in
the electoral cycle. The serious point is that that supermarket engages
with Members of Parliament and Members of the Assembly. Waitrose was
one of the more positive supermarkets about the establishment of the
ombudsman, and I think that others will follow suit. Yes, we can turn
the measure into a positive for the supermarkets. On Second Reading, we
all said that we are not anti-supermarket; we are pro-supermarket,
pro-consumer and
pro-supplier.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000114">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> I draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to
subsection (2), which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000115">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of the law of defamation, the publication of any report or
other matter by the Ombudsman under this Act shall be absolutely
privileged.&#148;<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000149">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p>The
conditions that need to be met for an action for defamation or for
libel are that a matter should be untrue, damaging and not privileged.
That subsection deals with the question of privilege for the report,
but I do not know whether it covers the person who makes the complaint
in the first place, because it is unlikely that the provision will be
needed, unless a complaint is potentially defamatory. If the Bill is to
receive further consideration, those who have greater knowledge than me
of the law of defamation may want to consider whether there needs to be
protection for the person who makes the complaint in the first
place.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000116">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> I am sure that there are several lawyers in the
House who can look at the measure in greater detail. The only
complaints that will not be examined in greater detail will be those
that are before the courts. A court&#146;s decision will be in the
public domain and we could consider that. However, the hon. Gentleman
is right: that matter needs closer examination in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000117">&#160;</a>

states:<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000125">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="hs_brev">&#147;The

                     </p>
                     <p>This
issue, which has been raised by the British Retail Consortium, is the
only one that I feel the need to push a little further. Subsection
(2)(a) states that a retailer with more complaints made against
it<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000126">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="hs_brev">&#147;will

                     <p>Considering
due process, is it fair and reasonable for a retailer, which has only
had complaints made against it, to make a greater contribution to the
ombudsman&#146;s costs? Would not clause 3(3), which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000127">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="hs_brev">&#147;The

                     </p>
                     <p>be
a fairer way of representing the proportion that retailers should pay?
It would mean that only complaints deemed necessary of investigation by
the ombudsman should be taken into account in relation to paying the
overall costs of the ombudsman&#146;s office. Will the hon. Member
for Ynys M&#244;n consider
that?<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000128">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed">Clause
12(5) indicates that the OFT must follow the ombudsman&#146;s
recommendation on how much retailers should contribute according to the
formula for any particular period unless there is good reason to vary
it. Will &#147;good reason&#148; be defined more clearly in
guidelines? If so, what does the hon. Gentleman believe would be a good
reason for varying the recommendation? We must bear in mind the
importance of the need for the ombudsman to be independent and for it
not to feel that it is being imposed upon by the OFT when making its
judgments.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000129">&#160;</a>
                     </p>
                     <p class="tabbed"> Further to the point made by the hon. Member for
Crewe and Nantwich, and in addition to the idea that the formula should
reflect the number of complaints and subsequent penalties, I wish to
point out that, in my survey of the grocery retailers that fall within
the orbit of the grocery supply code of practice and the measure under
discussion&#151;in other words, those retailers that the Competition
Commission defines as having a turnover of more than &#163;1
billion&#151;Aldi, Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer indicated
conditional support for the concept of an ombudsman at a relatively
early stage. I had discussions with several retailers at various stages
and, although some equivocated, it became clear that they wanted a fair
system of penalties and rewards, as well as a formula that might also
reflect the capacity of a retailer according to its size and
turnover.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000130">&#160;</a>
                     </p>Has
the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n considered a circumstance in which
penalties have been so great that the ombudsman&#146;s coffers are
overflowing with income and it is so awash with money that it does not
need to ask for any contributions for a number of years? Clearly, the
ombudsman would not want to reimburse supermarkets 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 20<a class="bkMark" name="Column20">&#160;</a>
                     </div>with a greater amount than the contribution they may have made in the
preceding year. Those are all speculative questions to help envisage
the detail of what the formula needs to contain, but the primary point
is the size of the retailer and whether that can be reflected in the
formula.<p class="tabbed"> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Crewe and
Nantwich for raising those points. I must say that he has good links
with Ynys M&#244;n, while we are on that subject. He made a good
point about the number of complaints and issues. Of course, we are
following the guidelines and recommendations of the commission&#146;s
report and the idea that the provision needs to be varied at a later
stage is exactly because it is new and there should be proper
guidelines. We need to look at it and let it bed down to see how the
formula is working. The formula is set up by the OFT, which is why I do
not think that it breaches the independence of the ombudsman. In fact,
there needs to be co-operation, which strengthens the argument about
the cross-departmental workings of the ombudsman with the OFT. I
understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I expect there to be
strong guidelines once the formula is up and running so that everyone

Member for St. Ives raised the fairness of the formula and the
ombudsman&#146;s being awash with money. I want to put on record that
it is not my intention for the ombudsman to pay himself huge bonuses
with any surplus money. Again, that is the reason for varying the
formula at a later date. The clause is in the Bill for that purpose.
Hopefully, there will not be much at all. That is the intent. If the
code works properly, there will be no need for great fines, great
moneys and the ombudsman&#146;s being awash with money, but I have
explained the reason why the formula needs to be varied at a later
stage and why the OFT needs to work with the ombudsman.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000132">&#160;</a>

about Northern Ireland. I have two points: one is that I neglected to
say what a pleasure it was to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. O&#146;Hara. It has been a great pleasure over the
years and I wish you a healthy, happy and long-lived retirement. I have
enjoyed working with you on a number of shared interests, such as
Marbles Reunited, the restitution of the Elgin Marbles, for example. I
wish you well in your
retirement.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000137">&#160;</a>

the substantive point, although I am interested in the inclusion of
Northern Ireland and the extension of the Act to all corners of the
United Kingdom, as a Cornishman, who strongly differentiates between
Cornwall and England, I would like to insert the word
&#147;Cornwall&#148;.<a class="bkMark" name="10033062000138">&#160;</a>

it comes under the law of England and Wales. As a Welshman, I, too,
