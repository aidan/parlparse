<H2><center>Standing Committee C</center></H2>
<H4><center>Wednesday 12 April 2000</center></H4>

<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/112/2000112.htm">Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we commence the clause 1 stand part debate, I shall make two announcements.

<P>
Notwithstanding what I said at the previous sitting about, as a general rule, not selecting starred amendments, I have selected amendment (d) to new clause 3. The new clause appeared on the amendment paper for the first time yesterday, so a starred amendment was the only way to table an amendment to it.

<P>
It might help the Committee if I explain how we should proceed on the new clause, the amendments grouped with it and subsequent clauses and amendments. I have grouped new clause 3 with the clause 1 stand part debate, because the new clause is clearly intended to replace the first four clauses. This point in our proceedings is the first at which the matter arises.

<P>
I will therefore be content to allow a wide-ranging debate on whether the first four clauses should be replaced by the new clause, and on whether the new clause should first be amended as proposed in amendments (a) to (d).

<P>
At the end of the debate, I shall put the question that clause 1 stand part of the Bill. If clause 1 is disagreed to, the Committee's intention will have been made clear and I shall not then call the amendments to clause 2 that I have provisionally selected. Of course, if clause 1 is agreed to, we shall proceed in the usual way.

<P>
New clause 3 and the amendments tabled to it are to be debated only under the clause 1 stand part debate. Any votes on them will be taken towards the end of proceedings and without further debate. They will be called formally when we reach the new clauses.

<P>
I hope that that is clear.

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: New clause 3-Strategy relating to fuel poverty-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.-(1) It shall be the duty of the appropriate authority to prepare and publish, before the end of the period of twelve months beginning with the relevant commencement, a strategy setting out the authority's policies for ensuring, by means including the taking of measures to ensure the efficient use of energy, that as far as reasonably practicable the homes of all households on lower incomes can be kept warm at reasonable cost.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) The strategy must-

<P>
(a) describe the households to which it applies,

<P>
(b) specify measures for ensuring the efficient use of energy, such as the installation of appropriate equipment or insulation.

<P>
(c) specify interim objectives to be achieved and target dates for achieving them, and

<P>
(d) specify a target date for achieving the objective of ensuring that as far as reasobably practicable the homes of all households on lower incomes can be kept warm at reasonable cost.

<P>
(3) In preparing the strategy or any revision of the strategy, the appropriate authority shall consult-

<P>
(a) the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority and the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council, and

<P>
(b) such other persons as the appropriate authority thinks fit.

<P>
(4) The appropriate authority shall take such steps as are in its opinion necessary to implement the strategy.

<P>
(5) The appropriate authority shall-

<P>
(a) from time to time assess the impact of steps taken under subsection (4) and the progress made in achieving the objectives and meeting the target dates,

<P>
(b) make any revision of the strategy which the authority considers appropriate in consequence of the assessment,

<P>
(c) from time to time publish reports on such assessments.

<P>
(6) If the appropriate authority revises the strategy, it shall publish the strategy as revised.

<P>
(7) Any strategy complying with this section which was published by the Secretary of State within six months before the passing of this Act shall be taken to have been published under this section.

<P>
(8) In this section-

<P>
``the appropriate authority'' means-

<P>
(a) as respects England, the Secretary of State, and

<P>
(b) as respects Wales, the National Assembly for Wales;

<P>
``the relevant commencement'' means-

<P>
(a) as respects England, the day on which this Act is passed, and

<P>
(b) as respects Wales, the day on which this section comes into force as respects Wales.

<P>
(9) In relation to any time before the commencement of section 3(1) of the Utilities Act 2000, the reference in subsection (3)(a) to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority and the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council shall have effect as a reference to the Director General of Gas Supply and the Director General of Electricity Supply.'.

<P>
And the following amendments thereto: (a), in subsection (1), leave out ``on lower incomes''.

<P>
(d) in subsection (2)(d), after ``date'', insert
<P>
``not more than fifteen years after the relevant commencement''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
(b), in subsection (2)(d), leave out ``on lower incomes''.

<P>
(c), at end of subsection (4), insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and achieve the objectives and meet the targets set out therein.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. David Amess </B>(Southend, West): A great deal has happened since out last sitting, and I am pleased to say that it has all been good. In hindsight, we have achieved a splendid result due to the week in which we have further considered the repercussions of accepting the original new clause. I am pleased with new clause 3, which, as you have already told the Committee, Mr. Gale, replaces clauses 1 to 4. To be frank, my first efforts were somewaht amateurish. That is not new among those piloting private Member's Bills, but I do not think that the clause was in order as I first submitted it.

<P>
I am grateful for the further work done by the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), and his officials. I am only too well aware that Ministers and their officials are pressed at such points in our parliamentary cycle, when Bills build up along the Committee Corridor. But that pales into insignificance when compared with the way in which the Conservative party is pressed, running between Committees and trying to maintain a quorum. The Bill is important to my hon. Friends and me, so we regard the time that the Minister and his officials have spent on working towards what we all want to achieve as being worthwhile. We now have something much better than the original new clause.

<P>
One improvement is that the strategy in new clause 3 requires the Bill to include a target date for ending fuel poverty. All hon. Members think that that is fundamental. Many of us feel that, although Governments are always blessed with good intentions, a carrot must be placed in front of them to encourage action to put an end to fuel poverty.

<P>
Another improvement is that new clause 3 promotes the installation of insulation and energy efficiency equipment rather than only energy efficiency ideals. It underpins the Bill's overall objective. We want local authorities and private landlords to take advantage of various programmes, many of which are operated by companies in our constituencies. Furthermore, new clause 3 will include a description of the household to which the strategy will apply. On Second Reading and at last week's sitting, we referred to the difficulty of defining poverty. That troubed one or two of my hon. Friends but, by and large, new clause 3 reaches a splendid compromise.

<P>
New subsection (2)(d) is clearly a major improvement. The principal aim of the warm homes campaign is a target by which fuel poverty will be eradicated. We shall continue to call for that to be not more than 15 years. New clause 3 requires a strategy to be drawn up under the Bill to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>specify a target date for achieving the objective of ensuring that as far as reasonably practicable the homes of all households on lower incomes can be kept warm at reasonable cost.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Households on lower incomes do not include only people who are on benefits. Perhaps the Minister will say something about that later. In the light of last week's long discussions on the definition of fuel poverty, the new clause requires a definition to be included in a strategy that I hope provides enough flexibility for the Government to work out a good definition and meet the concerns that members of the Committee raised last week. That objective must now be part of the strategy and the relevant authority must take the necessary steps to implement the strategy. In other words, the strategy must aim to end fuel poverty and it must be implemented. Unless that is part of the Bill, we are wasting our time.

<P>
New clause 1 required that the strategy contained only objectives and target dates. That could be for the alleviation of fuel poverty rather than its eradication. New clause 3 calls for its eradication. I shall be honest with members of the Committee and admit that the provision falls short of the previous aim to set a 15-year target, as it leaves the final decision about the target date to the Government. Perhaps that is one concession that we have made to them. The warm homes campaign continues to believe that the 15-year target is sensible, an issue to which those on the Liberal Democrat Benches will refer.

<P>
While the exact target is a matter of judgment, I still believe that a target date of 15 years is sensible. It will allow the programme to pay for itself in its own lifetime. On Second Reading, some of my right hon. and hon. Friends were troubled by the costs of such a programme. We debated the money resolution, and I have furnished them with details of how the proposal will be cost neutral. Under the 15-year target, it should pay for itself, through savings in the national health service, public-sector housing and job creation. A 15-year period would have been sensible in creating new jobs. It is simply not possible to train hundreds of thousands of people to do just two years' work. A 15-year programme throughout the United Kingdom will generate up to 30,000 jobs, which my constituents in Southend, West and people in other parts of Essex will welcome. The 15-year target will also increase the action that the Government are already taking, which is realistic and practical. I do not want to be churlish. I recognise that, from the Minister's point of view, the Government are already doing a great deal.

<P>
It has been argued that a programme of less than 15 years would be sensible, and the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson) feels strongly about that. The Labour party in Scotland pledged in its election manifesto to eradicate fuel poverty in two Parliaments-about eight years. I should not be party political, but it has yet to detail how that will be achieved, and we look forward to that announcement. A clear commitment has been made to match that in the rest of the United Kingdom.

<P>
Furthermore, the most recent analysis of the 1996 English house conditions survey suggests that the number of households suffering fuel poverty may have declined. Assuming that fuel poverty in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is as prevalent as that in England, the decline may be from about 8 million to about 6.3 million households. Whatever figure is arrived at, that is a huge number of people, and this is not a third world country. Whether the number of people who need proper heating is 8 million or 6 million, in a civilised society that is an absolute disgrace.

<P>
Regardless of which political party parliamentarians support, they should all welcome the efforts made in the Bill to eradicate fuel poverty. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs Gilroy) has suggested a 15-year target. I realise that some hon. Members believe that it is not worth signing early-day motions, but occasionally they cut their cloth when it suits them, and for the hon. Lady to have persuaded nearly 400 Members to sign her early-day motion is splendid. That proposal would have tackled 7.5 million homes over a 15-year period. The Minister is probably sick to death of hearing about it, but I believe that he signed an early-day motion three times, and we welcome his support. Had the 6.3 million households been tackled at a rate of 500,000 a year, as the hon. Lady proposed, it would have taken fewer than 13 years to eradicate fuel poverty.

<P>
Politics is the art of the possible, and last week, in my amateurish way, I may have been trying to persuade the Committee and the Government to support the impossible. Both sides of the argument have given a bit and taken a bit, but as the promoter of the Bill, I assure the Committee that I am now delighted with what we have arrived at with new clause 3, and I hope that other hon. Members will feel as I do and support it.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As hon. Members know, the Chair customarily calls Opposition Front-Bench Spokesmen and Back Benchers before calling the Minister. To facilitate the debate, however, and given that this is a private Member's Bill, it may be helpful for the Committee to hear the Government's view first. That may resolve some of the questions in hon. Members' minds.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> I am in your hands, Mr. Gale. I had proposed to speak for only for a couple of minutes in support of the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), but I am prepared to go into more detail if hon. Members see fit.

<P>
I contratulate the hon. Gentleman on the progress that has been made and the eloquent way in which he described the new clause. I am delighted that we have arrived at a formula that reconciles the hon. Gentleman's objectives with those of the Government. As I explained last week, the Government would not want the Bill to pre-empt the decisions of the interministerial group, but the new clause would not allow that to happen. It clarifies some of the terms and issues and makes them more transparent, but it does not prevent the interministerial group from setting targets and laying down the definitions, which is a task that we want to leave with Ministers.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southend, West raised a couple of points. He asked whether the reference to ``lower incomes'' involves people on benefit alone. It does not. We will leave the precise definition to the interministerial group, but we anticipate that it will be wider than that. The interministerial group will also be setting target dates, but stating an end date in primary legislation presents real problems. We cannot use legislation to commit the Government to long-term spending plans, which may have a lifetime of three Parliaments or more, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that. It would be unreasonable to expect us to do that within the current spending plans and review cycles, and, if we tried to, the Chancellor of the Exchequer might have something to say on the subject.

<P>
Our proposed solution is contained in subsection (2) of the new clause. It would be perfectly sensible for the interministerial group to be given a duty to specify target dates, including the date by which we aim to ensure that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as far as is reasonably practicable the homes of all households on lower incomes can be kept warm at reasonable cost.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That meets the commitment given by my right
hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment on
21 December 1999.

<P>
It falls to me to say how glad I am that we have arrived at a formula that seems to satisfy all parties, and to thank all those who have co-operated to make that possible. I am grateful to the Friends of the Earth and to the Association for the Conservation of Energy for the constructive role that they have played. If I can be of any further use to the Committee in the course of our proceedings, I stand ready.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I add my congratulations to the hon. Member for Southend, West, who has clearly been burning the midnight oil along with others to produce the amendment for us this morning. I am anxious to stay in good order, Mr. Gale, and I carefully listened to your explanation of how business was going to be conducted.

<P>
It might be helpful to the Committee if I said straight away that, were we to get to clause 2, I would not move amendment No. 7. We may not reach that clause, but it is important to bring the Committee's attention the issues contained in amendments Nos. 9 and 10, and this may be the appropriate moment to do so. The amendments were designed to insert into clause 2 a clear timetable, or, more accurately, a limit on any timetable of a maximum of 15 years for the completion of the programme. I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Southend, West and the Minister said, and I understand the practical and political difficulties of proceeding as the Campaign for Warm Homes and many Committee Members would wish-establishing a national 15-year programme that would solve the problems of fuel poverty across the United Kingdom.

<P>
In the Commitee's previous sitting, we discussed one or two difficulties in relation to the devolved areas of the United Kingdom. The Minister pointed out that the Chancellor of the Exchequer might also raise difficulties, which, I suspect, would be more formidable to overcome than the views of a devolved Assembly. Nevertheless, we must recognise that we are discussing a large number of United Kingdom households. Whether the number is 4.3 million or 6.88 million-we discussed the figures last week-it is a much higher proportion than in any other European Union country, or, indeed, European country. That is reflected in this country's excess winter deaths, which are directly related to fuel poverty. We should not dance on statistical niceties; we should consider practical outcomes.

<P>
I want to make it clear that I am pleased with the new clause. I agree with the hon. Member for Southend, West that it is a significant step forward. Securing the Government's support, and that of the hon. Gentleman's party, will be important in ensuring that the programme reaches fruition and can be implemented at the end of the Session. I do not want to do anything to reduce its chances of success. However, I want to emphasise the need to set a deadline. In all conscience, 15 years is an extended deadline. It is not asking a great deal-it approximately doubles the rate at which the problem is currently being tackled-and would have a limited impact on public expenditure. Some Committee Members have also been serving on a working party that is considering ways in which the goal could be achieved at nil or low cost to the public purse. We have had meetings with providers of mechanics for improving the efficiency of homes and increasing the rate of energy conservation. Some of us are convinced that, in some cases, the technical difficulties and costs have been overestimated.

<P>
The amendments that I tabled with my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) are designed not to impose a rigid year-by-year timetable but to insist on completion within 15 years. The Minister claimed that that would be committing three Parliaments-and possibly three Governments{**DP**}-{**DP**}to a programme in primary legislation. That is true, but if the Government wanted to achieve the aim in one term, we would not object. Nothing in the Bill would prevent it being done in a shorter period. If the amendment were incorporated into the Bill, it would merely stipulate that the programme should be completed by the end of the stated period. It does not commit future Governments if the current Government wanted to tackle the problem vigorously.

<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman </B>(Chipping Barnet): I have great sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's remarks. However, he is being a little pessimistic. We would all agree that Parliament is at the spearhead of keeping Governments, of whatever hue, on their toes. It would be strange if we or our successors did not keep whatever Government were in power to the commitment to phased progress in removing the problem within 15 years, or even sooner. While I accept in theory what the hon. Gentleman says, in practice we can be a little more optimistic-although how many of us will serve in future Parliaments is obviously not something I can readily predict.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I did not intend to be pessimistic; I am very optimistic, the more so with the new clause. For the first time, we have secured genuine all-party support on a wide-ranging measure, which has a fair wind from the Government and has every prospect of being brought into force. Far from being pessimistic, I am optimistic. I am just doing what the hon. Gentleman suggests should be done: spurring on the Government and the promoter of the Bill to be that bit more ambitious-although the degree of ambition I am asking for is not that great.

<P>
All we are saying is, ``Yes, that is an excellent way forward. It is what many of us have long been campaigning for. Please will you undertake to finish the job in 15 years?'' That is not pessimism, but a request for a Parliament to do what it is supposed to do: keep Government and policy makers-on this occasion, the hon. Member for Southend, West is a policy maker-up to the mark to ensure that they deliver the goods. I emphasise that that is not just to achieve some statistical nicety but to save lives and, as the hon. Member for Southend, West said, costs. There will be a reduced cost to the national health service and to the public housing sector, and a reduction in human misery and tragedy.

<P>
It does not seem likely that my amendments will be debated. However, I say to the Government and the promoter of the Bill that I hope that a message will go back to the ministerial working party that an end date must be put on the process that it is commissioning. The promoter of the Bill, and some 400 Members of Parliament, including the Minister, want that. In so far as it lies to me-in lonely isolation as I am on the Opposition Benches-to make a point to the promoter of the Bill, I hope that he will act on the strong urging of the Committee that we need a finite campaign to produce a practical outcome in a defined period. That is now the only missing element from what has in all other respects become an excellent Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Simpson </B>(Nottingham, South): I offer some assurance and comfort to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell). I am not sure that we have an Opposition today. It was wonderful that, in all the areas that we explored in our first sitting, there was not a single instance of opposition to the Bill. The debate was about making improvements. I am glad that, in its wisdom, the Committee agreed to an extra sitting. A phenomenal amount of work has been done by the promoter of the Bill, the Minister and the civil servants to produce a much better new clause, with which I am certain we will be in agreement.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove is right that if we run the risk of anything, it is of being overly modest. The Government have already set timetables and deadlines for meeting some of the targets that will inevitably be included in the Bill. The Scottish Parliament has set itself the task of eliminating fuel povery within two Parliaments. In last week's Green Paper, the Government set themselves a target to ensure that all social housing is of a decent standard within 10 years. I believe that that time scale will be reduced. Far from feeling that we were overly ambitious in wanting to eradicate fuel poverty within 15 years, most of will be rapidly recalculating our position backwards to a much more achievable end date within a much shorter time.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I say that in a spirit of enthusiasm for and commitment to the Bill, and I hope that the Committee will reflect on what I have said. I believe that the Government will return with a shorter timetable. Subsections (1) and (2)(d) of new clause 3 require the Government to specify target dates before the end of the period of 12 months. An obligation will be built into the Bill to give a definite form to that period, although I would draw comfort from an actual figure being built into the Bill now.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, were the Government to return with a timetable that was longer than 15 years, it would be a cause of major dissatisfaction for members of the Committee?

<P>
<B>Mr. Simpson:</B> It would be a major cause of dissatisfaction; indeed, it would be a major embarrassment for many hon. Members who would be aware that such an announcement was fairly close to an impending election in which most of us would have an interest. It is unlikely, or unwise, to presume that anyone in his right mind would make such an announcement. I am genuinely optimistic that, whatever the announcement in a year's time, the period will be less than 15 years. We must bear in mind the Government's commitment, for example, to meeting the Kyoto targets. Such an agenda will accelerate, which is something that we shall applaud. I have no reservations about that.

<P>
At our previous sitting, we discussed the meaning of ``low income'' and ``lower income'' and how tortuous such provisions may become in terms of definition and as a point of political argument with communities that want their properties to receive better insulation. I tabled amendments (a), (b) and (c) to the new clause because the more that I thought about the matter, the more I felt that we were confusing targets and strategies. The Government of the day will always have at their disposal a range of strategies to meet certain targets. To try to identify what we would achieve by nailing ourselves to an income base of a strategic approach and targets may not help us. My amendments would remove the phrase ``on lower incomes''. They would give the Government and the interministerial group greater space to deal with the separate challenges of target dates and the strategies for delivering them. Some of those strategies may be income related, but others may not. In the debate on the money resolution that preceded the Committee stage, there was a great deal of discussion about the actual cost. In the hearings of the warm homes group, we went through the different forms of costings that might arise. It is by no means clear, inevitable or even desirable that all the costings should fall on the public purse.

<P>
I do not believe that the Chancellor will necessarily be the stumbling block in the process, because a mixed bag of strategies is being introduced to deal with fuel poverty and inefficiency in our housing stock. We already have new standards for new properties. The standard assessment procedure ratings have significantly raised home energy efficiency standards, and apply to all new properties built. We have also seen an extension of value added tax exemptions that applies to home insulation products, and I am sure that we shall have further discussions about the range of products that are to be included.

<P>
At the moment, the Government are discussing a new form of licensing for houses in multiple occupation and rented houses in the private sector. If a national licensing scheme is introduced, as I am fairly certain that it will be, I would be astonished if home energy efficiency standards were not built into licence conditions. The starting point is not an assessment of the income of the prospective tenants or owners; it is a presumption of an overriding duty and interest in lowering carbon emissions from domestic energy consumption. That is a powerful virtue.

<P>
The Minister may find, on reflection, that the interministerial team would have much greater flexibility if it did not always have to second guess what ``lower incomes'' meant. It would not be restricted by having an income framework to direct grant aid or home insulation project work around the country. There would be no framework to define the entire strategy, but the team would be able to set targets to be met in several different strategic ways.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will think about whether he would find it helpful to accept the amendments that would remove ``on lower incomes''. The interministerial team could introduce that in the strategy where appropriate in many other ways. It makes no sense for us to assume that the whole strategy needs to be nailed up against the ``on lower incomes'' test.

<P>
Each of the Bill's stages has pushed the warm homes agenda forward, and, almost like an early warning, has attempted to flag up to Ministers what will happen next. That is a tribute to the work being carried out around the country. We have paid tribute to the work of the Newark and Sherwood local authority, which set itself enormously impressive targets for the reduction of domestic energy consumption. It has been rightly praised as a leader in the field.

<P>
We may equally want to praise a programme called BedZED, the Beddington Zero Energy Development, which was designed by an architect called Bull Dunster. I would not know him if I fell over him, but I would be delighted to meet him. In his design for housing developments on brownfield sites, costing only £80,000 per house, there is a commitment to zero energy consumption and zero carbon emissions. That is a phenomenal achievement, and a triumph of the skills and ingenuity in this country and of our ability to harness these to Government programmes. It will allow us to prioritise zero energy and low carbon emission programmes in our national housing renewal and building strategy.

<P>
The Minister may see, in the next wave of private Member's Bills that comes his way, a push to get a wider commitment to such programmes from the interministerial group in our housing policy. There is nothing to prevent us from making those new designs on brownfield sites the benchmark against which we judge all forms of social, rented and privately owned properties. It would be a phenomenal realisation of our commitments to the Kyoto conference obligations.

<P>
Amendment (c) inserts the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and achieve the objectives and meet the targets set out therein.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment represents a grammatical tidying-up exercise. In the new clause, the Government accept the responsibility to take such steps as are, in their opinion, necessary to implement the strategy. That is not the same as delivering on the targets, and yet in earlier parts of the new clause they have committed themselves to the identification of targets. Gramatically, and in the spirit of the new clause, it would be helpful if we added that phrase. It would provide consistency between the commitments in subsection (4) and those in subsections (1) and (2). I hope that the Minister will agree that it strengthens those commitments and, along with amendments (a) and (b), widens the scope for determination by the interministerial group.

<P>
<B>Mrs Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): I want briefly to put on record my support for new clause 3. Much has already been said about the desire to have the 15-year target in that clause, and I do not want to repeat what has been said.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South mentioned the Kyoto targets. I am optimistic that the interministerial group will come up with a plan of action to implement the intentions of the Bill, but that optimism rests on meeting our target of eliminating child poverty, which we will have severe difficulty meeting without addressing fuel poverty. There are significant differences between households that spend from 5 to 7 per cent. of household income to keep their houses warm, and those in extreme and severe fuel poverty that have to spend from 20 to 30 per cent. of their income on heating their homes. However, I remain optimistic about that target.

<P>
As many members of the Committee know, I am also enthusiastic about eliminating pensioner poverty. The Government have introduced measures that will lift around 1 million pensioners out of poverty. There are huge differences in the housing conditions of those pensioners. Some live in well-insulated, sheltered housing and others in draughty, old, badly maintained properties, whether owned or rented.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I greatly welcome the fact that the team who created new clause 3 has, in subsection (2)(d), moved towards incorporating a specific target date for achieving the Bill's objectives-although I and others would like it to go further. I also hope that the interministerial group will pay attention to the strong feelings of the hon. Members who actively support the hon. Member for Southend, West in his Bill. The new clause constitutes a significant refinement because it creates a framework in which Members of Parliament can engage constructively with the work of the interministerial group in its consideration of what target to set and what definition of ``fuel poverty'' and ``lower income'' to use.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South proposes in his amendments (a) and (b) to new caluse 3 to delete the phrase ``on lower incomes''. I have much sympathy with his argument, but I am concerned that his amendment could leave the interministerial team with a significant challenge in creating a programme that would achieve the objective. The team should not have to expend much energy or time trying to meet what might be too vague a definition. I draw to my hon. Friend's attention the reference made in our previous sitting to the draft guidance from the Secretary of State to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. Individual MPs and the warm homes Bill group can make suggestions about how the current definition could be tightened. As well as having reference to the Bill, the interministerial group will take considerable notice of the mechanisms set up under the Utilities Bill for the Secretary of State to give draft guidance. We should create a more precise definition than the deletion proposed in the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South.

<P>
We have reached a significant milestone today. The Bill has some stages to go through, and we shall all have to work to ensure that it continues to make progress and has the support that it merits. The 15-year programme is the most important target, although it is not an ambitious one. Some members of the Committee will remember the campaign of the early 1970s, when my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks) was one of the first to discuss excess winter deaths. The measure of the Bill's success-the campaign will have been faulty if it takes 15 years-will be a reduction in the number of excess winter deaths. Last year, in my constituency, the number was 80, and in the city of Plymouth, it was 150. That is far too many.

<P>
The Bill is a significant milestone. I shall certainly support new clause 3, and I urge other hon. Members to do likewise.

<P>

<B>Ms Joan Walley </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, North): I thank the hon. Member for Southend, West and my hon. Friend the Minister for the huge progress that has been made in the past seven days. When we met a week ago, we genuinely feared that we might not be able to take the Bill forward. I recall saying to my hon. Friend the Minister that I was sure that he was capable of returning with an agreement that would enable us to make progress. He has done that, with everyone's support, and I congratulate both him and the hon. Member for Southend, West.

<P>
Last week, I discussed the Environmental Audit Committee's recommendation that fuel poverty should be treated like a national disaster and that we should take appropriate and immediate action. New clause 3 will enable us to do just that. Given the amount of work that we have done in the past seven days, I have great hopes that everyone involved in the new authority will be able to achieve an enormous amount in the next 12 months.

<P>
New clause 3 relates to preparing and publishing,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>before the end of the period of twelve months beginning with the relevant commencement, a strategy setting out the authority's policies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In those 12 months, an enormous amount of work needs to be done, at the same pace as the work that has been done in the past seven days. I hope that we shall ultimately have a set of intermediate targets and, therefore, not only the reasonable long-term objective, but the necessary short-term, year-on-year achievements and objectives, linked to specific Government initiatives, such as the comprehensive spending review, and the different commitments that each Department of State will have as a result of that comprehensive spending review, to ensure that money is targeted where it is most needed.

<P>
I hope that the scope for energy efficiency and the need to ensure that homes can be made warm will be a top objective in all future work and for every Department of State. The Secretary of State today announced the neighbourhood initiatives forum. We must ensure that, in tackling every aspect of neighbourhood renewal, we target homes and new builds that can transform neighbourhoods. We must emphasise the measures necessary to tackle social exclusion and consider opportunities for promoting warm homes.

<P>
Some time ago, I wrote to the Department of Health to ask whether its new guidance on energy efficiency could be included in the health improvement programme guidance. I received a reply dated 3 April from my hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health, the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), whcih states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Energy Efficiency is not explicitly referred to within the National Priorities Guidance but this does not detract from the importance this Government places on reducing fuel poverty and the inevitable impact this will have upon ill-health.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I realise that the Minister will be involved in the Department of Health's new modernised action team, but to make progress on promoting energy efficiency and warm homes, we must ensure that those future objectives of the Department of Health are included in the guidance. That will enable us to achieve not just joined-up rhetoric but joined-up action at every level of government. In reaching agreement on how the Bill can progress, the hon. Member for Southend, West has aided all of us who care deeply about this issue.

<P>
In my constituency, there are many elderly households, and many unnecessary winter deaths. Our housing stock is in need of repair and modernisation. The progress of the Bill will give hope to the many who feel that action cannot be taken soon enough. The culture must be changed to ensure that local authorities, housing authorities and housing associations have regard to the objectives of the Bill when plannig for the future. The issues that we have discussed must be considered as top priorities. I welcome new clause 3, and hope that the Bill makes fast and efficient progress. I look forward to the next milestones. I hope that the aim will be achieved within 15 years. By working together we have ensured that it is no longer a question of whether it will be done but how.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Chaytor </B>(Bury, North): I add my congratulations to the promoter of the Bill and the Minister for introducing the new clause. We now have a basis of consensus on which to proceed. I especially welcome the fact that the new clause specifies that the strategy must define various elements, which, last week, were left undefined-the households to which it applies, the measures that will be introduced, the interim objectives and the target date. However, the strategy is not required to define reasonable cost, on which I want to comment briefly.

<P>
I acknowledge the comments my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South on the need for the strategy to apply to all households. I welcome the Minister's commitment that the strategy will apply not only to households on benefit, but to other households. It is likely that new clause 3 will apply to households in full or part-time work that are just above the benefit threshold.

<P>
I want to reiterate the argument that I tried to make last week on the impact of regional disparities in income and housing costs. I do not want to argue that there is a north-south divide, because, as we all know, such a divide does not exist: there are merely regional variations. One of the most striking regional variations is in housing costs, especially during the past two years, and generally during the past 15 years. For example, the average cost of a small terraced house in my constituency is a quarter of the cost of a similar property in the south-east. I acknowledge that there are income variations, which, as the hon. Member for Hazel Grove pointed out, compensate for disparities in housing costs to some extent. However, the reality is that the difference in incomes between the north-west and the south-east is nowhere near as great as the difference in housing costs. Therefore, given that some of the households included within the terms of reference of the strategy will be trying to buy their own home, disposable income in low-income households in the south-east will often be less than disposable income in similar households in, for example, the north-west. Therefore, if we defined reasonable cost-we shall at least have to establish some criteria for it-on a crude percentage of disposable income, whether 10 per cent. or whatever, low-income housheolds in the south-east would be much more likely to hit that threshold than similar households in the north-west.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
There is less need for energy efficiency measures in the south-east, where, by and large, the climate is less severe than in the north. I recognise that the problem is not included in new clause 3-I merely flag it up as a problem-but we could create an anomaly whereby it was easier to pass the threshold in parts of the country where the effect of climate and temperature was less severe, and there was less need for support. That point is extremely important.

<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> I am carefully following my hon. Friend's argument, which has some merit. Does he acknowledge that people in the south-west have the highest water bills in the country? On average, they are £100 more per annum than elsewhere. Significant factors other than basic affordable housing costs affect disposable income.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would not encourage the hon. Gentleman to go too far down that road.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I am happy to accept my hon. Friend's point, and to include the south-west as a part of the country where the climate is more severe than in the south-east. We could spend a long time stating the case for our own regions, and I do not want to do that. If we see the Bill entirely as a poverty alleviation measure, the establishment of the criterion of a strict percentage of net disposable income is probably acceptable. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South made the point forcefully, however, that, if we see the Bill also as an energy conservation measure, the strict percentage of net disposable income will exclude certain categories of households in regions where the need for energy conservation is equally if not more important.

<P>
I take your guidance, Mr. Gale, that we do not need to go into the subject in detail at this point, but I feel particularly strongly about it. Regional variations exist. In considering the strategy and how the reasonable cost will be defined, it is important to ensure that we do not allow such anomalies to be built into the final programme.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I should deal with a couple of points that I did not touch on in my opening remarks. I appreciate the constructive spirit in which the debate has taken place, and my heart lifted when I heard what my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South said. Cheerful fellow though he is, it is not every day that we hear genuine optimism from him. As he said, a lot of progress is likely to be made through building regulations, standards that we will set for houses to be built in the future, and-I make no commitment on the matter-regulation on houses with multiple occupation.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) mentioned the involvement of the Department of Health. Health Ministers sit on the interministerial group, and they are considering the impact of fuel policies on health. As I said in my opening remarks, we do not limit the definition of lower incomes to people on benefit. The use of the term in new clause 3 is intended to reflect the recent consultation on the home energy efficiency scheme, which identified differences of opinion on the definition of fuel poverty. Amendments (a) and (b), tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South, take that a step further by requiring that every household, regardless of circumstances, be included in the fuel poverty strategy. Improving every home could entail an enormous diversion of resources from the many other programmes that we have to manage. Such a project would not be costed-and would not, in fact, remove every household from fuel poverty. There will always be people who live in large houses that they cannot afford to keep warm but from which they do not wish to move, for reasons that may be understandable. We have no desire to insist that such people should move. The proposals in new clause 3 would leave the ministerial group free to agree on the most appropriate definition. I hope that my hon. Friend will agree not to press his amendments.

<P>
Amendment (c) proposes the insertion of the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and achieve the objectives and meet the targets set out therein.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, in preparing the strategy we will be required to specify objectives and targets. When the strategy is implemented, steps will have to be taken to meet its targets and objectives. That will be obligatory. It would therefore be superfluous to include a reference in subsection (4) to ``targets'', thereby repeating the wording of subsection (2). I am advised that such repetition could lead to misinterpretation, with the repeated wording being given a purpose that we do not anticipate or require. I hope that my hon. Friend will therefore accept that amendment (c) is unnecessary.

<P>
I repeat my appreciation of the constructive spirit of the debate and thank those who have been involved, particularly those who have worked on the changes that have occurred over the past week-changes that demonstrate that we are a listening Government. Our overall aim is to leave targets and definitions in the hands of the ministerial group. I am glad that we have reached a formula that reconciles the ambitions of the hon. Member for Southend, West and all members of the Committee with those of the Government.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Section (Strategy relating to fuel poverty) shall not come into force as respects Wales until such day as the National Assembly for Wales may by order made by statutory instrument appoint.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment requires the National Assembly of Wales to pass a statutory instrument to trigger the commencement of the Bill in Wales. After our debate on Second Reading, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) referred to money for Wales. We have now sorted that out, so it is up to him and his friends in the Welsh Assembly to drive forward the Bill so that it delivers warm homes to his constituents.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor </B>(North-West Leicestershire): I apologise to the Committee for not being here at the beginning of our sitting. I had an Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall.

<P>
The Bill is weaker in respect of Wales than members of the Committee would like. Adequate research into fuel poverty has yet to be conducted. Although the Bill will extend to Wales, the appropriate authority for Wales is not yet in a position to draw up the strategy. Given that the appropriate authority will have to implement the strategy, will the Minister confirm that the block grant will be adjusted to reflect that requirement? Fuel poverty is a scandal, which should be ended. The principle applies as much to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales as it does to England. I want to ensure that the implementation of the measure will not be hampered in Wales because of restrictions on financial resources that must reflect the responsibilities of the new Assembly. Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am not in a position to dole out money to Wales. We have discussed matters with colleagues in the National Assembly for Wales and the situation there is not as advanced as it is elsewhere. I reassure the Committee that it is not intended that nothing is to happen in Wales. On the contrary, there is little point in making a provision that the National Assembly has no hope of meeting at the moment. We must reflect the different positions in England and Wales, and the amendment proposes such a solution. I apologise to my hon. Friend because I cannot give him the answer that he seeks off the top of my head.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Simpson:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
I hesitate before incurring the wrath of further praise from the Minister, but I want to give the Committee an opportunity to reflect on the important issue of how this Parliament works in relation to the increasing devolution of responsibility to other assemblies. I want to help my hon. Friend. We may have further opportunities to discuss the helpful nature of my contribution on our bus journeys home at the end of the evening. One of the problems experienced by hon. Members in the campaign to eradicate fuel poverty and avoidable winter deaths was that reporting data is increasingly difficult as devolved assemblies take greater responsibilities. I have no difficulty with them doing so, but Parliament will have to address an area of uncertainty-to all practical intents and purposes, the assemblies are still dependent on block grant funding from the UK Parliament. It is right for them to decide their own strategies on how to address different problems, but the relationship between the UK Parliament and the work of devolved assemblies in meeting overall targets and objectives for the United Kingdom as a whole must be clarified.

<P>
Under new clause 2, the Secretary of State is required to publish a report each year, which must include Ministers'assessments of the costs of complying with the Bill's targets and objectives in the different assemblies. The report must also include a ministerial assessment of changes, which may be necessary from time to time, in relation to the provision of moneys to the different assemblies to meet the overall targets and objectives. That is not intended to be unhelpful, as Parliament must address the issue. I am not fearful about that. In the face of increasing devolution of responsibilities, there must be honesty about the distribution of moneys to meet targets. There must also be an assessment of the way in which different approaches dovetail together. We must have a strategy that makes overall sense, even if different parts of the country have different approaches or priorities. The carving up of the United Kingdom financial cake must also be appropriate to meeting different strategies in different Assemblies.

<P>
I do not intend to press the matter to a vote. That would be unhelpful, as there has been so much unity in the Committee. However, I emphasise that the Government must address this issue. I hope that the Minister will indicate the Government's strategic thinking on the balance of devolved responsibilities and rights and overall UK parliamentary duties to carve up a national Exchequer cake. The framework must hold policies together in a coherent hole, instead of a series of fragments. Otherwise, a danger exists that policies will move not only in disparate but contradictory directions.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> Does my hon. Friend acknowledge that our colleagues in the Scottish Labour party have already set a target of eliminating fuel poverty within two Parliaments? In that respect, Scotland can alredy be considered to be ahead of England, although the detailed strategy of objectives, interim targets and measures to implement them is lacking. Does new clause 2 reflect that?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simpson:</B> I am aware of that, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the matter. That is one of the dimensions about which we must be more open. I would not have a problem if Scotland were to set itself a shorter time scale for tackling the problems of fuel poverty that it faces. That would seem a perfectly legitimate decision for the Scottish Parliament to take, but it would have resource implications for the roles and responsibilities of this Parliament. I do not object to those implications, but we must be far more open and honest. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to understand that what would allow us to respect the integrity of the different assemblies while binding us to an overall strategic commitment would be a willingness on the part of the Government of the day to report to the House, spelling out the resource implications and how the resource allocation and the prioriteis and strategies pursued in the different assemblies will work together.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Nottingham, South carefully contained his remarks to the Bill. I remind hon. Members that that is what we are debating. It is not an excuse or an opportunity to engage in a wider debate about the gamut of evolution from A to Z.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> That certainly enables me to make a comparatively short contribution to the debate. The hon. Member for Nottingham, South raises an interesting issue. The new clause relates to an entirely different topic, and, as you, Mr. Gale, suggested, the broad reach of the proposal goes far beyond what is necessary for the Bill to be implemented effectively and transgresses many of the principles of devolution. Under the new clause, the Secretary of State would not have a duty to present information about England, which just happens to be the area for which he is primarily responsible. It invites-indeed, it instructs-him to present his assessment of, rather than merely report, the cost of the Scottish, Welsh or Northern Ireland Administrations. In the final paragraph, the new clause states that the purpose of subsection (b) is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in order that these bodies may meet the costs assessed under paragraph (a) above.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That rather assumes that all the costs discovered in paragraph (a) will be met from public funds. Previously, the hon. Member for Nottingham, South suggested that they would not, and many of us believe that that is not a necessary consequence. It rather casually builds in a renegotiation of the Barnett formula, which I should have thought well beyond the normal scope of a private Member's Bill relating to home insulation. I do not want to go too far, but since coming to the House, I found myself, rather to my surprise, consistently aligned with the hon. Member for Nottingham, South on a wide range of issues. However, on this issue he is well wide of the mark, and I was delighted to hear that he does not intend to press the new clause to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Member for Hazel Grove put his finger on several relevant points. The new clause goes well beyond the scope of what the Bill is designed to achieve. In some ways, it is rather strange, not least because the Bill will not apply to Scotland. The allocation of such funds is a matter for the devolved Administrations, taking account of need and other demands on funds, and it would be inappropriate for the Secretary of State to direct the resource allocation to, or within, devolved Administrations. We expect each to take decisions in the light of local circumstances. I propose that the amendment be resisted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Simpson:</B> I am happy to have placed the amendment on the agenda for probing and discussion purposes, but I did not intend to press it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
