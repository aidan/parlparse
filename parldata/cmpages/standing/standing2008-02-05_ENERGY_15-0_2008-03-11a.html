earlier contains the two words &#147;nuclear&#148; and

little. Given the track record of the nuclear industry for secrecy and
lack of disclosure, can he assure us that the scope of the clause
literally covers national security and so on and that it will in no way
give greater secrecy to commercial and other matters that enable us to
scrutinise either the companies or the Government&#146;s nuclear

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000419"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Before lunch, I was making the important point that
the Energy Act 2004 resulted in a major restructuring of the nuclear
industry, whereby sensitive nuclear information pertaining to uranium
enrichment could be taken and stored away from the two sites designated
as prohibited places under the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column594" />Column number: 594</div>Nuclear Installations Act 1965. It would help the Committee if I
emphasised the word &#147;information&#148;. We are talking about
information, not materials. Materials must be kept on a licensed site.
There are clear requirements for the holders of sensitive nuclear
information and what they must do to protect it.</div>
					<a name="080311136000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee can be reassured that the security regulator&#151;the
Office for Civil Nuclear Security&#151;is content that the
requirements are both sufficient and up to date. The Bill proposes no
change to the requirements. However, the Office for Civil Nuclear
Security is concerned that, should an individual steal, or attempt to
steal, sensitive nuclear information from premises that are not
currently designated a prohibited place, the only sanctions available
are prosecution for burglary or theft. I recognise that appropriate
penalties are available for the usual offences of theft or burglary.
However, I hope that the Committee will agree that theft and the
potential onward dissemination of information that relates to uranium
enrichment represents a risk to our nation&#146;s security, so such
matters warrant different
treatment.</div>
					<a name="080311136000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulator has therefore requested that the theft of sensitive nuclear
information be punishable by stronger penalties. My view and that of
the regulator is that the Official Secrets Act 1911 provides
appropriate protection in such matters of national security. An offence
under the Official Secrets Act carries a maximum prison term of 14
years, but the provisions also remove the requirement on the state to
prove that the person broke into that prohibited place for a purpose
that would compromise the security interests of the
state.</div>
					<a name="080311136000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
designate specific premises as prohibited places, they must either be
owned or occupied by the Crown or deemed as belonging to, or used for
the purposes of, the Crown. Clause 86 will therefore insert proposed
new section 80A into the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001,
which governs issues relating to the security of uranium enrichment
information and technology. The proposed new section will allow for
premises holding equipment, software or information that relates to
uranium enrichment to be deemed as belonging to the Crown for the
purposes of the Official Secrets Act. As a result, the Secretary of
State may designate premises holding information that relates to
uranium enrichment as prohibited places under that Act. That will
provide more appropriate sanctions for theft or attempted theft of that
information. The clause represents an important part of protecting our
national
security.</div>
					<a name="080311136000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
answer to the hon. Member for Northavon, let me say that sensitive
nuclear information that relates to uranium enrichment that is held on
licensed civil nuclear sites is already covered by the Official Secrets
Act. It is only right that we ensure that consistent sanctions are
available for sensitive nuclear information that is stored or used off
licensed civil nuclear sites&#151;for example, at research
facilities. The Official Secrets Act is the only appropriate
legislation for issues of national security. Given the implications for
national security, the sanctions under the Act are the most
appropriate; they are a minimum of three and a maximum of 14 years in
prison.</div>
					<a name="080311136000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
scope of the clause that I have outlined, I hope that I have put at
rest the fears of the hon. Member for Northavon. To answer his question
in a little more detail, I suppose that he is really asking whether the
clause applies only to national security 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column595" />Column number: 595</div>issues. The answer is yes. The clause will apply only to persons who
steal sensitive nuclear information, where the sanctions are those
under the Official Secrets
Act.</div>

						<a name="080311136000420"></a>
							<b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): This is clearly
an important clause that deals with serious issues. Normally, we would
have let this sort of thing go through without further discussion or
debate. At the heart of the clause seems to be the rather quaint notion
that Government secrets are kept in the places where they are supposed
to be and are not sent to the United States, lost in the post or
dropped on roundabouts somewhere in the west country. We must consider
at exactly which places are covered by such establishments. Clearly,
there is an issue when material is in transit. If material is being
moved from one of the establishments that the Minister mentioned to
research laboratories elsewhere, is it protected while in transit? What
happens if some of that material goes
astray?</div>
					<a name="080311136000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000421"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I am sorry to intervene so soon, but I hope that
the hon. Gentleman has taken on board the fact that the clause deals
with information, not nuclear
materials.</div>
					<a name="080311136000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000422"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I totally understand that. The Government have not
so far managed to lose nuclear materials, but they have lost an awful
lot of information in various places. If the information is held on a
computer disc or a laptop, what happens if it goes astray once it is in
transit or someone gains access to it who should not have access to it?
What happens in relation to international establishments? The companies
that are likely to build the new nuclear power plants are either
Arriva, which is French, or Westinghouse, which is American. There are
a couple of alternatives, but those are the likely ones. If an issue
required close investigation, it is quite possible that that would
involve sending the information to an overseas base to be analysed and
investigated further. What protection do the Government have for the
security of information in those circumstances? Does the clause cover
material that is held in different
countries?</div>
					<a name="080311136000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000423"></a>Mr.
Binley:
						</b> I wish to carry my hon.
Friend&#146;s argument just a little further. I agree with the
Minister that this is a very important clause. I recognise that what we
are really doing is carrying on from the restructuring of the Energy
Act 2004, but other factors have come to light since the creation of
that Act with regard to the safe handling of information. I do not wish
to bring up the incidents that have been a great cause of concern to
the Government, but we are talking about stronger sanctions for theft
and attempted theft under the clause. However, nothing is said about
people who lose information, do not follow protocols and are
incompetent, negligent or whatever, thereby allowing information to go
astray or to fall into undesirable hands.</div>
					<a name="080311136000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not suggest that we have
penal sanctions for those offences&#151;I see them as
offences&#151;but there ought to be some consideration of the matter
and some tightening up of protocols and of how we keep information
safely, especially in this important area. Would the Minister consider
that viewpoint, too? It is not covered in the
clause.</div>
					<a name="080311136000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000424"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Our purpose is to make sure of the most stringent
controls on the holders of information, to ensure that sensitive
nuclear information is safeguarded. That is the purpose of the clause.
It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column596" />Column number: 596</div>relates to information, not materials, that could be held in different
kinds of establishments, including research establishments. We have to
make sure that we have a regime in place. I have emphasised the
importance of the Official Secrets Act and the appropriate terms of
imprisonment. Also, the Office for Civil Nuclear Security, which is the
security regulator, is satisfied with the requirements that we are
putting in
place.</div>
					<a name="080311136000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
might need to correspond with the hon. Members for Wealden and for
Northampton, South about issues such as whether the information might
go to companies registered abroad. I will have to write to them. The
issue raised by the hon. Member for Northampton, South is obviously
vital, in that everyone in the workplace&#151;everyone
involved&#151;should be absolutely vigilant and follow proper
procedures. I am sure that that happens and that we have a rigorous
regime in place. At the next opportunity, when I talk to the Office for
Civil Nuclear Security, I will take to it the Committee&#146;s
concerns.</div>
					<a name="080311136000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080311136000425"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Stephen Ladyman</b> (South Thanet) (Lab): My reading of the
clause suggests that it pertains to inserting into a clause of a
terrorism Act something that relates only to the enrichment of uranium.
The clause is narrowly restricted to secrets and information about the
enrichment of uranium. It goes no wider than that. Concerns by the
Liberal Democrats that other information might be hidden are certainly
outside the scope of the clause; likewise, the exchange of information
about the construction of commercial
reactors.</div>
					<a name="080311136000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000426"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> That is helpful. I will return to
some of the issues about sanctions. I have given a broad answer. I am
advised that existing regulations&#151;the Uranium Enrichment
Technology (Prohibition on Disclosure) Regulations 2004 and the Nuclear
Industries Security Regulations 2003&#151;already cover the duties
and responsibilities of those who hold such information and deal with
sanctions. I am advised that, if information were to get lost in
transit, sufficient protections are available on the holders of
information on site, off site or in transit. However, I take the point
about human error. Everyone needs to be absolutely
vigilant.</div>
					<a name="080311136000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
places covered are those where research into uranium enrichment
technology is undertaken. The technology represents a proliferation
risk and needs to be appropriately protected, in line with our
international obligations and our national security. Supply chain
companies that manufacture parts for uranium enrichment technology are
also
covered.</div>
					<a name="080311136000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the question of whether such information could be transferred overseas
and how it would then be protected, I am advised that that could be
done only with agreement on how it would be protected by the receiving
authority. Our duty would be to be satisfied with that protection. I
hope that I have satisfied the
Committee.</div>

Hendry:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="080311136000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had an exciting few moments&#151;democracy in action. We now
understand why we are trying to teach countries around the world that
they should move towards democracy; it is so that they can go through
that rather special moment where people who have spent years arguing
for things then turn around and vote against them when they are given
the opportunity to do so.</div>
					<a name="080311136000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of a renewable heat
obligation was raised by many colleagues on Second Reading and by a
number of people who have made representations to us about the fact
that heat should be included in the Bill. A renewable heat obligation
would require energy suppliers to source a percentage of heating fuel
from a range of renewable sources, which could include solid, liquid or
gaseous fuels produced from biomass, passive solar heating systems and
geothermal systems.</div>
					<a name="080311136000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">About 50 per cent. of the
UK&#146;s final energy demand is in space, water and process heating.
Around 1 per cent. of heat is currently generated from renewables. That
has declined in recent years, both as a proportion of the whole and in
absolute terms, as some industrial wood-fired systems have been
decommissioned because of tightened emission regulations. Around 85 per
cent. of domestic heat, 50 per cent. of industrial heat and 77 per
cent. of commercial heat is provided by gas, with the remainder coming
from coal and oil.</div>
					<a name="080311136000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Heat is
responsible for 47 per cent. of the UK&#146;s CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>emissions and, broken down by sector, roughly 42 per cent. of
those emissions come from the residential sector, 43 per cent. from
industry and 15 per cent. from commerce. By providing more heat from
renewable heat technologies, we could deliver carbon savings of 7.3
million tonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> by 2020. The biomass taskforce
estimated that 7 per cent. of the UK&#146;s heat energy could be
provided from biomass alone. A successful example of a community
heating scheme is in Tower Hamlets, which uses a gas-fired combined
heat and power plant to provide heat and electricity at 20 per cent.
below the cheapest supplier, saving 2,500 tonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> a
year.</div>
					<a name="080311136000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">More than two
thirds of the energy output to power stations is lost as waste heat.
That waste costs the UK economy more than &#163;5 billion a year. It
is clear that if our EU targets are to be met, a dedicated support
mechanism for renewable heat will be needed. The introduction of an
obligation on upstream suppliers of fossil fuels into the transport
market creates a precedent for the same sort of mechanism to be applied
in the fossil fuel heat market. That could give a steadily increasing
incentive to generate cost-efficient renewable heat with a buy-out and
recycle mechanism to address the potential for price spikes and provide
a means for addressing any under-supply issues. Linking all three
markets would enable renewables targets to be met with maximum economic
efficiency.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000494"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> As the person who in a previous
life introduced renewable transport fuel obligations, I point out to
the hon. Gentleman that many non-governmental organisations and
environmental activists have now decided that they oppose that
introduction because one cannot guarantee that the biomass will be
produced sustainably. The Government have taken the sensible 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column601" />Column number: 601</div>decision that 5 per cent. can produced sustainably, but they will not go
beyond that until we can prove that it can be produced sustainably. If
we were to pass the new clause, it would require the Government to do
something that they cannot guarantee to do sustainably, and would
therefore be far from a green solution to our
problems.</div>
					<a name="080311136000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000495"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a valid point. Indeed,
my colleagues voted against the RTFO on the grounds that one was not
sure about the sustainability of the sources from which it was coming.
I wanted to stimulate a debate about heat and about the whole of issue
of energy, which has been missing from the debate so far and is missing
from the Bill. Looking at it in this way provides the opportunity to
address how we will do more to get heat from renewable sources. There
are issues, such as the one that he has raised, which provide a
challenge to going forward in this way, but that does not negate the
importance of trying to do more to get more of our heat from renewable
sources than we do at the moment.
</div>
					<a name="080311136000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
observers say that, to encourage the development of low-carbon heating,
local authorities should be mandated to develop a local energy strategy
for heating. In areas with sufficient heat density that would be
district heating, which would use the heat demand in public sector
buildings to underpin its development. Under such a scheme, planners
will be given the power to insist upon district heating, local CHP and
other forms of decentralised energy, including microgeneration, in
granting permission for developments. A study by the Energy Saving
Trust found that in 2000, 83 per cent. of energy usage in the home was
for space and water heating. That excludes electric water heating and
still represents about 24 per cent. of total UK energy
consumption.</div>
					<a name="080311136000379"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="080311136000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike
mainland Europe, the UK market for low-carbon and renewable heating
remains underdeveloped due to the lack of a coherent strategy. For
example, there is no policy to promote the use of renewable heat. The
Government have set a target that all new homes should be zero carbon
by 2016. The 83 per cent. of energy that a typical home consumes to
provide space and water heating breaks down into 59 per cent. for
heating and 24 per cent. for hot water. A newly built house with good
standards of insulation can reduce heating requirements by about 75 per
cent.</div>
					<a name="080311136000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause offers one way forward to encourage the generation of more
heat from renewable sources. It has significant backing in industry,
but I recognise that there are concerns. Essentially, it is a probing
new clause to stimulate further clarification from the Minister of what
he thinks could be done on this issue. For example, the question of the
interaction with the renewable obligation has not yet been addressed
properly. Effectively setting two administered prices for biomass under
the renewable obligation and the renewable heat obligation will have a
potentially disruptive effect on the outlook for investment in biomass
power and combined heat and power. Some say that that is also highly
unlikely to deliver investment in the heat network infrastructure. Only
investment in the boiler or other heating plant would occur as a result
of that obligation.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column602" />Column number: 602</div>
					<a name="080311136000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The critical factor in
establishing a competitive alternative to gas in the heating market is
this infrastructure. I realise that there are problems with this way
forward, but I hope that it will give the Minister and other hon.
Members the opportunity to talk about what more we can do to address
heat within the framework of the
Bill.</div>

							<b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): It is a pleasure to be serving
under your stewardship again, Mrs.
Humble.</div>
					<a name="080311136000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is a very welcome probing clause. There are some difficulties
with it and the hon. Member for Wealden has been generous enough to
point some of those out. However, it certainly deals with an issue that
needs to be
addressed.</div>
					<a name="080311136000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure how many members of the Committee have installed renewable
heat. I have, but it was a bit of a nightmare process. I have solar
thermal panels fitted to my house. I looked to the predecessor of the
low-carbon buildings programme and discovered that grants were in
rather short supply. I realised very early on that it would be
virtually impossible to be one of the few lucky runners who manage to
secure a grant each month. I discovered that there was a rather
bureaucratic process for the approval of various heating systems and
supplies. The kind of heating system that I wanted, which included
under-floor heating as well as heated water, did not at that time
qualify for the Government scheme. In practice, I therefore had to take
the risk of going with a somewhat untested supplier. It was quite an
expensive process. It was one that I was willing to invest in, but for
many members of the population, it would have been pretty
unaffordable.</div>
					<a name="080311136000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">A real
push is needed to shake down the market and establish leading household
names as popular suppliers of renewable heat technologies of various
kinds at the micro, household level. Costs must also be brought down to
make it a more affordable technology. We need to tackle those
issues.</div>
					<a name="080311136000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Wealden said, 47 per cent. of our carbon emissions
derive in one way or another from heating. Of that, 12 per cent. is
from heat generated by electricity so there is a direct link back to
electricity generation. Of the remaining 35 per cent. of direct
heating, a very high proportion comes from gas and fossil fuels. We
definitely need a long-term framework of financial incentives to
incentivise not just individuals at household level and energy
suppliers, but communities, social enterprises and others to take
advantage of technologies such as combined heat and power. The
low-carbon buildings programme is effectively a broken reed and a dead
duck, and nothing from the Government has yet supplied it. I am tempted
to use another horse racing analogy and say that it has fallen at an
early fence. We certainly need some kind of incentive scheme to promote
renewable heat at community level, where it is most
effective.</div>
					<a name="080311136000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support
the new clause, but there are some aspects that I would like to
challenge. First, subsection (2) states that the provision would only
require</div>
					<a name="080311136000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;suppliers of
fossil fuels for the purposes of heating, to replace, over a specified
period, a rising proportion of their supply with metered units of
renewable heat energy.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column603" />Column number: 603</div>
					<a name="080311136000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, if one looks at the large
proportion of heat that is supplied by the generation of electricity,
one will see that there are electricity suppliers, such as my own,
Ecotricity, that do not have any fossil fuel supply. It is an entirely
renewable supplier, so it would not benefit from any incentive under
that phraseology because it is not a fossil fuel supplier, even though
it is not a supplier of renewable heat as such. To shift and
incentivise the market towards renewable heat, we need something a
little more inclusive.</div>
					<a name="080311136000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also the problem of
the interplay between the renewable heat obligation and the renewables
obligation. That needs to be worked out, as it is not clear how that
would work with regard to the energy suppliers. As the hon. Member for
Wealden mentioned, the Combined Heat and Power Association argues that
one of the most critical elements in getting combined heat and power
off the ground at community level is the need to build local
infrastructure. That is what makes the critical difference in
establishing it as an alternative to gas. I am not clear how the new
clause would take us forward on that, so perhaps he will address that
point in his closing remarks.</div>
					<a name="080311136000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, there is the issue of
sustainability, which was raised by the hon. Member for South Thanet. I
do not think that that is as much of a problem as there would be with
liquid transport biofuels, where there is clearly a big concern about
sustainability. I think that a great deal of local heat technology and
the use of local biomass from waste products is probably very
sustainable, but he is right to say that we need to be sure that
certification and the methodologies are in place. I support the new
clause and think that it is a welcome probing clause. It asks the most
important question: if it is not exactly the right formula, what is and
what will the Government do?</div>
					<a name="080311136000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister, on
this one occasion, will not promise us yet more consultation exercises,
because we have been discussing renewable energy and heat of various
kinds in this country for decades and have had endless consultations.
He should aim&#151;I shall venture to suggest another horse racing
analogy&#151;to be the Kauto Star of British Politics in that area at
least and forge ahead in a really proactive way, rather than just
resting on his laurels having won one Gold cup and indulging in yet
more consultation. It is clear that we need a long-term financial
framework, and if not this one, then
what?</div>
					<a name="080311136000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="080311136000497"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): I strongly
support some form of heat obligation or similar, because it is
important that we take account of that large area of UK energy,
particularly in the context of the 2020 targets that have now been
agreed for renewable energy. I support the idea in principle, but the
new clause, as has been pointed out, seems to confuse itself
substantially with the existing renewables obligation, particularly in
its later provisions, and that would need to be fundamentally
disentangled.</div>
					<a name="080311136000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
consider further the idea, which was raised in the Committee earlier,
of pursuing some form of renewable gas obligation as a substantial
proxy for elements of renewable heat obligation because of the
substantial part of our heat requirements that is fuelled by gas. I
also ought to report to the Committee the sad news that I already have
renewable heat on my roof, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column604" />Column number: 604</div>nothing whatsoever went wrong with the installation, the application for
a grant to assist in the installation or its working. I know that that
is a surprise to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="080311136000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000498"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> Perhaps I should start by declaring an interest,
because I have just realised that my home is equipped for burning
renewable fuel, as defined by the clause. I have a beautiful house that
was built in 1714. It has a huge inglenook fireplace in which logs are
the only sensible thing to burn.</div>
					<a name="080311136000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000499"></a>Dr.

						</b> It is a biomass heat
station.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000500"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> Indeed. Were we to pass the new clause, my
excellent log supplier would be able to claim renewable obligation
certificates, which he would sell to the local coal merchant and reduce
the price of my logs. So I suddenly feel attracted to the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="080311136000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, I want to emphasise sustainability. There is always a temptation
to think that if 5 per cent. of something is good, 10 per cent. must be
twice as good. The European Commission has fallen into that trap, where
biofuels are concerned. It assumes that because 5 per cent. can be
produced renewably, 10 per cent. must be much better. If it cannot be
guaranteed that that biomass is produced sustainably and that someone
is not cutting down a rain forest or displacing food production to
provide it, the carbon benefit of burning that biomass is
negative.</div>
					<a name="080311136000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">After a lot
of soul searching and calculations, the Government concluded that we
can be confident of producing 5 per cent. of our transport fuel
renewably from sustainable biomass production. They went through a
great consultation and put huge effort into getting a set of criteria
that will guarantee that the material is produced sustainably. I am
confident that the renewable transport fuel obligation, as it stands,
will have a sustainable net carbon benefit. Go beyond that 5 per cent.,
however, either to produce transport fuel or to produce a source of
biomass for heat production, and it cannot be guaranteed that that will
be produced sustainably. It may be that we can work out a way of doing
that in the
future.</div>
					<a name="080311136000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is unfair
to criticise too much, because the hon. Member for Wealden has made it
clear that it is a probing new clause that is intended to stimulate
debate. I support that intention. I would certainly like to see better
ways of producing heat, but it should not be assumed that biomass and
waste, and all the other things mentioned in the contributions, have
not already been taken into account in calculating how much renewable
transport fuel we can produce. They have been taken into account. We
already assume that some of that transport fuel will come from waste
sources.</div>

							<a name="080311136000501"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is knowledgeable on the
subject. Is he aware of the analysis by the Swiss Government, who have
already set a framework for analysing whether biofuels are sustainable?
That analysis places things such as soya and the American wheat
industry at the most unsustainable end of the spectrum. Local biomass,
however, is by and large sustainable, and makes a positive contribution
to carbon reduction.</div>

							<a name="080311136000502"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> It may be that for small
countries local biomass production can be a sustainable source of
biomass. We are not a small country. We already have 34 million
vehicles on the roads. Five per cent. of our road transport fuel is a
huge amount of fuel and will require a huge amount of sustainable
biomass. At this point, nobody is able to guarantee that anything more
than that 5 per cent. can be produced sustainably. I agree that there
are ways of calculating whether biomass is sustainable, but there is no
international agreement yet on any of them. I hope we will have an
international agreement soon. Whereas I am four square behind getting
my hon. Friend the Minister to think about those issues, and behind
moving to a position where we can contribute towards heat production
from biomass, I counsel the Committee not to push the Government too
fast down that road because they already have a huge task of ensuring
that the renewable transport fuel obligation is delivered
sustainably.</div>

Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for
Broxtowe, who, by convention, cannot speak on these occasions, for
helping me with that part of the script. I will not follow the hon.

the hon. Member for Cheltenham has installed solar panels; that is a
very worthy and interesting experience. I am bound to say that, given
his party&#146;s opposition to most forms of energy, including
nuclear and fossil fuels, and given that his party comrades have
objected to wind farm after wind farm, I have a horrible feeling that
he has installed solar panels out of some optimistic belief that the
Liberal Democrats might form a Government and that that will be his
family&#146;s only form of

					</div>
					<a name="080311136000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Energy
consumed for heating accounts for about 40 per cent. of the UK&#146;s
primary energy consumption. We have heard about the considerable
proportion of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>that it produces. Heat is produced and
used by a huge number of consumers, ranging from individual
householders to very large industrial plants. In thinking about
tackling climate change, heat is clearly a sector that we cannot afford
to ignore. The Government already have a number of policies in place to
tackle emissions from heat, including the European Union emissions
trading scheme, energy efficiency measures generally and fuel poverty
initiatives.</div>
					<a name="080311136000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
programmes such as the low-carbon building programme, the energy
efficiency commitment and, in future, the carbon emissions reduction
target, we are focusing on improving the energy efficiency of
dwellings, thereby reducing demand for heat. A third of the emissions
savings estimated from the measures set out in the energy White Paper
will result from energy efficiency policies, and much of that will
relate to reductions in heat demand. Most of the estimated 100,000
microgenerators in the UK&#151;including our colleague&#151;are
using renewable heat technologies such as solar and ground source
heating.</div>
					<a name="080311136000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our minds,
however, are increasingly focused on renewable heat, particularly given
the EU target of 20 per cent. of our energy in Europe coming from
renewables by 2020. We need to do more to tackle heat emissions if we
are to meet that challenging target. The Prime Minister, in his speech
to the WWF in November last year, announced that we will do more and
introduce measures as part of the renewable energy strategy next
summer.</div>
					<a name="080311136000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that
reason, I am sympathetic to the intentions behind the new clause,
tabled by the hon. Member for Wealden. It would require the Secretary
of State to introduce a renewable heat obligation, which would require
suppliers of fossil fuel heating to source an increasing proportion of
their fuels from renewables. However, I am sure that the Committee will
not be surprised to hear me say that I believe that it is premature to
amend the Bill in that way. Tackling carbon dioxide emissions from heat
is not straightforward. Any step to encourage greater use of renewable
heating options would need to consider a wide range of factors,
including the different needs of various customer groups and the large
range of technologies available, each of which has different
potentials, costs and practical implications with regard to the type of
support that would deliver the best
outcomes.</div>
					<a name="080311136000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in
the middle of reviewing our policy on heat, and the new clause would
pre-empt that work. Last year&#146;s energy White Paper,
&#147;Meeting the Energy Challenge&#148;, restated the
Government&#146;s commitment to decarbonising heat and to increasing
the use of renewable heat. Specifically, we said that we
would</div>
					<a name="080311136000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;conduct further
work into the policy options available to reduce the carbon impact of
heat and its use in order to determine a strategy for heat. The work
will look at the full range of policy
options&#148;.</div>
					<a name="080311136000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
then, the Office of Climate Change, working closely with several
Departments, including my own, has undertaken an in-depth study of
heat. That project has focused on providing an overview of heat and the
cooling sector&#151;air cooling is quite important in this
regard&#151;to analyse the carbon impact of heat generation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column607" />Column number: 607</div>and cooling, to assess the potential to reduce that and to identify and
assess alternative or additional policy
mechanisms.</div>
					<a name="080311136000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
31 January, the project culminated in the publication of &#147;Heat
Call for Evidence&#148;, which seeks further information on which the
Government can base the next stage of our work. It outlines our
understanding of the opportunities and prospects for renewable heat and
examines options for possible financial support mechanisms to promote
it, including capital grants, a feed-in tariff and a renewable heat
obligation. The call for evidence will feed valuable information and
insight into our strategy in
2009.</div>
					<a name="080311136000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
call for evidence also considers issues such as how to promote
renewable heat, including biogas; the role of low-carbon electricity
and heating; how surplus heat can be captured, transported and used,
especially where we have a well established gas network; options to
reduce the heating needs of existing buildings, focusing primarily on
the residential sector; the relationship between the EU emissions
trading scheme and heating; the prospects for including heat in
existing and proposed carbon markets; the non-financial barriers to the
greater deployment of renewable heat technologies that will need to be
tackled alongside any financial support mechanism; the potential for
district heating; and the possible incentives and regulatory changes
necessary for an expansion of such
schemes.</div>
					<a name="080311136000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Complex
issues need to be worked through before we can know that a renewable
heat obligation could work or whether it would be the most
cost-effective support mechanism for heat. For example, unlike
electricity, heat is not supplied directly to end users; rather, they
are sold a range of heating fuels. The renewables obligation works
because the end product is uniform. That allows us easily to measure
how much of it is supplied and to impose an obligation to supply a
percentage of it from a renewable source. The situation is not as
straightforward with
heat.</div>
					<a name="080311136000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not agree
that we should commit the Government to pursuing a particular financial
support mechanism for heat, because all the options and implications of
implementation have not yet been fully evaluated, and there is no
guarantee that the measures that we will propose in the renewable
energy strategy could be implemented by the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="080311136000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for South Thanet talked about biofuels, and he is a
great expert on these issues because of his ministerial experience. I
can, in a sense, confirm what he was saying, in that we take concerns
about unsustainable sources of biofuels very seriously. The
Government&#146;s commitment to biofuels is subject to their being
sustainable. The renewable transport fuel obligation is designed to
encourage the use of only the right type of biofuels. It will require
companies to report on the carbon that the biofuel has saved and the
wider environmental impact. We are keen to move beyond that to
mandatory standards as soon as we
can.</div>
					<a name="080311136000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
introducing similar reporting requirements for the use of biomass under
the renewables obligation. We will be able to keep the issue under
review through the introduction of sustainability reporting for biomass
users. That will enable us to monitor any sudden growth in the use of a
biomass fuel and expose biomass sources to public scrutiny. A survey of
the scientific 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column608" />Column number: 608</div>evidence on the environmental impact of biofuels, commissioned by the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is due to be
published
shortly.</div>
					<a name="080311136000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
doubt, that will be disappointing news to the hon. Member for Wealden,
who proposed the new clause. However, as he has indicated, it was
probing in nature and has provoked a useful debate. Given the
importance of tackling emissions from heat, only once we have finished
the necessary analysis will it be appropriate to reach a decision on
whether and what type of legislation is necessary. I give no apologies
for that, because I am confident that taking the time to consider
matters properly will help us to deliver the right policy. Therefore, I
hope that the hon. Member for Wealden will consider withdrawing the
motion.</div>

probably be disappointed by his rejection of the new clause, but I have
moved beyond the stage of disappointment during the past few weeks. I
have accepted that, however much he may say that he is grateful or
sympathetic, he will proceed to say that the amendment or new clause is
completely unacceptable to the Government. However, the Minister has
made a good case on this subject. As I said in moving the new clause,
it is a probing one, because I feel that we need to do more about
renewable heat, heat loss and other such issues. It was a way of
stimulating that debate, as it has done so. I think that there is
overwhelming agreement that more needs to be
done.</div>

							<a name="080311136000515"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> We are going to try again to persuade the Minister
that the new clause contains matters that are not yet included in the
scope of the Bill. Even at this late stage, as we reach the twilight of
the Committee stage, I hope that the Minister will see the
light&#151;if one can see the light in twilight&#151;and recognise
that further changes could be made to the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="080311136000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
relates to the primary duties of Ofgem&#151;again, something that was
mentioned many times on Second reading and during the submissions that
have been made to us. In 2000, Ofgem was given new duties to contribute
to the Government&#146;s social and environmental objectives. In
2004, it was given a duty to contribute towards sustainable
development. The new duties were additional to Ofgem&#146;s primary
duty, which did not change. In addition to its primary objective, Ofgem
has a series of 11 secondary
duties.</div>
					<a name="080311136000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
looked at the work being done on the issue by the Sustainable
Development Commission, such as its report, &#147;Lost in
Transmission?&#148;, in which it made a compelling case about why
Ofgem&#146;s remit should be changed. It recognised that
Ofgem&#146;s remit needs to adapt to reflect the fact that the world
has moved on and the problems that society faces have
changed.</div>
					<a name="080311136000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can have
a debate about Ofgem&#146;s work to protect consumers&#151;it does
a good job and is well led as an organisation&#151;but it is not
doing as much as it needs to do to move us towards a system in which we
use more renewables than fossil fuels. The UK currently generates 5 per
cent. of its electricity and 2 per cent. of its energy from renewables,
compared with 12 per cent. of electricity and 5.8 per cent. of total
energy generated from renewables in Germany.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column612" />Column number: 612</div>
					<a name="080311136000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">A huge number of onshore wind
applications are stuck in the planning system. If the UK is to achieve
its target of 15 per cent. renewable energy by 2020, between 35 and 40
per cent. of all electricity must come from renewable sources. That
will not be achievable without a concerted effort and a clearer
direction to Ofgem about the work that it must
do.</div>
					<a name="080311136000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
there are considerations that relate to connectivity to the national
grid, which could also be addressed by reforming the primary duties for
Ofgem. An enormous amount of the national grid network is reaching the
end of its lifetime and will need to be replaced. At the moment, Ofgem
is required to connect new installations in the order in which the
applications are made. So it is connecting some wind farms that might
not get planning consent for some years, but others, which have been
given planning consent, will not be connected to the national grid for
some years to come. Clearly, that does not make sense as a coherent
strategy. Ofgem should have more powers to intervene and to suggest
that installations should be connected in an order that reflects their
viability and the extent to which they can make a contribution to
promoting
renewables.</div>

Ofgem was established before the urgency of climate change became

efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the energy
sector.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080311136000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly the
Sustainable Development Commission has recommended that Ofgem&#146;s

emissions

					<a name="080311136000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofgem&#146;s
current primary responsibility to promote effective competition in the
energy sector means it does not promote increased energy efficiency and
renewables as much as it could. Ofgem&#146;s remit should be altered
by the Bill to include a primary responsibility for the delivery of a
low carbon energy
system&#148;.</div>
					<a name="080311136000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
British Wind Energy Association
said:</div>
					<a name="080311136000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofgem&#146;s
interpretation of its rules mean National Grid cannot invest in
upgrading connection and cabling for new wind farms until developers
are able to underwrite their costs. Companies are unable to do this
until their schemes are approved and they have secured finance, which
can take several years: under current arrangements they would then have
to wait further for grid upgrades before they can generate. Ofgem fears
that early investment in system reinforcement would result in stranded
assets being built... We believe that Ofgem must be more strongly
directed to give higher priorities to tackling climate change and
increasing security of supply alongside itself economic
focus.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080311136000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Sustainable Development Commission produced its report, it proposed
three options, one of which was to create a primary duty for
environmental matters and climate change issues and to put that ahead
of consumers&#146; interests. That is a difficult position to sustain
in the current climate, when we are all concerned about fuel poverty
and how people will pay their bills. There must be a continuing primary

<div class="Column"><a name="Column613" />Column number: 613</div>duty to protect consumers. The SDC also suggested an option whereby
those issues would be viewed in tandem. New clause 11 would add to its
primary duty about protecting consumers and includes the
words,</div>
					<a name="080311136000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;while reducing
the emissions of greenhouse gases in accordance with Government targets
for greenhouse gas emissions
reductions&#148;.</div>
					<a name="080311136000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">A clear
body of opinion sees that as the right way forward.</div>
					<a name="080311136000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The SDC has looked into this
in great detail, and I hope that the Minister will be able to respond
positively to the new clause and recognise that we need to address this
matter to meet our climate change objectives. We are reaching the final
moments of the Committee. The prospect that we are soon to be released
is almost like Christmas. We therefore ask the Minister to give us that
little Christmas present&#151;that final little nugget after weeks of
saying no in the Gallic manner&#151;and say, &#147;Yes,
here&#146;s an issue that we can support. Here&#146;s an issue that
we should rally round,&#148; and accept the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="080311136000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000516"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:
						</b> I want to speak to new clause 12, which is a
more comprehensive version of new clause 11, tabled by the hon. Member
for Wealden. I would not characterise these as Christmas clauses, but
rather as owl of Minerva clauses, in that the best bit comes just
before the ending. In that case, it was Greek civilisation, but we will
not go down that
road.</div>
					<a name="080311136000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
new clause 12 is simply to reverse the subsidiary nature of the clauses
within Ofgem&#146;s remit, which concern sustainability and
environmental obligations, and place them as a principle objective.
Rapid progress is being made to ensure that our future energy concerns
relate to climate change, sustainability, renewable energy and the use
of other forms of energy, either more economically or through the use
of technologies that make them more sustainable.</div>
					<a name="080311136000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea
that the energy regulator is tasked to ensure that that is a primary
consideration is very important. It is also important because Ofgem has
suffused the considerations of the Committee&#151;it has a very
important role and undertakes a whole range of activities that relate
to grid connections, the operation of the energy market, arrangements
that relate to renewables and all sorts of similar matters. Therefore,
having a primary duty to do that is important, but of course I
recognise and understand that simply to do so would be to fundamentally
disrupt the range of considerations that Ofgem should properly take
into account.</div>
					<a name="080311136000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently, in furtherance
to its principal objective, new clause 12 lists a number of
considerations that Ofgem should have regard to, which will effectively
fall within its primary duty. At the moment, that duty is set out
thus:</div>
					<a name="080311136000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to protect the
interests of consumers, present and future, wherever appropriate by
promoting effective competition between persons engaged in, or in
commercial activities connected with, the shipping, transportation or
supply of gas conveyed through pipes, and the generation, transmission,

electricity
interconnectors.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080311136000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
hon. Members will understand, those elements of the primary duty would
be reflected in the things that Ofgem should consider in pursuit of its
primary objective&#151;it is effectively a tandem arrangement as far
as those objectives are concerned.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column614" />Column number: 614</div>
					<a name="080311136000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
certainly beyond serious dispute, but there have been some
difficulties, not necessarily because Ofgem is a perverse organisation
that does not want to pursue environmental objectives, but rather
because of the way in which its duties and powers are set out. The hon.
Member for Wealden mentioned some of those difficulties in relation to
the connection of transmission for renewables and various other
activities, and I believe that they have resulted from the subsidiary
nature of the contribution to the achievements of sustainable
development in Ofgem&#146;s present remit. That is a result first of
the systematic undervaluing of carbon by Ofgem in its calculations of
what is meant by significant financial implications and because of
Government guidance from 2004, which was supposed to help Ofgem in its
interpretation of social and environmental issues, but which probably
had the opposite effect.</div>
					<a name="080311136000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">In their guidance, the
Government
stated:</div>
					<a name="080311136000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where the
Government wish to implement social and environmental measures which
could have significant financial implications for consumers or for
regulated companies, these will be implemented by Ministers, rather
than the Authority, by means of specific primary or secondary
legislation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080311136000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The interpretation of
what is a &#147;significant financial implication&#148; in the
context of Ofgem&#146;s primary duty has led to conclusions that do
not advance the question of sustainability and environmental management
in the way that is increasingly becoming imperative in the management
of energy supplies. At the very least, I hope that my hon. Friend the
Minister, in replying to these questions, will consider whether there
should be new guidance for Ofgem, because I do not think that the
guidance does the job that it was originally intended to do; indeed, it
could have perverse consequences for Ofgem&#146;s overall
role.</div>
					<a name="080311136000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
emphasise that the idea of setting out principal and subsidiary
objectives in the way that is set out in new clause 12 is not unique
for regulators. Indeed, the rail regulator has a duty to contribute to
sustainable development that ranks alongside the duty to promote
competition and is not subsidiary to it. Therefore, regulators can work
within a competitive environment with that duty; rather, such a
framework of duties can probably contribute to the development of a
workable and competitive environment, while sustainable objectives are
pursued, in the way that I imagine everyone on the Committee wants us
to proceed in respect of energy management.</div>

							<a name="080311136000517"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> The Liberal Democrats have a lot of sympathy with
the goals in new clauses 11 and 12, which touch on the same
issue&#151;Ofgem&#146;s remit&#151;and goals as new clause 13,
which has not been discussed even though it is grouped with new clauses
11 and 12, so I assume that it is in order to refer to it.</div>
					<a name="080311136000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, there are two
slightly different approaches to Ofgem&#146;s remit. There is a more
comprehensive approach from the hon. Member for Wealden in new clause
11, which seems to be more effective, because it appears to cover both
gas and electricity legislation, and I sense that it might be
preferable to the other approach. Nevertheless, the goal of both
approaches seems to be right. We all know that, if we have one primary
duty or one priority, we will focus our attention; if we have 10
priorities, we have no priorities. My worry with the current Ofgem
structure is that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column615" />Column number: 615</div>primary duty overrides and that, when there is a conflict between the
primary duty and the subsidiary duty, the primary one, by definition,
dominates.</div>
					<a name="080311136000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">From our
point of view, sustainability and adherence to greenhouse gas targets
are not at all subsidiary matters&#151;this is the future of the
planet, for goodness&#146; sake. The idea that sustainability is a
subsidiary consideration&#151;I hesitate to say that it is an
afterthought, but it is certainly a subsidiary
consideration&#151;just seems wrong to us.</div>
					<a name="080311136000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree
with the Sustainable Development Commission&#146;s suggestion that
Ofgem&#146;s primary duty should be aligned to Government energy and
environment policy; why would it not be aligned to it? The fact that
there could be disjunction between the two suggests that change to the
remit is needed. In passing, I note that the Sustainable Development
Commission also recommends that energy and environment policy should be
handled by one Secretary of State; having a view on that may be above
the Minister&#146;s pay grade, but it is a very good recommendation
and one that we have implemented in our
party.</div>
					<a name="080311136000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
that we have not yet considered is what does Ofgem think of all this.
Obviously, Ofgem would not dream of trespassing on party political
matters, but it produced a briefing for us, called &#147;The Role of
Ofgem in a Changing Climate&#148;, in which it said that these are
obviously matters for politicians and Departments to decide, but it
then came up with a raft of reasons why we should not change its remit.
One of the reasons that Ofgem gives in the briefing is that we should
judge it by its actions on sustainable energy networks and markets. It
lists a set of bullet points of things that it has done, saying that it
has advised the Government and promoted choice. However, I cannot help
smiling because one of the actions that we are supposed to commend it
for is its</div>
					<a name="080311136000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Leadership
role on smart metering, including overseeing Government backed 10m
trials (ongoing since
2005).&#148;</div>
					<a name="080311136000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot help feeling that, if the remit for sustainability and
greenhouse gas emissions had been primary rather than secondary, a
three-year smart meter trial might have led us to some action. In a
sense, it is probably unfair to criticise Ofgem for that; it has simply
administered the Government&#146;s trials. However, in no sense has
it been driving smart metering forward, although I am sure that it has
done a very competent job of administering trials.</div>
					<a name="080311136000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I am
pointing the finger in the wrong place and pointing it unfairly at
Ofgem. However, I just think that perhaps it would have been pressuring
Ministers and saying, &#147;Look, we have got a remit to fulfil. We
are supposed to be promoting sustainable energy. You are dragging your
heels on smart meters. How about pulling your finger
out&#148;&#151;metaphorically&#151;&#147;and getting on with
it?&#148; If Ofgem had been given that remit, there might have been
more pressure on the Government to act on some of these issues.
Therefore, of the two new clauses, new clause 12 probably gets closest
to the mark, but we would very much support the spirit of those people
who put sustainability and curbing greenhouse gas emissions right up
there, in the headlines, at the
top.</div>
					<a name="080311136000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly,
new clause 13 is about preferential access to the grid for renewables.
A brief reference was made to that earlier and again it is something
that we support. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column616" />Column number: 616</div>The danger is that the grid currently picks off the cheapest marginal
source of supply. If we are serious about getting renewables into the
mainstream, rather than having them as just a peripheral additional
supply, some sort of preferential arrangement would complement what we
have been talking about under the Bill, such as the renewables
obligation. It will be interesting to see why the Government have not
adopted that approach. I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to
it.</div>

I failed to do so. I will not detain the Committee for any length of
time other than to commend the idea about grid
connections.</div>
					<a name="080311136000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
40, which we discussed what seems like a very long time ago, made great
strides on the grid connection for offshore renewable energy. I
welcomed the Minister&#146;s verbal indication of further
consideration over whether there should be a hub-and-spoke arrangement
for future grid connections as the offshore grid develops. I also note
the proposed clauses in the marine Bill White Paper concerning how
permissions for offshore grid connections will be undertaken.
Nevertheless, problems will continue to arise upon landfall in the way
that they currently exist for connections for land-based wind
farms.</div>
					<a name="080311136000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is the
so-called Scottish queue of something like 9 GW of potential power that
remains to be connected up because of the considerations relating to
how connection is undertaken. Viable schemes that can proceed have a
lengthy period of waiting prior to going online because the capacity of
the grid is taken up by existing operators. Those operators reserve
elements of the grid according to their capacity operation, which does
not necessarily take
place.</div>
					<a name="080311136000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elements of
the grid for dealing with potential grid failures are normally not used
because failures to the grid are reducing considerably. Therefore, a
connection and management regime on the basis of that marginal,
additional capacity according to the priorities set out in new clause
13 would offer a very positive way to deal with grid connection
problems.</div>
					<a name="080311136000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause prioritises renewable connections, but the effect would be to
ensure that the way that the grid connection arrangements were laid out
meant that the full management capacity of the grid was used in
parallel, rather than in sequence. Therefore, that would cause the grid
to be used in a much more efficient way and bring on the considerations
of how the grid is strengthened&#151;at what point on the grid new
connections are landed and how they go into the high-power
grid.</div>
					<a name="080311136000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">For all those
reasons, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister would look carefully
at the considerations in the new clause. I anticipate that he will
suggest that it might be withdrawn, but it is on the amendment paper,
in part, at least to underline that we have to get grid 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column617" />Column number: 617</div>connections right in the future, so as to bring out the benefits of
renewables, which are underlined by the Bill and are essential to our
future
targets.</div>

							<a name="080311136000521"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> This matter has occasioned a lot of parliamentary
and wider interest, so it is useful that we have had a good discussion.
There are three new clauses here, so I am afraid that it will take a
little while for me to present my
analysis.</div>
					<a name="080311136000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wealden, hoped that, at this late hour, I would be able to
satisfy him. My endeavour is to satisfy him; I want to make him happy.
I am sure that during the course of my speech, I will do that, but with
only one small, rather specific and technical qualification, which is
the tedious business, sadly, of my not being able to accept his new
clause. Apart from that, I think that he will be
satisfied.</div>
					<a name="080311136000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
heard a lot in the debate as to whether the duties and powers of
Ofgem&#151;I mean here the Gas and Electricity Markets
Authority&#151;are still fit for purpose in the light of the
challenges that we face to meet our EU 2020 targets. New clauses 11 and
12 in particular attempt to address what some hon. Members feel is
perhaps an imbalance in Ofgem&#146;s overall focus. Before I cover
the specific issues raised by new clauses 11 and 12, I thought it might
be helpful if I took the time to remind the Committee of the rationale
for having an independent economic regulator for the electricity and
gas
markets.</div>
					<a name="080311136000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are committed to delivering safe, secure and sustainable
energy supplies through independently regulated energy markets,
promoting competition where possible. Ofgem has been specifically
established as the independent regulator, with consumer protection and
competition as its primary duty. The intention of independent
regulation is to provide the regulatory stability necessary for
investor confidence through independence from Government and a clear
statutory framework; to introduce competition into the market wherever
possible; and to regulate the prices of any natural monopolies, such as
networks, where
not.</div>
					<a name="080311136000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Investments
in the gas and electricity industry, be it networks or generation, are
generally long term and returns are made over a long period. Once the
investments have been made and the infrastructure built, it can be
costly for companies to pull out. It is the combination of
Ofgem&#146;s independence&#151;which demonstrates that regulatory
decisions about the market will be made for the long term on an
economic, not a political, basis&#151;and a clear statutory framework
of duties in which to take its decisions that provides companies with
the stability and regulatory certainty that they need to invest with
confidence in the power stations, gas infrastructures and electricity
networks that we need in the
UK.</div>
					<a name="080311136000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">A competitive
market with sufficient, timely investment brings benefits for consumers
by providing the most cost-effective way of delivering our energy
objectives of tackling climate change and ensuring secure supplies of
energy. Ofgem also regulates prices in elements of the gas and
electricity system that are natural monopolies. That ensures that the
owners of the pipes and wires do not abuse their monopoly power and
helps to drive efficiencies in the system. As part of that, Ofgem sets
price controls to limit the charges for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column618" />Column number: 618</div>access to those networks and provides incentives for the companies
regarding investment and service. That helps to ensure that costs to
consumers are minimised as far as possible.</div>
					<a name="080311136000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Changing the
nature of Ofgem&#146;s remit so that it will no longer primarily be
an economic regulator, as new clause 12 proposes, without sufficient
analysis of the potential impact on the broader market and other
unintended consequences, would be imprudent. Placing sustainability
above consumer protection and competition would take Ofgem&#146;s
primary focus away from the latter. I have already discussed some of
the reasons why we believe that it is important that Ofgem retains its
economic focus. Moreover, the new clause proposes giving Ofgem a
primary duty to deliver sustainability, but no practical powers or
tools to make it possible, as many of the important policies such as
the design of the renewables obligation and other trading schemes are
the remit of Government, and rightly so.</div>
					<a name="080311136000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">A recent Select Committee
report in the other place on regulators concluded that they are
&#147;creatures of statute&#148;, and that therefore, an effective
statutory remit for a regulator is one that is, above all else, clear.
The report also concluded that regulators need limited and relatively
narrow duties.</div>
					<a name="080311136000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
dual primary duty, as suggested in new clause 11, would require Ofgem
to make trade-offs between the economic interests of consumers and
promoting sustainability. How, for example, would Ofgem be able to
decide what should take precedence when making decisions about whether
to encourage renewable technologies, which are generally more
expensive, or to keep costs down for consumers to minimise fuel
poverty? It is only right for an elected Government to make the
political decisions about such matters. That is why the Secretary of
State provides guidance to Ofgem on social and environmental policy, to
which Ofgem must have regard. In light of significant developments in
this area since the guidance was last updated, we intend, as the
Secretary of State announced yesterday, to consult on new environmental
and social guidance for Ofgem shortly.</div>
					<a name="080311136000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guidance will set out the
Government&#146;s expectation of the contribution Ofgem should make
on social and environmental issues. It will cover issues such as
facilitating the faster deployment of renewables, both on and offshore,
and the development of local or distributed energy. On the social side
it will, among other things, address our expectation that Ofgem will
take a strong lead in co-ordinating activity to help low-income and
vulnerable customers.</div>
					<a name="080311136000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather than
a knee-jerk reaction to change Ofgem&#146;s remit and duties we
should step back and look at what the potential barriers to deploying
more renewables actually are. Stakeholders have highlighted several key
areas of concern in relation to the deployment of renewables,
particularly around grid access, transmission and charging. Some point
to Ofgem&#146;s remit as the cause, but that oversimplifies the
problem. The grid-related issues are complex and interconnected and
rather than believing that we can solve them at a single stroke by
changing Ofgem&#146;s remit, we need to develop a more rounded
strategy.</div>
					<a name="080311136000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
why we are developing our renewable energy strategy, which we have
discussed, to be launched in Spring 2009. As part of that we will be
launching a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column619" />Column number: 619</div>consultation this summer that will consider what more we should do to
increase renewable energy production to meet our share of the EU 2020
renewables target, including how we can ensure renewable projects
secure swift connection to the grid. We need to look at the rules
governing access to the grid and at ways of speeding up the delivery of
new infrastructure. We need to be sure that the grid as a whole is
equipped to handle significant increases in largely intermittent
renewable
generation.</div>

already has a secondary duty on sustainability, and has been criticised
for not delivering on that. That is unfair, in the light of the work
that it has taken forward on a number of projects. For example, Ofgem

businesses to be innovative in terms of sustainability and reducing
greenhouse gas emissions and losses of gas and electricity, through

					<a name="080311136000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can I go on to
new clause 13? Tempting though it would be to accept the new clause, we
wish to resist it. The new clause seeks to provide priority access for
electricity and gas produced from renewable energy sources to the
electricity and gas transmission and distribution systems. The new
clause places new duties on the Secretary of State and the authority,
which would govern how they discharge their functions under the
Electricity Act 1989 and the Gas Act 1986, as
amended.</div>
					<a name="080311136000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed text on access for renewable energy to electricity networks is
taken from the draft EU renewables directive, and many of the
provisions referred to in the new clause were contained in the 2001
renewables directive. Those provisions are already in place in Great
Britain through licence conditions and underlying industry codes. The
key difference is that the new clause would introduce a requirement to
mandate priority access to the grid for electricity from renewable
sources. That is currently a discretionary matter for member states.
Although gas is not covered in the EU renewables directive, the text
has also been applied to gas through the proposed new section 4AB in
the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="080311136000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will first address access for renewable energy to the electricity
networks, and then access for renewable gas to the gas networks. We are
giving careful consideration to the merits of prioritising renewable
access to the grid, and we need to address a number of issues. First,
there is some uncertainty about the meaning of priority access in the
national context. It is important that we do not introduce uncertainty
for existing generators and those planning future investments. We need
to be careful not to discourage essential investment in all generating
technologies.</div>
					<a name="080311136000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
next consideration is whether priority access is consistent with our
wider energy policy goals, and whether it is the best route to
accelerate growth in renewable generation and integrate what is largely
variable generation into the electricity networks, while keeping those
networks safe and reliable. Offshore and onshore wind generation is
likely to play the largest part in meeting our renewable energy targets
in 2020. To accommodate such variable renewable generation, it will be
essential to have a significant amount of responsive back-up generation
to maintain system reliability. A mixed-generating profile is therefore
consistent with, rather than opposed to, our ambitions for renewable
generation.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column621" />Column number: 621</div>
					<a name="080311136000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
ensure that the access regime encourages essential investment to come
forward. If conventional generation were displaced because of the
prioritisation of access for renewable generation for a period of time,
or if new investments in reserve capacity were not made, there are
foreseeable difficulties for maintaining a reliable electricity system.
We are considering reforms to grid access arrangements to ensure that
the regulatory framework remains fit for purpose in the medium and
longer term, and to speed up the connection of renewable generation as
part of the transmission access review with Ofgem. An interim report of
the review has been published and my Department and Ofgem are working
towards a final report in May 2008. We will work further on the matter
as we work with industry to deliver the conclusions of the review and
as we develop the renewable energy strategy. That may mean bringing
forward, in the strategy, further measures to speed up the connection
of renewable generation. Clearly, if we decide that the
Commission&#146;s proposals for priority access as set out in the
draft directive is the right approach, the proposals will be
implemented in the
UK.</div>
					<a name="080311136000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the second
part of proposed new clause 13, the Government are keen to support and
investigate the potential of renewable gas to contribute to the
UK&#146;s share of our European target. Renewable gas, or biogas, is
produced by feeding organic material such as food waste, sewage sludge,
animal slurries or energy crops into an anaerobic digestion
plant&#151;if my intelligence is right, such a plant is currently the
subject of some controversy in Ambridge&#151;or from the
decomposition of organic matter in landfill sites. The Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has recently announced that
&#163;10 million will be made available for the construction of new
commercial-scale anaerobic digestion demonstration plants. By removing
carbon dioxide and other impurities, biogas can also be used to make
biomethane, which could, theoretically, be injected directly into the
gas networks. However, there are a number of challenges to address
before it is possible to inject biomethane directly into networks in
the UK, such as standards for quality and
pressure.</div>
					<a name="080311136000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#147;Heat Call for Evidence&#148; invites contributions on the
potential of biomethane, the barriers to its deployment and how best to
tackle those. It is essential to consider the responses to that and to
feed our considerations into our broader work on the renewable energy
strategy. Moreover, until we have reviewed the evidence on how to get
biomethane into the gas system, we will not be able to judge what
potential unintended or undesirable consequences might flow from the
somewhat ad hoc change to the duties of the Secretary of State and the
authority proposed by the new clause. Therefore, the kind of
market-enablement that the new clause would provide seems entirely
premature.</div>
					<a name="080311136000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said throughout this process, we should not make significant
changes to a regulatory framework without careful consideration of the
consequences. We cannot simply add powers and measures to the
statute purely because we happen to have a legislative
opportunity.</div>
					<a name="080311136000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should, however, say more on the connecting of renewables. There is
currently a queue of projects at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column622" />Column number: 622</div>various stages of development, mostly in Scotland. National Grid is
developing a suite of measures to ensure that available connection
capacity is offered to the projects that are best able to connect
early, which is to say those with planning consent. That is in line
with the objective described by the hon. Member for Wealden to connect
the most viable projects
first.</div>
					<a name="080311136000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have said enough to assure hon. Members that there is no lack of
interest in renewables that leads me resist the new clause&#151;far
from it. However, if we are to develop the UK&#146;s contribution to
our European target, we need a comprehensive strategy, not a variety of
piecemeal ones.</div>
					<a name="080311136000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that important considerations of system reliability and investor
confidence need to be addressed before we can conclude that priority
access is in itself the right way forward to accelerate the growth of
renewable generation. The draft EU renewables directive is, of course,
still subject to negotiation between member states. It would not be
appropriate to transpose the draft text under discussion into the Bill.
When the negotiations have concluded, the finally agreed directive will
be transposed into legislation in the United Kingdom in the usual way.
In the light of those comments, I ask members of the Committee
to withdraw the new
clause.</div>

						</b> It was clearly too much to hope
that the Minister&#146;s stony heart would melt at this last moment
in our proceedings. It made me think of my little boy who was sure that
he would get a PlayStation for Christmas, but found that he had been
given a dictionary, and burst into tears. The Minister&#146;s
response was in the same vein. Nevertheless, it was not wholly
unexpected. It is a happy coincidence, however, that the day before we
reached such a debate in Committee the Secretary of State announced a
consultation process on the way forward. At least, we can feel some joy
at the fact that we might have advanced that consultation
process.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining
matters. Clearly, such a process would not therefore require primary
legislation to change it. Given that we have waited some time for an
Energy Bill to be published, it is frustrating to know of the number of
measures that have been put out to consultation. They really should
have been dealt with before we reached this stage and thus included in
the Bill. Nevertheless, we shall reflect on matters further, and take
soundings from the SDC and other interested parties about what they
think will be the appropriate way forward. We reserve the right to
bring the provision back perhaps as a new clause or an amendment on
Report. In the light of what the Minister has said, it would be
inappropriate to press the new clause to a Division now. Instead we
shall reflect further on the best way forward. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the

Clerks, those who work for <i class="I">Hansard</i> and the police, who have not
been overburdened with disciplinary problems. In particular, I would
like to thank fellow members of the Committee, as proceedings have been
an efficient, well-informed, and at times, highly intellectual. I
noticed that <i class="I">The Guardian </i>reported a little discussion that we
had about the beautiful island of Alderney, which several of us took
part in. I think that it was suggesting that that discussion did not
show a high intellectual content for the Committee. I do not think that

view.</div>

to thank my civil servants and officials, who from time to time have

help.</div>
					<a name="080311136000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to highlight the fact that we have had a wide-ranging discussion on the
topics and clauses and how thoroughly we have discussed the clauses to
ensure that all the key issues and policies were debated, so that the
Bill was scrutinised most thoroughly. I now look forward to further
discussion on the Bill on Report. That might be a short discussion, but
if I have not entirely satisfied Opposition Members or Members on my
own side, it might be a lengthy discussion, which I certainly look
forward to. Once again, Mrs. Humble, I thank
you.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080311136000570"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I shall echo many of the comments that the
Minister has made. I obviously differ with him on the concept of give
and take, as his is not quite the concept of give and take that I have
been familiar with&#151;the giving was not as evident as one might
have thought it should be.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column625" />Column number: 625</div>
					<a name="080311136000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also echo the
Minister&#146;s thanks to you, Mrs. Humble, and to
Mr. Amess, for the way in which you have chaired our
proceedings. You have been very generous. There have been occasions
when we have erred and strayed a little from the direct content of the
Bill, and you were very kind at times in allowing us to go as far as we
did. That enabled us to address some of the wider issues connected with
energy that were not directly included in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="080311136000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
the Minister for the way in which he has responded on most occasions.
Not a single comma has been changed in the Bill as a result of the
amendments put forward by the Opposition, but nevertheless he has
always told us how grateful he has been for our contributions. He even
said on one occasion that it was a genuinely interesting and useful
debate, which I imagine meant that all the rest were not. He has been
good humoured and very well supported. Perhaps I can go further than he
has done in expressing gratitude to his officials. I just hope that he
is there the next time a note comes from them saying,
&#147;I&#146;m damned if I know. You&#146;re on your own now,
matey.&#148; He will remember that particular moment for the way in
which he put his thoughts to them.</div>
					<a name="080311136000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to pay particular
thanks to the Clerk as well. We turned up in his office with a range of
ideas that he had to phrase in an appropriate way to include in the
Bill. Any mistakes can be blamed on our concepts or our way of
presenting them. We are very grateful to the Clerk and his team for
their work. He has been unfailingly helpful and good natured. At times,
he was probably despairing, feeling that we should know more about
parliamentary procedure than we did.</div>
					<a name="080311136000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I
express particular thanks to my colleagues for their interventions? We
have had a very well qualified Committee, which has shown a tremendous
understanding of the different energy issues. I also want to thank my
colleagues for making useful contributions to our proceedings. My hon.
Friend the Member for St. Albans made particularly useful contributions
in the form of Polo mints, sweeties and other things to keep us going.
When her supply ran out, we had to turn to my hon. Friend the Member
for Northampton, South for Strepsils. My hon. Friends have also brought
a great deal of knowledge and analysis to the Committee, which is what
this Bill required.</div>
					<a name="080311136000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful, too, to those from outside&#151;the business,
environmental and consumer groups&#151;for their help in ensuring
that we understood their concerns. I hope that we have been able to
give a fair hearing to those issues, even if the votes did not
ultimately show that. People will pore over these exchanges in years to
come&#151;the Minister looks worried about that. They will realise
that there are other issues to which they must return. For example,
last week I made a comparison in relation to tidal power off Portugal.
I said that it was a bit like saying that the England rugby team had
beaten Andorra; hooray, I think that they would be delighted to beat
Andorra. It would be quite a breakthrough for them to be able to do so.
Perhaps some of the comments will bear revisiting in the years to
come.</div>

parliamentary procedure that is useful to all of us. At the end of the
day, this Bill has sadly been unchanged. Our concern was not about the
failings within the Bill itself&#151;it is not so much an Energy Bill
but more a Bill about facilitating nuclear power and considering
decommissioning arrangements&#151;but about the fact that a range of
energy issues that are deeply important to our country have been left
out.</div>
					<a name="080311136000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">A whole range
of consultations are taking place. I am surprised that the Minister has
time to go to Tokyo when he has so many consultations. We are left with
a consultation on microgeneration, decentralised energy, feed-in
tariffs, smart meters, Ofgem and its duties, and priority access to the
grid. All those issues could have been included in the Bill, but sadly
have not been. We will have to go back to them on Report. This was a
great opportunity to address some of the wider issues but I assume that
another energy Bill will come along soon to include the things that
have not been covered in this one. However, it has been a joyful
experience to be involved in this Committee. Perhaps it has been
slightly frustrating at times, but I thank the Minister for his
approach, which has made these weeks and our discussions entertaining,
enjoyable, but not always
fulfilling.</div>

						</b> I very much echo the spirit of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s remarks. I suppose with this Department, a Public
Bill Committee has to be &#147;BERR-able&#148; rather than
bearable, and it certainly has been that. I reinforce the words of
thanks that have already been said to you, Mrs. Humble and
Mr. Amess, and to the other members of the Committee. I have
sat on Public Bill Committees in the past in which Labour Back Benchers
were told to sit there, shut up and stick their hands up at the
relevant moment. We have been delighted to hear the expert contribution
from those on the Labour Back Benches. They have been willing to put
their names to amendments, and we hope to see more of that in the
coming weeks. I have enjoyed the knowledgeable and humorous
contributions of the hon. Member for Wealden, who outed himself as
having read <i class="I">The </i>
						<i class="I">Guardian </i>for 30 years. There is hope for
him yet.</div>
					<a name="080311136000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my
hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham for paying a very active part in
the debates, particularly on the nuclear issues, when he was not
checking his mobile phone to see who had won the 3.15 at Cheltenham. I
have to admit that he was doing that this afternoon. I thank the
Minister for the initial way in which he encouraged us to contact him
and his officials so that we could have an informed debate. I think
that his officials got their own back, because when my hon. Friend
asked for some follow-up on an issue, he was supplied with a briefing.
The purpose of that was to keep him quiet for the next few weeks, which
is a cunning new
ploy.</div>

					<a name="080311136000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
most remarkable thing about this Bill is that most of the interest is
in what is not in it. We have, therefore, appreciated the selection of
amendments and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column627" />Column number: 627</div>the ability to raise such important issues. Most of what we have wanted
to talk about has not been in the Bill, but perhaps should have been.
However, we appreciate almost everything that we have been able to talk
about. We look forward to renewing our debate. The Minister and the
hon. Member for Wealden have implied that there will be another energy
Bill and energy Bills are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column628" />Column number: 628</div>like London buses in that more are coming. I suppose that we could say
that they are renewable. I look forward to having similar civilised but
more amending debates in the
future.</div>
