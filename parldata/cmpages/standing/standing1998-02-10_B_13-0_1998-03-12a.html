<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 99, in page 25, line 29, leave out from "shall" to end of line 32 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"be made to one of the following
<P>
(a) the Ombudsman;
<P>
(b) a member of the police force;
<P>
(c) the Police Authority; or
<P>
(d) the Secretary of State.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 100, in page 25, line 32, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) If a complaint is made to a member of the police force, to the Police Authority or to the Secretary of State, it shall be referred immediately to the Ombudsman.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The amendments are merely intended to tidy up the drafting of the clause. They were proposed to Conservative Members by the Police Authority, which felt that the wording of subsection (1) was somewhat ambiguous. We agreed and tabled the amendments to enable the Government to look again at the drafting and to clarify the provisions.
<P>
Subsection (1) would be clearer if it stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For the purposes of this Parliament, all complaints about the police force shall be made to one of the following: the Ombudsman; a member of the police force; the Police Authority; or the Secretary of State."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the four bodies to whom the Government intend that complaints about the police should be made.
<P>
The second amendment would add a new subsection:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If a complaint is made" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to the above bodies 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it shall be referred immediately to the Ombudsman."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would make it clear that any of the four bodies can receive a complaint, but that it must always be sent on to the ombudsman. The word "immediately" is important; the ombudsman needs to know about complaints, of whatever kind, as quickly as possible.
<P>
The amendments are merely drafting amendments. No doubt the Minister will tell me that it is impossible to draft provisions in a new way, because the draftsmen say that it should be done in the previous way. However, sometimes the language of lawyers leaves some of us rather confused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I should like to reinforce what my hon. Friend said, and to put another slant on the argument. As he has pointed out, subsection (1) requires the Chief Constable, the Police Authority and the Secretary of State to refer any complaints to the ombudsman immediately.
<P>
We have no quarrel with the intention of the subsection, but we question the draftsmanship. If subsection (1) were correctly formulated, it would make full sense if either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) were omitted. That is what the syntax would demand. However, it does not make sense. There is confusion between an "either, or" construction and a series of categories. Surely, the Government intend that complaints about the police force should be made either to the ombudsman, to a member of the Police Authority, to the police force, or to the Secretary of State. If a complaint is made to any of them, it shall immediately be referred to the ombudsman. However, I do not think that the subsection makes that clear. Our amendments would correct the confusion and clumsiness that seems to be present. They would clarify the Government's intentions.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington):</B> I must disappoint the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss); there is nothing wrong with his amendment. It would not bring about the end of civilisation as we know it. We prefer our wording. I feel that I am likely to repeat many times that the Government want the Bill to emphasise the fact that the complaints procedure will be under the control of the ombudsman. His will be the dominant role.
<P>
Clearly, others who are concerned with policing will want to support the structure. However, we prefer the present wording of the clause because it singles out the ombudsman's status as special and states that complaints should go to him or be forwarded to him if they are received by other parties. That pre-eminence of the ombudsman is not expressed in amendment No. 99, which gives the impression that he would be one among four possible recipients of a complaint, rather than the dominant figure. We want to emphasise his independence and supremacy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I do not remotely quarrel with the Government's wish to assert the primacy of the ombudsman, but where is the "or" that should follow from the use of the word "either" at the end of line 29? That is the point; the draftsmanship is clumsy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> In my copy of the Bill clause 52 reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For the purposes of this Part, all complaints about the police force shall either <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) be made to the Ombudsman; or" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the word "or" is there. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I fully agree with the Government's intention in relation to the clause. It is important that the ombudsman should be set apart and given a pre-eminent status. We do not argue with that just with the wording. It would be possible for the clause to provide that complaints should preferably be made to the ombudsman, but that they could also be made to the other three parties on the list, and that in that case they should immediately be referred to the ombudsman.[Mr. Moss]
However, we shall not quibble about that. No doubt the draftsmen think that the provision is best and most succinctly put as it appears in the Bill. I thought that our suggested tidying up made more sense, but I accept the Minister's argument and assure him that we agree with his analysis and about the need for the ombudsman to be pre-eminent. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 25, line 41, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(aa) make reasonable effort to ensure that the complainant is informed that his complaint is being considered;".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The amendment does not stand in the name of any member of the Committee. I point out that it will also be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 8, in page 25, line 42, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", and (c) make reasonable effort to ensure that the complainant is kept informed of developments in the consideration of his complaint, including any resolution or action resulting therefrom.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 65, in clause 64, page 33, line 25, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(cc) procedures for giving a complainant whose complaint has been the subject of formal investigation a record of the outcome of that investigation.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Thank you, Miss Widdecombe, for that clarification.
<P>
I shall speak briefly to the amendments. They were tabled early on by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. \UOpik), a Liberal Democrat Member who has shown considerable interest in Northern Ireland affairs. His amendments were some of the first to be tabled, and at the time he fully expected to be on the Committee. Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are not unreasonable. They seek to ensure that when a complaint enters the system, the complainant is kept abreast of its progress through the various stages.
<P>
It is quite a complicated system, and that is graphically illustrated in Dr. Hayes's report, "A Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland". On page 109 under the heading "How the proposed system would work" there is a complex flow chart. There are a number of stages and we shall address each in turn in the next few clauses. I have counted six potential stages for a complaint to go through the system: there may be more but I have cut them down as best I can. It is right for complainants to be kept as informed as possible as their complaints go through the various stages so that they know where they stand and what is being done.
<P>
As we have already ascertained in subsection (1), the complaint can go directly to the ombudsman or to three other bodies. Hopefully, it will shortly end up on the ombudsman's desk when he or she can decide whether it is a policy issue, in which case it goes to the Police Authority. If it is an issue of conduct, it goes into the ombudsman's own system where it is handled by his staff. Presumably there is some sort of preliminary sift of complaints. A decision has to be made about whether it is to be a formal resolution, whether it is to be investigated by the ombudsman because it is a serious complaint, or whether it is to be passed back to the Chief Constable under clause 57. After the ombudsman's decision a report is issued. Amendment No. 7 seeks to insert after (3)(a) that the ombudsman shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"make reasonable effort to ensure that the complainant is informed that his complaint is being considered".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 8 seeks to insert,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and (c) make reasonable effort to ensure that the complainant is kept informed of developments in the consideration of his complaint, including any resolution or action resulting therefrom."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps those matters will be dealt with by the regulation. The Government may argue that the working groups that are being set up will discuss the practical ways in which the system will work. They may argue that this is an administrative matter for the ombudsman to decide, that we must await the setting up of the ombudsman and his team and that they will decide how best to deal with this customer-client service, if I can call it that.
<P>
I think that the tabler of the amendment wanted to see that that was clearly stated in the Bill as a statutory requirement of the ombudsman to ensure that it is not overlooked later. It may be dealt with by regulation but there is no guarantee of that.
<P>
I have some sympathy with those who tabled the amendments and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in response to their arguments. I hope that he will clarify whether the matter is covered elsewhere in the Bill or will be dealt with, in the final analysis, by regulation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 were tabled by Liberal Democrat Members. We have no objection to the intention behind the amendments, but there may be a difficulty in defining precisely what is meant by "developments". That will need clarification.
<P>
As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire guessed, we intend to deal with those matters in guidance, and regulations will be consequent upon the Bill. Those regulations could provide examples of developments and clarify how often complainants should receive information about their complaint. We shall need to return several times this morning to the issue of what is appropriate on the face of the Bill and what should be dealt with by regulations.
<P>
The difficulty of putting all the provisions into the Bill is that that makes it very difficult to amend without further primary legislation. Regulations, however, make it much simpler to do so and to respond to problems as they arise. As I say, we shall return later to the important issue of keeping complainants in touch with developments through regulation. With that assurance, I hope that the amendments will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon </B>(Newry and Armagh): I drafted amendment No. 65, which also relates to clause 64. The amendment is necessary in order to keep in accord with clause 64(2)(b), which deals with informal complaints. Information relating to formal complaints does not match the provision made there for informal complaints. The same argument for open and transparent communication about the outcome of the complaint should apply in both cases.
<P>
The amendment would insert a new paragraph (cc) which specifies
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"procedures for giving a complainant whose complaint has been the subject of formal investigation a record of the outcome of that investigation."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If amendment No. 65 is accepted, that information and report would be available as a matter of course rather than on application by the complainant. That would serve the interests of transparency, and ensure that every complaint reaches a conclusion, with the complainant having full information about its resolution. The same type of procedure should apply in relation to the formal investigation as is specified for the informal investigation in clause 64(2)(b).
<P>
No doubt the Minister will agree that every subsection should promote transparency. I hope, therefore, that he will accept this technical amendment, which will make the subsection consistent with the others in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I acknowledge the point made by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) especially as it applies to clause 64(2)(b) that there is a regulation-making power in the clause for the informal resolution of cases. We are at one with the hon. Gentleman in wanting to enhance confidence in the system for dealing with complaints. Making the system more open will play a major part in achieving that aim.
<P>
However, what the amendment would achieve is already covered in the Bill. Clause 64(2)(j) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any action, determination or decision of a prescribed description taken by the Ombudsman shall be notified to prescribed persons within a prescribed time and that, in connection with such a notification, the Ombudsman shall have power to supply the person notified with any relevant information".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We intend to use the regulation-making power and guidance to place a requirement on the ombudsman to inform complainants of the outcome of their complaint within a specified time. That covers the hon. Gentleman's point and, indeed, goes further, in that it covers time limits and will allow the ombudsman to give a report to the complainant on his or her case. That will encourage greater openness, which will be picked up in the regulation-making power. The power is in the Bill anyway and the regulations will make it even clearer. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I remain unconvinced. Clause 64(2)(j) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Ombudsman shall have power to supply the person notified with any relevant information".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister tell me where in the clause is the requirement, not just the power, that the ombudsman should supply the relevant information? If he can convince me that there is such a requirement in the clause, he will have convinced me that there is a mechanism to ensure that records will be provided. The power to take action and the requirement in legislation to do so are two different things. I remain to be convinced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Let me try again. I take the hon. Gentleman's point about "shall have power", but that follows on from the Secretary of State issuing regulations. The Secretary of State will produce regulations so that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any action, determination or decision of a prescribed description taken by the Ombudsman shall be notified to prescribed persons within a prescribed time".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That places an imperative on the Secretary of State, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that that will happen. Detailed guidance in regulations will cover his points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> This extremely important clause deals with how complaints will be addressed in the first instance by the various bodies that can receive the complaints or by the ombudsman. Subsection (3) sets the point at which the ombudsman begins to record the complaint and assess its merits and type. From subsection (4) on, the clause deals with the initial sifting and assessment of complaints.
<P>
The Committee for the Administration of Justice has raised the problem of identification of individual officers. Subsection (4) depends on a correct assessment being made of a complaint against a member of the police force. It
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"applies to a complaint about the conduct of a member of the police force".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I assume that that can be read to include more than one member. The subsection requires identification of individuals or groups about whom the complaint has been made. The CAJ has made several approaches about the wearing of identification numbers by officers and has found that it is not currently possible to ensure that they are always worn. The CAJ states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there are many instances where the identity of the individual officer cannot be established ... and/or a focus on an individual complainant's testimony would trivialise what is really a policy concern. For example, CAJ in seeking to get satisfactory answers to concerns at the failure of officers to wear IDs during various public order situations in the summer of 1997, were asked to identify the officers concerned and/or identify the individual observers who claimed they had seen officers without IDs. Yet our concerns would not have been assuaged if the police interviewed individual CAJ observers and explained (if they could) the specific circumstances involved nor if individual officers were identified and disciplined ... The decision by the Chief Constable to send a reminder about ID display by all officers was very welcome, yet a short while later observers again saw officers without individual IDs displayed. The Ombudsman must have the possibility to intervene in such matters."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems a valid point because complaints against a divisional officer, which the ombudsman would have to assess under subsection (4), are important. From that initial assessment follows the procedure that we shall discuss when we come to clauses 53, 54, 55 and 56. If it is impossible to identify a specific officer, where will the complaint or the complainant go? Will it be taken as a general complaint against policy the policy being that identification numbers are not being worn in public places on such occasions? Will the complaint be referred back to the Police Authority as a general complaint about implementation of policy by the Chief Constable or a senior officer?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It would be helpful if the Minister would explain how proper criticism from the CAJ will be dealt with to[Mr. Moss]
assuage the fears that the clause, especially subsection (4), lacks teeth. There is a loophole because police officers who do not wear their ID cannot be identified in the way specified in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The clause is important, as is identification. A crucial point is that the Bill covers all complaints and not just those about specific wrongdoing. It covers complaints about operational or policing policy and not just the actions of individual officers in specific situations. That is what Dr. Hayes recommended in his report and it is worth reflecting on what he said. Paragraph 18(15) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I suggest that the Ombudsman should be the focus for all complaints about policing whether the policy issues are incidental or central to the complaint. This would provide a clear route for raising matters of concern and would, I believe, simplify matters for complainants."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I believe that the point made by the hon. Gentleman would have been true about the previous arrangements. In this case, if there is a complaint about individual officers who cannot be easily identified because their identification numbers are concealed, the complaint would go to the ombudsman and then to the appropriate section of the police. There would be accountability and responsibility because those police officers must be under the command of superior officers. I am sure that the ombudsman would regard that as a matter of concern, and the Bill provides the clarity for him to decide that it is a complaint that must be investigated. If there was a problem of indiscipline, he would hold the relevant police officers accountable for their actions.
<P>
The new arrangement, giving additional power to the ombudsman over the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, would cover the points raised by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I think that I understand what the Minister is saying. He quoted from the Hayes' report and I looked up the same paragraph. I want the position clarified to the Committee. Would a complaint against an officer who cannot be identified become a general complaint? Would it be covered by subsection (6), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Where the Ombudsman determines that a complaint made or referred to him under paragraph (1) is not a complaint to which subsection (4) applies, he shall refer the complaint to the Chief Constable, the Police Authority or the Secretary of State as he thinks fit and shall notify the complainant accordingly"?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (4) applies to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a complaint about the conduct of a member of the police force".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Essentially, my example is of a complaint about a member, but an unidentifiable member, because identification is not worn. Under such circumstances, would the ombudsman consider subsection (6) and tell the Chief Constable or the Police Authority that not only one, but several or indeed many officers do not wear ID under some circumstances? That would become a policy complaint, or a general complaint, with which the Ombudsman must deal. Or would it remain a complaint against an individual member? If that individual member cannot be identified, I am not sure how the complainant will obtain restitution. The complainant has made a specific complaint against an individual because of assault, or some type of conduct that would normally fall within the ombudsman's remit, which may lead to a disciplinary measure. I am still not clear about how the matter would be dealt with.
<P>
CAJ accepts that Dr. Hayes addressed the issue of complaints about operational policy. As the Minister says, the Chief Constable is allowed to deal with those. However, CAJ feels that Hayes also emphasised the importance of the Chief Constable's being answerable to the Police Authority on such matters. On page 88 of the list of recommendations, paragraph 19.52 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The opportunity should be taken in the legislation arising from the tripartite review of policing to clarify the role of the Authority and to establish it as the body to which the Chief Constable is responsible for providing a police service for the community."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It may be argued that enough has been done in the Bill to achieve that end. However, in the context of the issue that I have raised, does it sufficiently emphasise that in the CAJ's example, it would not be merely a question of the ombudsman passing the buck down the line to the Chief Constable or to the Police Authority? Who will be responsible for taking action in such circumstances?
<P>
CAJ felt strongly enough to submit its own amendment for consideration, which emphasises the authority of the Police Authority at that juncture in matters that relate to the ombudsman. We did not see fit to incorporate, or to utilise, that amendment, but it is nevertheless important in our discussion that the Minister make it clear that that contingency has been allowed for and will be covered by the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have raised an important point, to which further amendments at a later stage will apply. It is the age-old problem of complaints such as we have witnessed so often in the past and will witness again in future.
<P>
What happens when a legitimate complaint is made, and the process starts to deal with it, but the complainant or witnesses cannot properly identify the officer against whom the complaint is made? Would the complaint die? Or would there be, as I believe that there should, even in such circumstances, a reportable conclusion stating that there was insufficient co-operation from within to identify the officer or officers against whom the allegation was made? That is a crucial point, which the hon. Gentleman was right to raise. In many situations police wear riot gear, which makes it almost impossible to identify a person by number, rank or looks. I have attempted to address this problem with subsequent amendments, and I hope that the Minister will respond in a way that gives some hope that the new system will not cause the blockage that occurred many times in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): I understand what the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh wants to achieve. Will he not admit that it would be wrong to try to create a legal precedent when an attempt to identify a miscreant fails? It is simply not done, and there is no onus on the legal system to produce reports indicating what was done to try to identify the miscreant.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also gave the example of police officers being unidentifiable in riot gear. Is it not the case that that is not a normal circumstance and that it is becoming less likely that police will be in riot gear unless they are confronting a riotous crowd? In fairness to the Royal Ulster Constabulary 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is a lengthy intervention. As the hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to contribute to the debate later, will he bring his interventions to a close?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I apologise, Miss Widdecombe, I am confident that the hon. Gentleman understands my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> That is not a confidence that I share, but I understand what the hon. Gentleman is getting at and I shall try to tease it out.
<P>
I am aware of two incidents in the recent past, which will be the subject of complaint. In both instances the police officers were clothed in riot-type gear; in neither instance were the officers confronting a riot. I do not want to prejudice any future court cases, but the hon. Gentleman will accept that the capacity to identify a person does not exist in such circumstances.
<P>
I was vague about the hon. Gentleman's comment about a change in the law. I do not understand it. At the beginning of the troubles in the north of Ireland in the late 1960s, it was suggested that there was a conspiracy of silence: that was made not by me but by an eminent jurist. We know about the case, and about its effect down the years. This new and valuable system must ensure that an investigation that is carried out under the aegis of an ombudsman, who has support and expertise available to him, cannot be delayed because there is not the capacity to identify the person against whom a complaint is made.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If identification cannot be made, a report should be published stating that the reason that a final conclusion could nto be reached was that the ombudsman and those investigating the case on his behalf were not able, within the system, to identify the person who committed the transgression.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson </B>(Belfast, East): The hon. Gentleman seems to accept a scenario that I have never accepted. It should be possible at all times to identify police officers. It should not matter whether they are wearing riot gear, or whether the divisional mobile support units put jumpers over their numbers to hide them. At all times police officers should be identifiable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. Would that that were the case but if it were, the amendment would not have been tabled because it would not be necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> There should be a requirement on the police to be identifiable at all times. Under the present arrangements, the police are allowed to go out without identification in certain circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I fully agree the hon. Gentleman and I are making the same point. Several serious cases have been blocked because of that problem. I could cite two cases that are presently under consideration.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that we are having a clause stand part debate on clause 52, and that we should not anticipate future debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank you for your guidance, Miss Widdecombe.
<P>
The value of the new procedure could be lost if it does not, in effect, ensure that identification is possible in circumstances that we all know about, some of which are currently under investigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I do not think that members of the Committee who have spoken on this matter are in disagreement. It is important for police officers to be identifiable at all times that is in the regulations, and that is what should occur.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire discussed a complaint against a member of the police, and seemed to imply that it might be difficult to complain about a group. When questions are raised about conduct, complaints will always be against a member rather than against a group. One could not have a charge against a group although there could be multiple charges against those who make up a group.
<P>
The proposals take us a long way. The ombudsman will be in control of the whole procedure. He decides what is a complaint and how it should be investigated. There is no difficulty about saying that a fault occurred because people could not be identified. It is possible to show that someone was not wearing identification.
<P>
If there is a substantial complaint, it is plainly desirable to identify the officers involved. There is an obvious problem on the spot if the officers have taken steps to avoid being identified, but that is a disciplinary fault and a sergeant or a more senior officer who allows officers in a section of his force to go out with their identities concealed can himself be identified and asked why that was allowed. The officer can be told that he was allowing his force to break regulations and there can be a disciplinary case against him.
<P>
When news of that gets around, I think that any sergeant or inspector will say, "If I am to be held accountable and that will go on my record, I certainly will not let any member of my force go out that way." I recognise the complexity of the problem, but we hope that the system that we are introducing, which puts independent control in the hands of the ombudsman, will allow us to tackle these issues more effectively than we have in the past.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister has repeatedly said that the ombudsman is in control. Everyone hopes that that will be the case, but the problem that was raised by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh has occurred on many occasions. If it is a simple case of internal discipline, why has the problem not been solved? Why does it recur? Why have no senior officers or sergeants been disciplined when it has occurred?
<P>
I agree with the CAJ that there must be a reconnection with the ombudsman. Clause 52(4) relates to an individual member and complaints of that sort proceed down a particular road. Subsection (5) applies when:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Subsection (4) does not apply to a complaint in so far as it relates to the direction and control of the police force by the Chief Constable."<P>
</UL></FONT>
[Mr. Moss]
<P>
Subsection (6) adds that if subsection (4) does not apply, the ombudsman shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"refer the complaint to the Chief Constable, the Police Authority or the Secretary of State as he thinks fit and shall notify the complainant accordingly."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is fine as far as it goes.
<P>
However, the ombudsman may determine that a complaint about non-identification falls under subsection (6) and should be referred to the Chief Constable, the Police Authority or the Secretary of State. Subsection (7), the crucial subsection, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A complaint referred under subsection (6) shall be dealt with according to the discretion of the Chief Constable, the Police Authority or the Secretary of State (as the case may be)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The crucial words are "at the discretion of". The Bill does not say that the complaint shall be referred back to the ombudsman for judgment or so that he can make a statement. That is what the Committee on the Administration of Justice is getting at. It wants the ombudsman, having passed the matter on, to be able to take charge of it again and to say to the Chief Constable, "I gave you this problem but you have not dealt with it because it is recurring. Tell me what you have done, and why it is not working." The Bill fails to make such provision.
<P>
If I had a complaint such as I have outlined, I would not be satisfied as a complainant if I was told only that my complaint about unidentified officers had gone to the Chief Constable or the Police Authority. The ombudsman would write to tell me that, but would not write to me a second time to say that he had put my complaint to the Chief Constable or the Police Authority and that he, or it, had done X, Y or Z. Such reconnection has to be made. How can the ombudsman stand over an issue when the Bill does not appear to require the three bodies to report back to him and obtain his final judgment or at least an assessment of how the complaint has progressed and a statement of his findings and his comment to the public about his dissatisfaction or otherwise with the way in which the matter was handled? This is an extremely important issue, but, so far, the Minister has not made it clear to us how Government intend to address it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> This is indeed a significant issue and our aim is to strike the right balances in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will recall earlier sittings when we discussed the powers of the Chief Constable and the Police Authority and the need to clarify the areas to which they relate. It would undermine what we recognise is the Chief Constable's important control over his force if we were to propose that there be a "super" Chief Constable for matters of discipline a disciplinary force above the Chief Constable that undermined him. It is important that complaints be given to the ombudsman for investigation in the appropriate way, followed by a judgment from him. Afterwards, the Chief Constable would exercise his power and his disciplinary procedures in the full glare of publicity. I have every confidence that if the Chief Constable falls down on his job in that respect, not only the ombudsman but everyone would notice, and his failure would have to be acted on. The same would apply with the Police Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> May I give the Minister an example? Let us say that an incident has taken place, and that those three men there are being investigated by the ombudsman, or by someone else, but that, whatever type of interview takes place, responsibility for the incident cannot be established because none of the three will reveal who was to blame. What do the Chief Constable, the Secretary of State and the ombudsman do?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> It is always easy to devise an impossible situation and ask what one does. The issue is indeed important, but I hoped that I had answered the question earlier by saying that under the new disciplinary powers and procedures prevention will be better than cure. I cannot imagine superior officers, under the new rules, allowing their force to behave in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests because responsibility would rest with those officers. However, I hear what he says, and note the views of all members of the Committee.
<P>
I was about to refer to the Chief Constable and the power of the Police Authority. A very important power of the Police Authority is that it has responsibility for the discipline and conduct of police officers. To take that power away would be wrong, but the authority is subject to the scrutiny of the ombudsman and of the public. It is also under the scrutiny of Parliament: if the system did not work, it would have to be amended.
<P>
This has been an important debate. We will look at the clause, and if we feel that issues have been raised with which the clause does not deal adequately, we shall return to it on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): Perhaps it is not only members of parties other than the Labour party who feel that this is a significant matter that ought to be considered further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I note what my hon. Friend says. If the Government feel that there are loopholes in the Bill, we can deal with them on Report. However, I emphasise the importance of not undermining the Police Authority and the Chief Constable by introducing procedures that take away their responsibility for aspects of discipline. These crucial matters must be borne in mind, although we recognise the anxieties that exist.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We certainly welcome the Minister's latter comments that he and his officials will look carefully at the debate on clause 52, and his assurance that, if there are loopholes that are not covered by other parts of the Bill, they will deal with them in time for Report.
<P>
Although I am happy to hear the Minister say those things, I ask him to go a step further and to write to the Committee long before Report so that Conservative Members can know whether movement on this matter is likely. It is important that we get it right.
<P>
I think that a loophole exists, and I refer back to the Minister's claim that the ombudsman is in control. That is the most important principle, and would be dealt with easily in a separate subsection after subsection (7) covering the three bodies that have their own powers in the statute.
<H4><center>[Mr. Mike Gapes in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
I agree with the Minister's plea not to undermine the authority of the Police Authority. However, the desire of the Committee is to ensure that the Bill strengthens the ombudsman's pre-eminent power. It is also vital that the police complaints procedure is strengthened as a result of Dr. Hayes's report and the new office of ombudsman. Moreover, the ombudsman must be seen to be a pre-eminent and important position.
<P>
Another subsection could require the Chief Constable, the Police Authority and the Secretary of State, when dealing with complaints referred to them under subsection (6), to deal with them at their own discretion. We do not want to undermine their individual powers but they must report back to the ombudsman. It will be the ombudsman who will have instigated the complaint and decided who has the prerogative and who must deal with it: he cannot just walk away.
<P>
Somebody has to report back to the ombudsman so that he can take a view and make a statement about the case. If he is unhappy with what the Police Authority has done, he should say so. He is ultimately responsible for the complaints procedure and for making sure that complainants feel that their cases have been looked at properly. The Minister and his officials can examine that. Will he assure members of the Committee that he will write to us as soon as possible with his thoughts on the matter? We would then have sufficient time before Report to consider possible changes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I agree that the complaint must return to the ombudsman, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that it must subsequently return to the complainant and the public, so that the reason for the failure to reach a conclusion is made known?
<P>
 Other amendments do not tackle the matter in a substantive way, but they consider the ombudsman's possible conclusion. Will the Minister make relevant suggestions when later amendments are debated, so that progress might be made before Report?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am sure that the Minister heard the second, and important, suggestion of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh. It would help the Committee if the matter could be dealt with before its proceedings finish. That is for the Minister to decide, but the hon. Gentleman's suggestion is a good and helpful one.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's first point is one that I thought that I had made already. I agree that the purpose of returning a complaint to the ombudsman is for the ombudsman to pronounce on it, not only for the public's benefit but for the complainant's. Ultimately, the complainant's complaint should be dealt with; otherwise, what is the point of the Committee's work?
<P>
Returning a complaint to the ombudsman not only enables him to take a view on its handling, but avoids the embarrassment of a complaint that was initially forwarded to the Secretary of State under subsection (7) being subsequently criticised publicly by the ombudsman. Such an eventuality is unlikely under the present, or indeed the previous, incumbent. However, in such a case an ombudsman should feel sufficiently powerful and influential with the Northern Ireland community to be able to speak his or her mind about the way a complaint is handled.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the ombudsman is appointed to protect the interests not only of the public but of the Royal Ulster Constabulary? Does he also agree that it is incumbent upon the ombudsman to report instances of malicious or mischievous complaint? There must be a quid pro quo.
<H4><center>[Miss Ann Widdecombe in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. There must be fairness, even-handedness and balance. If he is patient, we will come to that matter in the stand part debate on the next clause. I am talking about the need for genuine complaints against police officers to be dealt with and to be seen to be dealt with properly and for the ombudsman to control and be responsible for their outcome. At the moment, the ombudsman appears unable to do that.
<P>
Complaints that are deemed to be malicious or vexatious Dr. Hayes' report contains a large section on that issue must also be tackled in a balanced manner. The Bill fails to do that. I shall return to that point later.
<P>
Will the Minister write to the Committee with his thoughts on the matter, or focus on the suggestions of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh when we debate his later amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I have listened to the debate with interest because the balancing of powers is a crucial issue. I am sure that we agree that we should not do anything to undermine the powers of the Police Authority, the Chief Constable or the Secretary of State. Removing responsibility from those bodies might create a supreme court that functions as an ombudsman with regard to certain actions. That could be viewed as double jeopardy.
<P>
We agree totally on some points for example, informing complainants of procedures and outcomes. Everybody recognises that that is a difficult balancing act. I will write to Committee members after further consideration of the issue. I cannot give an undertaking to make a change, but in a co-operative spirit I acknowledge the points that have been made. We shall consider whether we can strengthen the report to the ombudsman about what has been done.
<P>
However, giving the ombudsman further powers in the manner of a supreme court would create difficulties. The ombudsman knows what happens to the complaints that he forwards for action by the Chief Constable, the Police Authority and the Secretary of State. He has the power to talk about dissatisfaction in his annual report and in individual cases can bring that dissatisfaction to the attention of those authorities.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 52 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 53</center></H4>
<H4><center>Complaints informal resolution</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 26, line 42, leave out "to be" and insert "who has been".<P>

<P>
This small amendment would clarify subsection (5). The current wording is ambiguous. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Chief Constable shall, at the request of the Police Authority, provide a member of the police force to be appointed by the Police Authority under subsection (4)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that the Chief Constable is in charge and provides a member whom he deems suitable for the job required by the Police Authority. The amendment would replace the phrase "to be" with "who has been". The Police Authority would have the responsibility to decide, initially through the ombudsman, what cases would be suitable for it to investigate and which senior officer should conduct the investigation.
<P>
The Police Authority should be given a degree of freedom to choose the appropriate officer. The current wording suggests that the Chief Constable may offer one or two candidates that the Police Authority will be required to appoint. My amendment would clarify that.
<P>
The Government may intend that the Chief Constable should offer a staff member to the Police Authority. I do not think that that is right: the Police Authority should be reasonably free to make the choice. To ensure public acceptance of the procedure, there should be no possibility of accusations of collusion being made regarding, for example, the regular selection of certain police officers for investigations, or the choice of the right person for a particular investigation.
<P>
The Police Authority should be in charge of the procedure and should be free within reason to choose a police officer of sufficient standing to undertake investigatory work. Is it possible that the Chief Constable could make a pool of officers available? My understanding of the clause is that he will provide a member to be appointed. Will the Minister clarify that?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend's argument. It can be extended by comparing the text of subsection (5) with that of subsection (4). That comparison compounds the confusion. Subsection (4) implies that when the ombudsman refers a complaint either to the Chief Constable or to the Police Authority for informal resolution, the Chief Constable or the Police Authority
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may appoint a member of the police force to do so" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, to come to an informal resolution of the complaint. The relevant disciplinary authority makes that appointment. If that is the Police Authority, under subsection (4) it appoints a member of the police force. However, a different scenario is depicted in subsection (5). It states that the appointment is made not by the Police Authority but by the Chief Constable the Police Authority merely requests that the Chief Constable provide a member of the police force to be appointed by the authority. That is a very different state of affairs.
<P>
Subsection (4) suggests that the Police Authority has the executive authority to appoint a police officer to conduct the informal inquiry. Subsection (5), however, suggests that executive authority lies with the Chief Constable, albeit in obligatory response to a request from the authority.
<P>
Amendment No. 123 would clarify the ambiguity of, and resolve the contradiction between, subsections (4) and (5). The amendment would make it clear that the appointment is made by the Police Authority, and that the Chief Constable's role is to implement that appointment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> I thought that I knew what the clause meant before the Committee began this debate. Amendment No. 123 is therefore useful, because it will encourage the Minister to place clearly on the record what the procedure will be.
<P>
My assumption was that the Police Authority would deem it appropriate that inspector A should carry out an inquiry, that the authority would then ask the Chief Constable to provide inspector A for that inquiry, and that it would then formally appoint inspector A.
<P>
I can picture at least two other scenarios. To take one, the Chief Constable could put forward the name of the best friend of the person who has been complained about, as the only option for appointment by the Police Authority. The procedure should be clarified, or even changed, so that it is evident that the Police Authority is in control, rather than the Chief Constable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> This is another useful amendment. I hope that I can clarify the contention caused by the phrase in subsection (5):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to be appointed by the Police Authority under subsection (4)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a question of the balance of powers. Throughout the passage of the Bill, we have agreed that the Chief Constable should be in control of the police force. It is his responsibility to deploy his officers as he sees fit. The Government would resist proposals that some other body should be able to tell the Chief Constable how he should use his officers. He would have more knowledge than anyone else about the relevant duties and relationships, and would be able to choose the most appropriate officer to conduct an inquiry. No other authority could have that knowledge.
<P>
The provision would give the Police Authority a veto power, if the Chief Constable were to propose an officer whom it considered to be unsuitable. The appointment of the inquiring officer would rest with the Police Authority, but the choice of the officer rests with the Chief Constable. He would be required to find a police officer to conduct the investigation, and the appointment would be made by the Police Authority, but it would be made through a veto power. The authority would not have the power to select a particular officer. The Chief Constable would have to propose an officer who, in the view of the Police Authority, would be a suitable person to conduct the inquiry. That ensures a neat balance between the relative responsibilities.
<P>
It would be unsatisfactory if the Chief Constable were to appoint officers who were considered inappropriate by the Police Authority, perhaps because of their previous service or relationships and so on. The final appointment is made by the Police Authority, but it does not undermine the authority of the Chief Constable to control his force in the way that he thinks best.
<P>
That should satisfy the legitimate points that have been made by hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister has made a reasonable attempt to explain the inexplicable.
<P>
The wording of the Police Act 1996 is a little different. Section 68(4) states: "If the appropriate authority" meaning a police authority in England and Wales 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"requests the chief officer of police" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is the chief constable 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"of a police force to provide a member of his force for appointment under subsection (3), the chief officer shall comply with the request".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems to be more in line with what Conservative Members are saying than with the Minister's interpretation of clause 53(5).
<P>
In England and Wales, if the police authority wants an officer, the chief constable has to comply with that. Why is the situation different in Northern Ireland? The Government refer to a balancing act so-called but they seem terrified of taking powers away from the Chief Constable. Under subsection (4), the Police Authority is able to appoint a member, and it is reasonable for it to have some choice in the matter.
<P>
I can envisage the Chief Constable writing to the Police Authority and saying that the chosen individual is doing such a good job that he should not be moved from here to there. I understand that and accept the Minister's argument in that context. However, there must be a middle way whereby a panel of officers is available from which the Police Authority can make its choice. I heard the Minister's assurances but we are not entirely satisfied. The Chief Constable could still offer only the officer that he wants to be appointed or a panel of officers, none of which is acceptable to the Police Authority. In that case, where do we go from there?
<P>
Someone must be in control. If it is left for the two parties to negotiate, agreement and a satisfactory outcome may occur, but the law should be explicit about what will happen in an impasse. At present, the Bill is not explicit and the Minister has not yet provided satisfactory answers to that problem.

<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The wording is almost identical to the Police (Northern Ireland) Order 1987, which deals with the appointment of officers for the investigation of complaints against senior officers, and it has never been suggested that it is defective.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that the 1996 Act, from which he quoted, does not provide for a named officer, only for an officer. We shall need to reflect on it further and ascertain whether the hon. Gentleman is right we have doubts about that. The clause is well worded and deals pretty well with the circumstances.
<P>
If the Chief Constable proposes an officer who is unsuitable for the task, the Police Authority has the power to veto it. As will always be the case in such circumstances, the Chief Constable and the Police Authority will not want a public disagreement over an officer. An important reserve power is in place. If the Chief Constable seeks to diminish an inquiry or make it less scrupulous, he has the knowledge that the Police Authority can reject his choice.
<P>
Reference was made to a panel, but I find it artificial. Each complaint will be different and I recognise that there will be a need for different qualities in officers, but drawing them from different geographical locations will be restrictive. I have answered the main points. Both the Police Authority and the Chief Constable will have influence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am listening carefully to the Minister. He said several times that the Police Authority has a veto and that it is contained in the Bill. Will he tell the Committee where in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> It is in subsection (5):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Chief Constable shall, at the request of the Police Authority, provide a member of the police force to be appointed by the Police Authority".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Police Authority can choose not to appoint that officer its veto power. The officer can take up the position only if the Police Authority agrees to appoint him. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> I shall be more charitable to the Minister, who has made a reasonable fist of explaining the provisions. As so often when considering legislation in detail, we attempt to throw up circumstances that might arise but probably never will. But there is the potential, although I accept the balance that has been struck. I do not see a great deal of difference between it and the England and Wales legislation. It still can bring about a set of circumstances where the Chief Constable provides and the Police Authority does not accept. Clearly from a public point of view the Chief Constable would be as embarrassed putting someone forward who was not credible as the Police Authority would be in turning someone down who was. At the same time there is no indication in the Bill how a stalemate could be resolved so the complaint can be dealt with.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> There will be a requirement in that the ombudsman will say that a complaint has to be dealt with by a particular route. It will be for the Police Authority and the Chief Constable to deal with it. If it is not dealt with the ombudsman will be very dissatisfied with an impasse. As the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) says, it is highly unlikely that the Chief Constable will not be able to find an officer who meets with the approval of the Police Authority in this very hypothetical case. The impasse will be resolved by a suitable officer being found. The ombudsman will be in the background if a complaint is not being dealt with in the appropriate way.
<P>
We are talking about informal resolutions. I am not saying that the complaints are not serious but they are those the ombudsman considers best dealt with by an informal resolution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> They are less serious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I am not saying that they are not significant or that they are trivial, as they will be[Mr. Worthington]
important to the complainant. The suggestion that there will be an impasse between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority over the appointment of an officer on an informal resolution case is a little far-fetched.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The clause is an important part of the Bill. It deals with the initial assessment by the ombudsman of where a complaint shall go next. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If it appears to the ombudsman that the complaint is suitable for informal resolution, he shall refer the complaint to the appropriate disciplinary authority."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is defined in clause 50 as either the Police Authority or the Chief Constable. Presumably in assessing whether the complaint is not serious, the ombudsman also assesses some of the serious complaints that he will deal with separately. Those are covered by clause 54, under which an assessment would be made. They would then be dealt with either by the ombudsman under clause 56 or the Chief Constable under clause 57.
<P>
Clause 53 relaes to an important point in the process, at which decisions are taken on the merits of the complaint. It provides for a complaint that is thought suitable for informal resolution to be considered by the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. Subsection (6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If, after attempts have been made to resolve a complaint informally, it appears to the appropriate disciplinary authority 
(a) that informal resolution of the complaint is impossible; or
(b) that the complaint is for any other reason not suitable for informal resolution,
the appropriate disciplinary authority shall notify the Ombudsman accordingly and refer the complaint to him.
<P>
Off the complaint would go to be considered by the Police Authority or the Chief Constable. It would be hoped that it could be resolved informally, but if for some reason that were not possible, it would be handed back to the ombudsman under subsection (6). He or she would have to decide what to do with it next.
<P>
A problem exists in the context of such assessments. It was raised initially by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis). Dr. hayes referred to it in his report as the problem of malicious and vexatious complaints. They are an important and difficult problem and should be dealt with under clause 53. Does the Minister agree?
<P>
The Royal Ulster Constabulary (Complaints etc.) Regulations 1988 provide that the Independent Commission for Police Complaints may, at the request of the RUC, dispense with complaints that are anonymous, repetitious or incapable of investigation. In cases of the latter sort, the police write to the complainant or his or her solicitor, to explain that unless the complainant co-operates, dispensation from the independent commission will be requested. That provision was extended by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (Complaints etc.) (Amendment) Regulations 1990, to include complaints that were vexatious, oppressive or otherwise an abuse of the complaints procedure.
<P>
The measures were intended to prevent the system from becoming clogged up and also as recognition of the fact that police officers are vulnerable to malicious complaints. According to Dr. Hayes's report, in 1995 the ICPC granted 572 dispensations out of a total of 2,627 completed cases. That is more than 20 per cent. of all the cases that were examined. A further 572 cases were withdrawn. About 43 per cent. of cases did not progress beyond the early stages of the compaints procedure. They may have hung around for a considerable time, but did not get very far. The statistics are on page 103 of Dr. Hayes's report. The percentage in the "withdrawn" and "dispensation granted" categories fell. For example, in 1993, half of all complaints were either withdrawn or dispensation was granted because they were not deemed proper complaints. The figure dropped to 49 per cent. in 1994 and to 43 per cent. of all complaints in 1995, but it is an incredibly high figure. We must ask why the problem is on such a scale. Dr. hayes attempted to answer the question in his report, and we must consider how the Bill will cope with such a serious problem.
<P>
In representations to Dr. Hayes, the Police Federation maintained that malicious or vexatious complaints left its members under a cloud a state of affairs that could continue for a considerable time, especially if the complainant declined to co-operate with the investigating officer. The Police Federation's submission to Dr. Hayes proposed a new provision that would make malicious and/or vexatious complaints a criminal offence or give police officers the opportunity to take legal action against the complainant.
<P>
Although Dr. Hayes expressed considerable sympathy with the argument advanced by the Police Federation, he nevertheless felt that introducing a new criminal offence was not the answer. His report stated that it was still open to officers to bring a civil action against complainants, although that has rarely happened. I understand that a charge of wasting police time could be made under the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967, provided there was sufficient evidence for the Director of Public Prosecutions to become involved. However, that course of action is not taken very often. Dr. Hayes stated that, in his recollection, such action had been taken against the Garda Siochana in southern Ireland only once, and had failed. It is not a particularly productive course to take. To strengthen the law in that regard may discourage people from making complaints, but we want genuine complaints to be investigated.
<P>
Dr. Hayes felt that much, if not all, the new structure proposed in his report was in the Bill, and the clause is an important part of that structure. He believed that the new structure would alleviate some of the problems because the system would be much quicker and more transparent, as complaints would be fed through the ombudsman. Dr. Hayes maintained that that would enable the officer against whom the complaint had been made to monitor the progress of his case. More significantly, the fact that control of the system will pass to the new complaints body under the ombudsman will overcome the current problem of the police being reluctant to seek dispensation, especially if they have not been seen to make every possible accommodation and have pursued a case almost beyond what is reasonable. In this context the police would be in a difficult position. They might think that a complaint was malicious or vexatious but that proving it would be difficult. They could not seek dispensation too early because they would be accused of cover-ups and of not acting appropriately. They would be in a catch-22 situation. We hope that under the new legislation under which dispensations will not occur the ombudsman will take control so that matters move more quickly.
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The fact that the ombudsman is independent a point that we have emphasised many times and separate from the police should make it easier to sift out malicious cases more quickly. Also, the ombudsman should be able to discontinue cases where complainants, or their solicitors many such complaints are put by third parties, mainly solicitors were obstructing progress. It might be thought that obstruction meant simply failure to co-operate. I am tole that, at present, a policy of non-co-operation is endemic in the Northern Ireland complaints procedure.
<P>
Dr. Hayes makes a clear recommendation in paragraph 19.31 of his report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Ombudsman should have the discretion to refuse or discontinue the investigation of a complaint which he has grounds to believe is malicious or vexatious or where he/she has found bad faith in the complainant".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an important recommendation which, as I have said, needs to be addressed in legislation, but I cannot find reference to it in the Bill.
<P>
The critical point comes in clause 53(2)(b), under which the ombudsman assesses whether a complaint is serious. If it is not, it goes to the informal procedure. The ombudsman will have decided under clause 52(4) whether a complaint is for him to resolve. He will then process it either for informal resolution, or otherwise. Under subsection (3), the complaint goes to "the appropriate disciplinary authority", which is defined in clause 50(1) as either the Police Authority or the Chief Constable. If the complaint is serious, the ombudsman will investigate it through his own department, under clause 56.
<P>
The only evaluation made by the ombudsman under clause 52(4) is whether the complaint relates to the conduct of a member of the police force. No qualitative assessment of whether the complaint is genuine, spurious or malicious is made at that stage. With regard to clause 52(4), all that is relevant is the fact that a complaint has been made against a member of the police force.
<P>
If the complaint were sent for informal resolution, it would go to the Chief Constable and his investigating officers. If non-co-operation is likely historically, it has occurred the process could be as protracted as it ever was. Instead of applying for dispensation the Chief Constable could, under clause 53(6), refer the case back to the ombudsman, and the police officer who has complained against would have made no progress. The complaint, which could be malicious or vexatious, would go to the ombudsman, and the Chief Constable and the investigating officers would try to reach an informal resolution. The process would be as difficult as it ever was and the officer would still be under a cloud.
<P>
At what point does someone Dr. Hayes recommended that it should be the ombudsman declare that there are no grounds for progressing a complaint because of malicious or vexatious intent? There do not appear to be proposals in the clause or elsewhere in the Bill to allow him to do so, but we should permit him to step in and to knock the matter on the head once and for all. Despite a strong recommendation from Dr. Hayes, I cannot see such a proposal in the Bill. It may be a matter for regulation. However, Dr. Hayes's recommendation was so important and strong that it should be included in the Bill in one form or another. When the ombudsman determines a case for informal resolution, and it goes to the Chief Constable or the Police Authority, he must be able to step in and say that the complaint was malicious or vexatious, and discontinue it. How will that important proposal be realised?
<P>
Subsection (7) is about the co-operation of complainants, which I hinted about earlier. Police officers and staff at the Independent Commission for Police Complaints felt and put their feelings strongly to Dr. Hayes when he was preparing his report that complaints were lodged by some solicitors and complainants for what the police and the ICPC called tactical reasons principally because the complainants were also making civil claims against the police or because they had been charged by the police and had lodged a counter-claim.
<P>
Surprisingly, according to the statistics that Dr. Hayes included in his report, some 50 per cent. of complaints fall under the category of assault. Those complaints often follow arrest and charge. The solicitors with whom the problem was discussed were unrepentant, and their message was uncompromising. They advised their clients in civil actions, of course not to complain or, if they did, not to co-operate. The Hayes report states that they felt that if their client did co-operate
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"they could find their statement used against them in any charges they faced".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report recommends that the matter should be addressed in some way. Is that problem dealt with in subsection (7), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"no statement made by any person for the purpose of the informal resolution of a complaint shall be admissible in any subsequent criminal, civil or disciplinary proceedings."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is it hoped that that provision will ensure that non-co-operation, which has been instigated partly or mainly I do not know by solicitors, will become a thing of the past? A number of cases clogged up the system previously I alluded to a figure of 43 per cent. but eventually powers of dispensation were given or the complainants withdrew. As a sizeable number of cases have fallen into that category in the past, can we expect the Bill's provision that complainants' statements shall not be used against them in court to free up that backlog? A police officer would use any evidence available to clear his name including a complainant's statement if a case were brought against him. If this[Mr. Moss]
matter is not dealt with by subsection (7), will the Minister say where in the Bill it is dealt with, if at all?

<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> This is another important part of the Bill. There is little disagreement between us on the importance of informal resolution, and the Hayes report recommended that complaints should be dealt with at the lowest possible level and should be informally and quickly resolved. The hon. Gentleman thinks that this part of the Bill should deal with the issue of vexatious and malicious complaints, but we do not agree. Members of the Committee agree in line with the Hayes report that the case for a separate criminal offence of malicious complaint has not been made. That view is coincidentally backed up by the Home Affairs Select Committee report, which appeared in December and stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We agree with fears that genuine complainants could be deterred if there were a new criminal offence of making a false complaint; we do not therefore recommend the introduction of such an offence".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the police were able to bring charges for making a complaint, some genuine complainants might feel trepidation about coming forward.
<P>
The ombudsman will have the power to deal with the complaint in the way that he sees fit at any stage. Clause 53(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Ombudsman shall consider whether the complaint is suitable for informal resolution and may for that purpose make such investigations as he thinks fit".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The ombudsman will always have the power to discontinue the consideration of any seemingly malicious or vexatious complaints, and it is important that discretion is exercised at every stage. Clause 64 is the regulation-making clause, and those regulations shall prescribe in detail what should happen to such complaints. The working parties to enforce the Bill will include members of the Police Federation. The hon. Gentleman can therefore rest assured that his points will be dealt with appropriately.
<P>
It is a difficult issue, and I have given a briefer response than that of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. However, I draw his attention to clause 64, because that is the appropriate point at which to raise the issue of vexatious complaints, rather than when we are discussing clause 53 stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> Until the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire spoke, I had not intended to speak on the issue. I do so only to urge the Minister although he needs little urging not to include in the clause the issue raised by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. Although he raises a substantive issue with which the Bill must deal, and although the Minister draws our attention to clause 64, I cannot see in clause 64 a specific reference to malicious or vexatious complaints, and I believe that the matter has been overlooked. In terms of Dr. Hayes's comments, it is a substantive matter with which the Bill must deal.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If such complaints are to be dealt with substantively, they should be dealt with before clause 53. Clause 53 deals with what the ombudsman regards as genuine complaints. He breaks them down at that stage into the more serious and the lower-level complaints. Therefore, by the time that we reach the clause we should already have weeded out the spurious complaints that must be dealt with. I have long advocated an independent complaints procedure, such as an ombudsman, as much for protection for the police as for civilians.
<P>
The central feature of clause 53 is that the complainant has some control over how the complaint is dealt with. It cannot be dealt with informally unless the complainant approves. Clearly, malicious and vexatious complaints should not be covered by this clause: a complainant with such a complaint may not agree to its being dealt with informally. If part of his purpose is to block procedure, he will simply say that he does not approve, and the normal process will have to continue. Such complaints must therefore be weeded out before clause 53.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. I examined the various clauses to ascertain under which clause it was most appropriate to raise the issue. Under clause 52(4), the ombudsman decides merely whether the complaint is against an individual officer, as opposed to against policy. He must move on from that to clause 53. If someone refuses to give his consent to informal resolution, that is the first clear signal to the ombudsman that the complaint may be malicious or vexatious. I therefore thought that it was more appropriate to raise the issue at this point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The informal procedure is more of an internal procedure. Anyone who makes a serious complaint against a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary may, for the very reasons that an ombudsman is being appointed, not want it dealt with internally by an informal procedure. It is, therefore, not necessarily an indication that the complaint may be malicious or vexatious. The complainant may consider the complaint to be so significant that it should not be dealt with by anyone but the ombudsman.
<P>
We need a weeding-out process before clause 53. Perhaps the Minister will consider the matter before Report. It cannot appropriately be dealt with under clause 64 because if that were the case it would be covered by regulations, when it should be dealt with in the Bill.
<P>
Under clause 53(2)(a) the complainant must give consent. Will there be a mechanism for him to withdraw that consent? When discussing earlier amendments reference was made to a stand-off. If the complainant saw his complaint becoming bogged down because of a difference between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority or if he believed that the complaint was not being dealt with seriously by the informal mechanism, would he be able to withdraw his consent? If so there could be other implications, and withdrawal of consent would have to be done at a reasonably early stage. If the complaint had an indication that the matter was not going his way through the informal process, he might want a second bite of the cherry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised a valid point. Perhaps the answer is to empower the ombudsman to enter the investigation at any stage, and in exceptional cases to take over the investigation, if he believes that there is good reason to do so. Would that not solve the problem raised by the hon. Gentleman and also strengthen the ombudsman's role?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That might well overcome the problem, because the complainant could make his views known to the ombudsman if he believed that there was a problem in the way in which his case was being dealt with.
<P>
In the overall setting of the clause, if a polic officer admits that a complaint is justified but it nevertheless goes back to the ombudsman, will the ombudsman see the records of the informal procedure? Considerable doctoring of records would be required if the ombudsman should not be able to ascertain whether there had been an admission by a police officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I shall deal with the points raised by the hon. Member for Belfast, East. I do not accept that the complaints should have been weeded out before the provision in clause 53 is implemented. Legislation is not set out in that sequential way. Provisions in later parts of the Bill may refer to earlier provisions, depending on how someone has contact with the system. Clause 64 deals with regulations covering the way in which complaints are conducted. It may be the 64th clause of the Bill, but depending on the way in which people make their complaint, it could be their initial point of contact.
<P>
A complaint may be weeded out or dealt with as appropriate by the ombudsman at any stage. The ombudsman will be in control. If he believes at the initial stage that the complaint is malicious and without foundation, he can refuse to deal with it [Interruption.] The ombudsman has control of the whole process and he will deal with complaints as he sees fit.
<P>
I was asked whether consent could be withdrawn. Yes, it can. If the informal procedure is not working out fairly, the person can withdraw the complaint at any stage and the ombudsman will have to deal with it. Yes the ombudsman will be able to see records relating to the informal procedure, and it will help him to understand the history of the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I assume that "at any stage" means at any stage before it is determined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Yes, at any stage before it is determined, the complainant will be able to withdraw consent to the informal procedure. Let us not be negative about it. Hayes and many others found that informal resolution works better; people find it more attractive and want to achieve it. Increasing numbers of cases are being dealt with informally, and if the system works and public credibility builds up we can expect more rather than less to be dealt with in that way. I note that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone wants to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am rather puzzled about the facility to change one's mind after having chosen the informal method of resolution. The sort of complainant who may be chancing his arm on a half chance may believe, as a result of being dept informed during the process, that he is doing better than he originally hoped, and may choose to beef up the procedure to do even better still, and refer up to the ombudsman. A dangerous precedent is being set.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I can only emphasise again that the finding of Maurice Hayes was that informal resolution of complaints was increasingly viewed as a satisfactory route and we should encourage it. I am not aware that he viewed the hon. Gentleman's point as a significant one. It is important for people who feel trapped, tricked or urged into an informal route that is not delivering, to have an escape from it. That it will probably not apply to a significant number, but we want to ensure that people are treated fairly by the system and the ombudsman.
<P>
If complaints are legitimate, the consent mentioned by the hon. Member for Belfast, East is important. If the system is not working and people feel that the police are dealing inadequately with a complaint, they can say, "I am not satisfied". The system would be undermined without that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Surely that is not a matter on which the complainant should have the right to make the decision once he has agreed to informal resolution; rather the ombudsman, keeping to his watching brief, should make the decision. In other words, it should be for the ombudsman, not the complainant, to redirect. Is that what is intended?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> In going into the informal process the complainant is accepting a lower level of investigation. That is why consent is required. The consent principle is in article 5(9)(a) of the 1987 order and it has worked. The points that hon. Members are making today have not emerged as a significant issue. I realise that anything could happen to test the system and a flaw could be exposed. But on balance, if people have accepted a lower level of investigation and they feel that the case has not been dealt with in a proper way, they should not feel that they have been trapped, tricked or duped into something inferior.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> I thank the Minister for some of those replies. When I say that the procedure comes before clause 53, I mean that it comes before the procedures in clause 53. The authority is given only in the most general terms to the ombudsman to do the weeding out. It should be there, although it does not matter in which clause; I would certainly support an amendment to clause 64 if that is felt to be the appropriate place.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As for the issue of withdrawal of consent, an individual who feels that his case is bogged down and has not been taken seriously is justified in having the matter referred to the ombudsman. The Minister spoke about fairness. If I were a police officer who was being investigated under the informal procedure and I had almost completed or even completed the various hearings that might be required, I might feel that I was not being dealt with fairly if, because things were not going the way a complainant had hoped, the whole[Mr. Peter Robinson]
thing had to start again under the ombudsman's procedure.
<P>
A withdrawal of consent can be valuable in some circumstances. As the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh suggested, it could be made by leave of the ombudsman so that the ombudsman can determine whether someone is simply looking for a second attempt to get the result they seek, or whether the case has genuinely been bogged down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister did not address the second question that I put to him about subsection (7), which he doubtless will when he speaks again. I have listened carefully to what he said. I looked again at clause 64 and combed it as carefully as I could to see whether it referred to the issue before us now. No clear-cut subsection in clause 64 deals with the problem. I said at the beginning that I had thought long and hard about which clause to raise the issue under.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Belfast, East pointed out, it is difficult to see which clause to choose. Perhaps it should not be any of the others but should come in clause 64. I disagree with the hon. Gentleman in the sense that in all the earlier clauses, particularly clause 52, the ombudsman is simply deciding whether the complaint is against an individual police officer or is a complaint about policy. That is all he is doing. He is not making an assessment about the quality or the merit of the complaint. I chose clause 53 because it is the first point in the process at which the ombudsman makes a qualitative judgment. He or she has to assess the merit of the complaint and what type of complaint it is.
<P>
In Dr. Hayes's summary of recommendations, paragraph 19.7 on page 83, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Ombudsman would categorise complaints under three headings: serious complaints, possibly involving criminal action (such as death in custody, serious injury etc.), which the Complaints Body has a statutory duty to investigate; less serious but still substantial complaints which might, at the discretion of the Complaints body, be remitted to the police for investigation and report, either supervised or unsupervised; and quality of service type complaints which would be remitted to the police for informal resolution".
<P>
A qualitative judgment must be made. The ombudsman has to consider the whole range of categories to assess which complaints are in the lower category and should be resolved informally, and those which go beyond that.
<P>
After that initial decision by the ombudsman, we move to the assessment of what is a malicious or vexatious complaint and the point at which the ombudsman I stress that it is the ombudsman, and no one else can decide that such a complaint has no foundation. Under clause 53, the informal process is undertaken by the Police Authority or the Chief Constable, as appropriate. If they cannot resolve it, it is referred back to the ombudsman. There could be a situation, similar to that which has occurred in the past, in which 43 per cent. of complaints were either withdrawn or judged to be vexatious or malicious. That is a huge figure. We need to address the matter now, to ensure that that situation is not repeated. Otherwise the costs involved in the new system will escalate and go through the roof.
<P>
In the context of what has happened before, if the Chief Constable and the police force receive an informal complaint and experience the same non-co-operation that has occurred in the past, they should refer the case back to the ombudsman. In the past they might have waited around on dispensation trying to decide how to deal with the complaint. They might have decided to progress the matter further and to give it three months or six months, because if they gave it a shorter period they would be accused of not progressing the complaint properly, of not taking it seriously, or of seeking to effect a cover-up.
<P>
In the new situation, if I were the Chief Constable I would go to informal resolution and I would put people in charge of the investigation. We would make contact with the appropriate people. At the first sign of non-co-operation I would kick the case back up the line to the ombudsman. I would not have my officers running around trying to deal with cases in which there was non-co-operation.
<P>
If cases can be referred back to the ombudsman at an early stage, surely the Bill should make it clear that they can be discontinued at that point. I am happy for the Minister to point out to me that that is the case, but I cannot quite see it. I want to clarify the matter. Spurious and vexatious or malicious complaints are at the root of the problem, and we need to ensure that they can be weeded out as quickly as possible.
<P>
Clause 64 deals with regulations, and it may cover all the contingencies and eventualities that might arise, and include the power to discontinue. I have looked carefully at the clause, however, and I cannot see exactly where that power is outlined. In his first response, the Minister said that the matter would be dealt with in clause 64, but he did not say under which subsection. Will the Minister tell the Committee which subsection covers the matter?
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The first issue to be considered is whether the categorisation of complaints into malicious, vexatious and others is sensible. There may be some substance in malicious complaints, although that is less likely in the case of vexatious complaints. The fact that a complainant is being malicious does not mean that the complaint is inaccurate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> What?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> People who have a long-standing grudge against the police force may have a rather malicious attitude when they make a complaint but nevertheless there may be some justification for it. The categorisation of complaints into malicious and vexatious may not therefore be sensible.
<P>
As hon. Members may know from constituency cases, it sometimes becomes clear that a matter that one has taken in good faith turns out not to be true, or perhaps a large element of the story has not been told. To imply that at the initial stage, complaints can be categorised as malicious, vexatious or insubstantial is false. The ombudsman should have the power, at any stage, to weed out complaints.
<P>
Some complaints are transparently untrue, insubstantial and perhaps malicious or vexatious from the outset. At that stage, the ombudsman can say that the case should not be taken further. In the case of other complaints such a decision may be taken later in the procedure. The clause is probably not the right place to regulate such matters, as it covers the informal resolution of complaints. I suspect that most people who make complaints which could be categorised as malicious or vexatious would want them to be formally resolved.
<P>
Much of what we are discussing would be properly dealt with in regulations. There is a limit to what can be stated in the Bill; we shall debate the matter further on clause 64, when the Government can state what will be in the regulations.
<P>
I apologise to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire for not dealing earlier with his point about subsection (7). That proposal removes the restriction on informal resolution of cases in the 1987 order, which stated that complaints which, if proven, could lead to criminal or disciplinary charges, could not be informally resolved. Dr. Hayes recommended the removal of that restriction, but there are safeguards for example, the complainant needs to agree that theinformal approach should be used. The fact that the ombudsman, not the Chief Constable, decides whether an attempt at informal resolution is appropriate is an important safeguard too. It is the ombudsman's intention to audit the outcome in such cases.
<P>
We agree with Dr. Hayes that the artificial restriction should be removed, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that assurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Does that specifically relate to paragraph 19.32 of the Hayes report? The Minister may wish to confirm that
