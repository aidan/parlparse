<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that remarks should be succinct and to the point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 418, in page 77, line 3, leave out ``profits of his trade'' and insert ``opening technical provisions''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 423, in page 78, line 33, after ``Board'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and for the purposes of subsection (3) above ``opening technical provisions'' in relation to an underwriting member means so much of the premiums received, or treated (in accordance with the rules or practice of Lloyd's) as received, by him under reinsurance to close contracts;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to clarify the meaning of subsection (3).

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendments concern the effect of an election that a company might make under subsection (3) to reduce its deduction from paid liabilities. Amendment No. 418 simply restates the principle, namely that the effect of a reduction in the tax deductions is to increase taxable profits. Subsection (3) ensures that there is a matching reduction in the taxable profit in the following period. The amendment restates the principle in a different form, referring to an adjustment to the ``opening technical provisions'' rather than to the profit of the following period. However, the effect would be exactly the same. The hon. Gentleman may be seeking an assurance that the amendments are a duplication of the provision; my understanding is that that is the case.

<P>
Amendment No. 423 requires a consequential amendment to the Lloyd's definition of ``technical provisions''. I am not sure why it has been tabled; it appears to add complexity, perhaps in order to seek clarity. I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman clarity.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her answer. In essence, the amendments have been tabled for clarification. If I have any further questions, I will write to her. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 421, in page 77, line 16, after ``rate,'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`adjusted for an appropriate risk margin'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to provide for a risk margin to be incorporated into the prescribed discount rate and, perhaps, to elicit from the Economic Secretary what that might be.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I hate to chide the hon. Gentleman, but I have said before that we accept that there is merit in the approach and that some allowance should be made in the discount rate. I hope that, on the basis of what I have said, the hon. Gentleman may feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her reply. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 422, in page 78, leave out line 22.

<P>
The amendment would remove unearned income reserve from the definition of technical provisions.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Again, I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman. Discussion on the matter is continuing with industry representatives, and the responses to the consultation paper have highlighted some practical issues concerning both unearned premium reserve and unexpired risks reserve. I should like to explore the matter further, and I hope that we may return to it on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 425, in page 78, line 44, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7A) The Board shall not make any regulations under this section unless a draft of them has been laid before and approved by a resolution of the House of Commons'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 429, in page 79, line 22, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(12) The Chancellor of the Exchequer shall undertake to carry out a review of the impact of this section on the United Kingdom insurance industry.

<P>
(13) Draft regulations under this section shall not be laid before the House of Commons unless and until the Chancellor of the Exchequer has certified, on the basis of the review carried out under subsection (12) above, that in his view such regulations if enacted would not have a significant adverse affect on the competitive position of the United Kingdom as a location for insurance operations.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In contrast to the previous technical amendments, this amendment deals with a more important point of principle. It goes to the heart of the issue because the proposals would be damaging to the UK insurance industry, which is-unlike that of the US-essentially global in its business. The amendment would require a full and proper study of the competitive effects of the proposals before they are enacted. The Minister said that the increase in taxation was insufficient to produce serious uncompetitiveness, but 5 per cent. of profits makes us more heavily taxed than Holland. Germany and others are now reducing their taxation. The Government's proposals will result in serious uncompetitiveness, which should be properly investigated and tested. We shall press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I went through the arguments before and I shall not rehearse them all again. I dispute the hon. Gentleman's summary that it makes us less competive than the Netherlands. That is not true. The changes cannot be viewed in isolation from other changes in the Bill or from the Government's proposals for a business-friendly economy and tax system. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General explained that in relation to schedule 30 on Tuesday.

<P>
Insurance companies and multinationals will benefit from the globalisation of group relief for trading losses and capital gains. They also stand to gain from tax relief for goodwill and intellectual property rights and from rollover relief on substantial shareholdings. They will have a new ability to carry a double tax relief forwards or backwards, which is potentially valuable for insurers. These points are additional to what I said earlier about competitiveness.

<P>
Amendment No. 425 relates to a different point. It would require regulations under the clause to be made according to the affirmative resolution procedure. It is similar to amendments tabled by the Opposition previously on clauses that provide for regulations to be made. Opposition Members made the same points about the Finance Bill 1998. The change proposed by the amendment is odd and contrary to the normal practice-tax regulations are normally made under the negative resolution procedure. It is also contrary to the approach of the previous Government before the election. Conservatives do not like the negative resolution procedure for tax regulations, yet they had 18 years in which to change it. I could give the hon. Gentleman chapter and verse, but he will understand if we are unsympathetic to changing a practice that was accepted by his party for 18 years.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Amendment No. 429 is important. If the Economic Secretary is right and we are wrong about competitiveness, she has nothing to fear from the amendment. A study properly carried out would validate her propositions quickly and the measure would come into force. If, on the contrary, we were right, it would prove that she was wrong, and the Government and the economy would have benefited from being endowed with a self-correction mechanism. Her argument suggests that there would be nothing to worry about. The Government should happily accept amendment No. 429. If they will not, we will divide on that amendment, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We carefully consider the competition aspects of any changes. We did so with the measure. It has been debated extensively this afternoon and was discussed much more widely in our original consideration. However, I have some difficulty in thinking that the hon. Gentleman will be present for the conclusion of a review. He asked about competition, disappeared, did not hear my response, then returned to re-embark on the issue. If we undertook a review, which we do not propose to do, I hope that the hon. Gentleman would be back for its results.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Like Ministers, who have dotted in and out of the Committee, I was not present for the responses. I apologise for that. I took the trouble to find out what was said, and from what I can gather-I shall obviously read the record-the Economic Secretary gave an account of a review. We are asking not for one account or for an account from Ministers who admitted that the measure would raise taxes, but for an account given by proper study.

<P>
If the Economic Secretary will not accept the amendment, the solution is to publish the detailed review that she asserts that the Treasury carried out. If she produced a full and detailed review and circulated it to the Committee, we would happily withdraw the amendment. I profoundly doubt that any detailed review has been carried out, because I feel virtually certain from what the industry has told us that if such a review had been carried out, the decision would not have been made. However, the Economic Secretary has it in her power to allay those fears. Does she have the review, and will she publish it?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am in some difficulty. There seemed to be a distinction between amendments Nos. 425 and 429, but I became a victim of the mumbling again, I am afraid. Can I have some clarification?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In purely practical terms, amendment No. 429 is the key amendment that requires the competitive study. We wish to vote on its principle. I would be grateful for your advice in achieving that, Mr. Cook. Would the vote need to be on amendment No. 425 also, as the amendments are grouped together?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> If I can admonish the hon. Gentleman, I can advise him that it is possible to withdraw amendment No. 425 and vote on amendment No. 429.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> At a later point?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes. The amendments must be decided on in sequence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 425.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 426, in page 79, line 14, leave out ``1st January 2000'' and insert ``1st January 2003''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 427, in page 79, line 16, leave out ``1st January 2001'' and insert ``1st January 2004''.

<P>
No. 428, in page 79, line 19, leave out ``1st January 2000'' and insert ``1st January 2003''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments would delay the introduction of the legislation for three years. Inadequate consultation time on some extremely important principles has been provided. Under self-assessment for corporation tax, insurers are faced with making quarterly payments next month that may be affected by the Bill. Not enough information is available to allow them to calculate the figure with any accuracy, particularly as the Government's proposals will introduce a tax regime divorced from commercial reality or regulatory returns.

<P>
The proposals contain an element of retrospection. The tax changes relate to insurance business that has already been written, in some cases. The baseline for the future hindsight calculations will be insurers' technical reserves as at the end of December 2000, or in the case of Lloyd's, reinsurance to close as at 31 December 1999, which closes the 1997 year of account. In both cases, premiums will have been priced without taking into account the increased tax burden that the clause will impose, so the impact on insurers' profitablity is in that sense retrospective. That is why we propose the three-year deferral.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Committee is well aware that the extent of the earlier discussion rules out a stand part debate. In closing, however, I would like to say that the debate has shown that the Government are not alleging that there has been deliberate tax avoidance over provisioning, but are merely raising the principle of the discount. The Government believe that that is the correct approach. We are strongly opposed to that in principle, for all the reasons that we have described. Also, we have a great conceptual difficulty. The risks are unknown and are in the future. When people make provisions, they automatically tend to discount them anyway. That is how companies will view the matter. If interest and inflation rates change, the Government's measures could impose differing amounts.

<P>
We feel that the £250 million a year of extra tax that the Government seek-it is clearly the objective of the clause-could do much damage to a competitive industry. To put it bluntly, Lloyd's is only recently back on its feet, so the measure is simply unwise and unsound in principle. We proposed an amendment to delay for three years for the technical reasons that I described, and also to reiterate our view that the proposals are ill thought through. We ask the Government sincerely to continue consulting hard with the industry as there are some good points, as with the mixer proposals. The Economic Secretary has suggested on some counts that the Government are willing to do so, and we hope that when we see the provision on Report it will have been amended so that it will not do what we fear.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Before I discuss the amendments, I should point out that £250 million is the sum over 10 years, the build-up of a 10-year, full-year effect. The figure is £50 million in the first year, spread across the industry. That is an estimate, but no one would dispute it.

<P>
The clause introduces proposed changes gradually in two important respects that the amendments do not take sufficiently into account. First, even if liabilities are older than the year 2000, they are treated as though they arose in 2000, and that would greatly limit the effect of discounting for old liabilities. Secondly, if a sum calculated like an interest charge is added to taxable profits, the interest period will not begin before the year 2000. That will also greatly reduce additional tax due under the clause.

<P>
I believe that the two aspects of the clause are sufficient to provide a gradual introduction, so there is no argument in favour of a further three-year delay. In any case, the additional tax will not be charged under the clause until next year, and companies will be able to use this year to adjust their deductions in advance, should they want.

<P>
I hope that I might persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. If not, I shall urge the Committee not to support it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to reinforce the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs made, in the hope that it will be considered. No doubt that hope will be defeated, but the Committee might justify its existence by making the Treasury think again. I understand that the matter was discussed after I spoke previously, and my hon. Friend has raised it again. However, one element may not have got into the Treasury's mind clearly enough.

<P>
There is a strong logical difference between the life business and the general insurance business. The life business is actuarially based and is not certain, but within the limits of human forecasting, it is as certain as possible. There is an identifiable cost-not a loss, but a cost-that can be seen years before the event. As my hon. Friend said, a forecast may go wrong. The advent of AIDS or advances in medical technology may either decrease or increase life expectancy but, even then, it is within relatively settled limits. Actuaries are paid large sums to achieve as good a purchase as possible on the actual cost. The concept of discounting makes abundant sense. It is as though someone was building up a pension fund to ensure that, when he retires, he will have the right amount of money to enable him to live the sort of life that he wants to live. To achieve that amount at the end of a certain period, it would make sense to invest money now and, hence, to accumulate returns. It is those returns that are being discounted.

<P>
Similarly, the life business knows from actuarial calculations that it will have liabilities, thus and so, in years hence, so it makes sense for it to provide and, in cash terms, to invest, an amount of money that is much smaller than that which is expected to be paid later because it knows that appropriate returns will have accumulated in the meantime. So far, so good. No one is denying the appropriateness of discounting in the life business.

<P>
The general insurance business is different in principle. It is only the word ``insurance'', which happens to apply to both businesses, that misleads the Treasury. Actually, although one business is insurance, the other is not. Life insurance is not assurance at all; it is a pension service. For interesting and historical reasons, with which I will not trouble the Committee, both services are described as the insurance business. The general insurance business is a genuine insurance service. It is not trying to handle a well-ascertainable later liability by putting money away now. It tries to provide through portfolio a minimisation of the exposure of individuals to genuinely uncertain risks, and no calculation that man or beast can do will give a certain amount at the end. All that there will be at the end is an uncertain loss.

<P>
Under those circumstances, if the industry is told that, in effect, it must discount when provisioning, it will simply raise the expected loss. It can do nothing other than that because, after all, it is already implicitly making that calculation. The clause will cause a serious conceptual problem.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson indicated dissent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Economic Secretary is shaking her head. Perhaps we are genuinely under a misapprehension. Indeed, while I am at it, perhaps the industry is, too. The hon. Lady must explain how the concept of discounting applies. We need to delay matters until the issue has been ironed out and we know where we are.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not know whether the look on your face, Mr. Cook, means that I should not engage in a debate about discounting in general, and how it can be applied under the clause as the hon. Member for West Dorset has invited me to do. We discussed that at some length earlier. In response to the hon. Members for West Dorset and for Arundel and South Downs, I have already said that the amendments would mean a three-year delay. The industry will face a £50 million bill in the first year only and it will be spread throughout all sectors. I cannot tell the Committee what the life insurance component of that is, but it will obviously not be the full £50 million. [
Interruption.] The hon. Member for West Dorset is muttering from a sedentary position, although sometimes he mutters from a standing position, too. I can only conjecture what his mutterings are about, and I shall not invite him to elucidate on them. The amendments would introduce the provisions more slowly, but those provisions will have a small effect in the first year or so, in any event. They are not being introduced in the next year and I am advised that they do not cover life assurance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Precisely. That is what I was muttering.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Our main argument is concerned with the clause itself, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 330, in page 79, line 31, leave out from ``relevant'' to end of line 34 and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) The Board may by regulations-

<P>
(a) make provision as to the circumstances in which a trustee who is a policy holder or annuitant residing in the United Kingdom is to be treated for the purposes of this section as not so residing; and

<P>
(b) provide that nothing in Chapter II of Part XIII shall apply to a policy or contract which constitutes overseas life assurance business by virtue of any such provision as is mentioned in paragraph (a) above.

<P>
(4) Regulations under subsection (1) or (3) above may contain such supplementary, incidental, consequential or transitional provision as appears to the Board to be appropriate.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The proposed changes are a response to our recent consultation with the insurance industry. Our intention is that clause 107 should enable insurers to compete effectively in writing life insurance business and especially pension business in overseas markets. The amendment will ensure that the clause can do that for policies that involve UK trustees. I do not know whether Opposition Members want me to read out the detail. If they are satisfied, I trust that the amendment will receive the Committee's support.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In contrast to the previous clause, we welcome this one, as it reflects the Government's acceptance and understanding of the global market in which British insurers operate and will need to operate evermore. In addition to the advantages mentioned by the Economic Secretary, it will relax the tax rules to allow UK life insurers to write business with overseas policy holders on a competitive basis. As she said, we hope that the market for pensions in Europe and for savings worldwide will grow. The Association of British Insurers envisages that markets beyond Europe will become relatively easier to penetrate, especially as population ageing increases the need for pensions and other savings throughout the world. We welcome the clause and hope that it meets our expectations.

<P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his support for the measures, which are intended to enable greater competition overseas for a wider range of overseas business. I hope that it will be well supported by all members of the Committee. Industry also welcomes the clause.

<P>
The continuing power to make regulations given in the clause allows us to fine-tune the definition, should there be developments in overseas markets. The new definition will take effect from a day appointed by a Treasury order; the current definition will continue to apply to business entered before that date.

<P>
I commend the clause and the amendments to the Committee.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I hope not to detain the Committee for too long, but I must make one or two points about the clause. It deals with schemes that are, in substance, equivalent to loans that aim to generate tax relief on far more than the actual costs of borrowing the money. It ensures that such schemes will not succeed. The schemes transfer a stream of taxable rental income in return for a lump sum receipt, but with the underlying risk and benefits of owning the property returned.

<P>
In substance, the transferor is simply borrowing money and paying it out of the rents. The scheme's claim is that the transferor reduces its taxable income by the amount of the rents that it diverts, but does not have to pay tax on the lump sum that it receives in return. The clause puts it beyond doubt that the lump sum is taxable as income, so the avoidance equivalent to trying to get the tax relief for loan repayments as well as interest will not work.

<P>
Commentators have accepted that the Government are right to act against such a clear attempt at tax avoidance. The legislation has been drafted to apply only to transactions that, in substance, replicate loan financing and are accounted for as such. Other transactions that are genuinely transfers of risk and rewards of property ownership are not affected. We have received no representations that the clause does not target exactly what it is supposed to target. It is unacceptable that a person who in substance borrows money should claim that tax relief on amounts far in excess of the actual cost of borrowing. The clause as targeted applies only to schemes entered into after Budget day.

<P>
There have been suggestions that a game of cat and mouse is taking place between tax planners and the Revenue, which is expected to continue in the future. I want to make it clear, on the record, that the Government intend the clause to stop the abuse. We hope that our action, and the warning that I am about to give, is sufficient to achieve that. This is the warning: we will not hesitate to act against any equivalent schemes that are designed to obtain a tax reduction that is not justified by the true substance of the transaction. If we have to legislate to deter new schemes, and deal effectively with schemes in existence at the relevant time, we will. The Government are committed to ending the abuse in the tax system, and the clause is necessary and appropriate action. It puts it beyond doubt that rent factoring schemes cannot be used to avoid tax.

<P>
In June 1997, the Inland Revenue announced in its tax bulletin that the view of tax law taken by those entering into rent factoring schemes could be susceptible to challenge. The Revenue continues to process challenges that it believes to be incorrect in the view of the law. For some years, that has worked, but we have started to see renewed interest in such schemes. We are acting in the hope that we can put it beyond doubt that rent factoring schemes should not be used. Through specific targeting, we have kept the measure as narrow as possible. If it goes beyond that limit, we will have to return to the matter.

<P>
I hope that that makes it clear to those who read the record of this debate that the Government are determined to act in this respect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> This is an unusual case. First, I must declare an interest. Secondly, in this instance, the interest is real. Thirdly, the Government are absolutely right, and it is astonishing that this action has not been taken before.

<P>
The fourth thing that I would like to say is that, in future Finance Bills, the Treasury should attend to a wider range of analgous activities. It would receive the support of the Opposition if it were to do so. I continue to believe that, even today, significant distortion is induced by leasing schemes, although leasing rules have altered greatly. There is no reason for those distortions to exist. No competitive issue exists, as it does in relation to many of the other proposals-for instance, the insurance proposals that we discussed. The clause has, appropriately, been narrowly drawn. The Paymaster General is right to issue a general warning and I should place on record the fact that people considering taking the action to which the Economic Secretary referred should expect the next Conservative Government to take the same attitude towards them as the present Government.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 109 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 110</center></H4>
<H4><center>Payments under deduction of tax</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 368, in page 86, line 43, leave out ``payments of interest'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`declarations under section 481(5)(k)(i) of the Taxes Act 1988'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It would be helpful for me to place on record issues that are of concern, possibly to the Opposition, but certainly to a wider audience in the Committee. First, the clause is part of a package of measures to promote the UK as a competitive environment for business while improving the effectiveness of exchange of information agreements to help prevent individuals and companies from evading or avoiding tax.

<P>
The clause has three effects, which I shall detail briefly before turning to the substance to the amendment. First, from April 2001 it abolishes the pay and collecting agent schemes, under which UK paying and collecting agents currently deduct income tax when they issue interest on quoted UK eurobonds or foreign dividends and interest. Secondly, it ensures that in future all interst on quoted eurobonds will be paid free of withholding tax. Thirdly, it introduces a minor modification to the tax deductions scheme for interest under which building societies banks and other deposit takers deduct income tax from interest payments made to individuals-which is the subject of the amendment.

<P>
I turn now to the amendment. The Inland Revenue has been consulting City representatives about the detailed implementation of the deduction of tax measures in the clause and the new information powers, to which we shall come later, in clause 140. During the discussions, strong representations were made for transitional arrangements to be put in place for the proposed modification to the tax deduction scheme for interest arrangements. The purpose of the transitional arrangements is to allow payments of interest made gross to existing ``not ordinarily resident''-NOR-investors to continue to be paid without deduction of tax when the new NOR reporting arrangements come into effect on 6 April 2001.

<P>
Under the current arrangements, a bank or building society can pay interest without deducting tax to an individual who is not ordinarily resident in the UK if he or she holds a valid NOR declaration. If that declaration does not, for some reason, contain the address of the person signing it, the deposit taker may complete a deposit taker's certificate, as long as he or she has no reason to believe that the investor is ordinarily resident in the UK. Completion of a deposit taker's certificate will validate the NOR declaration and allow interest on the account to be paid gross. Where a valid NOR declaration is in place, the investor can request the bank or building society to omit from its annual information to the Inland Revenue details of the interest paid on the account.

<P>
From 6 April 2001, new information reporting arrangements introduced by clause 140 will come into effect. Banks and building societies will be required to supply information about all interest payments to individual investors. That will include payments made without deduction of tax to NOR investors. To ensure that banks and building societies have the information that we need, the names and addresses of account holders will need to be shown on NOR declarations. Those details could be included in the annual information returns that banks and building societies make to the Inland Revenue. That will put the Inland Revenue in a position to exchange information if we have appropriate arrangements with other tax authorities. That will help to prevent individuals from evading or avoiding tax.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Clause 110 as drafted would require banks and building societies to ensure that fully completed NOR declarations were held for all their existing NOR investors by April 2001. Financial institutions have said that they can see no practical way of achieving that. They would have to review all their NOR accounts to identify those that were validated by a deposit taker's certificate. In a significant number of cases, they would have to obtain new NOR declarations that contained the address of the person who signs.

<P>
Amendment No. 368 will meet those concerns by ensuring that existing deposit taker's certificates will continue to validate NOR declarations made before
6 April 2001. As a result, the requirement to obtain the investor's address will apply only to new accounts that are opened on or after 6 April 2001. Furthermore, we have discussed with City representatives how, in the context of the Bill's proposals, we should obtain the information that was needed for the appropriate exchange of information.

<P>
Following helpful discussions, we agreed with City representatives that the requirement for beneficial ownership details from April 2001 should be limited to new NOR bank and building society accounts, for which new NOR declarations are made on or after 6 April 2001, and to NOR investors in unit trusts and open-ended investment companies. To ensure that banks and building societies have that information to pass to the Inland Revenue, the City representatives agreed that all new NOR declarations that are made on or after 6 April 2001 must show the name and address of the person beneficially entitled to the interest on the account. We shall table the necessary amendments on Report.

<P>
Discussions are continuing with City representatives on the fine detail of the arrangements. I am sure that all Committee members fully appreciate the importance of those discussions and the need to reach agreement with City representatives.

<P>

<B>Mr. Casale:</B> I congratulate the Government on abolishing the withholding tax, on their constructive dialogue with City representatives and other European countries, and on getting other EU countries to abandon plans for a Europe-wide withholding tax. In particular, I pay tribute to the Paymaster General for her constructive work-she chaired the code of conduct and tax co-ordination groups in the EU. That effort led to this excellent result for our country.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am slightly embarrassed by my hon. Friend's complimentary remarks, but I thank him for them. He is right-it is important to protect the City of London's business, which Opposition Members have discussed. We should ensure in international negotiations that we challenge avoidance without undermining what we believe to be the best-it is certainly the largest-financial centre in the world.

<P>
Discussions are still continuing with City representatives on the fine detail. Once those discussions have been completed, the detailed running of the scheme will be set out in regulations and laid before Parliament in due course.

<P>
So that hon, Members are fully informed, I shall flag up a few issues that are still of concern. First, there is the question of deposit taker certificates. Representative bodies are concerned that the proposed withdrawal of the facility for existing certificates will mean that financial institutions will have to deduct interest from a significant number of individuals in April 2001. The bodies see some practical problems with that, and we have tabled amendment No. 368 to deal with those concerns.

<P>
Secondly, there is the issue of paying and collecting agent rules. Those rules have not previously applied to collectives, but were to do so from April 2000. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has written to the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, acknowledging its early and constructive involvement in the discussions on exchange of information and consultation and accepting that the paying and collecting agent rules should not be applied to collectives in 2000-01. That was announced by the Inland Revenue in a press release on 17 April.

<P>
Several points were raised about the information that is collected, about how it is collected and about the people with whom it is exchanged. We are close to agreement with the City, and I hope to bring details of that before the House soon. I stress that the removal of the paying and collecting agent rules is an enormous step forward. We have done that with the support and advice of the City, for which we are grateful. The City and the Government believe that our current proposals will work, and we will bring those proposals forward as soon as possible.

<P>
I hope that that slightly wider explanation will assure hon. Members that there is agreement and that they will accept amendment No. 368 and, indeed, clause 110.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We have no objections to the amendment. I hope, Mr. Cook, that you will allow us the latitude to reply to some of the more general points that the Paymaster General has made about the clause, as a trade for not seeking a stand part debate.

<P>
If I may, I shall start at the intervention, rather than at the Paymaster General's remarks. Government Members seem to have convinced themselves that acceding to the ``or'' part of the EU's either/or proposition-either withholding tax or exchange of information-is a great triumph. Unfortunately, it is not. It would be a great triumph, if the blinkers had not been on and if the Government and other EU Governments had realised that there is a world beyond the borders of the EU. In particular, there is a country called Switzerland, which is not covered by the agreement.

<P>
As things stand, the result that we would have had, if the Chancellor had done the right thing and vetoed that proposition from the beginning-or had threatened to do so-has not been achieved. Instead, we have the ``or'' part of the either/or proposition and the prospect that yet more business will move to Zurich. That would bring advantage to neither the EU nor the UK. It would be to our great disadvantage.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I may be mistaken, but I have read in press reports that the agreement takes effect only when the other financial centres have also agreed to abide by it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention. If the Paymaster General wants to assure us that the EU genuinely will not implement the provision until it is clear that-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have allowed the remarks to go on the record as a means of counterbalancing comments from the Labour Benches earlier, but I think that I have allowed sufficient, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to return to the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am afraid that you are in the right as usual, Mr. Cook. I was indeed going very wide.

<P>
In relation to the clause to which the amendment relates, we do not want to cause a great fuss. We acknowledge that our own sources suggest that there continues to be constructive dialogue between the British Bankers Association and others and the Government. We simply hope that, in drafting the regulations, the Government will seek to achieve the best result that they can for the British banking sector in the light of the threat of Zurich, against the background-alas!-of the necessities imposed on the Government and our banking sector by the background, which I was mischievously beginning to dilate on, Mr. Cook, and on which you rightly reminded me that I am not allowed to speak at length at this juncture.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I briefly add to that? First, there is a city called Geneva, as well as one called Zurich.

<P>
However, the main point that I want to make is as follows. It is greatly to be welcomed that the Government have had serious, no-holds-barred dialogue with the City, knowing what the issues are. From my own career history-I should probably declare an interest-my particular concern is, for example, middle east potentates, who have historically kept huge sums of money in London because they trusted Britain more than Switzerland, but who are often quite tricky people and need to be handled carefully. We do not want to shoot ourselves in the foot with that type of private banking business.

<P>
We shall return to the territory more widely on clause 140, but, by way of putting down a marker, I hope that those discussions with the City will have envisaged some differences between different parts of the world, depending on their tax regimes. Self-evidently, where one is dealing with north America, continental Europe and so on, the situation is straightforward, but we are dealing with the various Gulf states-for example, Saudi Arabia-which is a different situation.

<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset has just said, we are pleased that these discussions are taking place, we believe that the Government are sensitive to Britain's commercial interests as a leading international banker and we hope that nothing will happen to damage that.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 430, in page 89, line 39, at end insert ``until 4th April 2002.''.

<P>
That is an important part of the Bill. Some of it was debated on the Floor of the House, but there are detailed provisions that we nevertheless want to question, and we have tabled amendments to that end. I should remind Committee members that, in respect of this matter, I have a declarable interest that is recorded in the Register of Members' Interests. I do not intend to repeat the point every time that I move an amendment this evening, and the amendments are indeed tagged to indicate that interest.

<P>
The part of the Bill that deals with stamp duty has become particularly important because the Government are using stamp duty as another way to raise money, and dramatically so. The top rate has increased from 1 per cent to 4 per cent., so stamp duty has become a very large revenue-earner indeed. It is also something of a stealth tax. The Chancellor is fond of implying that only home owners will pay higher rates of stamp duty, but the great majority of stamp duty is in fact paid by the commercial sector, so it is another tax on business.

<P>
As a result of the rate increases in every Budget, people are naturally seeking ways to avoid tax on their transactions, which probably explains why the Government are bringing forward powers to counter such avoidance. There is the familiar and rather depressing story of a tax becoming more prominent, people seeking to avoid it, the Government erecting a legislative framework to prevent avoidance, clever accountants and lawyers finding a way around it, and the Government assuming wider and stronger powers to try to counter such schemes. I am afraid that that is the future in respect of stamp duty.

<P>
The problem is that the structure is already extremely rickety. Stamp duty derives in large part from legislation that was enacted in 1891. It has been extensively amended, and the Government recently had another go, in the form of schedule 13 to the Finance Act 1999. However, it cannot be said that it proved a great success. Although the legislation is in a considerable mess, it is on that structure that the Government are seeking to raise more money. They are tagging on to the Bill a schedule that will give greater powers to the Revenue authorities. Schedule 33 states that the Treasury may do certain things
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if they consider it expedient in the public interest.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All parliamentarians should be on alert when they read a phrase such as that. The word ``expedient'' tends to mean expedient for the Treasury, and ``the public interest'' is a highly subjective concept when viewed from the Treasury's perspective.

<P>
In the clause and the accompanying schedule, the Government are effectively giving themselves the power to extend the tax and alter the description of any document that deals with land, stock or securities, thereby bringing them into the tax net. That is to be done not by the Finance Bill but by regulation. It is highly questionable whether the power to tax should be delegated in that way. It should be done in a Finance Bill. The Government should take away this part of the Bill, have a good look at it and possibly take it to the tax law rewrite committee. The Bill is a prime candidate for a comprehensive rewrite. It is obscure, confusing, incomplete, inefficient and, in part, ineffective. Do the Government intend having a comprehensive review of that tax, bearing in mind the extra pressure that is now put on it?

<P>
As an improvement to the Bill, we would introduce in clause 116 a sunset provision to ensure that the schedule will cease to have effect in two years' time. It would be a good incentive for the Government to use that time to bring forward proper legislation that covers the necessary area clearly, without the need for sticking plaster provisions to patch it up by regulation. Two years is plenty of time to do that if the Government start now.

<P>
The idea of a sunset clause is included in schedule 33, but it is a bogus sunset clause because the Government have merely to make further regulations just before the old ones expire. It is not a genuine sunset clause. It simply allows the Treasury to roll forward the same reguations indefinitely. It defeats the purpose, which should be to take the powers in primary legislation. Amendment No. 430 does exactly that.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Clause 116 and schedule 33 provide the powers mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman to allow stamp duty avoidance devices to be counted as they arise. At present, there is no mechanism to allow a change in stamp duty to take immediate effect, other than at the time of the Budget. That sets stamp duty apart from other more modern taxes, including stamp duty reserve tax, income tax and corporation tax. Without such a mechanism, there can be no rapid response to devices that would reduce the rate of stamp duty payable.

<P>
The ability to counter stamp duty avoidance devices as they arise is part of the Government's continuing commitment to tackle avoidance. I am not sure whether the right hon. Gentleman was complaining about our ability to tackle avoidance, and he wanted us to allow avoidance to continue, or whether he was simply complaining about the way of doing it. I shall address both points.

<P>
Clause 116 and schedule 33 ensure that, where an avoidance device involving land or shares threatens to undermine the stamp duty base, the Government will have the power to make regulations that will have immediate effect. Proper parliamentary scrutiny will be assured, as the regulations will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, which requires a vote of the House.

<P>
The amendment suggests that Opposition Members believe that the stamp duty avoidance industry will have to shut shop and go out of business on 4 April 2002. We do not share that optimism. The power provided by the clause is an essential weapon to enable the Government to respond promptly to devices designed to avoid stamp duty-as we can to such devices involving other taxes. The amendment would mean that stamp duty avoidance devices could not be countered with immediate effect after 4 April 2002. I can only presume that the Opposition want to allow new stamp duty avoidance devices to be successful in undermining the stamp duty base after that date. If I am wrong about that intention, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment, otherwise, I shall urge the Committee to reject it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Economic Secretary reads out her brief beautifully, but the trouble always is that it is written before the debate. I wish that she would occasionally respond to the points that we make, rather than those that she would like us to make. I asked her a direct and specific question about whether she intended to remit the aspect of law that we are discussing to the tax law rewrite committee. She did not answer that question because it was not anticipated and was not dealt with in her written brief. Will she return to it? The other general point that I made was that avoidance is partly a function of the size and rate of any tax. As the top rate has been quadrupled, it is not surprising that the avoidance industry has now taken an interest. The Economic Secretary ignored that point altogether.

<P>
My main point to the Economic Secretary was that although we are not on the side of avoidance which defies the clear will of Parliament, we believe that the rickety structure that underlies the tax needs a comprehensive review. I said that the two-year period in our so-called sunset clause was intended to give the Government the opportunity to conduct such a review. It would make unnecessary the use of emergency back-up regulatory powers to stop up the emerging deficiencies in the legislation. Will the Economic Secretary respond to those points, which are made in a constructive spirit?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am sympathetic to the fact that the right hon. Gentleman is trying to be constructive. I appreciate that, although I did not understand clearly whether he was speaking about a general comprehensive review or about a specific rewrite of tax law. We will, of course, consider the proposal in future. In due course, the development of electronic conveyancing might provide an opportunity for the sort of review that he has in mind. I do not believe, however, that there is any logic to inserting into the Bill a sunset clause for 4 April 2002. As I said, all that such a provision would do is allow avoidance to remain untackled until the next Finance Bill is introduced.

<P>
Question put and negatived.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 431, in page 524, line 45, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) to increase the stamp duty chargeable on the transfer of assets to a business on incorporation;

<P>
(d) to increase the stamp duty chargeable on business assets sold as part of a single transaction in which the business continues as a going concern.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would restrict the scope of the schedule so that it cannot be used to extend stamp duty in specific areas. It draws attention to the harmful way in which the tax hits particular transactions. As things stand, assets that are transferred to a business on incorporation attract stamp duty. That is a considerable burden on new businesses, which the Government say, in general terms, they want to encourage. The burden does not apply in the VAT system, in capital gains or in income tax, which provide for this eventuality.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It cannot be right in principle for somebody who wants to set up an incorporated company with existing trading and assets to bear such taxes on the transfer of the assets into the new legal structure. The stamp duty is especially onerous because it is charged on the gross value of the assets that are transferred and no allowance or deduction is made for the liabilities or for the assets' cost.

<P>
Many small companies that want to buy or take over another company do not do so because they may get into a lot of legal difficulties about whether the target company has hidden charges or liabilities. The process of taking over a company involves considerable legal obligations, which many small companies avoid by taking over the underlying assets rather than the corporate entity. The difference is obvious. Instead of the 0.5 per cent. that they might pay if they took over the shares, they can pay more than 4 per cent. in stamp duty on the assets concerned. Again, no deduction or allowance is made for any liabilities that are taken over. Large companies, which typically do take over target companies, are, therefore, at an advantage. The problem did not exist when stamp duty was much lower. All the problems have arisen in a more acute form because of the higher tax rates that the Government are levying.

<P>
The amendment would stop the regulations for which the schedule provides being used to increase the stamp duty that is chargeable in the circumstances that I have described.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to add two points to my right hon. Friend's exposition. I declare, as usual, a vague and ill-assorted interest, just in case. First, my right hon. Friend's point illustrates a large theme on which you, Mr. Cook, will not let me speak at length. It is, however, important to note that the amendment brings this large theme into focus. Essentially, my right hon. Friend is saying that quantity and quality cannot be divorced in terms of such a tax. It is the fact of the quantity that is causing the problem about quality. Ministers will find that this happens more and more. Of course, they may relish the prospect, as they love closing loopholes. I hope that the Paymaster General will forgive me for saying this, but I sometimes think that they take genuine delight in having discovered another loophole to close.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman said during a previous debate that he knew of some loopholes that he thought we should close. I would willingly accept any suggestions that might help me to further that project.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> You see, Mr. Cook, I told you so.

<P>
Of course, one partly admires the zeal of the Inland Revenue and of Ministers. All Governments try to close loopholes, as it is a worthy cause.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will remember that we are discussing a specific loophole.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I wondered when you were going to mention that, but this co-called loophole is not a loophole at all. It has been caused by ministerial action. It is part of a trend, which is to transfer tax on to business in order to raise very large amounts of money without too many people noticing. The problem is that people have responded as expected. That is relished by Ministers, who leap into the breach with yet another way, as they see it, of closing the loophole. What it really means is that they are introducing new rigidities into the economy in order to solve the problems that they have caused by raising particular taxes too far. That is what my right hon. Friend was saying, and he was absolutely right.

<P>
The second point is more specific. The mischief could be cured, at least in principle, if the liabilities were admitted as part of the calculation, where both assets and liabilities are injected or purchased. There must be some reason why that has not been done. I have been pondering what that reason could be and I must admit that I cannot for the life of me make out what it would be. It cannot be the intention of the Revenue or of Ministers to clobber those who are genuinely injecting the whole of a business into a company structure. It must be an oversight. If it is not an oversight, I hope that the Economic Secretary will tell us, now or on Report, that it will be taken care of. If I am right in that optimistic speculation, although we may not reach agreement now we may be able to reach it on Report.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Perhaps I may clarify the position on transfers between separate legal persons who face a different stamp duty regime. A property securitised as a company can be transferred at the 0.5 per cent. shares rate of stamp duty, or zero per cent. if it is a foreign-registered company, rather than at the normal property rates. That is the position on incorporations, which I give in response to the right hon. Member for Wells.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It would be helpful if the Economic Secretary recognised that that was exactly the point that my right hon. Friend was making. It was not an answer; it was a repetition of the question. It is exactly that differential that is causing the trouble.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We may indeed have failed to understand each other's viewpoint, because the amendment appears to assume that transfers of assets on incorporation, or a transaction when the business continues as a going concern, are immune from avoidance devices. That is the assumption behind the amendment. We do not share the Opposition's confidence or their contentment with that situation. There is no reason why such transactions should be excluded from the power to allow stamp duty avoidance devices to be counted as they arise-as with the earlier amendment to clause 116, so with this amendment. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do not know where to begin. The Minister is saying that those businesses are just avoiding tax. That is a profoundly depressing comment from a Treasury Minister. What sort of message does it send to the thousands of businesses that seek to incorporate? They may start as sole traders or partnerships, but at some point they may wish to incorporate to gain the advantages of limited liability. Is that not the story of the long march of the industrial revolution and the market economy? When Gladstone introduced limited liability, it was a huge advance on what had been before. Instead of people bankrupting themselves and their partners, they got the protection of the law. Creditors, shareholders and owners knew where they stood in relation to each other and banks knew where they were. All that the Minister can say now is that such people are simply trying to avoid tax.

<P>
If there is an abuse and there is a problem, then bring forward a new clause in a Finance Bill to deal with that abuse. If the procedure is used entirely as a vehicle for cheating the Inland Revenue out of the money that Parliament intended to raise by way of stamp duty, then deal with the situation. Do not, however, pretend that incorporation is simply an avoidance device. I tell the Treasury for free that that is not true. That is a breathtaking attitude to take and one that I can only find incredibly depressing.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Before the right hon. Gentleman claims that I am addressing the point that he has just made, I will say that I am not trying to do that. Instead, I will refer back to the point made by the hon. Member for West Dorset concerning incorporation.

<P>
Clause 116 is not to do with incorporations. It might be helpful if I wrote to the hon. Member for West Dorset on that specific point, although I believe that officials would like to study further his point in the Official Report. The point is not clear to us currently and it might be helpful if he wrote to me before I wrote to him.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The exchange might be productive. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and I and those who have corresponded with us might be in error. If so, that would be splendid. To avoid the necessity of writing, I will make clear what we suppose to be the case. It will be extremely helpful to know if it is not the case.

<P>
This is what we think might be the effect of the provision. An innocent trader might own a corner shop not in corporate form and also have an overdraft. That is a regular enough occurrence. If the overdraft is 100 and the value of the trader's corner shop is 100, and if the overdraft and the corner shop are an injection into a business and the trader receives back as consideration the shares of that business, of which he will be the 100 per cent. owner, he will end up paying stamp duty on the injection. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells will confirm that that is his understanding as it is mine.

<P>
We might easily be wrong about the effects of the measure. If we are, the problem will be solved. If we are not wrong, something is going awry, because there is no reason for that series of events, which I hope I have described clearly, to attract stamp duty, given that the net value of what has been transferred is zero. Even if the net value were great-if the overdraft were much smaller than the value of the corner shop-there would be no reason for the activity to attract stamp duty. All that would be happening would be incorporation of assets and liabilities already in the possession of the individual concerned.

<P>
If the Economic Secretary can assure us that the measure does not have the effect that I described, we will rest easy. If it does have that effect, I hope that she will assure us that she will do something about the situation, because that is clearly wrong. That is why my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and I were gasping for breath.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member for Wells themselves have possibly explained why I said that there was a complete misunderstanding between them and me about the way in which this works. I will be clear with regard to ordinary incorporations. There is no suggestion that incorporation as such is an avoidance device. However, incorporations can be done in such a way as to avoid duty. The right hon. Gentleman's example is not relevant to avoidance. It is a normal incorporation. It would be helpful to accept that there has been a misunderstanding of the Government's intention. I shall write to members of the Committee to clarify the matter. We will consider any issues that need to be addressed, but I do not believe that that will be necessary.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for her remarks. Perhaps some of her earlier comments were based on a misunderstanding of our argument. We are talking not about avoidance schemes, but about genuine innocent incorporation, which happens frequently. We are also aware that the amendment does not deal with the entire problem, but it has allowed us to raise it and perhaps to stop some circumstances getting worse. It illustrates that there is a genuine issue of whether, and under what circumstances, it is appropriate to levy the rates of stamp duty, which are now considerable, on assets that are passing into an incorporated vehicle. I am glad that the Economic Secretary will reconsider the matter. The issue, which is separate from the rest of the schedule, deserves attention. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Schedule 33 agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 117</center></H4>
<H4><center>Land transferred etc for other property</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 432, in page 91, line 4, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(13) Section 241 of the Finance Act 1994 shall cease to have effect.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is a probing amendment. Its intention is to draw from the Economic Secretary the purpose of the clause, which many people find obscure. When I suggested at the start of our debates that the Government should take a radical look at taxation, it was partly with such clauses in mind. It illustrates rather well how the higher rates of duty have stimulated schemes, some of which have a less than immediate commercial intention, that are counteracted by legislation. The tax is drifting away from the original idea of stamp duty. It was meant to be a tax on a bit of paper that was evidencing a transaction and giving good title to it. We are beginning to tax the transactions themselves.

<P>
The tax is in danger of undergoing a transformation by stealth. I was encouraged by the Economic Secretary's remarks in an earlier debate that it could be a candidate for a rewrite or review. I understand the difference between rewriting existing tax in plain English and fundamentally reviewing it, which raises substantial questions. I would urge her to do the latter in time for next year's Finance Bill. Perhaps, even before that, she might consult the industry about putting those concepts into clearer English, because both projects could proceed in parallel.

<P>
Many in the industry believe that the particular mischief with which the provision deals has already been covered by section 241 of the Finance Act 1994. If that is the case, the provision would seem to be redundant. Perhaps the Economic Secretary would comment on that.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I apologise for not being in Committee earlier. I had to take part in a debate in Westminster Hall on a report of the Select Committee on Education and Employment.

<P>
I am concerned that one of the unintended consequences of clause 117 is that derivatives developed on property might be caught by the clause. The development of a derivatives market in property has been talked about for 10 or 15 years. No one has yet had the ingenuity to do it, but it is possible that it might develop at some stage. If that did happen, it would be an immense benefit to the property market in terms of providing more liquidity and making it a more acceptable investment medium for institutions. Has the Economic Secretary considered whether the clause's effect would be that every time a derivatives contract was taken out on property, it might be caught by stamp duty? If so, it would be a remiss move, given that the success of derivatives depends on low transaction costs and the fact that no transfer of property takes place. Can the Economic Secretary reassure the Committee on that point?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I think that I am suffering from some puzzlement. Perhaps I can explain what I think that the clause does and give an example of the sort of scheme that it is designed to counteract.

<P>
The clause ensures that stamp duty will be charged at the relevant property rate when land or buildings are transferred in exchange for another property. As the hon. Member for Guildford knows, the stamp duty charge of between 1 per cent. and 4 per cent. normally arises when there is a conveyance on sale of land or buildings, but schemes have been set up that enable the normal rates of stamp duty to be avoided. The schemes operate where land or buildings are transferred in exchange for other forms of property. The transfers are arranged in ways that avoid a conveyance taking place on the sale of the land or buildings concerned, thereby enabling the normal rate of stamp duty to be reduced.

<P>
For example, as gilts are exempt from stamp duty, they are often used as other property in such a scheme, so a sale of land for gilts is instead structured as a sale of gilts for the transfer of land. As there is no conveyance or transfer on the sale of the land because there is no sale as such, and the transfer of the gilts is exempt because gilts are exempt assets, no stamp duty is due on a transaction that is so constructed.

<P>
With effect from the Budget day resolution, clause 117 counteracts those schemes by treating transfers as conveyances on sale, regardless of the way in which the transaction is structured. The amendment seems to have been tabled under the mistaken impression that section 241 of the Finance Act 1994 overlaps with clause 117, but it does not. Although section 241 considers the stamp duty implications of transferring land in exchange for other property, it also refers to cases in which an exempt asset is sold in consideration for the transfer of land. Therefore, the result of accepting the amendment would be to re-open the loophole that clause 117 is designed to close. The clause removes the advantages that were previously being gained by those who were seeking to avoid stamp duty.
 
<P>
I shall think about the question of the unintended consequences for derivatives, but it will be addressed if and when it arises. However, I do not think that it is relevant at the moment.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I apologise to the Economic Secretary-It might have been preferable if I had tabled an amendment to exclude derivatives. I should point out, however, that the clause could be interpreted as referring to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an instrument transferring  an  interest in land  for consideration.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A derivative might be an agreement to swap rents on two properties. Two pension funds might each have a property and decide that they want to swap rents. We need not debate why they might want to do so. The first might want to take the risk of one tenant, and the second might want to take the risk of the other. That would be a derivative.

<P>
Any rental agrement to share the risk of a group of tenants defaulting on a lease might be interpreted as falling under this clause, and agreements that enable property investors to share risk might unintentionally be caught by it. If that is correct, will the Economic Secretary consider providing a suitable exemption for that type of purely risk-sharing and risk-transferring device before the Bill leaves the Committee?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Economic Secretary responded to our points by giving an example of tax avoidance. That is all very well, but it does not deal with the fact that the clause ranges rather more widely than we believe is necessary to counteract such schemes. As it stands, some genuine commercial transactions could be hit. However, I do not wish to pursue the point any further; indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford has probably raised a better and more specific issue that is in need of reconsideration. Nevertheless, I ask the Economic Secretary to keep the matter under review, and urge her in quieter times to ask her officials to pull out the file and take another look. There are plenty of people in the profession who are willing to help. They are not all ravenous tax avoiders; many are anxious to get on to the statute book clauses that are intelligible, unambiguous, workable and raise the money that Parliament wants, but which do not give rise to uncertainties and hit genuinely commercial transactions. That is what we are all aiming for, and the purpose of the debate on this clause-and perhaps some of the remaining ones-is to draw out areas that need improvement.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's approach. At the moment, we do not believe that derivatives will be caught, but I undertake that officials will look further into the matter. If any difficulty comes to light, we shall deal with it on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 117 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 118</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of land to connected company</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 435, in page 91, line 7, leave out ``person'' and insert ``body corporate''.

<P>
I think that the Economic Secretary might be able to deal with this amendment without too much debate. Clause 118 seems to apply to, among other things, gifts made by individuals, and I wonder whether it has been drawn rather more widely than intended. As drafted, it could catch transfers of land by an individual company with which that individual is connected, where such a transaction is in fact a gift. In the same way, it might hit the transfer by a trustee to the principals of a trust. In such a case, it would certainly be unfair if stamp duty were incurred, and I would be grateful if the Economic Secretary would comment on that.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendment would severely weaken the effect of the clause, because it would no longer apply to the situation in which an individual transfers property into a connected company. If the amendment were accepted, an individual could avoid the property rate of stamp duty by putting a property inside a company and then selling the company. The clause ensures that the usual level of stamp duty is paid on transfers that are subject to the property rate, which is consistent with the Government's general commitment to fairness in this regard. The Committee should not, therefore, accept the amendment.

<P>
The Government have listened to representations on the point about the property rate on land, and will introduce a new clause to ensure that land settled on an independent corporate trustee will not be within the scope of clause 118.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells will no doubt reply in due course. I am sure that he would welcome, as I do, the assurance that something is going to be done about the trustee problem. We might be able to reach common ground on that issue.

<P>
With regard to the Economic Secretary's first response, I am bound to say that we have gone back to the issue of incorporation. I begin to doubt whether we made ourselves clear earlier. Perhaps the Economic Secretary does not wholly understand the character of the problem. Someone might own an asset and also a company. I shall go back to my example of the corner shop. A corner shop owner might own a corner shop and also a small company. If he decided not to create or buy a new off-the-shelf company in which to put his corner shop, but to vest the corner shop in his pre-existing company, that would be a form of incorporation. If, at the same time, he were to vest the other liabilities of the business, he would-as I understand it-be a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>person transferring or vesting the estate or interest-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to quote line 7 on page 91 of the Bill. He would then be caught for property stamp duty. The Economic Secretary tells us that that is not the Treasury's intention, and if that is the case, perhaps there has been an error. If not, she needs to explain why, in my example, the corner shop owner would not be caught.

<P>
The problem is that we are dealing with intricate questions of statutory construction, and we are, alas, legislators not barristers. We are not leading counsel who spend days in court, and who understand how these provisions will be construed. The natural, layman's construction of line 7 is as I have described it. It sounds like a transfer or a vesting, and it is the clear intention of the remainder of the clause that, in such circumstances, the transfer should be assessed as having the entire market value and that stamp duty should be imposed on that value, especially if the transfer is at a consideration of zero.

<P>
It is possible that the answer to the problem is that, in that particular case, the shares would be taken to be the consideration, and the consideration would be taken to have the same value as the asset. If that were the explanation, the problem would be solved. However, we need to be able to understand this, because the clause is misguided if it catches the incorporation cases that I have described, and the Economic Secretary has said that that is not what she wants to achieve. We need clarification on the effect of the clause on the corner shop in my example.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Before we go any further, it occurs to me that I should perhaps declare an interest at this point, but I am not sure whether it is relevant. I refer Labour Members to the Register of Members' Interests.

<P>
Clause 118 represents yet another example of the Government's attempt to ratchet up the level of stamp duty, thus making people who simply wish to make a transfer to reorganise their affairs try to find ways of avoiding stamp duty, whereas in the past they would happily have taken the hit of 1 per cent. As a result, increasing numbers of people who find only a small commercial advantage in reorganising their affairs will choose not to do so. That will lead to more inefficiencies in the management of their businesses and investments, and to weaknesses in the economy. Although the Government will garner a great deal more revenue from higher stamp duty in the short term, they will lose revenue in the long term. That is why their ratcheting up of stamp duty is such a short-sighted approach.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Again, I find the remarks of Opposition Members surprising. That is a genuine comment, not shorthand for something else. There has never been a stamp duty relief for incorporation. The clause prevents transfers of property to companies with which the transferor is connected from escaping the usual level of stamp duty.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Would the Economic Secretary remind the Committee of the last occasion on which stamp duty was charged at 4 per cent.?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I could give the hon. Gentleman a history of stamp duty. It started in around 1694 as a tax of Dutch origin to help us to fight the French, and proved so popular that it has been continued by every Government since, including, of course, the previous Government. We have maintained the 1 per cent. rate. Many people pay nothing or 1 per cent. As the hon. Gentleman knows, only a very small percentage pay the higher rate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I suppose that due form suggests that I should say to the Economic Secretary that I am grateful for her reply. However, I shall not do so, because she has not answered the question regarding the matter that we are trying to elucidate. Perhaps we are in error, and an answer has been given, but it would be helpful to try to get to the bottom of it.

<P>
To return to my example, the person in the corner shop who invests his assets in a pre-existing company, with which he is connected because he owns 100 per cent. of it, and who is trying only to give corporate form to the corner shop profession, will be caught under subsection (1)(a), in that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the person transferring or vesting the estate  is connected<P>
</UL></FONT>
with A.

<P>
The question is whether that person is then saved by subsection (4)(b), which explicitly states that the value on which the stamp duty, in this case, would be assessed is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>reduced by the value of so much of any actual consideration as does not consist of property.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that mean that the shares that he receives back, and gives to himself, from the corporation in which he is vesting, the asset are taken into consideration, and that value is attributed to those shares automatically, equal to the value of the asset that he has transferred? If so, all is well, because the purpose of subsection (4) is to reduce the market value by the amount of the consideration, so he would be assessed as having transferred something of no value for the purposes of stamp duty, once the netting off has occurred. The stamp duty chargeable would be zero, so the problem is academic, and we can forget about it. However, I would be puzzled to find that that is how we ought to construe subsection (4)(b). If that is the right construction, anyone doing anything that involves a transfer to a company in which they get back some shares will be exempt. The Bill will not catch very many people. I cannot imagine a situation in which people make gifts to companies without the slightest consideration-in the form of shares or anything else. Perhaps people do engage in such tax dodges-I do not know. However, if there are cases of people making gifts to companies with no consideration in the form of shares passing back, and if people really see that as a tax loophole, we will be happy to see it closed. I cannot see it happening, but that may just be ignorance.

<P>
I suspect, however, that my optimistic construction is wrong. In my corner shop case, someone gives his assets to a pre-existing company that he owns, and gets back shares. If such a case is caught by the clause, we have a problem, and the Economic Secretary has a particular problem, for the clause is doing something that she does not want it to. It would be helpful to get that clear.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am not sure that we will get that clear. I shall respond to the point about gifts, if that would be helpful to Opposition Members.

<P>
The clause would be ineffective if we did not charge gifts to connected companies in the same way as transfers. That is because future transfers of property gifted to a connected company will be taxed at the stamp duty shares rate-0.5 per cent.-if the property is sold in the corporate envelope. It is fair, therefore, that the stamp duty at the relevant property rate should be paid when the property is gifted into the lower stamp duty environment. As I said, when a property is transferred to the ownership of a company, future transfers of the property will be taxed again, at the shares rate of stamp duty. The property rate of stamp duty should be paid on the initial transfer to the company.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I understand the words that the Economic Secretary has just used, but I am not sure that she understands what they mean. I do not mean that she literally does not understand the English; I mean that she does not understand the practical consequences.

<P>
There are two situations, and I think that I now understand what abuses the Economic Secretary is trying to cure. In one situation, an individual may want to sell some property to another individual, but want to avoid paying the property stamp duty. He, therefore, performs a manoeuvre-within 24 hours-that consists of vesting the property in a company and receiving shares for it, and then selling the shares to the individual to whom he wishes to sell the property, while paying the 0.5 per cent. rate, instead of the 4 per cent. rate. Clearly, that is a tax avoidance manoeuvre, and we have no wish to foster it. We regret that some people consider such manoeuvres necessary because of the absurd differential that has opened up between the two rates of stamp duty, but we accept that that is a matter of Government policy. We are not debating that. We accept that it is the will of Parliament-given the large Labour majority-that there should be such a differential and that people should not be able to avoid the differential by engaging in the manoeuvre that I have just described. We are at one with the Government on that.

<P>
My corner shop example, however, relates to the perfectly legitimate case of a trader whose sole intention is to turn the shop that he has bought and built up into a company that he, his cousins or his wives-connected parties-own. He is not selling anything to anyone. There is not the slightest reason on earth why he should be charged stamp duty for that transfer. I do not believe that the Economic Secretary understands the implications of the words that she read out. I think that she is implicitly telling us that the clause has been wrongly drafted-that is, much too widely-and will catch my corner shop chap.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I do not know what the remedy is. It may lie in the change that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells has suggested, although now that I understand the matter better I suspect that that might too closely constrain the clause and end up not dealing with the avoidance. There may be another remedy. It may be a question of how long one holds the thing in the corporate entity or the price at which one is selling. I do not know how the provision should be constructed to catch the abuse but not to catch and rigidify the whole of our small-company economy. It is crucial that we do not catch that because, if we do, every corner shop owner in Britain is given a huge incentive not to put their assets into corporate form. That would cause serious damage to the economy, which is unnecessary, and unwanted by the Economic Secretary. Therefore, I draw her attention to the difference and beg her to consider whether the practical effect of the words that she read out is as I have suggested.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> We are in the same territory again. The hon. Gentleman has just described the situation that he described earlier, and I understand what he is saying. I have undertaken to consider the points that have been raised. I can do no more at this stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We have again established that this is a deeply unsatisfactory clause, whose scope is very unclear. I am picking up some helpful signs from the Minister that she is not entirely happy with this part of the Bill, which is designed for taxpayers not all of whom will have superb professional advice. If the Government are to continue collecting this sum of revenue by means of a tax of this kind, they owe it to everyone to clarify who, and which transactions, will be caught; to redefine the aim of a stamp duty; and, to the extent that there is unacceptable avoidance, to target that without damaging the wider economy and innocent transactions.

<P>
With that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 433, in page 91, leave out lines 25 to 31.

<P>
I have just two points on the amendment. The seven lines to which I wish to draw attention are a gem of saying in seven lines what could easily be achieved in three. Indeed, they are achieved in three in the excellent explanatory notes to the Bill, which state that the purpose of the subsection is to ensure that where a charge could arise under either this clause or an earlier one, this one will take precedence. In the Bill that suddenly becomes seven lines. I hope that the drafter was not paid by the line. That also partly explains why this is the longest Finance Bill ever-558 pages. We should consider all ways of making drafting more concise and more understandable. I would have suggested simply putting into the Bill what is stated in the explanatory notes. Perhaps the tax rewrite committee could do that for us another time.

<P>
Secondly, why does subsection (5) appear in clause 118 but not in clauses 119 and 120, when again a charge could arise under the earlier clauses? Presumably, the same guidance should be in the Bill as to which takes precedence. It is clear in the case of clause 118 but not in the others, and I wonder why that is the case.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendment proposes that clause 118 should not take precedence over clause 117, but if the amendment were accepted, a gift of land or buildings could be accomplished without incurring stamp duty. That would be in direct conflict with the purpose of the clause and would provide an obvious method of avoiding the stamp duty charge imposed by the clause.

<P>
The transactions in subsection (1)(b) that the right hon. Gentleman was commenting on target situations in which land or buildings are transferred to an unconnected company and the consideration received by the transferor is shared in a connected company.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Economic Secretary has answered everything except the questions that I asked her. If I keep talking for a minute or so longer, she may receive some refuelling. I should be interested to know, first, whether she is satisfied with the clumsiness of the drafting compared with the notes, which are more concise, although they contain a minor inaccuracy. Secondly, I asked her why the same provision was not necessary in clauses 119 and 120. If she did answer that, I apologise.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am happy to answer that. Clause 119 is about the grant of leases and clause 120 is about shares, so it is not necessary to repeat the subsection.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Economic Secretary has just asserted that, but it appears to outside commentators that a charge could arise under clause 117 and one of the later clauses, so the same guidance is required. However, one accepts her assurance, so the commentators must be wrong on that.

<P>
Perhaps the hon. Lady will just take the drafting point without comment. It reinforces our point that the Bill is getting dangerously near gobbledegook. If we are to make taxes understandable, we should put them into plainer English, which is not achieved in the seven lines to which I have drawn attention. The hon. Lady may not concede that point publicly, but may feel it privately. My comments may help her if she wishes to advance the case for remitting this area of law to the rewrite team.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall of course reflect on it.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`other than an interest in a collective investment scheme within the meaning of section 75 of the Financial Services Act 1986'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The point behind our amendment is that the clause imposes a charge on contributions in specie to collective investment schemes. Previously, the Stamp Office appears to have accepted that such transactions are commercial and bona fide, and they have therefore been excluded. If that is the case, will the Economic Secretary tell us whether that is still the understanding or whether those transactions are now to be caught by the anti-avoidance provisions?

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The comments made by my right hon. Friend also extend to the subject of derivatives that I raised with the Economic Secretary earlier. There are many options involving securities in which entirely bona fide transactions take place, but, on a strict reading of clause 120, options on securities might now become subject to stamp duty. I do not have sufficient expertise on the subject to be able to say whether that is the case, but I am sure that that was not the intention behind the drafting.

<P>
The answer might depend on the meaning of the phrase ``execution of the instrument'' in line 27. If that describes the option being exercised when, in any event, the purchase or sale of the securities would give rise to stamp duty, that would be reasonable. There should be no avoidance of stamp duty if an option on securities leads to their being purchased. However, if that phrase refers to the option being bought-that is, when a person is deemed to be buying or selling the underlying property-and stamp duty were to arise, the provision would have a sad effect on the traded options market and on the market for over-the-counter options and other derivatives.

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The clause ensures that a stamp duty charge will arise when marketable securities are transferred in exchange for securities that are not chargeable to stamp duty reserve tax. Stamp duty is normally charged at a rate of 0.5 per cent. when there is a conveyance or transfer on the sale of marketable securities.

<P>
However, schemes have been set up that enable the stamp duty charge to be avoided. They operate when securities within the charge to stamp duty are transferred for exempt securities. The transfers are arranged in such a way that no transfer on sale of the chargeable security occurs, thereby enabling the transfer to be effected stamp duty free. From the day of the Budget resolution, clause 120 counteracts those schemes by treating such transfers as transfers on sale, regardless of the way in which the transaction is structured. The clause is linked to similar schemes involving land and buildings, which we have just discussed in clause 117.

<P>
The amendment would enable transfers of United Kingdom shares into collective investment schemes to avoid both stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax. That would perpetuate avoidance because, if the transaction were structured in the normal way, duty would be paid on the transfer of UK shares. Clause 120 removes the advantages that were previously being gained by those seeking to avoid stamp duty. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
I can also confirm that there is no effect on the traded options market, if that is the issue on which the hon. Member for Guildford seeks assurance.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for those words. Unfortunately, I am still very concerned as to what the true position is, even in respect of options on a traded market. Of course, they will be bought and sold for cash. However, it is common in such markets for part of the consideration to include security. It might be included for margin purposes, and it might be deemed, for the purposes of the clause, to be part of the consideration. Therefore, if someone participating in that market puts up gilts or other shares as part of the security-a very common margin arrangement-they might inadvertently be caught by the clause.

<P>
Equally, we should be concerned with what are termed over-the-counter transactions. These are not some sort of fly-by-night arrangement. They are proper contracts, entered into, typically, by banks and negotiated by banks on behalf of bona fide customers. While I welcome the Economic Secretary's assurances as far as they go, I regret that they do not really get to the heart of the matter. Indeed, I apologise for not signalling my concerns on this matter earlier by tabling an amendment. I understand the hon. Lady's difficulties, but I should appreciate any help that she can give on this important point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am bound to say that, unless I have misunderstood how widely the provision is drafted, my hon. Friend is understating the scale of the problem. If I have interpreted the clause correctly, for once, I really do have an interest to declare. Like many others-including certain Ministers who desperately, and rightly, encouraged such investments in earlier clauses-I hold a stock option plan, which I have declared in the Register of Members' Interests. If I am right, they and I will be caught by stamp duty in a way that is quite wrong, and the Economic Secretary did not intend.

<P>
Clause 120(1)(a) makes it clear that we are dealing not with securities alone, but with marketable securities. In broad terms, it seems that any underlying share in any company in the UK is covered by the phrase ``marketable security'', although I am happy to be corrected if the Economic Secretary's interpretation is different.

<P>
Subsection (1)(a) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an instrument transferring marketable securities,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is an instrument transferring any underlying share in any company in the UK. Subsection (1)(b) makes it clear that we are talking about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the transfer of the marketable securities for consideration.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I see it, an employee of a company who buys into-or is granted in a manner classed as ``for consideration''-an employee stock option scheme is taking hold of an instrument that will, in due course, transfer a marketable security.

<P>
Perhaps, as I say, I am wrong; if so, I am more than willing to be corrected by the Economic Secretary. However, if an employee stock option is indeed an instrument that will, in due course, transfer marketable securities, and if that transfer will be caught by the clause, one assumes that, on being granted an employee stock option, the employee will have the nasty shock of receiving stamp duty invoices. If my understanding of how the clause works is completely wrong, it would be helpful to know why. If I am right, the Economic Secretary will surely agree that that is not the intended effect.

<P>
When we considered previous clauses, it certainly was not mentioned that Ministers intended to add a hitherto unknown tax on employee stock options, and it would be helpful if the Economic Secretary could clear up the matter now. If it transpires that I am wrong, that is fine, and we shall leave the subject. If there is indeed a problem, the Economic Secretary can deal with it on Report, or we can table a suitable amendment on Report.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have already said that I will write to the hon. Gentleman on some of these points. In the light of the comments made by the hon. Member for Guildford, that would probably be the most helpful thing to do.

<P>
On the question of the stock option package, the transfer of securities to an employee on exercise of the option is charged on the basis of the exercise price, and is not affected by the clause.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) This section has effect in relation to instruments of both UK and non-UK incorporated companies.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Will the Economic Secretary explain why an opportunity is not taken here to make it clear that the provision is not limited to UK-incorporated companies? I believe that, following some court cases, it applies to non-UK-incorporated companies, and it would be helpful if that were made clear in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The purpose of the amendment appears to be to amend sections 75 and 76 of the Finance Act 1986, concerning the release of certain company acquisitions, so that they apply whether or not the acquiring company is incorporated in the UK. However, the amendment would not have that result, because it would not amend those sections. Is that what the right hon. Gentleman wishes it to do?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I apologise for any deficiencies in drafting of amendment; I have never been any good at that. As I said, its purpose is to make it clear that the clause has effect in relation to non-UK-incorporated, as well as UK-incorporated, companies. I hope that the intention is clear, even if the drafting is bad.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We require the acquiring company to be UK-resident to ensure that the reliefs apply only where the result is to defer stamp duty. The reliefs are not due where the shares are transferred to a non-UK acquirer, because at that point the shares will have to move outside the UK stamp duty net, so future disposals of the shares would not be subject to UK stamp duty. The restriction that the acquirer be UK-resident simply protects the UK's existing taxing rights, and reflects the fact that residents and non-residents are in different positions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That is a helpful elaboration. It is good enough for me, anyway. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 437, in page 98, line 16, after ``registered design'', insert ``domain name''.

<P>
I wish that I had an interest to declare, because a number of my friends have made fortunes in this area.

<P>
The amendment is a good one. Although the clause exempts specific sorts of intellectual property, it does not appear to exempt domain names, because they may not be covered by the definition of intellectual property. They would be covered-and, therefore, exempt-if the domain name were protected by a trademark. A recent example in the press is www.lastminute.com, which would be exempt because it is a trademark.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> May I help the right hon. Gentleman? The amendment is unnecessary because his point is covered already. The Stamp Office will treat the transfer of domain names as falling within the range of exempted property. I believe that that is what he wants.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That is helpful and answers my point, but I want to contrast www.lastminute.com with another domain name such as www.cars.com, which is not a trademark because words such as cars cannot be registered as trademarks, for obvious reasons. It cannot form part of a trademark, so it would not be exempt as intellectual property. If the Economic Secretary will confirm that what she has just said covers such cases, we shall all be satisfied.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> In her generosity in interpreting the provisions of clause 127(2), will the Economic Secretary also clarify the situation of good will?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I probably can in a moment. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's point about domain names, including the one to which he referred, is yes. Domain names are likely to be protected as trademarks or by copyright and, although he referred to trademarks, he did not refer to copyright.

<P>
The good will relating to intellectual property is considered to be part of the property and is, therefore exempt.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> That is helpful in as far as it goes, but there will be cases in which businesses have developed good will attached to their names, but do not have any specific patent, trademark, registered design, copyright or design right. In such cases, if businesses then register their name in some shape or form, will they be able to sell that registered name with the good will attached and not attract stamp duty? While that form of intellectual property is excluded, the good reputation of a company, which is another form of intellectual property, will, for some curious reason, still attract stamp duty.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Good will in general does not attract relief, but good will in relation to intellectual property is considered to be part of the property and is, therefore, exempt. There is a difference in what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> This will concern many people because it will be difficult to determine on the sale of a company how much good will related to the business, which the Government are apparently not prepared to exempt, and how much related to the patents, trademarks and copyright. It will create a minefield of disputes between lawyers and accountants, unless the Government are prepared to clarify the matter.
