							<b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): Good morning,
Mr. Taylor. I welcome you back to the Chair.</div>
					<a name="07020138000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We have come
to part 2 of the Bill, which deals with the complex issue of
contracting out. This clause deals with the conversion of guaranteed
minimum pensions. It might be helpful if I set the scene as to how we
have arrived at the need for these provisions. In 1978 it was
established that where employees contracted out of the state
earnings-related pension scheme, employers had to provide a
defined-benefit scheme, and a guaranteed minimum pension that at least
equalled the SERPS that they would have earned had they not been
contracted out. Hence the contracted-out rebate, in effect a reduction
in national insurance contributions paid by contracted-out employers
and employees, was introduced. The rebate is set regularly by the
Government on the advice of the Government Actuary&#146;s Department,
and is supposed to reflect the cost of providing the benefits that have
been forgone.</div>
					<a name="07020138000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it does not always do
so; the Government have not accepted in full the most recent advice
from The Government Actuary&#146;s Department. I assume, therefore,
that the Minister accepts that the rebate no longer reflects the actual
cost of providing the forgone benefits, as was originally
envisaged.</div>
					<a name="07020138000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Following the
Pensions Act 1995, contracted-out salary-related schemes do not have to
provide guaranteed minimum pensions in respect of benefits accrued
after 1997, but they do have to provide them for benefits accrued
between 1978 and 1997. The new requirement is to provide benefits
broadly equivalent to or better than something called the reference
scheme test. The main features of that, for a defined-benefit scheme,
are that it should provide for pensions to be paid at normal pension
age of 65 and to continue for life; it should have an accrual rate of
1/80 up to a maximum of 40 years; it should define qualifying earnings
as 90 per cent. of the employee&#146;s earnings between the lower
earnings limit and the upper earnings limit; and it should provide for
a widow&#146;s or widower&#146;s pension at the rate of one half if

<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 231</div>the member dies after the age of 65 or one half of the pension rights
already accrued if the member dies before the age of
65.</div>
					<a name="07020138000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Pickering
report in 2002 recommended simplification of contracting out, and the
pensions Green Paper of December that year proposed, among other
things, that schemes should be permitted to convert the GMP use to the
simpler reference scheme test benefits of equivalent value.</div>
					<a name="07020138000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Pensions Act 2004 rather
ducked the issue of converting GMPs into scheme benefits. However, the
Government belatedly introduced a new clause allowing pension schemes
to modify members&#146; accrued rights, provided that that is done on
the basis of actuarial
equivalence.</div>
					<a name="07020138000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 14
would allow contracting-out defined-benefit schemes to convert GMPs
into scheme benefits, but only if they meet certain conditions. Those
conditions include the actuarial equivalence of the value of
members&#146; conversion benefits with those possessed
pre-conversion. We are promised regulations setting out how actuarial
equivalence is to be determined; can the Minister tell us whether draft
regulations are yet available? There should be no reduction of pensions
in payment; conversion benefits should not include money purchase
benefits; survivor&#146;s benefit is to be provided; the agreement of
the scheme&#146;s sponsor is to be obtained; and the members and
survivors and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs are to be
informed. Can the Minister confirm that even where all members in a
scheme do not convert to GMPs, trustees will be allowed to do so for
individuals, provided that those individuals consent?</div>
					<a name="07020138000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will be for the pensions
regulator to enforce the law in that area, but when does the Minister
expect the provision to take effect? It is suggested in the Library
brief that it will not happen before 2009 because, as we have found out
on a number of occasions in the Committee, the Department&#146;s
computers cannot be programmed to do the job before then&#151;another
case of the computer saying
no.</div>
					<a name="07020138000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
would be valuable for the Committee to consider the views of outside
bodies on the clause. The Engineering Employers&#146; Federation,
which has followed the Bill carefully, describes it as &#147;a useful
provision&#148;
and</div>
					<a name="07020138000154"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;one for which the
EEF has been arguing for a number of
years.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020138000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to
say:</div>
					<a name="07020138000155"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
the EEF considers that there needs to be greater clarity about the
requirement to notify members about a proposed conversion, as this may
prove to be impossible for some deferred members whose current address
may be unknown, and about what is meant by the requirement to
&#145;consult&#146; the earner in
advance.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020138000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
practical problem, and we are grateful to outside bodies such as the
EEF for identifying it. Will the Minister address
it?</div>
					<a name="07020138000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">A briefing
provided by the Association of Consulting Actuaries makes the point
that the provisions of the clause are supposed to ease administration
costs. It states
that</div>
					<a name="07020138000156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the cost of running
good existing occupational pension schemes must be significantly
reduced if the wave of scheme
closures&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020138000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">in recent years
is to be checked. Rather worryingly, the ACA goes on to suggest that
the clause will not deliver savings, because of EU legislation. It
states that the clause</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 232</div>
					<a name="07020138000157"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;appears to allow conversion into
normal scheme benefits to take place only if benefits are levelled up
to avoid sex
discrimination.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020138000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister comment on what appears to be another serious issue drawn to
our
attention?</div>
					<a name="07020138000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
ACA goes on to suggest a number of methods to reduce the costs of the
scheme. One is to restore the contracted-out rebate to the level
recommended by the Government Actuary to meet the costs of
replacing the state benefits forgone. As it points
out,</div>
					<a name="07020138000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the 2007/12 rebates
set by Government are an effective tax on providing a defined benefit
scheme.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020138000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister
confirm that he is reconsidering
that?</div>
					<a name="07020138000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subject to the
various points that I have raised, and of course to the
Minister&#146;s answers to them, we do not oppose the provisions in
the
clause.</div>

Chair, Mr.
Taylor.</div>
					<a name="07020138000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has helpfully introduced the
clause and explained the purposes behind it. It is one of the
Bill&#146;s private pension simplification measures and is designed
to remove some of the complexity that, as the hon. Gentleman said, has
built up over time. It is a long clause, but we believe that it will
achieve a straightforward and desirable end&#151;reducing
the administrative burdens on schemes and making it easier for their
members to understand what they are entitled to. It is a reform that
implements a recommendation of the Pickering
review.</div>
					<a name="07020138000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
will help the Committee if I provide a brief history and make some
points in addition to those already contributed. The schemes involved
are those that were contracted out of the state earnings-related
pension scheme for all or part of the period 1978 to 1997. In order to
contract out, people running those schemes had to ensure that the
benefits offered were at least as good as the statutory
minimum&#151;the guaranteed minimum pension. However, a two-tier
system developed over time and the GMP and the scheme excess now have
different rules applying to different parts. That is too complex. GMP
conversion will allow schemes to move to one set of rules. The clause
will allow, but not require, the schemes to convert the GMPs of all or
some of their members as long as actuarial equivalence is
maintained.</div>

time, as the two-tier system has evolved, there has been considerable
representation from across the industry urging us to achieve the
simplification. As she knows and as I said, when Pickering looked at
the issue during his review, he recommended such changes. What has been
composed here is very broadly welcomed by the industry, subject to one
or two caveats, which may have been raised earlier but to which I will
come shortly.</div>

						I
will explain the most significant provisions, beginning with those
designed to protect the members&#146; interests during the conversion
exercise. First, as I said, the scheme must maintain actuarial
equivalence, which means, put simply, that at the date of conversion
the value of the scheme benefits being offered must be the same as, or
better than, the value of the GMP being given up. Then, if the scheme
converts a pension already in payment, the amount of that pension
immediately after the conversion must be no lower than the pension
currently in payment. The clause provides trustees with power to amend
their scheme rules, if necessary, to allow for the GMP
conversion.</div>
					<a name="07020138000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
power has two restrictions. First, the scheme must continue to have a
defined-benefit structure&#151;it cannot change the basis of the
scheme to defined contribution. Secondly, at present, where the member
dies, his or her surviving spouse or civil partner can inherit a part
of the deceased member&#146;s GMP; the position of a survivor after
conversion must be broadly the same as it would be if the scheme had
not converted the
GMP.</div>

						<a name="07020138000207"></a>

					<a name="07020138000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
provisions protect the member. In addition, the clause requires the

Plaskitt:
						</b> Some of the issues that my hon. Friend is
raising are covered by the clause. I think that the rules surrounding
actuarial equivalence address some of her points, but others are
covered by subsequent clauses, which we have yet to reach. I hope that
her questions will be answered
then.</div>
					<a name="07020138000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Finally&#151;I
am just working my way through the main provisions of the
clause&#151;at present, when a person retires, the state
earnings-related pension scheme entitlement based on earnings before
April 1997 is reduced by the amount of their total GMP entitlement.
Known as the contracted-out deduction, the reduction is made to reflect
the fact that the person has paid a reduced level of national insurance
contributions and thus prevents double provision. The clause allows a
person who has had their GMP converted to be treated as if they still
had the GMP, for the purposes of reducing the state pension. It allows
for a notional contracted-out deduction to be made from the
person&#146;s SERPS entitlement to reflect the lower rate of national
insurance contributions paid by the member.</div>
					<a name="07020138000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Member for South-West Bedfordshire asked about an issue that was raised
by the EEF, namely the meaning of &#147;consult&#148;. Schemes must
explain the GMP 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 234</div>conversion proposals to affected members, so that they understand what
it will mean for them and can raise queries or points of concern before
the conversion proceeds. Scheme trustees have a duty under trust law to
act in the best interests of all members, so we would expect them to
consider any points raised by a consultation exercise in deciding
whether GMP conversions should proceed as proposed, proceed with
revisions, or not proceed at all. There are no plans to introduce
detailed legislation prescribing how each scheme should carry out
consultation, as that would be unduly
restrictive.</div>
					<a name="07020138000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked&#151;this has also been raised by the
EEF&#151;what happens if the scheme has lost contact with some
members and therefore cannot consult them. Under proposed new section
24E(3), the draft legislation requires the scheme trustees to
&#147;take all reasonable steps&#148;. Sometimes, deferred members
fail to update the address details held by a former pension scheme when
they move. Schemes therefore cannot be confident that their address
databases for deferred members are always entirely accurate. We accept
that it would be impractical and uneconomic for schemes to have to set
about tracing all members who may have moved house after leaving the
scheme. If correspondence is returned from the last known mailing
address, the details of the individual case will determine what
constitutes further &#147;reasonable
steps&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020138000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about costs. Our view is that when the provisions
are implemented, they are liable to ensure annual administrative cost
reductions for schemes, because there will no longer be two sets of
rights to administer. We estimate that scheme savings could be around
&#163;15 million a
year.</div>

							<a name="07020138000213"></a>Andrew

						</b> The Minister might be coming on to this in the
course of his remarks. The ACA made a point about the impact of EU sex
discrimination legislation. I should be grateful if he would respond to
that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020138000214"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> That will apply across the board; it is not
specifically related to this measure. Schemes will incur some up-front
costs on a one-off basis in making GMP conversions, but in the longer
run they will make annual savings. We are taking on board the point

Purnell:
						</b> It is a pleasure to welcome you to our morning
sitting, Mr. Taylor.</div>
					<a name="07020138000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendments will, I hope, help to allay the concerns about the treatment
of contracted-out rights that have already been built up when
contracting out is abolished for defined contribution schemes.
Government amendments Nos. 51 to 55 insert a power to abolish or vary
the rules on protected rights. This is the only area in which the
Government are introducing a substantive amendment after Second
Reading. Government amendment No. 59 is a separate, minor technical
amendment, to correct a reference in schedule 4 to a section title in
the Pension Schemes Act
1993.</div>
					<a name="07020138000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I discuss
the detail of the amendments, it may be helpful to explain a little
about contracting out and protected rights. The amendments and clause
15 only relate to defined-contribution schemes, which are also known as
money purchase schemes. We have already examined defined-benefit
schemes.</div>
					<a name="07020138000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As we have
already seen, contracting out allows people to opt out of the state
second pension by saving in a private pension scheme instead. People
who choose to do so on a defined-contribution basis receive a rebate of
their national insurance contributions. That rebate, together with any
associated tax relief, is invested in the person&#146;s pension
scheme. That amount and any investment return are known as protected
rights.</div>
					<a name="07020138000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">By contracting
out, the person has forgone some or all of their rights in the state
second pension scheme, so certain rules have traditionally applied to
protected rights. Those rules are, first, that protected rights are
invested only in certain specified products; secondly, that they are
only transferred to schemes that are contracted out; thirdly, that
annuities purchased with the protected rights must be calculated on a
unisex basis, and fourthly, that the protected rights have to provide
for a survivor benefit if a scheme member is married or a civil partner
at the time that an annuity is purchased.</div>
					<a name="07020138000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise that those rules
can complicate scheme administration and that they do not provide the
flexibility for scheme members when they are choosing their annuity. By
dictating that there must be a unisex annuity, we are restricting
people&#146;s ability to choose and they may have to make a choice
that is not appropriate for them; that situation can apply for women as
well as for men. The complexity in scheme administration is caused by
the fact that the rules on protected rights do not apply to any other
pension 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 236</div>rights that are held in that person&#146;s pension pot, so that
protected rights must be tracked separately in order for providers to
comply with the legislation. We recognise, therefore, that the removal
of those rules would simplify the schemes for members.</div>
					<a name="07020138000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We consulted on this issue in
significant detail, and we had a unanimous response from the industry,
which strongly supported the removal of those rules. However, we did
not receive any responses from people who represented women&#146;s
interests in particular, and we therefore wanted to obtain further
information from them before tabling the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07020138000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
that further round of discussions, we thought that the appropriate way
of introducing this measure was in the context of the joint Department
for Work and Pensions/Treasury review of the open market option for
annuities. That joint review was announced in the pre-Budget report
last November and one of its central aims is to ensure that people make
informed choices about their annuity type and fully understand the
consequences of their choice. The review will include specific
consideration of the impact of removing the requirement to take out a
dual-life annuity with protected rights, as well as more general
consideration of the question of joint life annuities, including how
partners can make appropriate choices for themselves both as
individuals and as a couple; a number of suggestions have already been
made as to how that can be achieved.</div>
					<a name="07020138000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">That review of the open market
option for annuities is expected to report towards the end of the year.
Therefore, amendments Nos. 51 to 55 would provide a power to abolish or
vary, by regulations, the rules on protected rights following the
outcome of the review. We intend to introduce regulations, once we have
fully explored the potential impact of removing the rule about survivor
benefits in the light of the conclusions reached by the review. Of
course, we will come back to Parliament with those regulations, as any
regulations made under this power will be subject to affirmative
resolution and therefore they must be debated by Members of both
Houses.</div>
					<a name="07020138000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Committee agrees with our considered approach. Our amendments will
allow action on the rules applying to protected rights to be taken at
the right time and are based on the evidence. The amendments agree in
principle with amendments Nos. 6 and 7, tabled by the hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire. So his party agrees with us about the need to
make the change; we are just proposing that it should be done in the
context of the wider changes on annuities, which might come forward as
part of that. I look forward to the debate and I shall be interested to
see whether he wants to press his
amendments.</div>

							<a name="07020138000218"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I think that I am reasonably reassured by what the
Minister had to say. We were lobbied by the Association of British
Insurers over contracted-out rights&#151;also known as protected
rights. The ABI feels strongly that those should be simplified further
because, as it put it,</div>
					<a name="07020138000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the current rules add unnecessary
complexity and cost for
consumers&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020138000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, the part of a person&#146;s pension fund relating to
protected rights has to be used in a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 237</div>
						particular way&#151;often differently from the
rest of the fund. For example, protected rights money must be used to
buy an annuity based on unisex rates. When the policyholder is married
or in a civil partnership, a joint life annuity must be
bought.</div>
					<a name="07020138000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ABI says
that</div>
					<a name="07020138000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;individuals should
be able to use the whole of their pension pot&#151;non protected
rights and protected rights alike&#151;in the same
way&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020138000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">It says that that
will supply simplicity as well as reduce costs for consumers and
providers. It would no longer be necessary to track protected and
non-protected rights benefits separately. Crucially, it would also
allow consumers to decide what sort of annuity is most appropriate for
their own personal circumstances. The Minister said that he has been
consulting on that matter, which is why he has introduced the
amendments before us, rather than incorporating the provisions in the
Bill as presented on Second
Reading</div>
					<a name="07020138000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, the Secretary of State said that he
intended</div>
					<a name="07020138000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to take powers
to enable us to remove the complex rules governing rights accrued in
contracted-out defined contribution schemes, following the outcome of
the review of the open market option for annuities that we expect to be
completed by the end of the year.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 16 January 2007; Vol. 455, c. 668.]</div>
					<a name="07020138000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the Minister
for providing the Committee with further information on that
review.</div>
					<a name="07020138000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as I
can determine, the Government amendments would give them powers by
regulation to simplify the current position in the way that the ABI is
urging. Prior to seeing the Government&#146;s amendments, of course,
we tabled amendments Nos. 6 and 7 to schedules 4 and 7 respectively.
They would remove the proposed amended requirements relating to
protected rights and add to the list of repeals section 28 of the
Pension Schemes Act 1993, which provides for the way in which protected
rights must be used.</div>
					<a name="07020138000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a sense, our amendments
merely force the pace of the Government&#146;s apparent intentions.
The Minister has confirmed those intentions, so I shall not press
amendments Nos. 6 and
7.</div>

								Ms
Keeble:
						</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to ask some
questions because this clause is extremely technical. I suspect that it
will fly below many people&#146;s radar but have a massive impact on
widows, in particular, but also on civil partners, who are dependent on
the main breadwinner for their pension rights. That is partly why I
have raised survivors&#146; rights
previously.</div>
					<a name="07020138000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
think back to the problems of widow&#146;s SERPS when women found out
much later on that what they had assumed to be a secure income for
their retirement was not, because the provisions that protected its
value had been changed. There were issues about the information and the
amount of time that they had. I am mindful that the Government were
taken to the ombudsman by a number of MPs, including me, because our
constituents had not received the information. I am pleased that the
new regulations will be by affirmative resolution, as that will make us
focus our attention on them. I hope that there will be very good
consultation with the women&#146;s groups as well as with the
pensions industry, because although the pensions industry might
understand the figures, the women&#146;s organisations understand the
human consequences of the calculations.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 238</div>
					<a name="07020138000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I hope that
careful provision will be made, or that requirements will be placed on
providers, to ensure that the right information is given to people when
they make their pension arrangements. The information should focus on
what will happen to their survivors&#151;spouses or civil
partners&#151;so that they can make informed choices and do not find,
part-way down the line when they are still working or are into their
retirement, that they will not receive what they thought they would or,
when the main breadwinner dies, that the survivor&#146;s income is
catastrophically changed.</div>
					<a name="07020138000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had some questions about
clause 14, but I will take them up separately with the Minister. When
we were dealing only with widow&#146;s SERPS it was a very different
society; now we have to ensure that the provisions are consistent for
widows, widowers and civil partners. I trust that those matters will
have been properly attended to so that the regulations are fit for
purpose when they are introduced.</div>

								James
Purnell:
						</b> I am happy to respond to what my hon. Friend
rightly said is a debate on important decisions. I reassure her that
the aim of the open market review and the changes proposed is to help
women and men to make better choices for themselves as individuals and
as a couple, not to remove from consideration the importance of
thinking about financial support for their partner. There is a bigger
prize than protected rights to be achieved through the open market
review, which is why the Equal Opportunities Commission is content with
that approach.</div>
					<a name="07020138000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
women will not want to purchase a unisex annuity because the provision
that they and their partner have means that the best financial
arrangement will be for them to purchase an annuity for themselves, as
individuals. The right approach is to consider what can be done to
ensure that couples make effective choices. A number of suggestions
have already been made; the EOC is interested in whether there can be a
signed waiver, so that someone who is purchasing a single-life annuity
has to show that they have consulted their partner. It would be
possible to do that when the relationship is registered, although it
may not be so easy if people are cohabiting, but the law may be able to
cope with that situation. Other suggestions have been made, for
example, people being automatically assumed to be purchasing a joint
annuity unless they make an active choice not to do
so.</div>

					<a name="07020138000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
and the women&#146;s groups mentioned by my hon. Friend, which have
provided us with an excellent briefing on the subject, understand the
human implications and the figures. The women&#146;s groups are happy
that the big prize should be informed choice for people to make
decisions for themselves as individuals and as a couple. The provisions
that the amendment would remove are very inflexible as they would
require people to do something that may not be appropriate in their
financial circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07020138000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, it is worth
saying that the ABI will also be involved in the open market review. We
have also written to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which is
content with our approach on taking this power and having the
affirmative resolution later. This 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 239</div>is the right way to take the decision&#151;in a staged way. The bigger
issue is the overall one of when people choose their annuities, and I
hope that that reassures both my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton
North&#151;and the Opposition Front Benchers, whom I therefore urge
to withdraw their amendments.</div>

								Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I welcome you to the Chair again this morning,
Mr. Taylor. Clause 15, as most members of the Committee
might acknowledge, is important not only in its own right but for the
potential development of future pension policy, as it involves a
significant change: the abolition of contracting-out for
defined-contribution pension schemes. Amendment no. 37 asks the
Secretary of State to lay a report before Parliament by the end of this
year, setting out how the additional revenues from increasing national
insurance contributions&#151;collected through the abolition of
contracting-out and other DC schemes&#151;will be used to improve
pension provision.</div>
					<a name="07020138000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, new clause 3, in the name of the hon. Members for
Eastbourne and for South-West Bedfordshire, seeks to raise similar
issues and is designed to provoke a debate about how the Government
intend both to use the savings that have been made through this change
and to underpin private saving in the future. There has been quite
extensive debate about this among private providers in the pension
arena, and significant debates both in the context of the Pensions
Commission&#146;s own report and in the Select Committee on Work and
Pensions. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare was an active
participant there and might want to make some comments on this
issue.</div>
					<a name="07020138000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
touching on the substantive debate, it will be useful to get
clarification on a couple of issues of detail. We have already touched
on one in Committee&#151;the costs involved in this particular
change. When the Work and Pensions Committee was debating that issue a
few months back, it did so on the basis of rather higher figures than
the Government now seem to have for the value and yield from getting
rid of the DC rebates. The figures that the Department for Work and
Pensions was using for the cost of these rebates in 2003-04 seemed
significantly higher than the figures being used now. The figures that
were being used for 2003-04 had it that the rebate was costing
&#163;0.5 billion a year for the occupational DC schemes and
&#163;3.1 billion for personal pensions, giving a total of
&#163;3.6 billion. Some members of the Work and Pensions Committee
were using figures of &#163;4 or &#163;5 billion in the context of
the hearing, which I assume is from a previous year.</div>
					<a name="07020138000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Now, the
figures that the Government have supplied as part of the Bill&#146;s
regulatory impact assessment use far lower numbers. The cost of the DC
rebate is given as &#163;1.9 billion for the years 2008 through to
2011 in cash terms, while declining gently in real terms from a similar
starting point. It appears, then, that the amount of money that we are
talking about has roughly halved over the last few years. It would be
useful to clarify whether there is a high degree of confidence in the
figures that have been used and to ask Ministers to state the reasons
for the big decline in the past few years. Does that simply come from
the growing lack of attractiveness of the DC rebate&#151;the point
that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare is about to
make?</div>
					
					<a name="07020138000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07020138000224"></a>
							<b class="B">
								John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): Indeed, I hope that the
Minister will clarify that for us. Given the eroding attractiveness of
the rebates for both defined-contribution and defined-benefit schemes,
one reason why it is costing the Government significantly less could
simply be that more and more people are contracting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 241</div>
						back into the Government scheme. That may mean that
the Government are saving money by reducing the amount of money that
they are paying out for the rebates, but at the same time they are
having to pay out a good deal more on the other side of the equation in
the contracted-in element of the scheme. If those numbers do not
balance, it will leave a big hole. I am sure that the Minister will
want to reassure us on
that.</div>

							<a name="07020138000225"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point, which
relates to another issue that I want to come to in just a
moment.</div>
					<a name="07020138000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue
that the Minister could clarify and which is slightly more complicated
is what the financial consequences of abolishing the
defined-contribution rebates will be. We have some DWP estimates of
that, which date back to 2006. At that stage the Government were using
a much higher estimate for the potential savings from the rebate. They
were using a figure of much more like &#163;4 billion and then they
had some projections for what the additional state second pension cost
would be of ending the rebates,<i class="I"> </i>but therefore opting more people
into the state second pension. They had a line which showed the savings
from getting rid of the opted-out rebates and a separate line
escalating rapidly over time that reflected the costs of providing the
state second pension. That cost rose by 2050 so that the cost of the
state second pension provision was greater than the saving from the
rebate. It would be useful to have some new figures on that. I assume
that these are now out of date and inaccurate in respect of the rebate
savings. It would be useful to know the latest estimates for the rebate
savings, which presumably are reflected in the regulatory impact
assessment, and also what the state second pension projections are and
how they have
changed.</div>
					<a name="07020138000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would also
be useful if the Minister would tell us at some stage what the net
present value to the taxpayer and the Exchequer of the changes will be.
He may not have those figures with him now, but they would be useful
for a later debate. There is a significant dispute about what these
moneys should be used for. Part of the argument is that although the
Government are getting some of the benefit now of not having the
rebate, they are taking on a big future commitment by increasing the
state second pension
expenditure.</div>
					<a name="07020138000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other complications because there is the money on the existing
Exchequer tax relief which will not have to be paid out. Therefore if
we are to have a sensible discussion about this and how any money
should be used, we should try to get an assessment of the net present
value of this change. Will it end up as a greater burden because we are
opting people back into a more expensive state second pension, or will
we save money because we are getting the value of these rebates, which
look as though they will save more money in cash terms for the
Exchequer until about 2050? That calculation, which may be complex, is
necessary to inform any sensible debate about what we should be doing
as a consequences of these changes.</div>
					<a name="07020138000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members for
Weston-super-Mare and for South-West Bedfordshire mentioned the fact
that we are going to stick with the existing DC rebates until the year
when the earnings link is restored. Sadly, we do not yet know when that
will be. It could be 2012, but it could be 2013, 2014 or 2015. I assume
that the Minister will confirm that the scrapping of the DC rebates
could 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 242</div>
						be as late as 2015. If I have got that wrong, I hope
that he will take the opportunity to put it on the record. It is an
undesirable aspect of the uncertainty that the Government have created
on the earnings link that there will also be uncertainty about the
change to the
rebates.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention.
I am not sure whether he was saying that he will review existing rebate
levels or that he is willing to review the possibility of the DC
rebates continuing and the timing of their phase-out. I thought that
the Government&#146;s position was that the rebates are to be
scrapped in the year when the basic state pension is linked to earnings
again and that that will be sometime between 2012 and 2015. I therefore
assume&#151;I am sorry if I have got this wrong&#151;that there is
a lack of clarity on the timing of the scrapping of the
rebates.</div>

							<a name="07020138000228"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
premise on our policy. Our objective is to restore the link in 2012 and
our policy is that the rebate will also be abolished then. We have had
a long debate on that, which I do not propose to reopen. The
quinquennial review is a separate thing and sets the level of the
rebate. The next one is due by 2012 but, as I said, there is always the
option of doing it
earlier.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020138000229"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Mr. Taylor, I am sure that I will get
into trouble with you if I revisit our debate on the timing of the
earnings link to too great an extent. However, the Minister has
confirmed what I was concerned about: that if the earnings link is
delayed, the provisions of the clause will be delayed with it. That is
not particularly desirable. The reason why I wanted to establish that
is the one given by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare. We
know&#151;it is set out clearly in the final report of the Pensions
Commission&#151;that the Government have not accepted the Government
Actuary&#146;s Department&#146;s recommendations of the level at
which the rebate for DC schemes should be set.</div>
					<a name="07020138000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a useful table, figure
11, on page 25 of the commission&#146;s final report. It compares the
Government Actuary Department&#146;s recommendations for the rebate
levels for DC schemes in 2007-08 with the rebate that the Government
are going to apply. Particularly for older groups, there is a big
mismatch between the rebate and the level that the GAD was recommending
as the break-even level for people either in their own personal schemes
on a DC basis or taking state second pensions benefits. For somebody
aged 60, the GAD recommendation for the rebate was 13.4 per cent., and
the rebate that will be applied is only 7.4 per cent. For somebody aged
50 the GAD recommendation was 9.4 per cent. and the actual
rebate 7.4 per cent. Helpfully, next to that table the commission spelt
out that the implication was that</div>
					<a name="07020138000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless individuals aged over 44
in APPs and 48 in money purchase schemes receive higher investment
returns than assumed by GAD, the contracting-out rebate will not
replace foregone S2P
benefits.&#148;</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07020138000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a bit
of a concern and raises the question whether, at worst, there is an
element of misrepresentation or mis-selling going on and whether people
might in the future challenge the Government&#146;s setting of the
rebates at such a low level. The issue is particularly relevant because
the Government seem to be saying, &#147;This whole DC rebate thing
isn&#146;t really working. People have much more of an interest in
just opting in to the state second pension.&#148; Yet people will
still be able to make that mistake for five, or maybe six, seven or
eight years. Why have the Government decided to set the rebates at
those levels? What information will be given to people, particularly
those in the vulnerable groups, about the risks of not opting in to the
state second pension? Why have the Government decided to maintain this
slightly dangerous situation for a number of
years?</div>
					<a name="07020138000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are our
preliminary statistical concerns. The bigger debate is on what the
defined-contribution rebate saving should be used for. During the Work
and Pensions Committee hearing, three or four different claims were
made on the rebates. Although the level of rebate that people fought
over to use for their own purposes has now shrunk by perhaps 50 per
cent., it is quite a lot of money. A couple of billion pounds, even by
my standards, is a lot of money, so it is worth asking ourselves what
should happen to it.</div>
					<a name="07020138000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 4.14 of the
regulatory impact assessment
says:</div>
					<a name="07020138000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Against
this background, contracting out for DC schemes will no longer offer
the stimulus to private pension saving that the Government
seeks.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020138000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seems to be
some thinking that the DC rebates were designed to offer a stimulus to
private saving, and perhaps that is an indication that that should
happen in future. That was contested by Alison O&#146;Connell of the
Pensions Policy Institute, as the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare
will know, because he was involved in a lot of the questioning when she
gave evidence to the Select Committee. She
said:</div>
					<a name="07020138000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Contracting
out was not ever intended to be as an encouragement for funded
provision; it was intended to protect the existing Defined Benefit
schemes when SERPS was set
up&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07020138000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">and as the Minister
will know, the PPI was suggesting that there was therefore no rational
need to put aside the DC rebate to encourage future saving. For some
time the PPI has been suggesting reinvesting it in the first tier, on
the basis that that might be a better foundation for encouraging
saving.</div>
					
					<a name="07020138000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020138000230"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Is the hon. Gentleman therefore disagreeing with
the view of the Pensions Commission that we should keep the DB rebate
so as to preserve final salary
schemes?</div>
					
					<a name="07020138000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020138000231"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The Minister will know that our view is that in
future, while respecting accrued rights, we should not have a state
second pension. We want a good foundation basic state pension set at a
higher level than the present one. Then we want to provide a basis for
people to save on top of that. It stands to reason that if we do not
have a state second pension, we will not have an opt-out system,
because there will be nothing to opt out of. However, in the context of
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 244</div>Government&#146;s policy there are three or four views as to how the
money from the DC rebates should be used. The Pensions Policy Institute
was taking one of them&#151;that the money should be invested in
first-tier provision. I know that that is not the Government&#146;s
view, and I shall comment on that in a second.</div>
					<a name="07020138000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that was the first view, the
second was put by a number of economists who gave evidence to the Work
and Pensions Committee. They argued that it would be foolish to use any
of the money to incentivise saving or improve the first tier, on the
basis that all that was happening was that the Government were
acquiring an obligation to spend on the state second pension, and
swapping that for rebates that were designed to be an alternative to
the state second pension. If that view is right&#151;this is why I
asked my slightly geekish question about the net present value of what
the Government are doing&#151;the net present value of what the
Government are doing will be close to zero, because the state second
pension obligations that they are acquiring will be offset by savings
from the rebate. It will be interesting to know whether that is the
case.</div>
					<a name="07020138000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third set
of arguments seems to date back to the Government&#146;s view, set
out in the regulatory impact assessment, that the rebates are there to
encourage private saving. One could argue that the more one encourages
private saving in the context of first-tier provision&#151;first-tier
saving or saving through having a decent first tier&#151;the less
potential there is to end up with a large number of people on
means-tested benefits, so that there is some moderation of the demands
on the taxpayer of the
future.</div>
					<a name="07020138000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">That position
seems to have been taken by both the Pensions Commission and the
Secretary of State. The second report of the Pensions Commission
indicated:</div>
					<a name="07020138000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Additional
government cash flow generated from these changes should be used to
increase government&#146;s contribution to national saving: this
requires either the pay down of debt, the diversion of the money into a
national &#145;buffer fund&#146;, or its use to promote individual
funded
savings&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07020138000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">for
example,</div>
					<a name="07020138000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by measures to
ensure the success of
the&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020138000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">national pensions
savings scheme.</div>
					<a name="07020138000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems to be the view that the Secretary of State has bought on behalf
of the Government&#151;perhaps not the entire Government, but
certainly the Department for Work and Pensions. The Secretary of State
was questioned on the issue before the Select Committee on 7 June. He
said of the money that would be realised as a consequence of getting
rid of the DC
rebates:</div>
					<a name="07020138000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
creates extra revenue essentially for the National Insurance fund.
Essentially that is how it works. What Turner said was that it would be
rational and sensible to use some of that to embed and support a new
pensions saving
culture&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020138000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">He went on to
say that a new mechanism of tax relief for the personal accounts
was</div>
					<a name="07020138000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;one potential way in
which that investment, that saving...from scrapping the DC rebate,
can be reinvested in promoting and encouraging and embedding the
savings culture, and I think that would be an entirely sensible thing
to do&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07020138000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that</div>
					<a name="07020138000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the savings that
are generated from the DC
rebate&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020138000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">could be
used</div>
					<a name="07020138000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to support the
introduction of the personal cap system.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 245</div>
					<a name="07020138000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of State made his
position extremely clear in answer to question 304, which was whether
he saw himself as making a bid for the &#163;5 billion being realised
by the abolition of the DC rebate to be used in the pension system. The
Secretary of State very clearly said yes. He does not want the
Chancellor of the Exchequer to nab all the money from the DC rebate,
although it may be too late. He was hoping to capture some of that to
incentivise personal
accounts.</div>

hon. Gentleman may be causing by his remarks, that is exactly what we
have done through the personal accounts policy, which will attract tax
relief in the way that he, I am sure, understands. As he said in his
previous supposition, the measure is broadly neutral. There is not a
pot of money to be spent, but it needs to be taken into account when
looking at tax reliefs overall. It is not part of direct pension
expenditure.</div>

							<a name="07020138000233"></a>
								Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that,
but I think that he is having that both ways. He is saying, first, that
there is no money from the change, because one set of liabilities is
being taken on to offset the money coming in, but he also appears to be
saying that he has spent some of that money on the 1 per cent. tax
relief, which will be there in the personal accounts. I am not clear
whether the cost of all the changes, including the 1 per cent. that the
Government are putting into the personal accounts, is zero, or whether
the Government accept that there is some saving that they have already
used on the personal accounts. I thought that the implication of what
the Secretary of State was saying and of what the Pensions Commission
was recommending was that, even on top of the things that were being
done through the personal account tax incentives, there was the
possibility of some additional incentives to encourage personal
accounts. For example, such incentives might relate to the tax relief
or to help on additional costs for smaller firms staying in the
personal accounts, or might be designed to incentivise personal
accounts versus other savings products. That was certainly the
impression. The industry and a lot of people who are interested in the
issue have been under the impression that the Department had not closed
the door on using the money saved on the DC rebates for some new
initiative.</div>
					<a name="07020138000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
the third option, the others being that the money is to be found in the
pensions or that there is not really any money here at all. The third
is that there is some money, but it should be used to incentivise
saving in the personal accounts. The other, sub-view of the private
savings incentives, was expressed very well by Mr.
Waddingham of the Association of Consulting Actuaries, who gave some
very good evidence to the Work and Pensions Committee on 17 May. In the
context of levelling down, he set out his views and concerns about
personal accounts and what was then called the national pension savings
scheme. He
said:</div>
					<a name="07020138000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;NPSS is
a good idea for broadening the scope of pension provision because there
were always many employees who were never pensioned. What I am saying
is that NPSS can in no way be an adequate replacement for those many
millions of people in current occupational pension schemes, who are
doing rather better at the moment, but the next generation will do very
much worse in retirement terms.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 246</div>
					<a name="07020138000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later, he discussed his anxiety
that although some bigger employers with a significant commitment to
pensions may stick with their pension schemes, their DB schemes or
their DC schemes, which are more generous, there is a risk, which it
seems intuitively sensible to consider, that as the personal accounts
are set up, many employers who are under greater financial pressure and
have lower contributions to their pension schemes than the very high
rates at the top of the market, or people who have DB schemes and
discover that they are hugely under water, may decide to trade down to
the personal account level, which would imply much lower contributions
and carry an enormously higher risk.</div>
					<a name="07020138000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not discussed the issue
of the huge transfer of risk from the state, as the second pension
provider, and employers, as major providers of second pensions, to
individuals, many of whom will be very poorly qualified to manage that
risk.</div>
					<a name="07020138000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the context
of the DC rebate, Mr. Waddingham told the Select
Committee:</div>
					<a name="07020138000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would be much more beneficial, I think, to use some of that rebate to
offer the good employers, say, a 1 per cent. reduction in their
National Insurance if they were willing to introduce risk-sharing
schemes to which they were contributing, say, 10 per
cent.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020138000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
other words, Mr. Waddingham was suggesting that some of the
money should be used to give employers who are providing good second
pensions an incentive to keep going rather than letting them fall to
the minimum set by the Government for personal accounts. That is at
least worth considering, because many employers who have acquired huge
pension obligations over the past few years have not kept up with the
implications of increasing life expectancy, and there is a great risk
of them trading down to the personal account levels. We understand that
the Government are introducing personal account pensions at a low level
to avoid placing too big a burden on employers and employees, but the
total amount going into the personal accounts will be very low in
relation to the types of scheme to which we aspire.</div>
					<a name="07020138000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider the issue in
the context of the MPs&#146; pension scheme, which has a 27.8 per
cent. employer contribution, against 3 per cent. for the personal
account, which has a 10 per cent. employee contribution as against 4
per cent., which is about 4 per cent. going in from the taxpayer
directly through our own pay, versus 1 per cent. in the personal
accounts. We have a pension scheme that pumps about 40 per cent. of our
average salary each year into a very good, defined-benefit pension. The
personal account pensions, which will have much more money going into
them anyway because the target audience is lower-paid people, will have
much smaller elements of people&#146;s overall
income.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07020138000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
that I would want savings from the DC rebates to go into advantaging
personal accounts versus other forms of employer provision. If we gave
incentives only to personal accounts rather than to other employer
schemes, we would risk encouraging that levelling-down process.
However, the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 247</div>might have good reason to be seriously concerned that many of the
excellent employer schemes that we have had in this country over the
past few decades will continue to be lost. They might want to think of
imaginative ways in which to help good-quality employers keep
good-quality
schemes.</div>

that, therefore, their liabilities became top-heavy. Auto-enrolment is
critical in providing incentives and making the schemes

extremely dangerous if as many as half the population were to end up on
means-tested benefits, especially if we do not have a proper system of
advice, which becomes more difficult as the number of people in the

want to make it clear that I am certainly not inviting employers to
keep open unsustainable schemes. The private sector has moved far more
rapidly than the public sector in demonstrating how such schemes can be
made affordable. Some good defined-benefit schemes in my constituency
have made all sorts of imaginative changes. For example, some have
shared the risk of longer life expectancy in order to keep the schemes
going in the existing form, which employers value for providing the
certainty of a final salary scheme and better levels of
contribution.</div>
					<a name="07020138000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all
know that when defined-benefit schemes close down and
defined-contribution schemes open up there is usually an enormous
disparity in the employer contribution. Even some of the best employers
in my area, who had contribution rates of about 16 per cent. under
their DB schemes, are cutting them to more like 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 248</div>7 per cent. under their DC schemes. That is the context in which we are
having this debate. We will want to ensure that, as a consequence of
the changes being made, we do not end up losing or undermining the very
good employer schemes of recent years. That is why I think that some of
the proposals put to the Work and Pensions Committee are at least worth
considering. I hope that my comments will prompt some clarification on
the details from the Minister and some discussion of the different
savings
options.</div>

Selous:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman was right in saying that there
is a strong similarity between his amendment No. 37 and the official
Opposition&#146;s new clause 3; they essentially cover the same
territory.</div>
					<a name="07020138000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">We went
over quite a lot of the background of contracted-out rebates earlier
this morning. Like the hon. Gentleman, I shall focus on the fact that
in the regulatory impact assessment that was published in May last
year, the Government confidently asserted that the abolition of
contracting out for defined-contribution schemes would</div>
					<a name="07020138000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;lead to an immediate cash-flow
benefit from the rebate of around &#163;4 billion in 2012/13, rising
to &#163;5.1 billion by
2050&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020138000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">That raises a
major accounting issue. Figure 8.6 on page 100 of the latest regulatory
impact assessment shows that the Government have slashed that amount.
For both 2008 and 2009, the figure is &#163;1.8 billion; for 2010,
&#163;1.7 billion, and for 2011, &#163;1.6 billion. Slightly
bizarrely, there is a figure of zero for the years between 2012 and
2050. Perhaps the Minister will comment on
that.</div>
					<a name="07020138000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important
point made by the ABI and other industry bodies is that contracted-out
rebates are a major incentive for private pension saving. Not only does
that system encourage people to save for their retirement but it
reduces through pre-funding the state&#146;s future pension
liabilities. As well as being fair and equitable, it makes enormous
sense for any saving to be ploughed back into the pension system. In
theory, the money that is saved by scrapping contracting out could be
used to increase the state pension or to hold down the future cost of
pension provision. The Pensions Commission favoured the latter option,
saying that there was a</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 249</div>
					<a name="07020138000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;good argument that the extra tax
revenue...should not be used to fund current
pensions&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020138000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission
felt that the revenue should instead be used to reduce long-term
pension costs.</div>
					<a name="07020138000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Yeovil has quoted extensively from the evidence of the
Work and Pensions Committee and he is absolutely right to have done so.
In its recent report, the Committee said that
it</div>
					<a name="07020138000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;believes that the
Government should be explicit about how it intends to use the increased
revenue arising from the abolition of contracting out for Defined
Contribution
schemes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020138000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State has undertaken that any savings should be used in one of the
ways that I have described. In his evidence to the Work and Pensions
Committee on 7 June 2006, he said that</div>
					<a name="07020138000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it would be entirely legitimate
and sensible to use the savings that are generated from the DC rebate
to support the introduction of the personal cap
system.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020138000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be
grateful if the Minister will confirm whether that is still the
Government&#146;s stated position. Assuming that the Government have
not retreated, will he also explain in detail how he intends to utilise
that significant saving for the benefit of the whole pension
system?</div>
					<a name="07020138000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Yeovil has helpfully set out, there is a wide range of
options for the use of that money. It could, for example, provide
additional support for employers, especially smaller employers. It
could incentivise them to offer contributions above the default level.
When we debate the relevant provisions, we will have a great deal to
say about the dangers of levelling down existing pension provision as a
side effect of the introduction of personal accounts.</div>
					<a name="07020138000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the money could be used
to improve public awareness and understanding of the need to save and
the incentives that are available. That point was also made by the
Pensions Commission. In any event, proposed new clause 3 would require
the Secretary of State to report to Parliament every financial year on
how the Government have used the revenue saved by the abolition of
contracting out.</div>
