<H4><center>Clause 30</center></H4>
<H4><center>Petitions and orders: supplementary</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin (North Essex):</B> The clause is fairly simple, but we are also discussing schedules 1 and 2—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Not yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. Gale. The clause relates to schedules 1 and 2. Before we discuss schedules 1 and 2, will the Minister explain its purpose?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I hesitate to delay the Committee. I tried to refer to the significance of the schedules and the clause in my introductory remarks about the group of clauses from the start of the special administration provisions to the end of schedule 3, but I shall recap briefly.
<P>
Clause 30 relates to petitions made under the insolvency provisions. Schedule 1 specifies the provisions of the insolvency legislation that are appropriate for inclusion in the modified versions appropriate for air traffic control along the lines that I explained earlier. It repeats many of the provisions in the Insolvency Act 1986, making amendments where necessary to reflect the specific requirements of the air traffic control administration order arrangements.
<P>
Schedule 2 covers circumstances in which a court has made an air traffic administration order, and provides for schemes under which another company may carry out licensed activities in all or part of a licensed area. It details the provisions that are available to the air traffic administrator to achieve those objectives. They are tidying-up provisions designed to cope with an eventuality that I hope will not arise. They are sensible provisions that are included as a fail-safe mechanism. I hope that that satisfies the inquiry of the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes. I am grateful to the Minister.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 30 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill,
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I shall be brief, as we cantered over much of the subject in discussing clause 26. The clause may result in a mess, as public money will now be involved. Has a maximum or minimum sum been considered? Has it been discussed with the Treasury? From which Department would the loan come? Has that been discussed with the Treasury? The conflict in the clause, which is backed up by clause 32, is stated in subsection (6):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A grant, loan, agreement to indemnify, guarantee or direction under this section requires the Treasury's consent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause would come into effect only in the event of a catastrophe, in which case we would need to set up a new arrangement to ensure that NATS carries on. Such continuity is vital. By definition, any involvement by the Treasury means prevarication, delay, obfuscation and a tendency to say no. I would have thought that the priority would be to have a set-up that guarantees a swift decision and that that decision-making power should rest in the hands of the Secretary of State, and not the Chancellor, whose priority, under any Government, is not to spend money. Could the Minister clarify how he thinks that will work in practice?
<P>
There was merit in amendment No. 184—perhaps I am jumping ahead to clause 32, which said that—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is jumping ahead and is debating an unselected amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I apologise, Mr. Gale, but the two clauses go together closely. There is a potential delay while we await a Treasury decision. It would have been better if the total decision rested in the hands of the Secretary of State for an instant decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that I can allay the hon. Gentleman's concerns. He asked whether the issue had been the subject of discussion with the Treasury. As he will observe from the back page of the Bill, the Chancellor is one of the sponsors of the Bill and has to be satisfied with all its provisions. There is no question of the provision of the clause being included without the prior agreement of the Treasury.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the provision is designed to cope with a catastrophe, but if he looks closely at the wording of the clause, he will see that it applies only if an air traffic administration order has already been brought into effect. That is the situation that would require an urgent response and the need for quick action. Once the administration order was in place, there would be a period of up to three months in which the administrator could prepare proposals for dealing with the problem. Any financial requirements would be analysed and identified during that period. The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions is the Minister responsible for making the decision, but under the Bill he will require the consent of the Treasury to make any payment—which is not to imply that there will be a requirement for such payments. Simply, it would be foolish not to provide powers that would enable the air traffic control system to continue operating in such circumstances. That is why the provision exists, but we hope very much that it will not have to be used in practice. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman's concerns.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Some of my queries on my previous question have been satisfied, but I should like to go back to the amounts of money that may be involved, and to any discussions that there may have been with the Treasury. I am pleased that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been involved and that is he is one of the Bill's sponsors.
<P>
What must arouse some worries in the minds of Treasury mandarins is the fact that there is no time limit, so that those who will run the new company could come back for further helpings, and get quite a liking for it. There is no limit on the timing that would prevent that. Can the Minister give the Committee an idea of the total amounts that might be involved and say something about the time scale that may have been discussed with the Treasury? Is there perhaps some trip-wire mechanism that could bring this potential gravy train to a halt?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no gravy train here along the lines of those that his party envisaged for the privatised railways. We are simply looking for safeguards against circumstances in which insolvency could occur or where there might be a need to transfer the licence to a new strategic partner, leaving a financial shortfall that would jeopardise the maintenance of air traffic control services. In those circumstances, the powers are available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Perhaps the Minister will rethink some of his words. I feel sure that he made a slip of the tongue when he spoke of the licence being given to the strategic partner. That is not correct; the licence would be given to National Air Traffic Services itself as the strategic partner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. If I have misled the Committee, I will be happy to rephrase what I said. If there has to be a change of licence holder because of a change of strategic partner, it will be necessary to accommodate that in the most expeditious way possible. If there were a financial difficulty, it would be absurd if separate legislation was required at that time to give the Secretary of State power to make such a grant. We do not expect to use the provision. It is only a backstop for emergency and extreme circumstances, so there can be no pre-determined view of the amounts involved because clearly that will depend on the circumstances.
<P>
There is provision in clause 31 for the terms to require all or part to be repaid, if it is a grant, so there are careful safeguards to ensure that, where appropriate, the Government can recover that money. Equally, there is provision for loans to be repaid according to the terms set when the loan was advanced. These terms will determine the timetable for repayment of the loan. The provisions simply cover an eventuality that we hope will not arise. If it does, we have the flexibility to respond appropriately. The provisions are certainly not a guarantee of money to an irresponsible licence holder who happens to default on his responsibility. That would not be appropriate, nor is it what we are providing for. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that and agree that clause 32 should stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I should be grateful if the Minister would explain the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> That is not a particularly onerous task. It is, I think, the shortest clause that we have reached so far. It contains no more than eight words:

I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is more interested in the contents of the schedule, so it may be helpful if I address them briefly before we reach schedule 3.

I hope that members of the Committee will accept that, in a Bill of this size and complexity, it is almost inevitable that an occasional gremlin creeps in. We wanted to correct such errors at the earliest opportunity. I should love to think that now was the only instance when such a problem arises, but I fear that it will not be. I hope that the Committee accepts the amendment.

<H4><center>Investigations</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Speeches are becoming shorter and the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) should be congratulated on his speech, which consisted of the phrase, ``What would the Minister like to tell the Committee?'' I want to speak in a similar vein and ask the Minister to explain the missing bit of clause 34. Clauses 15 to 20 deal with orders by the Secretary of State in relation to contraventions or likely contraventions of section 8 duties, while clauses 21 to 25 deal with orders by the CAA in relation to contraventions or likely contraventions of the licence conditions. We heard earlier that the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) had the opportunity to write a lengthy letter home because the Minister agreed that those two packages of clauses will collide and that the responsibility for orders will rest with the CAA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That merited a case of champagne for my mother.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Committee is delighted that the hon. Gentleman is giving his mother such wonderful presents. No doubt, he will have sent at least one bottle to the Minister concerned.
<P>
With or without the collision of the two issues, it is interesting to note that clause 34 suggests that the CAA must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``investigate an alleged or apprehended contravention of a condition of a licence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Depending on the outcome, the results will appear in the register that is referred to under clause 35. I can find nothing, however, in the Bill that refers to the need for the CAA, presumably, to investigate the allegations of contravention of section 8 duties. If there is a need for investigation into possible breaches of licence conditions, why is there not a similar requirement for an investigation into breaches of section 8 duties?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This is an interesting clause. When we reach the part of the Bill that is headed ``Miscellaneous'', we find that the draftsman has dropped in bits of the Bill that did not fit elsewhere. However, this provision should have been dealt with elsewhere in the Bill because it concerns whistle-blowing, which is becoming a recognised and accepted part of any regulatory structure.
<P>
Just to be quixotic, I am concerned about two opposing dangers of such a whistle-blowing clause: first that it is open to abuse and vexatious whistle-blowing and, secondly, that it may have been drawn too narrowly. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The CAA must investigate an alleged or apprehended contravention of a condition of a licence if the alleged or apprehended contravention is the subject of a representation made to the CAA by or on behalf of a person who appears to it to have an interest in the matter.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To whom, exactly, is the whistle-blowing limited? One hopes that it would include an employee of the licence holder—for instance, if an air traffic controller felt that his internal representations were not being ignored.
<P>
The CAA is legally obliged to investigate bone fide representations made to it. But would a former or sacked air traffic controller be deemed still to have an interest in the matter? Would an aircraft pilot be deemed to have an interest? What is meant by ``an interest in the matter''? If pilots can have an interest in the matter, what about passengers? Surely passengers have an interest in the safe management of the air traffic control system. What about my constituents, who have aircraft stacking over their heads waiting to land at Stanstead airport? Do they have an interest in the matter? What is the purpose of that qualification? Is it meant to restrict the provision, or is it meant to apply to anyone with an interest in the matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): What would happen if a pilot is told something by someone whom he regularly meets in a pub? Could that person be said to have an interest in the matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I certainly understand—[Interruption.] Mention of a pub has started chattering on the Government Benches. I venture to suggest that if it is left to pub talk, matters of aviation safety will have reached a pretty sorry pitch. However, my hon. Friend is right to ask whether, if a third party hears of such a matter from someone who may have an interest—whatever that means—and draws it to the attention of the CAA, the CAA should be obliged to investigate. Is it intended to be a broad provision or a shutting-out clause? It can be read either way. It depends what is meant by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a person who appears . . . to have an interest in the matter.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In support of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), I would ask why the provision is restricted to the conditions of the licence? Why is it not about the duties of the CAA or of a licence holder or, indeed, of the Secretary of State? I presume that the CAA would be interested in any aspect of airline safety. Will the Minister explain how it was dealt with previously? I am not familiar with the provisions of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 on whistle-blowers, but I am sure that the CAA knows how to judge a bogus scare from a real one and that it would act accordingly. I am sure that its doors are open, that its ears are open and that its e-mail system is working to pick up anything that comes in its direction. From that point of view, is the clause necessary? I would be glad to hear the Minister's view on those matters.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> Mr. Gale—
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> They always give the hon. Gentleman the tricky ones
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> On the contrary, I think that I have got off fairly lightly.
<P>
You may recall, Mr. Gale, that at the start of this morning's sitting the hon. Member for North Essex—or was it the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)?—asked how much money we hoped to raise. It was alleged that there was some confusion over the figures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman like me to deal with that question now, or would he prefer me to answer him later?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There are more appropriate places in the debate on the Bill for that to be done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. We shall deal with the matter in relation to extinguishing liabilities after clause 40. However, were we to receive a note before our sitting on Thursday, that would suffice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am sure that that can be arranged. There is no need for confusion. The matter is more or less as I described the other day, although I can spell it out.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath spoke about duties. I am grateful to him, as he made an interesting point. I do not want to provide premature hope for his mother, but we agree to consider the matter. We shall have to check it out and see whether it needs to be addressed. If it does, we shall tackle it.
<P>
We need not make heavy weather of the subsequent matter. The hon. Member for North Essex asked who the interested parties were. The clause mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a representation made to the CAA by or on behalf of a person who appears to it to have an interest in the matter.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That clarifies that discretion lies with the CAA, which will use common sense to judge whether sufficient weight can be given to someone raising a matter for it to investigate. We should not get bogged down on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Is there an equivalent provision in the Civil Aviation Act 1982?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I do not have that Act to hand. However, clause 34(1) of the Transport Bill contains the phrase ``who appears to it''—meaning the CAA.
<P>
The clause is drawn widely because we want to err on the side of caution. If someone brings a matter that requires consideration, no one will be pettifogging about the status of that person, as the credibility of the matter to be investigated is the important issue. If the CAA considers that a serious matter has been raised, it will look into it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I share that confidence. Indeed, I did not expect a provision worded in such a way to appear in the Bill.
<P>
I am not contesting the word ``it''. However, who, precisely, is expected to have an interest in the matter? Will some categories of people be excluded? Is there simply to be discretion for the CAA to decide who it wants to listen to? We would be happy with that.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 185, in page 23, line 32, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but any person who suffers loss or damage by reason of the inaccuracy of matters entered upon the register, or by reason of the omission from the register of matters which the CAA ought reasonably to have made itself aware, may bring an action against the CAA.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 292, in page 23, line 33, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
No. 293, in page 23, line 37, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We tabled the amendment because it seemed bizarre to require the CAA to maintain a register under the clause, given its sweeping powers to demand information from licence holders. It therefore seems odd that the CAA is not liable if it does not know of something. The Government have already accepted the principle that bodies affected by the chapter may be sued under clause 18. Why not include a common-sense remedy for bureaucratic incompetence? One must have some regard to keeping the register accurate. This is an important part of the Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 292 and 293 would omit subsections (5) and (6). Our main concern is that, despite subsection (7), which gives the public the right to inspect the register, there seems to be some sort of sifting process by which both the CAA and the Secretary of State can exclude information that they do not want to be on the register, and thus available for inspection. These catch-all provisions could substantially alter what information goes on the register. Perhaps it might be as well to have a register of two parts, one for public inspection and the other for more sensitive information, which would nevertheless still be part of the register.
<P>
Clause 35 provides for the compilation of a register containing all the relevant information, and yet subsections (5) and (6) could exclude bits of information that may, for example, be relevant to an inquiry. Will the Minister explain how those subsections will operate and, related to that, how subsection (7) will work? There needs to be a balance between the public right of inspection—I suspect that, in most cases, ``the public'' would be interested parties such as airlines wanting to scrutinise the licence and modifications—and making public sensitive information that could impact on a third party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> When we talk about a register, I have in mind a large, leatherbound book with tooled edges and vellum paper, in which various things are inscribed with a quill pen. I know that I am very old fashioned and that modern registers do not look at all like that.
<P>
A curious feature of the clause is that the register is designed to hold only one licence for the foreseeable future—for perhaps the next 30 years, it will contain just one record plus related notes. It seems a little over the top to set up a register for just one licence. The recording and reporting of these matters could perhaps have been done more simply, but I suspect that the provision has been taken straight from our old friend the Railways Act 1993. I did not want to let this moment pass without making that point.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gavin Strang </B>(Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh): I do not want to delay the Committee, but I, too, was a little surprised by subsection (5). Clearly, the Committee is agreed that there should be a register. Given that, such a register should include all relevant information. Subsection (5) is sharply drawn. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``So far as practicable the CAA must secure the exclusion from the register of any matter . . . if the CAA thinks its inclusion would or might seriously and prejudicially affect the person's interests.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would help the Committee if my hon. Friend the Minister could give some examples of information that might appear in the register but which would be prejudicial to an individual. It seems rather clumsy drafting. Could not we prescribe that, in compiling the register, the CAA must ``take practicable and reasonable steps to avoid seriously and prejudicially damaging an individual's interests''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As the hon. Member for Poole explained, the amendment would create a right of action for damages against the CAA for any error in or omission from the register of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which the CAA ought reasonably to have made itself aware''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said in our debate on clauses 1 and 2, we consider that an application for judicial review provides adequate remedies against public bodies such as the CAA. We have undertaken to write to hon. Members on that point, and we shall do so shortly. The hon. Member for North Essex is right that there are several precedents for provisions that require the regulator to keep a register of licences, but none creates a right of action for damages against a regulator for any error in, or omission from, a register. Such provisions include, to name but a few, sections 72 and 73 of the Railways Act 1993, section 195 of the Water Industry Act 1991, section 49 of the Electricity Act 1989, section 36 of the Gas Act 1986, and section 19 of the Telecommunications Act 1984.
<P>
We would expect the CAA, as a matter of course, to respond constructively to a request to correct an error or omission in the register, but we doubt very much whether anyone would resort to law in those circumstances. We do not expect a mistake or omission to result in losses or damage to anyone. Therefore, there is no need for a remedy above and beyond judicial review, which could be used to require the CAA to correct mistakes or omissions in the register but not to obtain damages.
<P>
There would be a far greater risk of someone sustaining loss or damage if amendments Nos. 292 and 293 were accepted, because we are considering the deletion of provisions to exclude sensitive or prejudicial material from the register of licences. Those amendments seem to contradict the spirit of amendment No. 185.
<P>
The provisions in subsections (5) and (6) are nothing new, and I shall not weary the Committee with a further recital of the precedents, unless hon. Members insist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I seek some examples. Do subsection (5) and (6) relate to commercially sensitive information, which one could understand, or are we still talking about safety information, which may have an impact on commercial considerations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We are principally talking about commercial information, and I shall give some examples in a moment.
<P>
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 provides for the maintenance of a register of agreements and, in section 23, for the maintenance of a special section of the register for commercially sensitive material. The Fair Trading Act 1973 contains similar provisions for the excision of sensitive information, such as section 83, on the laying before Parliament of Competition Commission reports; section 124, on the publication by the Office of Fair Trading of information and advice; and section 133, which imposes general restrictions on the disclosure of information gained under the auspices of that Act, thereby underlining the importance of treating commercially sensitive information with care.
<P>
The expectation is that the provisions will be rarely used. The regulator and the Secretary of State will start with the strong presumption that, in the interests of transparency and accountability, the register of licences should be comprehensive unless it is clear that the person would suffer commercial prejudice as a result, or that the public interest would be adversely affected. The provisions are intended to be a safeguard. If the licensee is not the parent company, there is a possibility that certain matters in the licence might reveal information about the parent company or a subsidiary of the parent company, which could affect its value or competitiveness. The provisions are not about protecting the licensee from disclosing information to which its customers are reasonably entitled. Licensed bodies, by their nature, are monopolies or involve monopolistic elements, and it might be argued that considerations of commercial sensitivity are a different animal where monopolies are concerned.
<P>
Some information, if disclosed, can be prejudicial to the interests of customers as well as to the monopoly itself. My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) asked for examples. If a licensee were obliged to disclose a statement of his investment plans which not only disaggregated projects—which would be fair enough—but included details of the anticipated cost of each of those projects, it would give a clear signal to prospective bidders to contacts that could have a materially detrimental effect on the final prices.
<P>
The regulator and the Secretary of State in exercising these powers have to make a balanced judgment as to the legitimate interests of the licensee in associated businesses and the interests of customers. The ability to excise, where necessary, material from the register of licences which might damage the interest of either or both is an important tool in maintaining that balance. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for that full explanation. The clause is a fairly good part of the Bill in that it aims to sweep up all the various aspects of the Bill—the register, the exemptions, the licence and the other bits and pieces—and there is some provision in paragraphs (8) and (9) for the CAA to supply information to those who wish to have it. Our main concern was the impact of paragraphs (5) and (6). However, in view of the Minister's explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister give a brief explanation of the powers in relation to land?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, I will. Essentially, schedule 4 preserves the status quo. It sets out the amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1982 in relation to the licence holder's powers to acquire land for any purpose connected with the carrying out of the activities authorised by the licence. The licence holder is allowed to acquire land compulsorily, for example to set up equipment that enables NATS to function. That is the basis of the measure. It is all in the Civil Aviation Act 1982.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> Could I press the Minister a little more on that? He talked about preserving the status quo. It is not being preserved, as private companies are coming into this equation. It is unusual. Opposition Members are slightly ill at ease at the idea of giving compulsory purchase powers to a private company. I can see that a piece of equipment such as a beacon would be essential, but the Civil Aviation Act 1982 goes much wider. It is not just about putting up little pieces of equipment about the place. The Bill refers to ``an aerodrome or apparatus'' owned by the CAA. Does this theoretically give this new company powers to compulsorily purchase many acres to put in a new aerodrome, for instance? In places such as Heathrow, NATS has responsibility for ground movements. If it felt that Heathrow needed to have its ground controls reorganised, could it compulsorily purchase some acres in order to redesign the taxiways of the airport?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend touched on an interesting point. As exercised by the CAA, those powers were exercised by a public authority directly accountable to Ministers, Parliament and, as public money was spent, the Treasury, but we are transferring the powers to a commercial organisation. What is to prevent that organisation—the licence holder or its parent—from exploiting the powers for other commercial purposes? Is there a protection?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> My hon. Friend's point is interesting and illustrates our concerns about compulsory purchase powers being in the hands of a private company, especially if it is able to acquire large tracts of land under the schedule.
<P>
Paragraph 4(3) of the schedule would add proposed new section 44(7B), which is about consent, to the Civil Aviation Act 1982. A company has to apply to the Secretary of State for approval, but why Eurocontrol is mentioned in relation to the necessary consent is baffling. Proposed new section 44(7B)(a) states that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if the relevant authority in whose favour the order is made is the Secretary of State or Eurocontrol, the consent of the Secretary of State''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is necessary. Will the Minister explain why Eurocontrol is involved? Is there a suggestion that it has some proxy, compulsory powers? I would be grateful for a further explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I wondered whether the word ``Eurocontrol'' would set Conservative Members off again like a pack of Pavlov's dogs, and the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) has not disappointed me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> That is the second time that I have been got at. Until I realised some of the errors of my ways, I was a member of the positive European group, so I can hardly be considered a total Eurosceptic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am afraid that it is the usual story. The reference to Eurocontrol is not new. Section 44 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982—no prizes for guessing which party was in power then—already provides that Eurocontrol should be the relevant authority for those purposes. I must stress that we are more or less preserving the status quo, except in that we are transferring powers to the license holder that previously resided with what was a publicly owned corporation, as the hon. Gentleman said. If I understand the official Opposition's position, they would sell 100 per cent. where we are selling only 51 per cent. They would have to do precisely the same thing, except that the state would have no say whatever. So with all due respect, that is not a strong point.
<P>
There is a precedent for the powers given in the schedule; I mention Railtrack in passing. The hon. Gentleman asked what protections prevent a private company from abusing the powers. It would need the Secretary of State's approval, and the use of the powers would be for only the purposes given under the licence and to enable the orderly functioning of air traffic control. I do not think that we are breaking new territory, so no one should get too excited.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The new territory is that the powers lie no longer with a public authority, but lie with a private limited company. How draconian are the powers? I mentioned the question of aerodromes. Would it be technically possible for the licence holder, which would be in charge of ground control at Heathrow airport, compulsorily to purchase additional land to redesign the taxiways at Heathrow? Would that be subject to a public inquiry, like the new terminal? Could the licence holder simply slap down a compulsory purchase order, or could it tell the owners of the land that it would do so and go to a public inquiry if the land was not sold at a reasonable price? That is the usual threat to bring down the price and complete the deal. Would it be able to do that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> No. That would be a clear abuse of the powers that is not provided for in the schedule. The schedule provides only for the safe and efficient functioning of air traffic control; that is the only purpose for which land could be compulsorily purchased. The safeguard is that the Secretary of State has to approve the power, which can be used only for the purposes of the licence. A precise planning procedure exists for dealing with expansions of airports, as anyone who has followed the saga of terminal 5 or the other airport expansions will know. The schedule is not intended as a short cut.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham raised a good point. Sometimes the shortest parts of the Bill throw up such points. I understand that radar or some other land installation needs to be accessible for repair and maintenance. However, I have concerns similar to those of my hon. Friend in that I wonder whether some powers should continue to reside with the CAA and whether NATS, as a private company, should ask it for permission to do certain thing. The schedule shifts substantial authority to the private company and although one presumes that that authority would be used responsibly, one of our roles in scrutinising the Bill is to assume that people sometimes do not act responsibly.
<P>
The schedule provides for extensive powers and my hon. Friend makes an important point. The CAA is a public corporation that is, unlike the new private company, accountable to Parliament and will have to undertake its duties under licence. However, the area of compulsory purchase is a difficult one where public-private partnership is involved. I press the Minister on that: should that power be passed to what, to all intents and purposes, will be a private limited company under the Companies Act, rather than remaining with the CAA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I can only repeat that the powers of compulsory purchase depend on the consent of the Secretary of State. That is a pretty strong safeguard and it is coupled with the fact that NATS will not be a private company in the way that Opposition Members would like—100 per cent. privately owned—but one in which the public sector will have a substantial stake, with directors on the board and many other safeguards built in. I repeat that the Secretary of State will have to authorise any acquisition. With all those factors added together, I cannot see what the problem is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham has stumbled on something. The Minister may ridicule the possible interpretation of the word ``Eurocontrol'', but Eurocontrol will make European legislation by qualified majority vote through the Commission—through the comitology procedure, as we discussed earlier. He says that the Secretary of State would have to give his consent. Secretaries of State have to do many things under European law, which, whether or not they withhold their consent to them, will happen in any case. I am not sure that there is a precedent in British legislation for a European organisation compulsorily to purchase land in a member state—the Bill may be straying into that territory. Can the Under-Secretary assure me that that is not the case? If so, I should be delighted to write it down in my book of assurances that Ministers are giving as they explain the Bill, and shall test it against posterity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It is possible that the hon. Gentleman was out of the Room when we discussed the matter, but I do not believe that he was. The schedule is not unprecedented. The precedent is section 44 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that Eurocontrol should be the relevant authority for such purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That was before the European Union became a member of Eurocontrol and certain changes had taken place, and before the possibility arose of qualified majority voting on civil aviation issues that would create European obligations directly applicable in UK law on what happens in this country. The Under-Secretary, cannot cite that as a precedent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> An illegible note has arrived, but I believe that I have a translation, which I shall read.
<P>
Consent relates only to interference in—I shall have to ask for a translation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I can read the reverse of the note.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Hon. Members will understand why my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning is a Minister of State and I am merely a miserable Under-Secretary.
<P>
Consent relates only to interference with apparatus and so on. Underneath that on the note is written ``section 44, CAA, 82, para 4 here''. I shall rely on my own resources.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex said that the EU was not a member of Eurocontrol when the Civil Aviation Act was enacted in 1982. I understand that the basis of his problem relates to whether foreigners can compulsorily purchase land, so whether they are inside or outside the EU—

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> There is a germane difference between co-operation with other countries and qualified majority voting, which can override what the Government believe to be in our interests. If the Under-Secretary can assure me that Eurocontrol will not be able to plan an international air traffic control system or compel the CAA or the licence holder to acquire land, I should be happy. However, he has not yet done so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall return to the note.
<P>
Consent relates only to interference with apparatus, not to buying land for another purpose, such as a new airport, housing estate or Eurocontrol headquarters. It relates solely to apparatus essential for air traffic control. As a long stop, it requires the Secretary of State's approval. The Secretary of State may be a member of our party or of another party. He may be a Eurosceptic or a true believer, but whoever is Secretary of State will ultimately have power of approval. I do not consider that to be controversial, because it relates to the compulsory purchase of only that land necessary for the efficient functioning of air traffic control. I shall be surprised if it proves controversial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I am sorry to return to the matter; I see that you are becoming slightly scratchy, Mr. Gale. In all kindness, it was clear from the number of notes that have been sent recently that the Under-Secretary was not prepared to deal with the matter in detail. [Hon. Members: ``Oh!''] Perhaps I do the Minister an injustice; I apologise.
<P>
If the provision applied in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State would have to make the order himself. In the rest of the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State would simply authorise the licence holder to make a compulsory purchase. What makes us ill at ease is the fact that such compulsory purchase orders would not be made by a public authority. I ask the Minister to reflect on the fact that it might be better for the CAA to make a compulsory purchase—or, as in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I will certainly reflect on the matter. As for whether we spotted the fact that it would arouse the interest of hon. Members, we certainly did, as many people have witnessed. As soon as I saw the word ``Eurocontrol'', I knew exactly what would happen. That is why my notes say in bold letters
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``IF NEEDED—The reference to Eurocontrol is not new.''<P>

<P>
I know that phrase almost by heart. I shall certainly reflect on the matter. However, the Secretary of State is a public authority. If such an application should prove controversial, the buck will stop with him.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister tell the Committee whether there is anything untoward, unusual or unprecedented about the schedule?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It is not my job to say whether there is anything untoward about it, but precedents are numerous.
<P>
Schedule 5 gives statutory undertaker status to licence-holders. Statutory undertakers are persons or bodies authorised to undertake the provision of public services or utilities and to carry out works necessary in relation thereto. The CAA has statutory undertaker status for certain purposes under section 19 and schedule 2 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. Under that Act, and the powers given to statutory undertakers in certain other legalisation, that status is extended to the CAA—and, in practice, to NATS.
<P>
It is the same sort of authority that gives other statutory undertakers the right to dig up our roads without much reference to us. The provision is entirely precedented, and it seeks to preserve the status quo, as did the previous schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> Perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell us what other private companies have the role of a statutory undertaker. It seems to be something new. Those listed in the schedule are all public bodies, such as the Coal Authority. Can he give an example of a similar private company?

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the interests of encouraging or maintaining the United Kingdom's relations with another country or territory.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I look forward to understanding the thinking behind that proposal. I am assuming, Mr. Gale, that we shall discuss the whole clause when we discuss those amendments rather than repeat our arguments in a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let me make it abundantly clear. We do not debate starred amendments. Although the hon. Gentleman is right in so far as broader matters may be discussed in a stand part debate, whether at the beginning or the end of the clause, the individual starred amendments cannot be debated because they were tabled too late for them to be so debated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I fully understand the technicalities, Mr. Gale, and I am sure that the ingenuity of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh will allow him to debate the issues underlying the amendments without debating the amendments themselves.
<P>
The interesting thing about the clause is what it does not contain. First, there is no reference to any possible limitation on the Secretary of State's powers to give directions as a result of international obligations, which may include obligations that are enshrined in European Community law, and therefore enforceable under the European Communities Act 1972. Secondly, there is no authority in the interests of national security for the Secretary of State to direct the licence holder to relinquish the licence, and amendments Nos. 294 and 295 are intended to deal with those deficiencies.
<P>
I shall deal first with the matter of relinquishing the licence. We discussed it earlier and I tried to—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are in some difficulty, because we are currently debating amendment No. 294. The hon. Gentleman referred to amendment No. 295, which I shall call when we have dealt with amendment No. 294.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. Gale. I did not notice that the amendments were not grouped together. I shall, of course, discuss them separately.
<P>
When discussing what is the national interest, we must recognise that everything that Ministers do is circumscribed by European Community law, and that the European Community legal order and the powers of the European Community institutions are not circumscribed by anything that we at present have in our law. There is no evidence that the legal order or the legal powers of those institutions is diminishing. On the contrary, there is general consensus that they are expanding—as much by judicial activism of the European Court of Justice as by additional legal instruments that are passed into law through the processes of the institutions.
<P>
Under what circumstances does the Under-Secretary envisage giving directions as a matter of national security? I suggest a scenario that might dent the British Government's confidence in the licence holder's affairs if the licence holder were owned by a foreign company with divergent national interests at a time of national tension. There is strong anxiety in the United States about the relations of the French Government in the operation in Kosovo. It is now being openly discussed in Washington that intelligence matters sensitive to the alliance and to the conduct of affairs in that province were automatically passed to the Serbs. That is an accepted fact. The list of targets in Kosovo was known to the Serbs long before allied planes arrived to do the bombing: that information was passed on by the French Government.
<P>
Intelligence is obviously a matter of national interest. Our national security is very much bound up in intelligence matters with the United States. We would not have that relationship with America on intelligence matters if it thought that we were not watertight with regard to other European powers, because the US Government do not have the same intelligence relationship with them. Such matters as military air corridors and flight plans and the control of military aircraft movements during a national emergency, all of which are dealt with by the licence holder, are sensitive issues. They have been covered elsewhere, including in the licence, but they are secret and sensitive matters of national security which must be retained.
<P>
Let us suppose that the Government lost confidence in a French company in which the French Government had a large stake, because the French Government were acquiring intelligence information that the American Government did not want them to have. No one could deny that would be a matter of national security. Presumably it would be incumbent upon the Secretary of State to act, by giving the licence holder instructions to cease passing that information or to dispense with the people involved in the operation or, I hasten to add, by encouraging the licence holder to relinquish the licence because the very fact of that company's involvement with our computer systems and the information that they contained constituted a security risk.
<P>
How would that be treated by other member states that will now have acquired an interest in a pan-European air traffic control system through Eurocontrol and the EU's membership of it? I remind the Committee that the whole purpose of air traffic management is to ensure the safety of air transport, and that, through the EU's involvement with Eurocontrol, that competence has been acquired and cemented in place. Under article 71(c) of the treaty, transport safety is one of the objectives of the transport policy and is subject to qualified majority voting under article 80 of the new treaty. So these issues are clearly part of the European legal order. The legal base for European membership of Eurocontrol is article 300, so there is no question about the acquisition of those competencies.
<P>
It has been explained to me by those interested in the future of air traffic management in this country that the very purpose of agreement to these arrangements is to be able to tell the French military where its flying zone should be. At the moment, the French military takes a perverse pleasure in deciding where military no fly zones should be: one, on the French-Belgian border, is right in the flight path of major routes into Europe. It has been explained to me that one advantage of signing up to Eurocontrol and getting decisions made by qualified majority voting is that the French Government will no longer be able to stand in the way of these decisions affecting their military air space: the French military will have to comply.
<P>
It remains to be seen whether the French military complies with directions of that kind. It does not comply with much else; France is the worst member state in the European Union for complying with anything. I see that hon. Members gasp, but it is true. It remains to be seen what happens. The crucial point is that if our conception of national security does not concur with the EU's view of our obligations under the treaty, surely there are limitations, as prescribed by European Community law, on what the Secretary of State can do under this clause.
<P>
I do not know which Minister is dealing with this, but if I have strayed too far and he is no longer with me, I should be obliged if he would say so. If he is with me, we can conduct the argument on a sensible basis, but if he does not accept that there is a potential limitation as a result of European Community law, perhaps he would let me know. I take the silence to be assent.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It could be bewilderment, because the hon. Gentleman is straying a little wide of the amendment. Of course, that is not a matter for me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. No, it is not. I have been following the debate very carefully and, incredibly, the hon. Member for North Essex is in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Of course I defer to your interpretation of what the hon. Gentleman is saying, Mr. Gale, but he asked me whether I was with him and I have to say that I am not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman's reservation is entirely consonant with the fulsome assurances that his ministerial colleague gave earlier in our proceedings. I described them as words for eating and I wrote them in my book to see how they will stand the test of posterity.
<P>
The question is whether these matters of national security are immune from judicial activism in the European Court. The instant response might be that matters of national security and common and foreign security policy are in a separate pillar and are not justiciable, therefore they are protected. At the risk of detaining the Committee—I beg your indulgence, Mr. Gale—I shall demonstrate through precedent and court rulings on other matters that they are not. It will involve discussing sex discrimination in the armed forces, but it is strictly relevant and I shall go straight to the relevant quote.
<P>
The Government argued in the Sirdar case that who serves in the armed forces is a matter of national security and therefore not justiciable in the European Court of Justice. The ruling stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is for the Member States, which have to adopt appropriate measures to ensure their internal and external security''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
incidentally, it is interesting that judgments of the European Court of Justice refer only to public security or external and internal security; they never refer to national security because the court does not recognise national security of member states as a concept—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to take decisions on the organisation of their armed forces. It does not follow, however, that such decisions must fall entirely outside the scope of Community law.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The court lists four treaty provisions dealing with fundamental freedoms that are qualified by national security. They are article 36 on the free movement of goods; article 48 on the free movement of people; article 56, which deals with freedom of establishment; and finally article 223, from which I should like to quote. I am using the treaty that is in force rather than the newly numbered articles in the Amsterdam treaty. Article 223 is in part 6, the general and final provisions which qualify what has gone before in the treaty. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The provisions of this treaty shall not preclude the application of the following rules:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (a) No Member State shall be obliged to supply information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to the essential interests of its security;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (b) Any Member State may take such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of the essential interests of its security''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but that is qualified by—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which are connected with the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war materials''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That narrows the immunity considerably. The judgment explains:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is not possible to infer from those articles that there is inherent in the Treaty a general exception covering all measures taken for reasons of public security. To recognise the existence of such an exception, regardless of the specific requirements laid down by the Treaty might impair the binding nature of Community law and its uniform application''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a clear statement that matters of national security are justiciable by the European Court of Justice and, in this case, are subject to revision or limitation on grounds of sexual equality.
<P>
We are dealing with articles on transport, which are subject to qualified majority voting. When we discuss clause 49, we shall deal with freedom of establishment and free movement of capital. Ministers acting to protect what we regard as national security may encounter problems. A French company, for example, could seek to bring an action against the British Government, arguing that it has rights to exercise its commercial interests under treaty articles on freedom of capital and freedom of establishment. The French authorities would finish up asserting their rights through Community treaties at the expense of our national security.
<P>
Therefore, our amendment would help the Secretary of State to ensure that our national security is protected. It would protect any guidance or direction that he issues under the clause and gives him immunity under European Community law. We could get into a lengthy argument about whether such an amendment would be effective. I wish to avoid such an argument, but I am prepared to reconsider the amendment's wording. In this country, European Community law operates through section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. It is understood that subsequent Acts reflect the operation of the 1972 Act.
<P>
If the Bill expressly excluded the operation of that Act with regard to action taken by the Secretary of State on national security, our courts would have to recognise the sovereignty of Parliament and abide by Parliament's express intention that the Bill's provisions should not be overruled by European Community law. The Minister may argue that that would contravene EC law, but in matters of national security, surely, the Government should be paramount.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend.
<P>
A key issue is how the private company NATS will work with the Ministry of Defence. There is a joint committee and the director of airspace policy at the CAA deals with such matters.
<P>
Capacity is an important pressure point in relation to airspace policy. No doubt, the private sector will want more capacity and more aircraft, which will put pressure on the defence sector. Clause 38, I assume, deals with wartime emergency. In such circumstances, the Secretary of State—in this context, it may be the Secretary of State for Defence—may give directions to NATS that limit its capacity because there is insufficient airspace for Ministry of Defence aircraft.
<P>
Perhaps the Minister will confirm this, but I assume that national security can be considered as a form of emergency. The Secretary of State may have to direct NATS to allow an aircraft from the United States to pass through our airspace in an emergency. Capacity constraints are critical with any form of transport, but especially with air transport, so there is a pressure point. How sparingly will such measures be used? Will the Secretary of State for Defence be tempted to issue instructions that limit capacity, or are we simply talking of one-off or once-in-a-blue-moon events when the Secretary of State acts in response to an international situation?
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> The hon. Member for North Essex rightly said that we are coming to one of the most crucial provisions in the Bill. Indeed, he referred to some starred amendments that I have tabled. I emphasise that I would not dream of seeking to move them. It is worth saying that, when we discuss clause 81, we shall deal with the major powers that the Secretary of State will rightly take if hostilities, severe international tension or national emergencies are imminent. We are talking about the powers that may be taken and the direction that may be given in relation to national security.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I hope that the right hon. Gentleman would consider intelligence matters, rather than imminent war, to be low or relatively middle order national security issues
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> Yes, indeed. I do not dissent from any of the points that the hon. Gentleman has made. I shall give some examples, although I do not want to be alarmist. Frankly, the Committee would not do justice to the responsibility that the House has bestowed on us if we did not seek a proper explanation and understanding of what the Government have in mind. For example, if intelligence information were obtained to the effect that a plane might be carrying a bomb, or biological or chemical weapons, or a gang of armed terrorists, the Government and the security services would want to take immediate control of the air traffic control system. They might direct the plane to another airport, or perhaps keep it in the sky for as long as possible, to enable them to make preparations for when it lands.
<P>
Obviously, such things are well thought out in advance but, whatever plan the security services have in mind to protect us and to minimise or avoid damage, the clause is germane to such matters. Fortunately, such incidents are rare—long may that continue—but we cannot assume that they will not happen or that they will not become more frequent in future. It is important to understand what the Government envisage. I understand that in such circumstances, the provision would enable the Secretary of State to take immediate control of the air traffic control system and direct it to follow his instructions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. You will recall that you gave a clear ruling about possible changes of membership of the Committee. Can you advise the Committee on what will happen in light of the announcement that has just been made that one of the members of the Committee has just been promoted to the shadow Cabinet? I refer, of course, to the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo).
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Ah!
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am happy to be able to inform the hon. Gentleman that that is not a matter for the Chair; it is a matter for the Committee of Selection, which will no doubt reach its own conclusions in the appropriate manner.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> We are all grateful to the hon. Member for Bath for conveying that piece of information to the Committee. Certainly I was not aware of it. All these machinations in the Conservative party, although it is unlikely to gain power again in our lifetime, are nevertheless of interest to us.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There are a number of conversations going on. Dr. Strang is at the far end of the Committee Room. I am finding it quite difficult to hear. It would be helpful if, as requested earlier, hon. Members conduct their private conversations in the Corridor outside.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> As the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh was interested in the changes, he may be interested to know that the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) will no longer have responsibility for the matters that concern this Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Fascinating though that may be, it has very little bearing on the clause.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I am grateful for that advice, Mr. Gale. Obviously, we will have to wait and see whether there is a clear shift in the policies pursued by those on the Conservative Front Bench in the light of that change.
<P>
I am sorry that you have had difficulty in hearing me, Mr. Gale. I shall raise my voice level by a decibel or two to ensure that you can follow the arguments that I am seeking to put to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The admonition did not relate to you; it related to several other conversations taking place, which made it difficult to hear you.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
Under the clause the Secretary of State may give a direction in the interests of national security, but subsection (1)(b) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the interests of encouraging or maintaining the United Kingdom's relations with another country or territory.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not suggesting that that may not be practical or justified, but we want to know what the Government have in mind. Although some of the airlines that fly into airports such as Heathrow are privatised, many are owned by the state and are the flagship of the national government. That applies particularly to some of the developing countries.
<P>
A fundamental requirement of the air traffic control system, which must apply if and when the new arrangements come into place, is that air traffic control's impartiality must not be open to question. In other words, decisions about the order in which planes are brought in to land and the priority that they are given must be entirely fair and should not favour any airline because of the country that it belongs to. For example, it would not be acceptable, much as some of us might want it, for the air traffic control system to favour British Airways. It must provide an impartial, objective and independent service to planes on the basis of their case for an early landing slot.
<P>
What directions will the Secretary of State give to encourage the United Kingdom's relations with another country or territory? It seems a substantial power.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate that the right hon. Gentleman has a burning desire to discuss these issues, but that would be a stand part debate. We are debating amendment No. 294, which relates specifically to national security. I said that it was not in order for the right hon. Gentleman to speak to an amendment that has not been called.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. May I take it then that, although two amendments have been tabled to the clause, in order to allow the right hon. Gentleman to discuss this point, you will allow a stand part debate?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thought that I had already made it abundantly plain that at the moment we are debating amendment No. 294. When the hon. Gentleman introduced one of his amendments, I reminded him that we were only debating one of the amendments, not both. In due course, I shall call amendment No. 295. Depending on the nature of the discussion that has taken place, I shall, in due course, exercise the proper judgment of the Chairman on whether matters arising from the clause have been fully and thoroughly debated. I shall do that at the end of the debate, not now.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I am grateful for that excellent guidance. We need to ask questions about subsection (1)(b), and I shall do so when it is appropriate. I judge from your remarks, Mr. Gale, that that will be during the debate on the next amendment or during a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall start by dealing with the points made by the hon. Member for Poole. I can confirm that the clause does not relate to restriction of airspace for military purposes in peacetime. As the hon. Gentleman put it, we are considering blue-moon situations, or serious national security matters. Military aircraft are handled by the military air traffic operation, not NATS.
<P>
I shall restrict myself to some brief comments on amendment No. 294, which is based on a considerable misunderstanding. It might help if I were to explain why that is so. As the hon. Member for North Essex explained, it would provide that clause 38 would not be subject to any limitation imposed by EU membership. The Committee will be aware that the Secretary of State could not make a direction that was contrary to the UK's obligations as a member of the European Union. I do not think that the intention underlying hon. Gentleman's amendment is to encourage the Secretary of State to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am envisaging circumstances in which a national security issue required the Secretary of State to give a direction under the clause that might conflict with an obligation under European Community law. The Under-Secretary can have it two ways, but he cannot have it every way. He can say, ``If that happens, tant pis—it doesn't matter.'' Alternatively, he can say, ``It is never going to happen,'' because he cannot envisage circumstances in which it could. However, he cannot pretend that the Secretary of State has an untrammelled right to look after the national interest, as the clause does not give him that power. Does the Under-Secretary accept that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I do not, for reasons that may become clear in the next few sentences. As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows, national security and foreign relations fall within the competence of member states, not the European Union.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is not what the judgment says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Let me read on, as I also have a quote. The European Community declaration of competence in respect of matters covered by the Eurocontrol convention states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is emphasised that the Treaty''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the treaty of Rome—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``does not confer to the European Community competence with regard to the issues of national security and defence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is clear. I therefore find it hard to envisage circumstances in which the UK's membership of the European Community would interfere with the Secretary of State's ability to act in accordance with the interests of national security or foreign relations under this clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Was the Under-Secretary quoting from the Eurocontrol convention or the treaty? If he was quoting from the treaty, will he tell the Committee which article he was quoting from?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I do not have the precise reference, but I was quoting the European Community's declaration of competence in respect of matters covered by the Eurocontrol convention. I could probably find the reference if the hon. Gentleman would allow me a little time, and he could then go away and study it at leisure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I would be grateful for the exact reference, but I can help the hon. Gentleman. Declarations have no legal effect; it is the treaty articles that have supreme legal effect. If the court considers a treaty article against a mere declaration, the treaty article will win.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I understand that the immunity under the treaty provides adequate protection. The hon. Gentleman questions that, and he has made a good point. I cannot respond fully at the moment, but I shall study what he said and take further advice before returning to him. That is the best I can offer at the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> During an earlier debate, I said that it is proposed that article 133 be introduced into common commercial policies when the European Community has exclusive competence. Ministers have had a week in which to catch up with the issue, but they do not seem to be up to the mark. The Council of Aviation Ministers met last Friday with a view to signing up the European Union as a member of Eurocontrol. There are around four routes by which the EU is about to take control of the European skies. Senora Palacio has said that that is the intention.

<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>6.26 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we resume, it may be helpful for the Committee if I offer a little guidance, which, on reflection, I should have done at the beginning of the debate.
<P>
As hon. Members know, I am usually happy to accept a fairly wide-ranging debate where amendments are grouped at the beginning of a clause and it makes sense to have a stand part debate at that point. In this case, however, I have chosen to keep the amendments separate, because they cover specific, and very different, matters. Amendment No. 294 deals with the relationship with the European Community, while amendment No. 295 deals with the powers of the Secretary of State and the licence holder under security circumstances. The matters that the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh and others wish to raise are more properly dealt with in a broader clause stand part debate.
<P>
Although that is not a change of ruling, I had particular reasons for doing it. I took some time over my explanation in the hope that the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), who was on his feet, might return. Does another member of the Committee wish to catch my eye?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Member for North Essex asked me for a reference from the declaration of competence by the European Community in respect of matters covered by the Eurocontrol convention. It is a short document which covers less than two pages. The relevant part is section C(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is emphasised that the Treaty does not confer to the European Community competence with regard to the issues of national security and defence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The design and use of airspace for military purposes therefore fall outside the scope of the competence of the European Community. The hon. Gentleman suggested that European law could override ours. I cannot claim to be an expert in this area—I appreciate that they probably talk of little else in North Essex—but if the Commission went to court attempting to get power in that respect and the declaration which says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is emphasised that the Treaty does not confer to the European Community competence with regard to the issues of national security'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
were drawn to the court's attention, I am sure that it would be taken into account. I cannot imagine that the court would not consider that. I recognise that the hon. Gentleman raised an important point, and the matter is in the hands of our solicitors. I shall consider it, but I have difficulty believing that the court would overrule when faced with that unequivocal declaration.
<P>
We are not introducing anything new, as the Civil Aviation Act 1982 covers the matter. If there is a problem, and I cannot see that there is, it has existed for the past 17 years. I will reflect on those points further.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for the candid way in which the Under-Secretary dealt with the subject. To a degree, he is right. If my analysis is correct, the vulnerability has existed for the past 17 years, and possibly longer. That puts us in the same camp, because the European Court of Justice always interprets treaties to mean what they have always meant. The member states see each judgment as a further legal encroachment. That is known as the doctrine of the occupied field. As each encroachment is made, the member states have to put their hands up and say, ``Well, that's something else gone''. To a degree, however, the Under-Secretary is not right. The situation has changed in the past few days, because of the new competence acquired by European Community institutions that has been conferred by membership of Eurocontrol. I do not want to cover that ground again.
<P>
I did not bring chapter and verse examples of the court's having set aside declarations of the nature referred to by the Under-Secretary, but they are numerous. The most notable one caused the previous Government grief, and the present Home Secretary had to deal with its consequences. Lady Thatcher as Prime Minister accepted the assurance on border controls that nothing about the free movement of people would limit the right to deal with terrorism, drugs, drug trafficking, art theft and so forth. That declaration had no standing in law whatever and the Labour Government had to ensure that there was a treaty amendment to secure our right to check passports at points of entry.
<P>
We are in similar territory on this subject. I will enumerate and re-emphasise the judgment on the sex equality case. The judgment refers to derogations in the treaty in favour of national security. The second chapter of the treaty deals with the elimination of quantitative restrictions and provides in article 36 that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
note the lack of recognition of national security—member states will have the right to make prohibitions on import and export. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The company concerned would simply need to argue that it is carrying out trade. The question of national security protection would then fall to be adjudicated by the European Court of Justice. Similarly, under article 48, the right of free movement is subject to limitations on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. That right has been severely qualified in previous judgments. Article 56 is in the chapter about the right of establishment.
<P>
Whenever public security is referred to—it is not national security—it is heavily qualified with ample precedent. The provisions are tightly circumscribed and the national element of security is never recognised. The Under-Secretary should remember that his Department had to withdraw the golden share when selling Belfast port because of a restriction on the freedom of movement of capital, and no amount of pleading about national security could change that.
<P>
The Under-Secretary is on extremely shaky ground. When we come to article 49, he will find himself on even shakier ground. It is a curious situation. If the Government own a business, they can control it; but if that business is transferred into the private sector, they can no longer control it through those means. The court will look not at the bona fide intentions of the Under-Secretary if he exercises a direction under clause 38; it will look at the effect of that direction on the freedom of movement of people, the freedom of right of establishment and the freedom of movement of capital, and it will then decide whether it constituted a restriction.
<P>
I add one other point on national security. Why does the European Court never consider matters of national security? Why does the treaty not refer to a member state's national security? It is because the long-term objective is common foreign and security policy. Member states will have to do away with their predilections for national security, because they are a barrier to free trade in the single market, the development of the European Union, ever closer union and the rest. That is the long-term agenda. I can tell the Under-Secretary that the going will not get any easier, because the competences are all in one direction.
<P>
Lastly, Mr. Gale, a useful note was prepared for us by the Under-Secretary's officials. It was delivered to us yesterday evening with a letter address to your co-Chairman, Mr. Benton. It was about NATS and the protection of the public interest. All sorts of scenarios were mentioned, such as unwelcome takeovers and what would happen if the licence was removed, but there is no mention of the national security interest. That is because the officials know that that would be a reason for removing the licence. A dispute with a licence holder who happens to be owned by a foreign company will not be resolved in the Secretary of State's favour if the words ``national security'' are employed as the principle means of empowering the Secretary of State to do things. That paper dealt with issues of public interest, but it refers to national security only in the selection of a strategic partner, not with how to dispose of an unsatisfactory licensee. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has been candid, but he has not dealt with the points that I have made. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, but we shall return to this matter later.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 295, in page 24, line 23, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or (c) to relinquish the licence,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to the argument to which I referred—albeit mistakenly—earlier, and would allow the Secretary of State greater scope in giving directions to the licence holder. It would enable him to direct the licence holder to relinquish the licence in the interests of national security. There may be other ways of skinning that cat, but the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill)—I nearly said ``for Croydon'', which would have been a great mistake—did not say whether the Bill will allow the Secretary of State to remove the licence.
<P>
If the provisions on national security are to mean anything, it must be possible to remove the licence, so that it reverts to the Crown or an acceptable licence holder. The note that was circulated by Ministers makes it clear that national security will be a criterion of selection for the strategic partner, but what will happen if the strategic partner is taken over by a company that is incompatible with national security considerations? [Interruption.] The Minister for Housing and Planning is gesticulating at me, and I should be grateful if he or his colleague would enlighten me. If the Secretary of State is not given the power to remove the licence, we shall be caught in a cleft stick.
<P>
If the amendment is not accepted, directions given by the Secretary of State to the licence holder in the interests of national security may not be followed. They could be challenged under European Community law provisions, and the Secretary of State would be unable to revoke the licence in the interests of national security. One would expect him to have that power, but I doubt that he will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Subsection (3) will provide powers of direction for the Secretary of State to direct a licence holder to ensure that action is taken to fulfil an international obligation placed on the United Kingdom. The amendment would enable the Secretary of State to direct a licence holder to relinquish the licence altogether. I do not disagree with the sentiment behind the amendment, but the Government consider that the matter is covered elsewhere.
<P>
First, it should be recalled that a number of measures will be taken to ensure that the initial strategic partner is in all respects a fit and proper person to control the licence holder. He will be selected by reference to qualification criteria carefully established for the tender process. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman was referring to takeovers.
<P>
Secondly, the shareholders' agreement contains effective controls over the transfer by the strategic partner of its shares in NATS to a third party without the Government's prior written consent. Any breach of that restriction would result in compulsory transfer of the shares to another strategic partner or the Government. Those arrangements are underpinned by provisions in the articles of association of NATS, particularly the rights attaching to the special share, which ensure that no person may directly or indirectly own or control 15 per cent. or more of the voting shares in NATS.
<P>
Finally, under the licence conditions and schedules dealing with revocation—condition 19 and schedules 3 and 4 of the current draft—the Secretary of State must be notified of direct or indirect changes of control of a licensee, including acquisition of material over which he has influence. Failure to notify or where a change of control occurs despite a notice by the Secretary of State that the change of control would be against the interests of national security or relations with another Government are circumstances where the Secretary of State may revoke the licence. In those circumstances, I put it to the hon. Member for North Essex that the situation as outlined is perfectly well catered for in other parts of the legislation.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I guarantee what will happen under these circumstances: if the Minister tries at any time to exercise the powers he has just described and finds that he cannot, he will say that it is not a matter of national security and we will have to pretend that everything is all right. As we will show later on clause 49 and the articles of association, those provisions can also be challenged as being discriminatory or arbitrary restrictions on the power of foreign companies to invest, buy shares or, indeed, to take control. They will be considered as restrictions on the freedom of movement of capital. The Under-Secretary has probably been briefed on that subject. One of the reasons why clause 49 contains the provision for the Secretary of State to set a licence aside is that he is concerned that he might have to do so.
<P>
The Under-Secretary says that a licence can be revoked elsewhere, but not in the Bill. There is no power in the Bill, as far as I can see, for the Secretary of State to revoke or direct that the licence shall be relinquished on the ground of national security. It may be included: I thought that that is what he would say. Clause 38(3) reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) to do or not to do a particular thing in connection with anything authorised by the licence,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) to secure that a particular thing is done or not done in connection with anything authorised by the licence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I thought that the Under-Secretary would say that that itself gives the Secretary of State the power to instruct the licence holder to revoke the licence. Perhaps there is sufficient qualification that that power does not exist. But other things have to be wrong. There have to be other defaults for the Secretary of State to order the relinquishment of the licence.
<P>
If the Minister is so confident that the provisions exist, where is the harm in accepting the amendment? Surely even if he cannot envisage circumstances when the relinquishing of the licence might be required on the ground of national security, it would be a useful safeguard to have in the Bill and, moreover, one that should be protected from any interference by European law. I fail to understand why he does not want to accept the amendment. It would provide him with additional protection. I invite him to think about it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I find it hard to see the precise point that the hon. Gentleman is making. The situation is catered for, albeit not in the Bill. Power is provided to revoke a licence on national security grounds if ownership or control of the licence holder changes. There is no more general power to revoke for national security reasons. We cannot envisage a situation, other than the change of ownership or control, where it would be desirable or equitable to revoke the licence. If hon. Members have examples where it might be, let us hear them, we could then have a think about them. It is perfectly possible that a foreign company would purchase an interest in NATS, but that could happen only subject to all these safeguards that are written into the Bill at every level. I do not have, nor, do I suspect, do not have, nor do I suspect do members of the Committee or people throughout the country, the same fear of foreigners as the hon. Gentleman, even though he a civilised chap who no doubt speaks French as well as one or two other languages.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> And drinks champagne.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes.
<P>
I feel that, at the back of the argument, is the hon. Gentleman's obsession with Europe and the European Commission. Some of his points are valid, however, such as those that he raised about the previous amendment. If I am not mistaken, the dastardly French already own water in Essex and, so far, they do not seem to have poisoned it, unlike one or two of the English owners of water companies.
<P>
We must allow for the possibility that a foreign interest will not be inimical to national security, but should it turn out to be so, there are plenty of provisions in the Bill to deal with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is charming and is now making light of the points that I raised. Such action underlines the weakness of his case. He is asking us to accept that the vital provisions for national security should, in the final analysis, be trusted to an agreement in contract law and that they should be enforceable only in so far as they are written in a contract. That is not acceptable. The Secretary of State can consent to changes in the articles of association and the partnership agreement long after the Bill is collecting dust on the shelf.
<P>
Hon. Members should be entitled to ask that powers concerning national security are enshrined in statute. I cannot for the life of me understand why the hon. Gentleman does not want that to be the case. Of what he is afraid? It is unlike a Minister in this Government to be afraid of having a little too much power. The provision is in place to strengthen the hands of future Secretaries of State and to tie the hon. Gentleman's hands so that there can be no backsliding on the issue by a future Minister, who wishes to brush under the carpet a national security issue that he would rather not have aired on the Floor of the House. In all reasonableness, I cannot understand why the hon. Gentleman does not wish to accept the amendment. I shall not press it to a Division now, because it is another matter to which we shall return at on Report.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> One of the problems with the Bill, especially this clause, is that the Government are taking the Civil Aviation Act 1982, bashing it about a bit, and hoping to adjust it to the new circumstances that will exist in future. The trouble is that that does not work. We have the feeling that nothing will be really different when the Bill is enacted. Even the Under-Secretary said earlier that it maintained the status quo. However, when a whole raft of private shareholders and private money are introduced into an organisation, that will greatly change the situation, which is what worries me about clause 38.
<P>
We have dealt with national security but, under the Bill, the Secretary of State may give directions of a general character to a licence holder
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the interests of encouraging or maintaining the United Kingdom's relations with another country or territory.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Allowing the Secretary of State to encourage the United Kingdom's relations with another country or territory gives him a wide remit. It gives him carte blanche—I must stop using French words, although I am not anti-French; indeed, I believe that the company that produces the water that the Minister and I are drinking is owned by the French, and it does a perfectly good job. The clause will give the Secretary of State a wide remit.
<P>
In what circumstances might the Secretary of State want to direct a company in order to encourage relations with another country or territory? I am puzzled why he should want that power. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State must lay before each House of Parliament a copy of a direction''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
given under that provision. However, he need disclose it only if to do so would not be against the national security interests of this country. He need not disclose it if he feels that to do so might impinge on the UK's relations with another country or territory or on the commercial interests of any person. In such circumstances, what would the licence-holding company tell its shareholders? It could not tell them that it has been given a direction by the Secretary of State to encourage relations with a neighbouring country, such as the Republic of Ireland, for example.
<P>
Such a direction could have a profound commercial impact on a company's profitability. We have witnessed such sensitivity in the case of Railtrack, whose shares have fallen as a result of political interference, which has had a profound effect. It will also have a profound effect on how Railtrack will be able to finance what the Government want it to do. A company could be in the same boat in this case. The Secretary of State might give a direction to the licence holder that will have a profound effect on its profitability and the value of its shares, and it might not even be able to inform its shareholders.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Hexham, who raised some important points. As we have agreed throughout the debate on the clause, and as you, Mr. Gale, have implicitly acknowledged, this is a hugely important part of the Bill. I do not intend to repeat the points that I made earlier, but it would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could provide more information about the circumstances in which the Secretary of State would, on national security grounds, want to issue a direction and, in practice, take control of the system.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hexham said, the Secretary of State is taking the power to issue directions in the interests of encouraging the UK's relations with another country or territory. Obviously, we are all in favour of having good relations with other countries, but what do the Government have in mind in going as far as to give the Secretary of State power to issue a direction to achieve that objective?
<P>
Many carriers that use airports such as Heathrow are national carriers, owned by the state and considered to be a national flagship. It is vital that the new NATS is entirely independent and scrupulously fair in dealing with the different aircraft that enter our airspace, regardless of nationality or ownership. We should like more information about the circumstances in which the Secretary of State might issue directions relating to national security, and about the circumstances in which the Under-Secretary envisages that a direction will be given for the purposes of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``encouraging or maintaining the United Kingdom's relations with another country or territory.''<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Member for North Essex made the point that the Commission usually refers to public, not national, security—it does not acknowledge the existence of national security.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The European Court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Sorry, the European Court.
<P>
The declaration of competence to which I referred earlier refers to national security, but the hon. Gentleman is talking about the Court. It seems that Europeans are capable of recognising the concept of national security.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I reiterate that a declaration has no legal status whatever. European declarations have traditionally, down the ages, been sops thrown to Ministers who want to satisfy the troops back home. That is why national security is written into the declaration; it has absolutely no legal effect whatever.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I recall the hon. Gentleman saying that he would return to that matter, but I did not envisage that it would be so soon.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It was my fault, Mr. Gale—I tempted him down that road.
<P>
Perhaps it would be helpful if I made some general comments about the clause, which will address some of the points made. The power in the clause has, as far as I know, been used on only one occasion: during the Gulf war, to control the movement of aircraft in the interests of national security. The clause can be used at any time to give directions to the licence holder after consultation. Clause 81 provides the power to make directions in time of conflict to anyone and without prior consultation. The consultation envisaged by the clause does not have to be in writing and could be undertaken quickly, by telephone, if necessary.
<P>
I was asked for examples of where the power might be used. As I said, I know of only one example of where it has been used, but it might be used to require the licence holder to take initial precautions where there is thought to be an imminent threat of terrorist activity, to restrict the employment of foreign nationals in situations where they could have access to sensitive information, to require the licence holder to take extra steps to protect his operational premises to ensure the maintenance of the service and to require the licence holder to co-operate where the UK is providing assistance to a foreign power. That answers the question of the hon. Member for Hexham about the circumstances in which we might want to encourage maintaining relations with another country.
<P>
Another, different, example would be where a neighbouring country wanted help with its air traffic service provision, their own having completely collapsed. I can assure the Committee that the provisions in the clause, like other provisions, makes a presumption of openness.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> For the sake of argument, let us suppose that the Government thought it a good thing to help the Turks and Caicos Islands, for example, rebuild their air traffic control service. Could they, in the interests of creating good relations with those islands—and wanting, perhaps, to encourage them to start behaving themselves better—say that they would get the licence holder to run the service for them, at huge cost and inconvenience to the company?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As I said, the circumstances envisaged are where a neighbouring country's own system collapses, perhaps temporarily—not ones where we would be pursuing what might be regarded as a business opportunity. No doubt, one reason for the consultation would be so that representations could be made, which might well be on the lines of the points just made by the hon. Gentleman. The clause deals with emergency situations, short of outright war—which are catered for in clause 81.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> So, in effect, if there were a strike of air traffic controllers in a neighbouring state and we felt that it was in our national interest to supply air traffic controllers, we could give a direction to go and break a strike in the next-door country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> That is an interesting example. I suppose that it would boil down to whether the Secretary of State of the day thought that that was necessary in the interests of maintaining relations—who knows?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Let us suppose that British troops in Cyprus were involved in a renewal of the conflict there—in which Greece would of course be involved—and matters of national security were involved, and that European Community nationals were working in air traffic control. Is the hon. Gentleman sure that matters of national security could override the application of the free movement of workers throughout the European Community?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a genius. Wherever we go, he leads us back down the same path.
<P>
The Secretary of State has the power that we are conferring on him in the clause. It has been used only once in the nearly 20 years that it has existed. I have outlined half a dozen or more examples, one of which is to exclude foreign nationals if they are working in a sensitive area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Under-Secretary now answer the question that I asked him? Does he think that the clause would empower him to remove EC nationals who happened to be working for the licence holder? [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Streatham reminds me of something that Harold Wilson said—that he did not answer hypothetical questions. However, I am happy to answer it. It would be a matter for the Secretary of State and the Government of the day to decide what constituted—
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Of course it would—rather than try to set out in advance all the possible hypothetical situations in which it might apply. We are pushing the boat out a bit here. I have given half a dozen examples, which I think are enough. It is possible that the hon. Gentleman's old friend Eurocontrol might have an interest in the circumstances that he outlined. However, I do not want to set him off again, so I shall conclude on that note.
<P>
We need not make too much of a meal of the clause: it is obvious what it is for. I think that I have illustrated it to the best of my ability, but one cannot continue on into the undergrowth thinking of more and more unlikely examples.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On all three issues relating to the clause that have been raised with the Under-Secretary, he has found himself unable to answer the questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> To the hon. Gentleman's satisfaction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Under-Secretary has not even responded satisfactorily to his hon. Friend on the issue that was raised. It would look perverse if we objected to the inclusion of the clause in the Bill, as clearly the Bill must contain a clause of this nature, but I want to place on record how wholly unsatisfactory the Under-Secretary's answers have been, although he has delivered them with his characteristic charm and sincerity. I think that he would agree that his briefing on these fundamental questions of national security has been found wanting. As I said earlier, this is a clause that we will wish to discuss again and he may find these issues arising on later clauses.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 38 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 39 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
