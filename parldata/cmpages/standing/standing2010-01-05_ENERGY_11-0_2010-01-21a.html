<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000217"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I propose to add only a word or two to those
spoken by the hon. Member for Wealden on Tuesday. We have the same
general concern. The clause appears to be very broadly drawn, giving
significant discretion to Ministers. Therefore, the sensible thing is
for me, like the hon. Member for Wealden, to listen to the
Under-Secretary&#146;s response. However, we are very keen for the
Government to undertake to consider the objections from the Opposition
after the Committee stage and before Report, as they have done for
other matters. I am very happy, as I am sure the hon. Member for
Wealden and others would be, to meet after the Committee stage to
discuss disputed matters that may be capable of resolution or progress.
I hope, therefore, that the Under-Secretary will take note of the
significant concern about the clause. Clause 27 is the only remaining
clause that presents significant concern for the Opposition.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000218"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change
(Mr. David Kidney):</b> On Thursday, I promised to
write to all Committee members with some statistics that I presented to
the Committee on that day. The letter is in the process of being
written. I point out on the record that when I said a figure
of 40 per cent., I should have said 43 per cent., and when I
gave a figure of 870,000, I should have said
837,000.</div>

Disgraceful!
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="10012144000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000220"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I have not finished my mea culpa yet. Apparently,
my presentation of the tables was also infelicitous and the correct
interpretation of them will be set out in the letter, to put me and
hon. Members straight. I apologise for any error that I made in my
presentation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div><a name="10012144000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
27 will allow the Secretary of State to devise a scheme that will
adjust gas and/or electricity charges if he considers that a group of
customers of a particular energy supplier is being treated on less
favourable terms than another group of customers. The Secretary of
State will be able to define which group of customers the scheme
applies to&#151;whether gas, electricity or dual fuel, or a sub-group
of those customers&#151;as well as which charges are covered by the
scheme and how they will be calculated. The clause will ensure that the
Secretary of State has the power to address the type of unfair
discrimination, identified by Ofgem&#146;s probe into energy markets,
that exists in respect of the charges that suppliers imposed on
electricity-only customers and dual fuel customers.</div>
<a name="10012144000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Tuesday,
my hon. Friend the Minister of State and I endured many hours of debate
when Opposition Members criticised the effectiveness of the regulator
Ofgem and said that the Government should do more. Now we have come to
a clause where the Government propose to do more, and Opposition
Members still criticise. But then, whoever said that Opposition Members
had to be consistent in their
criticisms?</div><a name="10012144000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012144000221"></a><b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): I was not one of those who led
those criticisms. The issue at stake is that nobody knows when the
Minister will use his powers, or in what circumstances. What we need is
clarity. There needs to be an absolute degree of certainty among those
working in the industry about whether certain things will be acceptable
to either Ofgem or the Minister. There is a broad range of powers here,
but without the detail to understand exactly what is
intended.</div><a name="10012144000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000222"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> The powers are largely based on existing powers
found in sections 43A and 43B of the Electricity Act 1989 and sections
41A and 41B of the Gas Act 1986; they replace and expand on
those powers. In each of those sections, which have existed since the
Utilities Act 2000, the word &#147;considers&#148; appears in the
first subsection, as here in the present draft. What is new in the
clause appears in subsection (5), where the
words</div><a name="10012144000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(c)
electricity and gas
customers&#148;</div><a name="10012144000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">are
added to the categories that the Secretary of State can take into
account to discover whether there are disadvantaged customers. That
precisely covers the point, which I mentioned in my evidence to the
Committee, of a potential lacuna where people are dual fuel users with
the same supplier.</div>
<a name="10012144000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(7) caused some concern among Members, particularly the phrase
&#147;assumptions and calculations&#148;. That is new because of
the addition of dual fuel customers; it would not always be possible to
compare directly the charges being made between groups of customers
because of the interaction of their gas and electricity supply. That is
why the widening is required.</div>
<a name="10012144000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change
will ensure that the Secretary of State has a full suite of powers to
address price discrimination between electricity and/or gas customers.
It will mean that the Secretary of State will be able to address cases
where suppliers have cross-subsidised their gas businesses from their
electricity businesses, as a result of which electricity-only customers
have been charged more than can be objectively justified.</div>
<a name="10012144000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power is
intended as a reserve power. Ofgem has already introduced new licence
conditions to prohibit the kind of discrimination previously described,
and we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>are confident that this will mean that such practices will not be
repeated in future. The clause is still necessary to ensure that the
Secretary of State has powers to intervene should it become
necessary&#151;if, for example, Ofgem is unable to obtain the
necessary level of agreement from licence holders to allow it to
introduce or amend licence conditions to prevent future
discrimination.</div>
<a name="10012144000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wealden said that Ofgem does not have the same
relaxations, as he regarded them, as the Secretary of State has here.
Given that it is intended that the Secretary of State should step in,
usually after Ofgem has failed to take the necessary action, having
exercised its powers to investigate, the things that the hon. Gentleman
believes should be done will already have been done by Ofgem.</div>
<a name="10012144000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
address the issue around subsection (7) and the word
&#147;assumptions&#148;. First, it is restricted by its link to the
words &#147;and calculations&#148;. It is a formula to enable the
Secretary of State to make the necessary comparisons, to see whether
one group is disadvantaged compared with another. It is also restricted
by the opening words of the subsection: that it is</div>
<a name="10012144000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the
purposes of this
section&#148;</div><a name="10012144000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
no other purposes, that this ability of the Secretary of State
exists.</div>
<a name="10012144000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">More widely,
under the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989, the Secretary of
State has a duty to have regard to best regulatory practice in carrying
out his functions under the legislation. The duty requires him to have
regard to the principles under which regulatory activity should be
transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted only
at cases in which action is needed. Subsections (8) and (9) of clause
27 make it clear that the carrying out of the Secretary of
State&#146;s functions under the clause are covered by the better
regulation duty.</div>
<a name="10012144000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 29
requires the Secretary of State to give advance notice of any proposals
to make regulations under these powers and consider any representations
or objections raised with him. In line with the better regulation duty,
the Secretary of State would consult fully and complete an impact
assessment before any scheme to adjust charges could come into force.
When Sarah Harrison of Ofgem gave evidence on the point in answer to a
question from me, she made it clear that it was helpful to Ofgem, in
carrying out its duties in regulating the supplier companies, that this
reserve power should exist with the Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="10012144000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as the
suppliers are concerned, it makes sense for them to comply with Ofgem
in changing their licence conditions; if they did not, they would know
that the Secretary of State would step in with something much more
effective. In that sense, they would prefer to cling to nurse for fear
of something worse.</div>
<a name="10012144000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000223"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That was a good
coda.</div><a name="10012144000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
discussed the interrelationship between Ofgem and the Minister earlier
in Committee. In defence of those of us who were critical of Ofgem, I
should say that my criticism was not that there should not be a
Government role&#151;that has never been the criticism. In
opposition, one rightly criticises and probes to check that the powers
that a Bill gives to Ministers or regulators are clear and that we know
what we are getting. That was the burden of our song. We do not step
back from the points that we made last week on the inappropriate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>inclusion of Ofgem as an alternative in an earlier part of the Bill.
Ministerial powers can override and direct, but we need to know in
advance their extent, breadth and import, and to have as few variables
as possible.</div>
<a name="10012144000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000224"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I
remain concerned that this is a sloppy bit of the Bill. We have to
assess legislation against criteria to see whether it is appropriate.
The first criterion is need, and that has not been proven in the
Minister&#146;s argument so far. He talked about an existing power in
other areas under the 2000 Act and explained that it has never been
used, so, as I say, the need for the power is not
clear.</div><a name="10012144000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second criterion is urgency; we were told by the Minister of State that
only issues that were pressing were going to be incorporated in the
Bill, and we see no reason for urgency on this matter. I think that
Ofgem, in evidence, said that how much should be taken forward was not
its choice, that it was not appropriate that it should have a view on
the powers and that the Government should decide. Ofgem did not sense
the
urgency.</div><a name="10012144000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
is the power appropriate? That is not yet proven. The Under-Secretary
has done his best to defend his case, but we have significant doubts
about not only the powers that will be taken, but&#151;more
importantly&#151;the potential scope for confusion. He has an unclear
set of powers and it is not evident how those relate to the powers that
Ofgem has. Nevertheless, the clause is perhaps better discussed in
another place, where we have a raft of lawyers. Their lordships may
wish to return to it in due course.</div>

went to in the Speaker&#146;s House with another birthday boy as part
of the Chairman&#146;s Panel on Tuesday.</div>
<a name="10012144000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate is
about emissions performance standards. To which Minister should I
direct my comments? <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I thank the Minister of
State for raising her hand. The subject has significant importance not
only in the UK but across the EU and globally. It is not new; how we
deal with carbon emissions and regulate them has often been debated
generally and specifically in the context of coal-fired power stations.
I am conscious that last year there was a debate in Westminster Hall on
St. Patrick&#146;s
day.</div>
<a name="10012144000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coincidentally,
the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change made a statement
on St George&#146;s day, which was responded to by my hon. Friend the

am</div><a name="10012144000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
set out our view then, and have held to it, that industry must know
that the next generation of coal-fired power stations must have a
system in place from the beginning that captures the carbon and so does
not continue the dangerous effects of carbon emissions. The qualified
retrofit option is not good enough either in protecting our planet from
emissions or in giving certainty to the people developing the next
generation of coal-fired power stations. We have made it clear that we
do not believe that we should get rid of coal in this country as a
contributor to our power supplies, but it needs to be produced and used
in a way that does not create the harm it has in the
past.</div><a name="10012144000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

Under-Secretary of State for Energy 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 372</div>and Climate Change, the hon. Member for Stafford, responded. The burden
of his song was that it was a premature proposal for three reasons.
First, the Government had indicated that there would be an Energy Bill
in the coming Session. He was right about that and here we are.
Secondly, in the background there was ever-changing technology,
proposals and other matters. That is obviously true. Thirdly, there was
a consultation going on at that very time, so it would be premature not
to await the response to
it.</div><a name="10012144000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

reasonable.</div><a name="10012144000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000231"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Indeed. We are coming back to the matter at the
first available opportunity, obviously with the knowledge of my right
hon. Friend, and keen to pursue the matter.</div>
<a name="10012144000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before the
end of last year there was also the report of the estimable Committee
on Climate Change, &#147;Meeting Carbon Budgets - the need for a step
change&#148;, which we all take very seriously and value very
greatly. By any criterion Lord Turner and his colleagues do an
excellent job. They have made a significant contribution to the issue.
On page 134 of the report, talking about whether we can only rely on
the carbon price and so on, they say:</div>
<a name="10012144000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
our concerns we therefore recommend
that:</div><a name="10012144000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">Whether
CCS is deemed proven should not be judged only on the basis of the
carbon price. Rather it should be considered in the wider context of
power sector decarbonisation required both in the UK and
internationally, and on the basis of UK and international
evidence.</div>
<a name="10012144000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">To the extent
that retrofit might be considered desirable in this context but would
require additional support over and above what is likely to be provided
by the carbon price, investors should be given comfort now that a
mechanism would be introduced to provide this
support.</div><a name="10012144000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">Such
a mechanism should be introduced no later than 2016 to support roll-out
once the first demonstration plants become operational. Some decisions
on regulation and financing structure could be made in advance of this
date.</div><a name="10012144000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
Government should make it absolutely clear now that whether or not CCS
can be deemed economically viable any conventional coal plant still
operating unabated beyond the early 2020s would only generate for a
very limited number of hours. Such a statement should be complemented
by a review (e.g. in 2020) to determine the precise level and timing of
such a
limit.&#148;</div><a name="10012144000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is followed by a box entitled &#147;Potential power market
interventions&#148;, which describes three such interventions. The
first proposal, entitled &#147;Measures to strengthen the carbon
price signal&#148;, is to extend the exemption from the climate
change levy to all new low-carbon generators. It also suggests a second
option of a carbon price underpin. The second proposal, entitled
&#147;Measures to provide confidence over the price received by
low-carbon generation&#148;, suggests feed-in tariffs for low-carbon
technologies and tenders for low-carbon capacity. The final proposal,
under the heading &#147;Measures to ensure investment in low-carbon
capacity&#148;, suggests an emissions performance standard or a
low-carbon obligation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div><a name="10012144000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
focus on the emissions performance standard. The report
states:</div><a name="10012144000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
emissions performance standard would entail regulation to specify a
maximum emissions intensity (g/kWh) of generation. This could be
introduced at firm or installation
level.&#148;</div><a name="10012144000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had debates about what would be appropriate and the industry has
given evidence. It may be much easier to introduce the standard at
installation level than across all the plant run by a particular
company or consortium. I am willing to have that debate. I was grateful
to the Minister of State for her response to my question about whether
an emissions performance standard would be legal in European law and,
therefore, in British law. New clause 5, tabled by colleagues led by
the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), also argues for
an emissions performance standard, and the Conservative Front-Bench
team have also tabled a new
clause.</div><a name="10012144000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difference between the three options available is that new clause 1,
tabled by my hon. Friends and me, is considerably stronger. It
states:</div><a name="10012144000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State shall make provision by regulations for a carbon
emissions performance standard to set the maximum level of carbon
dioxide that may be emitted for each unit of output by any new coal
fired electricity generating
station&#148;,</div><a name="10012144000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that
that</div><a name="10012144000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall
come into effect immediately on passage of this Act and will be
progressively lowered so that new coal fired power stations will
produce no carbon emissions from
2020.&#148;</div><a name="10012144000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a clear position. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Ministers may
disagree, but it is clear and it gives a clear indication to the
industry a decade in advance, so there is no lack of notice. One of the
Ministers reminded us in an earlier debate that the Act will be enacted
two months after its passage. We believe that the emissions performance
standard should be introduced when the Act is enacted so that it can
come into effect this
year.</div><a name="10012144000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Next
in effectiveness, though much less effective and, in our view, not
effective enough, is new clause 5, tabled by six Labour colleagues led
by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South. The difference between it and
our new clause is that it offers no provision as to when the emissions
performance standard would come into operation. It
begins:</div><a name="10012144000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State shall make provision...to set the maximum level
or levels of carbon dioxide that may be
emitted&#148;.</div><a name="10012144000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to say that the standard should be reviewed</div>
<a name="10012144000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no less
frequently than every three
years.&#148;</div><a name="10012144000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
then sets out the issues that the review should take into account,
including the most up-to-date scientific knowledge and the advice of
the Committee on Climate
Change,</div><a name="10012144000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;particularly
in relation to carbon budgets, medium and long-term emission reduction
targets, and future emissions from the electricity generating
sector.&#148;</div><a name="10012144000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause also proposes that the standard must be
introduced</div><a name="10012144000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no
later than 12 months from the date on which this Act is
passed.&#148;</div><a name="10012144000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would start next year and would be reviewed every three years, but the
new clause does not have a specific date for
implementation.</div>

Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): Does not
subsection 3(a) in new clause 5 sum up the reason there is a real need
for flexibility? It says that the Secretary of State
must</div><a name="10012144000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;take
into account the most up-to-date scientific knowledge about climate
change&#148;.</div><a name="10012144000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over
the last six months there has been considerable doubt about the impact
of climate change, particularly the assumption that was made in the
inter-parliamentary computer model to the effect that rising amounts of
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> produced a similar rising amount of heat within the
atmosphere. That seems to be in some doubt.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000234"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Let me continue. The point is that scientific
evidence is in some doubt. We need some flexibility and that is why I
welcome the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark), rather than the firm new clause tabled by
the Liberal
Democrats.</div><a name="10012144000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000235"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Gentleman is beginning to address the new
clause tabled by his hon. Friends which I have not addressed yet. It is
the weakest of them all. He has put his position on the record. He
supports the weakest proposition. To put it bluntly, of course there
are climate change deniers. There are more of them, as far as I know,
in his party than in any of the other three parties represented in this
Committee. There appear to be a significant number both in the current
parliamentary Conservative party and among those selected to be
Conservative prospective parliamentary candidates.</div>
<a name="10012144000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, it
was distressing to discover&#151;from research done not by us but by
the Conservative party&#151;that of all the issues that were thought
to be important by its prospective parliamentary candidates at the
bottom of the list were two things: social housing and climate change.
That does not suggest that great new, radical,
environmental&#151;</div><a name="10012144000071"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000238"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I know. I am sorry to spoil the
Committee&#146;s fun, but this is really getting rather wide of new
clause
1.</div><a name="10012144000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000239"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I was just warming up, Mr. Atkinson. I
have been waiting to make this speech for at least three days. But I
have other opportunities in the
grid.</div><a name="10012144000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, from both his
personal knowledge and his knowledge as Chairman of the Science and
Technology Committee, may wish to tell us that there is not increasing
evidence to suggest that climate change is uncertain. That is certainly
not the advice given to the Government. It is certainly not the
Government&#146;s view. To their credit they are very clear about
this issue. Of course, people can naively think that because we are
having a cold winter it must mean that the evidence is
different.</div>
<a name="10012144000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
burden of scientific evidence, both from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change&#151;I have heard its chairman speak&#151;and our
Committee on Climate Change&#151;we have heard their chairman and
members 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>speak&#151;is that the evidence is clear. I also take the view in
politics that the precautionary principle is a good one and we should
seek to anticipate things that are dangerous and not wait until after
the event. I understand the position of the hon. Member for
Northampton, South. He is entitled to his position. I do not think that
it is supported by the science and this is a matter to which we will no
doubt return. I will observe your polite request, Mr.
Atkinson, not to stray too far into that debate
now.</div><a name="10012144000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
put two of the positions, I should like, to be fair, to put on the
record the third, which is the position of the Conservative party as
set out in new clause 2. Obviously the hon. Member for Wealden will
speak to his own new clause in a minute but it is only affair that I
address it. It
states:</div><a name="10012144000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by regulation introduce an Emissions Performance
Standard&#148;.</div><a name="10012144000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
then defines it. It does not say that the Secretary of State
&#147;shall&#148; do so, and it does not say when. It does not say
what the criteria will be and so on. I think that the hon. Gentleman
will accept that it leaves an option, but it is simply that. My hon.
Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and I think that that
needs to be tougher and clearer from the
beginning.</div>
<a name="10012144000190"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="10012144000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is, however, one major issue that I want to raise, as the Minister of
State may suspect. It concerns the legal context of these matters,
which is why I have questioned her in the past. Correspondence between
her Department and the European Commission on this matter has come into
my possession. I have a letter dated 16 June, written by her Department
and sent to Mr. Jos Delbeke, the deputy director general for
climate change and air, DG ENV 1, at the Commission, on the subject of
a proposed UK framework for the development of coal. That was a
perfectly courteous letter explaining the Government&#146;s position
after the announcement made by the Secretary of State in April. I will
not set it out in detail, but it starts by
saying:</div><a name="10012144000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are writing to update you on progress following recent announcements by
the UK government in Budget 2009 and subsequently on proposals for new
measures on coal and
CCS.&#148;</div><a name="10012144000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also have the reply to that letter, which I will put on the record. It
is a short letter from Mr. Jos Delbeke, who is a
long-standing European civil servant. The letter is headed:
&#147;Proposed UK framework for the development of clean
coal&#148;. It
states:</div><a name="10012144000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Thank
you for your letter of 16 June 2009, in which you lay out elements of
the proposed UK framework for the development of clean coal,
comprising, <i class="I">inter alia, </i>the following
measures:</div><a name="10012144000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">1.
Requiring any new coal power station in England and Wales to
demonstrate CCS on at least 300MW net (around 400MTW gross) of its
capacity; as is laid out in Chapter 4 Section 1 of the Consultation
paper on the framework issued on 17 June 2009, the intention is to
implement this requirement through the planning
legislation.</div><a name="10012144000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">2.
Requiring these power stations to retrofit CCS to their full capacity
once CCS has been technically and economically proven, and new power
stations to then be fully CCS from the
outset;</div><a name="10012144000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">3.
Exploring options that would deliver emission reductions from coal
power stations should CCS not be proven as quickly as expected. With
regard to the requirement under L, Chapter 4 of the Consultation Paper
on the proposed UK framework, issued 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>on 17 June 2009, lays out that the requirement should be implemented in
the first place through the planning legislation. Amongst other options
to ensure the monitoring and enforcement of this requirement, it is
proposed to introduce emission performance standards or caps for
individual plants through the Environment Agency's Environmental
Permitting
regime.</div><a name="10012144000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">You
have asked for DG ENV&#146;s views on these proposals. As you know,
Article 9(3), 3<span class="Sup">rd</span> subparagraph of Directive 2008/1/EC
concerning integrated pollution prevention and control stipulates
that:</div><a name="10012144000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;Where
emissions of a greenhouse gas from an installation are specified in
Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas
emission allowance trading within the Community (1) in relation to an
activity carried out in that installation, the permit shall not include
an emission limit value for direct emissions of that gas unless it is
necessary to ensure that no significant local pollution is
caused.&#146;</div><a name="10012144000184"></a><div class="hs_brev">DG
ENV takes the view that this would rule out the introduction of any
emission performance standard, cap or limit value for direct emissions
of CO2 falling under the definition of emission limit value set out in
Directive 2008/1/EC in the permits to operate installations covered by
Directives 2008/1/EC and 2003/87/EC. I am looking forward to a
continued dialogue on these issues in the coming months.</div>
<a name="10012144000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">Jos
Delbeke&#148;</div><a name="10012144000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key point, as the Minister will have heard in the penultimate
paragraph, is that</div>
<a name="10012144000186"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;DG
ENV takes the view that this would rule out the introduction of any
emission performance standard, cap or limit value for direct
emissions&#148;.</div><a name="10012144000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unsurprisingly,
I have some questions for the Minister. Given that the reply is dated
September, why did the Government not refer to the letter when they
published their coal policy on 9 November? What steps have the
Government taken since 9 November to ensure that their proposed policy
for coal will be exactly in line with the recommendations of the
Committee on Climate Change?</div>
<a name="10012144000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it enough,
given the correspondence that I have cited, for the UK to rely on its
own legal advice? The advice may be different from that given to and by
the Commission. What communication has there been between the lawyers
here and in Brussels? If the Government&#146;s legal advice is wrong,
it would still be possible, according to the Commission&#146;s
letter, to use the UK planning regime to do something about the
situation before it is too late. I accept that it would be possible to
plan in advance and say that emissions above a certain amount will not
be allowed as part of the planning
condition.</div><a name="10012144000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand from the Under-Secretary&#146;s response to the debate on
the private Member&#146;s Bill in July, and from other dialogue, that
the Government&#146;s contingency plan for an EPS option would be for
a CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions performance standard by way of a plant-level
cap. If that plan is found to be illegal under European Union law,
there would clearly be no way of controlling or reducing the
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions from any coal power station in the UK once it
had been granted consent. The Committee will therefore understand the
concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough
and I about the danger that people would be trying to close the stable
door after the horse had well and truly
bolted.</div><a name="10012144000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would also mean that the UK would not be able to follow the
recommendations of the Committee on Climate Change, which apply to both
new and existing coal power stations. A new station, such as the
proposed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>new plant in Kingsnorth, could emit 8 million tonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> a
year indefinitely. Without an emissions performance standard, and if
the Kingsnorth CCS project fails to meet the targets, the obligations
and duties created by the Climate Change Act, which this country, to
our credit, passed in 2008, would be rendered sterile and meaningless.
E.ON has said, on the record, that if there is to be an emissions
performance standard, it wants to know what it will be at the outset so
that it can make an investment decision. The Government, however, have
not done that. Why have they not made that indication? We know
E.ON&#146;s current position in the market and in relation to
Kingsnorth.</div><a name="10012144000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to us that a rolling review in 2018&#151;the position described
by Ministers the other day&#151;with the threat of an uncertain
regulation thereafter, creates more questions and problems than it
answers. That is our criticism of the new clause tabled by the hon.
Member for Nottingham, South. Although it has the support of some
reputable voluntary sector organisations, I think that they are
misguided about the new clause&#146;s logic. After extensive public
consultation, we still do not know what the appropriate conditions for
any new coal power stations will be. That is hopeless if we are trying
to plan the future of an industry into the decade beyond this
one.</div><a name="10012144000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rolling review is also a hanging axe that will deter much-needed
investment in new coal and CCS. That is clearly undesirable&#151;I
could be stronger about it&#151;especially when we now know that it
is considered technically possible for new, commercial coal power
stations, such as the Powerfuel 900 MW project at Hatfield, which has
been supported by the European Union, to capture 90 per
cent. of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions from the outset. We now know the
EU&#146;s view and that it had indicated it to the Government. Apart
from the questions about why we were not told of the Brussels position
earlier and why it is only coming to light now, is it the case&#151;I
hope it is, because, as the Minister of State knows, I respect her
greatly&#151;that the Government have been trying to ride two horses?
On the one hand, are they creating the impression here that they are
being tough and determined about the issue, knowing over the past few
months that the European Commission would not allow them to carry out
their proposed policy; and, on the other hand, have they been unwilling
to stand up and take on the Commission&#146;s position, which needs
to be challenged, on the issue? Ultimately, this might have to be taken
to the courts. We take the view that this is sufficiently important to
be taken, if necessary, to the European Court, so that the dispute
between a member state&#151;the United Kingdom&#151;and the
Commission can be resolved.</div>
<a name="10012144000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the UK is
to take the lead in Europe&#151;and I commend the Government for the
intention&#151;then it is necessary to take on the civil service or
the European Commission on this issue. I am an enthusiastic European,
but that does not mean I think every single decision or view the EC
takes is correct. I have never taken the view that there ought not to
be robust participation in the processes by member states.</div>
<a name="10012144000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The legal
problem of how to regulate CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions from coal power
stations in Britain must be resolved publicly, positively, urgently and
ideally&#151;I see no other opportunity before the general
election&#151;by this House in this Energy Bill, before consent is
granted to any new coal power station. This is not meant to be
provocative, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>but we face a general election and none of us knows the outcome. It is
theoretically possible that there could be a Conservative Government,
who will not be as tough on these things, in my view, as the present
Government have been or intend to be. I look to the Minister and her
colleagues to help those of us who have had a lifetime of concern on
these matters, to take an opportunity that may not come again before
the general election. In certain outcomes of the general election, the
opportunity to succeed may not come at all in the House of Commons,
even though the House of Lords will remain a balanced place, without
any party having an overall
majority.</div><a name="10012144000090"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000240"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> My hon. Friend makes an incredibly powerful and
important point about the juxtaposition of UK law and European law. In
the debate on the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill earlier
this week, the Conservative Front-Bench team proposed an amendment
that, following a Conservative Government coming to power in May, any
future change in competence in terms of European law would result in a
referendum in the UK. That is their position. In that debate I sought a
cast-iron guarantee; to be fair, the Conservative spokesman gave a
cast-iron
guarantee.</div><a name="10012144000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000241"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I remind you that this is an
intervention, not a
speech.</div><a name="10012144000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000242"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson. It is a very
important point. Does my hon. Friend agree that in those circumstances,
not only may we have a challenge in the European Court over this, which
could take three to five years, but we may also have a referendum in
the UK, which could put back the whole process for a
decade?</div><a name="10012144000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000243"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I agree. Although I was not in the Chamber, I was
able to see my hon. Friend&#146;s intervention as I followed that
part of the debate. I am keen to persuade the Government of what needs
to be done on this issue. We need to amend the Energy Bill, because it
is the last opportunity, to include a clause providing for emissions
performance standards. That is consistent with the Government view and
with what the Under-Secretary indicated might be possible when he
replied to my right hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber
in July. It is consistent with statements made by the Secretary of
State and the Minister of State, both in the House and written answers.
If we put into the Bill an emissions performance standard amendment or
new clause, we would take the initiative and then it would be up to the
European Commission if it wanted to take us on. We would get on with
that and the matter would be resolved speedily, and not hang over
everybody&#146;s head as an unresolved matter in the way that my hon.
Friend indicates.</div>
<a name="10012144000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view, on
these benches, is that new clause 1 is the only new clause exactly in
line with what the Committee on Climate Change has recommended. I defer
to its wisdom and expertise, as it is the best source of guidance in
the UK and was specifically set up, with all-party agreement, to
provide that guidance.</div>
<a name="10012144000191"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="10012144000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall make one last point. I am conscious that this is the month after
the difficulties of Copenhagen and the Copenhagen accord, and, by 31
January, countries have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>to lodge the steps that they are taking as annex 1 countries. I
unequivocally applaud the Government for the efforts taken, only the
other day, at the Council of Ministers&#151;I think that it was the
Secretary of State&#151;to get the EU to be more robust about
emissions. I have had personal conversations with the Secretary of
State and have encouraged him to be robust. I know that that was in his
mind. I am grateful and I hope that his efforts deliver and that
Baroness Ashton can assist that delivery in her new role, because it is
a foreign affairs as much as an energy and environmental
matter.</div><a name="10012144000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have an opportunity for the Government to show, not only in Council of
Ministers meetings in Spain, as that one was, or elsewhere, but also at
home in their legislative programme, that they are determined to do
something about carbon emissions. If we want the coal industry to
thrive, and to let investors know what to expect in the future and to
have a proper lead-time for investment planners, financiers and others
to know what they are working towards, we need to tell them the score
by the time that the Bill is on the statute
book.</div><a name="10012144000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that we will continue to take the lead after a disappointing
conference in Copenhagen. I know that Ministers want to be in the lead
position. Here is an opportunity for us to take political
responsibility. If we do not amend the Bill, either in Committee or on
Report, and introduce emissions performance standards, I fear that we
will once more be accused of letting the public down and ducking a
difficult decision. We are happy to work on the wording; we are not
precious about it. I know the difficulties. I am clear that if we are
in government, or sharing government, after the election, we will be
promoting the measure and will come back to the issue with the
objective of introducing emissions performance standards. That is our
aspiration. However, it is always better to grasp the opportunity when
it presents itself. We have a Bill; now is the opportunity and I urge
the Government to take it.</div>
<a name="10012144000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000244"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> We should start by recognising that most people in
this room are keen to have an emissions performance standard. Some
aspects of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech were almost seeking to
divide us into different categories, but, overwhelmingly, what binds us
together is the desire to see an emissions performance standard
introduced and formulated in a way that is right for Britain. That is
his party&#146;s policy and my party&#146;s policy, and Back
Benchers share that desire, as, I suspect from her comments and the
campaigns that she has run, does the Minister of State, even if she
cannot elucidate those views as openly as she might
wish.</div><a name="10012144000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
background to the new clauses is that we all recognise that new coal
plant must have carbon capture fitted to it from the outset and that if
we are to secure the investment that we want in clean coal, investors
need to know the framework under which they investing. An emissions
performance standard is not only an environmental issue but an
investment issue. It sets the framework within which company boards can
say, &#147;We understand what is expected of us and what we need to
do to meet deadlines to comply with the law&#148;. This, therefore,
is a positive measure and will facilitate new investment if formulated
in the right
way.</div><a name="10012144000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Emissions
from a coal-fired power station without carbon capture are around 900
grams of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> per kilowatt-hour, which is much higher than
the emissions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>from a gas plant. If carbon capture and storage is introduced on one
quarter of the plant, it will bring emissions down to 650-700 grams of
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>per kilowatt-hour and can bring it down dramatically
over
time.</div><a name="10012144000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned with the absolutist nature of new clause 1. It says
that</div>
<a name="10012144000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;new coal fired
power stations will produce no carbon emissions from
2020.&#148;</div><a name="10012144000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
there is a debate about what is meant by &#147;new&#148;. Does that
mean plant built from 2020 or plant built from when the Bill comes into
force, which is what the new clause refers to? There is potentially a
retrospective element, which companies might find hard to
accommodate.</div>
<a name="10012144000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is,
however, also a practical consideration. The goal of producing no
emissions whatever will be almost unattainable. The people with the
greatest expertise to whom I have spoken say that a plant with 100 per
cent. carbon capture and storage on a post-combustion basis would
probably get its emissions down to about 50 grams per
kilowatt-hour and perhaps slightly less, but it would certainly not be
zero.</div>
<a name="10012144000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will
also be times when the emissions are higher. For example, about a third
of the output of a plant will be needed to run the CCS facility. There
will be a period when the plant is starting up and it does not have the
power available to run the CCS facility. In those opening hours, there
will be high levels of emissions until the plant is running at full
capacity. Under the proposals made by the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey that would be illegal.</div>
<a name="10012144000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will
also be periods when, because of a very tight winter situation, we will
need every element of our generating capacity to work at full tilt. For
that period, and looking at the issue in terms of trying to control
emissions on an annual basis, there would be a case for saying,
&#147;We don&#146;t want you to run your CCS for a few hours,
because we need the extra capacity to keep the lights on.&#148; Under
the new clause, however, that would be illegal, and the lights would
have to go off, because the CCS facilities would have to be working at
all times to capture 100 per cent. of emissions.</div>
<a name="10012144000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
therefore practical issues that create a fundamental flaw, even though
I agree with the direction of travel. One has to imagine what will
happen in boardrooms in Essen, Spain and elsewhere, when executives sit
down to decide whether they want to invest in new clean-coal plant in
Britain. They will wonder whether they can, realistically, be
absolutely certain that they will be able to capture all the emissions
within a decade. They will say, &#147;We don&#146;t believe we can
commit to that yet, because the technology is not in place.&#148;
When we have an urgent need for new investment in new capacity, the
boards of companies based overseas will say that there are better
opportunities elsewhere and they will turn their minds away from the
UK.</div>
<a name="10012144000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
it is better to go for a permissive approach that gives the Secretary
of State powers to introduce an emissions performance standard. That
should be based on the science and on discussions with business and
industry so that we understand what is realistic from their
perspective. We do not want to kill the goose that lays the golden
eggs.</div>
<a name="10012144000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
good for the emissions side of things to have a completely perfect
emissions performance standard that could be met because no new plant
was built, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>that would be catastrophic for our security of energy supply. A balance
has to be struck in these discussions between security of supply and
carbon emissions. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause simply falls
on the wrong side of that balance.</div>
<a name="10012144000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
new clause 2 is the best proposal because it is the loosest, and the
direction of travel is clear. My colleagues and I have committed
ourselves to introducing an emissions performance standard if we are
given the chance to do so, but the detail should be finalised based on
the science and the industrial evidence. If that is not acceptable, we
are willing to look at the new clause tabled by a number of Labour Back
Benchers, but for the reasons that I have set out the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s new clause for the Liberal Democrats cannot balance
our climate change and security of supply
objectives.</div><a name="10012144000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012144000245"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): I do not want to repeat what has
been said, but I want to make a few brief points. In the Bill, we are
setting up the levy, which will put a considerable amount of money into
CCS. It will be reasonable for those who pay the bill to know what they
are getting for their money and that there will be a reduction in
emissions.</div>
<a name="10012144000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s framework for the development of coal says that
they wish to see all new coal-fired plants fitted with 100 per cent.
carbon capture and storage by 2025, but they have accepted that
measures could be introduced in the 2020s to address the issue of
emissions from new coal plants should there be difficulties with the
technology. The difficulty is that if we have new coal plants in the
meantime that are not fitted with CCS, the Government could come under
great pressure to back off from the emissions standard at that time,
for the simple reason that we could end up losing those plants and
having a gap in electricity supplies. I think we need to be careful of
that, and to address that matter now by making it clear that there will
be an emissions standard that companies will have to adhere
to.</div><a name="10012144000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also draw attention to what I think is a slight disconnect. We talked
about the proposals for gas CCS. The provisions of the national
planning statement relating to large combustion plants states that any
new plant must be carbon capture ready, and the company must be sure of
the technical feasibility of retrofitting the chosen carbon capture
technology. If not, the Infrastructure Planning Commission must refuse
planning permission for that plant. I very much doubt if anyone is
going to come forward with a large coal plant until such time as CCS
has been proven to work; obviously, that is the reason behind the
demonstrations&#151;to show that it will work. It is interesting that
although the Government were prepared to grant the new plant, for
example, at Kingsnorth, with only 20 per cent. of CCS, E.ON pulled
back. As a matter of interest, a similar thing happened at Hunterston
with DONG Energy, which is an indication of the potential difficulty.
It therefore seems that companies will, in the first instance, be
unwilling to commit to building new coal plants until they are sure
that CCS is coming online. It also seems that there will be a hiatus in
new coal plants as a result. Having said that, it is important that we
deal with the
matter.</div><a name="10012144000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point that has not been raised is how adding a requirement now could
act as a technological drive to develop CCS. Others have made the point
that in, for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div>example, the motor industry, it was a requirement for emissions
reduction that drove the technology for cleaner engines in motor cars.
If companies know that they must have CCS, and will not be allowed
plants otherwise, it may work as a driver to push the technology on and
get us there quicker than we might otherwise
do.</div><a name="10012144000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will support the principle of the ETS. I am also happy enough to
support the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for North Southwark
and Bermondsey, but I personally prefer new clause 5, which is a more
reasonable way to approach the matter and takes into account the
science as it develops along the
way.</div><a name="10012144000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000246"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> I do not want to repeat the points that have been
quite excellently made by the hon. Member for Angus, and indeed, by my
hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey in tabling
the new
clause.</div><a name="10012144000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wealden makes a very valid point about the new clause.
There is clearly room for negotiation on that clause&#151;he is
absolutely right in that. Not only in this Committee, but across most
of the House, there is a commitment to see an ETS scheme of some sort
in the Bill, as a clear statement of intent by this Government to carry
forward into the
future.</div>
<a name="10012144000192"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000247"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Joan
Ruddock):</b> The hon. Gentleman says that there is room for
negotiation on the new clause, but he and his colleagues tabled it
specifically to state that there should be no emissions. He knows, as I
do, that the best technology that we anticipate would enable us to
reduce emissions to 90 per cent. of what they would be if there was not
carbon capture and
storage.</div><a name="10012144000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000248"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> I take the rebuke from the hon. Lady, who is
passionately committed to much of what we are trying to do. It is the
duty of the Opposition, when we are examining and scrutinising a Bill,
to take up positions to allow the Committee to debate the extent to
which we are able to legislate. That is what we should be doing. The
Government do not always get it right. Neither do the Opposition
parties, but we are humble enough to accept that, even if the hon. Lady
is not. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> We are making huge
progress; perhaps the Prime Minister will learn from that
example&#151;or is that too much to ask?</div>
<a name="10012144000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wealden makes the point that having a plant running with
zero carbon would open up all sorts of different issues. We accept that
point and, in view of the comments that the Minister is about to make,
we will be happy if new proposals are brought forward on
Report.</div>
<a name="10012144000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
address the issue that the hon. Member for Northampton, South, raised.
He will expect me to speak on that subject, as it goes to the heart of
the matter. This is the first time that I have been a member of the
same Committee as him. He seems to be an incredibly reasonable man; I
am rather sad to see him in the climate change denial
group.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000249"></a>Mr.

to be as sure as we can be before we proceed to lock in such
regulations. That is all that I am arguing for. That seems eminently
sensible to me.</div>

Chairman:</b> Order. Before the hon. Member for Harrogate and
Knaresborough replies to that intervention, may I say that, now that he
has made his position clear, we do not want a debate on climate change
at this stage? We have a lot of new clauses to get through in a rather
short time. I know that it is tempting to comment on the subject, but I
would be grateful if the Committee were to stick more closely to the
new clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000251"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> The whole point of this debate, Mr.
Atkinson, is to discuss whether CO<span class="Sub">2</span> in the atmosphere
creates greater heat and thus a need for the technologies that we are
talking about. I am saying to the hon. Member for Northampton, South,
that there is absolutely no doubt whatever about the science.
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> multiplied by heat creates a rise in
temperature&#151;full stop. There is no doubt about it. Every
scientist can prove that very simply.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000252"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000253"></a>Mr.

<a name="10012144000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no

source. That, too, is scientifically and absolutely undeniable. If one
puts a heat source in with CO<span class="Sub">2</span><span class="Sub">, </span>there will be an
increase in heat. What cannot be proved, of course, is what the effect
of that heating will be on the earth&#146;s ecosystems. That is where
the modelling comes in. The model from the university of East Anglia,
to which the hon. Member for Northampton, South, referred, is but one
model, using one data set.</div>
<a name="10012144000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000256"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that
the debate is straying far from the subject. I ask him to return to the
new clause; otherwise, I shall have to be a little firmer with
him.</div><a name="10012144000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000257"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> I simply make the point that there is no doubt. We
are trying, in new clause 1, to get the Government to admit that it is
unacceptable for the Bill to leave Committee without an ETS proposal
having been included. Unless there is a clear timetable for Governments
to achieve those objectives, the industry will not have security, and
nor will we.</div>
<a name="10012144000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wealden made a vital point. What would happen if a company
built a plant without having a clear direction on emission standards?
The idea that, in two, three, five or 10 years, the Government would
say to it: &#147;Unless you meet the standards, we will close down
the plant&#148; is nonsense, for the very reasons that he gave about
the lights going out. Unless the standards are locked in at the
beginning of the system, and companies are given clear direction, we
will not achieve our objectives, and that is why new clause 1 must have
clear standards for the
future.</div><a name="10012144000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000258"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> New clauses 1, 2 and 5 seek to address an issue
that I think we all agree is critical: the decarbonisation of the UK
power sector. Specifically, they seek to introduce an emissions
performance standard 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div>to regulate carbon emissions from power stations. If the ultimate goal
of the new clauses is to reduce carbon emissions from our fossil fuel
power stations by as much, and as quickly, as is feasible, that is an
aspiration that we share fully. The Government are absolutely committed
to the fight against climate change, through actions both at home and
abroad, and I am pleased that that approach has been acknowledged by
the Opposition. The Climate Change Act 2008, and the system of
five-year carbon budgets, establish a legally binding trajectory
towards our UK target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80
per cent. by
2050.</div><a name="10012144000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
move to a low-carbon electricity system is critical to the delivery of
our climate goals and the Government&#146;s low-carbon transition
plan, which was published last summer and which sets out our
overarching strategy. Our approach considers both how we can use energy
more efficiently and how our energy is supplied. Emissions from the
power sector are already regulated through the emissions trading
system, which is at the heart of our domestic and EU efforts to tackle
climate
change.</div><a name="10012144000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have worked closely with the European Commission and member states to
significantly strengthen the scheme from phase 3&#151;which starts in
2013&#151;onwards. For example, there will now be a centralised
EU-wide cap, ensuring a more ambitious, certain and consistent approach
across the EU, and in the UK there will be 100 per cent. auctioning of
allowances to the power sector, which will ensure that the cost of
carbon is better integrated into business decisions. I draw those
matters to the Committee&#146;s attention advisedly, because they are
at the core of the strategy and we always have to consider any new
proposals, such as the emissions performance standard, in that context.
We recognise, however, that the EU emissions trading scheme is not
sufficient. We must, in parallel, take action to remove barriers to the
development and deployment of low-carbon technologies, namely new
nuclear, renewables and clean
coal.</div><a name="10012144000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we have said consistently, tackling emissions from coal is a priority.
Coal is the fuel with the highest carbon emissions, yet countries
across the globe are set to use increasing amounts for electricity
generation. That is why we are legislating in the Bill for a new CCS
incentive to support four demonstration projects. We have already put
in place the most environmentally ambitious package of policy measures
for clean coal of any country in the world.</div>
<a name="10012144000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We require
any new coal power station to demonstrate the full CCS
chain&#151;capture, transport and storage&#151;at a commercial
scale of around 400 MW of their output; that is a minimum. Requiring
that scale of CCS at this stage in the development of the technology is
ambitious and goes beyond the scale of most projects planned elsewhere,
but we believe that it is feasible. Modelling suggests that the carbon
emissions from a demonstration programme of the scale that we are
planning would be similar to those from the alternative gas generation
that would be
displaced.</div><a name="10012144000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will maintain a rolling review of progress as regards CCS technology
and, by 2018, will publish a report that considers the case for new
regulatory and financial measures to drive the move to clean coal. In
our public consultation, a common argument advanced by respondents was
that we first need to demonstrate CCS and develop a better
understanding of its potential. They were also concerned that the
introduction of an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div>EPS now, while uncertainty remains about CCS, would deter investment in
new power stations that would form the basis of demonstration plants.
That is clearly a very important
consideration.</div><a name="10012144000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also worth noting that an EPS is not the only option for reducing
emissions from coal power stations. In our consultation last year, we
included other options: a cap on carbon dioxide emissions from
individual coal power stations, allowing coal plants to emit up to a
specified amount of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> each year, over a number of years;
and a running hours limit on coal power stations. We also need to
remember that we expect coal power plants to retrofit CCS to their full
capacity by 2025, with the CCS incentive able to provide support. Such
measures will be looked at as part of the rolling
review.</div><a name="10012144000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000259"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I may be anticipating something that the Minister
is planning to say, but before she sits down will she ensure that she
gives the Government&#146;s view on the other two matters that were
part of the consultation&#151;the cap and the hours
limit?</div><a name="10012144000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000260"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman has asked me a lot of
questions, which I shall endeavour to answer in due
course.</div><a name="10012144000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to record that, as the hon. Gentleman said, the Committee on
Climate Change has also listed in its first report a number of options
to ensure that future power generation is low carbon. We do not have
the time at the moment to go into the detail of all of them, but
possible options included&#151;again, as the hon. Gentleman
mentioned&#151;a carbon price floor, which I imagine we shall discuss
later, a feed-in tariff and a low-carbon obligation, as well as an
emissions performance standard. The hon. Gentleman sought to bring the
support of the CCC to his new clause, but the fact is that the CCC has
set out a range of options and has not said that an EPS is the one way
forward.</div><a name="10012144000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the possible effects on issues such as security of supply and consumer
bills, considering the options carefully will be important before
deciding whether to implement any of them. In the same report, the CCC
recommended a review in around 2020, which should consider additional
regulation of emissions from coal power stations. As I said, it did not
suggest that an EPS was the only course&#151;or, indeed, that an EPS
should be introduced now.</div>
<a name="10012144000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
considered the full range of evidence submitted to us, including the
CCC&#146;s advice, and thought about the risks to investment raised
by the introduction of an EPS now. Having put those considerations
against the absolute global imperative of demonstrating CCS on a
commercial scale as soon as possible, we decided to commit to a review
of the regulatory framework for coal power stations by 2018. In line
with the CCC&#146;s advice, we have also clearly stated our
expectation that, with or without CCS, coal power stations will need to
reduce their emissions substantially if they are to continue operating
in the
2020s.</div><a name="10012144000193"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="10012144000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear that an EPS could be part of our emissions strategy in the
future, but implementation now would be premature. That does not mean
that we are being idle. We do ask ourselves whether we are doing
enough, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>which question I hope will be answered when we publish, in the spring,
the 2050 road map that will set out further pathways to a low-carbon
UK.</div><a name="10012144000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we know that the scale and pace of the change needed will test current
energy market arrangements, particularly those for the electricity
market, we are assessing in parallel the operation of the energy policy
and market framework, to ensure that it will deliver the investment
necessary for affordable and secure supplies of low-carbon energy. It
is too early to say what measures, if any, might be proposed as a
result of that work, but we will set out initial findings in this
year&#146;s
Budget.</div><a name="10012144000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 1 would introduce an emissions performance standard for new coal
power stations and defines a pathway that would require emissions to
fall to nothing by 2020. The hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey needs to come clean about the consequences of the new
clause: no emissions means no new coal. Without new coal power
stations, we would not be able to demonstrate CCS, and coal would not
be in the mix for the future. A coal power station is a long-term
investment. No company would invest if it knew that it would have to
close its station down within five years of starting, as would be the
effect of the new clause. As I said, no new coal power stations risks
no demonstration of CCS in the
UK.</div><a name="10012144000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
matters for several reasons. First, CCS has the potential to play a
critical global role in tackling climate change, and developed
countries must take a leadership role in driving the technology
forward. Secondly, fossil fuels play a vital role in providing us with
secure energy supplies in the UK, and CCS will enable that role to
continue. Through the demonstration programme, we will start to
establish the expertise and infrastructure needed to enable wider
roll-out of CCS as soon as possible. Finally, by acting early, we will
open up opportunities for UK businesses in a major future market,
sustaining between 30,000 and 60,000 jobs. I must say to the hon.
Gentleman that there is no way that new clause 1 could be
acceptable.</div><a name="10012144000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000261"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> To what extent are utility companies&#146;
total emissions across their activities limited under the national
allocation plan? To what extent will those companies&#146; future
investment choices be guided by their overall emission limits, as far
as the quantum of emissions is concerned, in order to stay in line with
their overall allocations and those that they will presumably have on a
title basis under future ETS arrangements?</div>
<a name="10012144000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000262"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> My hon. Friend, as always, makes an extremely
valid point. He is absolutely correct. That is why we must keep
reminding ourselves of the centrality of the EU ETS.</div>
<a name="10012144000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
clauses 2 and 5 envisage the introduction of an emissions performance
standard to restrict carbon dioxide emissions from all electricity
generation plant. New clause 2 takes a fairly broad-brush, enabling
approach, while new clause 5 gives Ministers less discretion over how
to proceed and requires a review every three years. Both the proposed
new clauses would not only create risks for investment in new coal but
could delay or deter investment in new gas
generation.</div><a name="10012144000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
expect and need significant investment in new gas power stations over
the next few years. About 18 GW, about a quarter of current electricity
capacity, is expected 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>to close over the next decade as environmental standards for coal and
oil power stations become more stringent and some nuclear plants close.
We expect this to be replaced by 20 GW of new capacity that is under
construction or has planning consent. But the fact that a project has
planning consent does not necessarily mean that it will be built. There
is a risk that the regulatory uncertainty created by new clauses 2 or 5
would cause investors to delay investment in new power stations that we
would otherwise expect to be constructed over the next few years. That
would pose risks to the security of our electricity
supply.</div><a name="10012144000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked a number of questions about the correspondence with the EU
and whether we could do what we told the Committee we would do. The
letter from the Commission only specifically refers to its view that an
emissions limit value in two particular kinds of permit is against EU
law; we believe that we can still use our legislation. More broadly,
the Committee should recall that member states have the power under the
EU treaties to go further than EU environmental legislation if they
deem it necessary to protect their own
environment.</div><a name="10012144000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked why we did not refer to the letter from the Commission. It
was because it was just one element of ongoing correspondence and we
have not accepted entirely what the Commission has said. We have
written again setting out our final policy and we await a response to
that. We do not think it is appropriate at this stage for us to be
picking a fight with the EU. We are confident in our own legal advice.
We need to continue with the programmes that we think are appropriate
and until we are told otherwise, we think the Commission may be content
with our proposals. If it is not, then it will be a matter for it to
take up
legally.</div><a name="10012144000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000263"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Will the Minister be kind enough to circulate the
remaining correspondence, either in that series or other relevant
correspondence, so that we can all see before Report what the position
is?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div><a name="10012144000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000264"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I shall certainly look at that request. As I have
indicated, we wrote to the Commission in November setting out our final
policy. So far, it has not objected. There is nothing more to circulate
at this stage, but the letter included references to our contingency
policy and the possibility of an EPS. I think I may have answered most
of the other questions.</div>
<a name="10012144000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
conclude by saying, once again, how committed the Government are to
meeting our climate change goals, including delivering the required
decarbonisation of the electricity supply. I do not believe that these
new clauses are necessary to further those
aims.</div><a name="10012144000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012144000265"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> We are coming near to the end of the first part of
today&#146;s proceedings. I am grateful to colleagues for their
considered and helpful response to this very important debate. It would
be unfair, given the number of other new clauses to be discussed during
the longer sitting later today, to deal with these new clauses at
length. But I should like to confirm that we are aware of the technical
points that the hon. Member for Wealden made; they were picked up by my
hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. If the Bill
were to have such a new clause&#151;and we think that it
should&#151;the point that one cannot get an absolutely perfect,
insulated, watertight, 100 per cent. guaranteed system would not be a
barrier to having a system that allows for that inevitable escape. So
that modification would need to be made.</div>
<a name="10012144000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also seems
important to make sure that, although it is less technical than
arguments about the timing of the implementation, the question about
having the capacity to increase the power supply from the coal-fired
power station sources should be addressed. Those issues will be
reflected in our decision about what we do with the new clause at the
end of my
contribution.</div><a name="10012144000194"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
