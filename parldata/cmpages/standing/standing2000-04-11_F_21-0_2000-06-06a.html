<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following Government amendments:

<P>
Nos. 370 to 374 and 376 to 379.

<P>
New clause 27-City academies.

<P>
New clause 29-City academies: land.

<P>
New clause 28-City colleges and academies: special educational needs.

<P>
New schedule 1-City academies: land.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> Thank you, Mr. Benton. May I welcome you back to the Committee, slightly unexpectedly.

<P>
I am pleased that hon. Members will now have had some time to consider the proposals in detail. Before we adjourned our discussion, I had given an account of the policy and outlined our proposed amendments to the Bill. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) remarked, I did so at considerable length and so I do not propose to cover that ground again this morning. However, I had only just begun my response to specific points raised in Committee, which I shall now address.

<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) suggested that our policy for city academies had come straight from the United States and been ``dumped into Britain''. I would quarrel with the use of that verb, but I would agree that there are certain parallels between city academies and the charter school movement in the United States. Both are a means of introducing innovation into the management and delivery of education in challenging areas, and they enable local partners to get directly involved in raising standards. We make no apologies for drawing on best practice from elsewhere because we need to extend diversity in the publicly funded sector.

<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the premise that I put forward in glowing terms; that this innovation has come straight from the charter school movement in the United States. For the benefit of the Committee, will the Minister quote one piece of empirical peer group research that demonstrates that the charter movement in the United States has been a success?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I would be very happy to write to the hon. Gentleman setting out the evidence for that, but I hope that on the basis of what I said at the previous sitting and what I shall say today, he will accept that there is a real need to introduce innovation into the most challenging areas. I hope that the hon. Gentleman would not disagree that, in many areas, despite the best efforts of teachers, the profession in general, educationalists and Governments, we have not succeeded in delivering the standard of education that children deserve. This move is intended to do that. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we must not cease in our quest to introduce innovation where new practices are required, and this is an effort to do just that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> If I could just pursue my point about charter schools, I shall then give way.

<P>
It is important to understand that we are not dumping practice from elsewhere into Britain, because city academies are different from charter schools. Whereas most charter schools constitute additional provision, city academies will replace existing publicly funded schools. That goes straight to the point of tackling a problem that must be tackled. In city academies, all teachers will be qualified, the national curriculum will be the starting point for teaching and the evidence of achievement tests will demonstrate and provide public assurance that city academies are effective. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, and hope that I have not jumped the gun on the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. On the description that will apply to those schools, will the city academies be independent or state schools?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> They will be state schools, as the hon. Gentleman knows. They will be publicly funded schools. We are trying to bring in partners from the private sector, from partnerships and from anyone with a stake in the local community to ensure that we deliver the standard of education that children need.

<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), who unfortunately is not in Committee this morning, questioned the place of city academies in the context of our fresh start policies. We are clear on the matter. The policy on the academies does not replace fresh start. The academies are to be seen as one of the fresh start options. Indeed, they are perhaps the most radical of those options.

<P>
We intend the wider range of specialisms to be available to city academies to replace existing provision and not to add surplus places. It is important to stress that the academies will have admission policies consistent with the codes of practice on admissions. They will be able to select up to 10 per cent. of their pupils on the basis of aptitude for the specialism, just like any maintained school with a specialism.

<P>
Funding for city academies will be the same as that given to schools maintained by a local education authority in the locality, and will be supplemented only by the per pupil grant given to specialist schools-currently £120 a pupil a year-and by a sum equivalent to the cost of services to the school that would otherwise be provided centrally by the LEA.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) asked about the payment of a management fee. There is no question of such a fee being paid in connection with the running of a city academy, and no question of anyone making profits. There will be no remuneration for sponsors or governors. Government grant will be given for the purpose of running the school.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> That is not what it says in the prospectus. It is a pity that we do not have a prospectus here. It is sad that this is a major issue yet the Government have not seen fit to put copies of the prospectus at the disposal of the Committee this morning. Copies have not been widely circulated either. According to the prospectus, a company operating on a for profit basis can apply to run a city academy. It would be taking a management fee-indirectly if not directly-from the state sector. Is that not so?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> May I clear up one thing? I am assured that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Department of Education and Employment, the Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks) sent, under a covering letter, copies of the prospectus to all members of the Committee. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough may like to confirm whether he received his copy. If he did not, I would be happy to send him another.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I did not receive that copy but have received one from the Department.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am glad that a copy got through in one form or another.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): That people will not take management fees or otherwise profit from the enterprise is an interesting concept. Is the arrangement not similar to the one that we have witnessed in the past 30 years with the growing professionalisation of housing associations? Those associations are certainly not for profit companies. However, professional people such as lawyers, accountants and architects have made a very fat living from the public housing association movement. Does the Minister see similarities between that situation and the possibilities the academies present? Such people will move in and suck the cream from state funding through their salaries, entitlements and professional fees. I do not wish to be over long on the point. There is a distinct possibility that yet another opportunity will arise for those people to get richer and richer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am afraid that my hon. Friends the Members for Wolverhampton, North-East and for Leeds, Central and the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough are under a misunderstanding. Of course we want participation from all interested partners, some of which may be companies that operate for profit. That is part of the conception of the city academies. However, that does not mean that they will operate to make a profit from the academies. The distinction is crucial. The same principle applies to a publicly funded school that buys its books from a private company that makes profits from selling textbooks-that company should not be forbidden from selling textbooks to such a school.

<P>
We will welcome participation from any interested parties, but they will not make profits from their involvement, as it will be a donation rather than a profit-making business activity. I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about that. The point is simple: we want interested parties to take part in a rescuing provision for the benefit of the pupils in the most challenging areas. Parties that have a contribution to make will be welcome, but that does not mean that we will pay them or that they should seek to profit from their involvement. That is not the purpose of the provisions. I can only repeat what I have said.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Can the Minister clarify the corporation tax status of such donations? If the company does not seek profit, how is the activity treated in its accounts?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I have no immediate answer to that question. I am not a tax expert and I shall have to write to the hon. Gentleman. We will have an answer for him in due course.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central wanted to know how we would proceed if a sponsor sought to establish a city academy but neither the local education authority nor the school wanted one. I hope that he will be reassured when I stress that the policy is about partnership, co-operation and agreement. We expect nearly all city academies to be established on the basis of agreement. I remind the Committee of the circumstances in which the academies will be set up. If neither the LEA nor the existing community school wants a new city academy to be established, we would be unlikely to proceed, for fairly obvious reasons. Only if it were clearly evident that the establishment of an academy was in the best interests of the pupils of the school would we take forward a proposal despite the formal opposition of the LEA and the school governing body.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilary Benn </B>(Leeds, Central): What factors would be taken into account in determining whether the proposal should go ahead in the face of opposition from the school or LEA? How would the judgment be made?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend would not expect me to set out a list of criteria. Obviously, judgment would have to be exercised in accordance with the particular circumstances. The Secretary of State must be able to exercise discretion in some instances, but I stress that we expect this to be rare rather than common. The basis of the city academies is partnership and co-operation, but I am sure that my hon. Friend, with all his experience of these matters, will recognise that the local education authority and the school governing body may not agree on the best way forward, for perfectly understandable and perhaps emotional reasons. If there is clear evidence-

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South) rose-

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am sorry, but I should like to finish my point before I give way.

<P>
The sort of criteria that will be used will be clear. For example, the availability of alternative provision is likely to be taken into account. Such decisions will be taken only when there is a clear failure of provision. That is the key point, because, as I have repeatedly said, only when such failure occurs will the need to proceed become apparent. Clearly, evidence of a lack of alternative provision is the sort of factor than my hon. Friend is looking for. In such circumstances, if an LEA opposes alternative provision and clings blindly to the status quo-

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for giving way. I have no wish to cut him off in full flow, especially as that flow has sharpened the point of my question. He will recall that my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central and other hon. Members expressed concerns in the previous sitting about the basis on which it would be deemed that a school had failed and the city academy provision would come into operation. Exceptional circumstances might cause that to happen without the support of the local education authority, but the grounds on which a school is deemed to have failed will be crucial. Will my hon. Friend reassure me that the issue of turnover and pupil mobility, which interests me and my hon. Friends the Members for Leeds, Central and for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), will not be regarded as a sole ground for closing a school and proceeding with a city academy? Teachers and governors of the school would see that as blaming the patient rather than the disease.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am happy to give that assurance. I know how important the issue is to my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) and for Leeds, Central. I was going to address that point specifically. We will take account of particular circumstances. Of course we recognise that higher than average mobility can affect the ability of schools to reach targets. I hope my hon. Friends accept that it is important for pupils that we set benchmark targets. They will be interpreted in light of particular circumstances, and high turnover and mobility will be taken into account. There is no question of penalising schools arbitrarily or getting into the situation that my hon. Friend described.

<P>
We are concerned about circumstances in which alternative provision has failed children, and there is a clear need for innovation to introduce best practice and fresh thoughts from elsewhere. That is the only reason for the measures. We decided that there was a clear need to act, which is why they were introduced with such urgency just before the recess. There is no question of arbitrarily victimising schools for circumstances that are outside their control. A city academy that did not have proposals for dealing with such issues would also fail. I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friends.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have a number of additional questions but, while the Minister is on this specific point, will he say who in the first instance will identify a school as failing? Will the would-be promoters of an alternative school go to the Secretary of State and say, ``Here is a failing school. We want to take it over'', or will the Secretary of State say, ``This is a failing school and we are looking for people to take it over''?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am intrigued by the notion of an entrepreneur stepping in to close down a school. That will not happen. We will make a judgment according to criteria. Although that will include GCSE results, they will not on their own be a sufficient cause for closure. Obviously, the Secretary of State will make the decision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister seems a bit surprised by my suggestion, but it is implied on page 11 of the prospectus, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Promoters may have a particular location or even school in mind, or they may wish to talk to DfEE or other partners about a suitable location.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am not sure why that conflicts with what I have said.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way; it enables me to make my points absolutely clear. Will promoters go to the Secretary of State and say, ``Here is a school which we think is failing. We want to do something about it'', or will the Secretary of State in the first instance say, ``We have identified this school as failing and we are looking for people to come forward''? There is a difference. Which of those will apply?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> My understanding is that it will be the second option. The Secretary of State will make the decision. We shall then invite interested partners to make proposals where appropriate. I hope that we can now make progress.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> The matter that we are considering is entirely new. All I know is what has been in the press. I am grateful that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary professes not to be a tax expert. If I came across one more tax expert in this place I would have had it.

<P>
If we are not careful, the unintended consequences of a policy that has not been thoroughly debated and thought through will, in the end, do for a scheme or initiative such as we are considering. My hon. Friend has spoken of fresh thoughts, but where are they? What is happening? Why are not those fresh thoughts coming into schools? I shall not say ``failing schools''. I do not use the term, as I have never come across one. Is it not good management practice to tackle weaknesses, rather than to walk round them, which inevitably expends more and more resources on dwindling results? The right thing to do is to tackle the perceived or real problem.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is right in all that he says. However, I am not sure why any of it should conflict with the idea of city academies. I return again to the point that sometimes all existing mechanisms just do not work. Wonderful fresh ideas are coming to our schools all the time from teachers, educationists and academics. Best practice is employed all over the country. I pay tribute to the many schools in difficult areas that are doing a wonderful job in tackling difficult and intractable problems on behalf of children who have no other opportunities in life. However, the brutal and uncomfortable fact remains that some schools are not doing those things. We are left with a simple choice. We can carry on doing exactly as we are doing now, using the same mechanisms, or we can decide to be realistic and admit that, although great progress has been made in many respects, new mechanisms may need to be considered in a certain context. Sometimes new mechanisms trigger new approaches, insights or thoughts. History tells us that that is often so, although not always-I do not want to make grandiose claims. We should be failing in our duty if we did not explore every single avenue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> Explore them in the private sector, not the public. Attack privilege, not ordinary people.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We must explore-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Minister that remarks must be addressed to the Chair.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I stand corrected, Mr. Benton. I wanted to respond to my hon. Friend's welcome reminder that we must of course attack privilege. One of the best ways to do that is by extending opportunity-and the way to do that is to give every child in the most difficult areas the benefits of a proper education. Some of them are not receiving one, which is the reason for our approach. It is not the only option, but it is a weapon that we should have.

<P>
Before the recess my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central asked why we would allow sponsors with no direct education experience to make proposals for city academies. Clearly, we expect any potential sponsors to have a considerable interest in the problems of failing schools in deprived areas. They will have to put up large sums of money to demonstrate that interest. Some potential sponsors, such as the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church, have substantial experience of providing education. Organisations, companies and even individuals with a substantial interest in the problems of the inner city can find partners with education experience to join them in their proposals. What matters is the ability of the sponsor and the partners to make out a convincing case showing how they will transform the educational experience of inner-city children in a school. The city academy prospectus sets out the areas in which sponsors will have to demonstrate competence with respect to their proposals.

<P>
I hope that I have dealt with all the matters raised by hon. Members in our earlier discussion. I recognise the Committee's concerns and share the sentiments of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) about the importance of getting this legislation right. We hope that we have done that. We have taken careful account of all that has been said in Committee and shall continue to do so. I hope that what I have said today has gone some way towards allaying the Committee's concerns. On the basis of what I have said, and having had a little time to reflect on the proposals, I hope that Committee members will agree that city academies will offer valuable and much needed help to children in inner cities.

<P>
The hon. Members for Harrogate and Knaresborough and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) tabled an amendment to Government new clause 27 that would have provided that any arrangement to establish a city academy could not be made without prior consultation with the relevant local education authority. Although that amendment has not been selected for discussion today, I am happy to give the Committee my assurance that we have no intention of making any such arrangement without prior consultation with the LEA. Indeed, such consultation would be seen as a necessary starting point to any discussions about establishing a city academy. The Government will consider tabling an amendment to that effect on Report.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I did not speak in the debate on Thursday 25 May. I had been in the Liaison Committee for the earlier part of the morning and returned to Committee to find that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), had launched the debate and a full-scale row was rapidly developing. I raised the timing of those arrangements in a point of order, but that was my only contribution because it seemed sensible to keep one's head down. However, due to the Government's wisdom, the debate was carried over to after the recess, so I now have an opportunity to say a word or two.

<P>
On a previous occasion when I said that I was unusual, there were cries of ``Hear, hear'' in Committee. I also have a somewhat unusual inner city constituency. The European Union's calculation that the area of central London, which mostly falls within my constituency, is the richest area in the whole of the EU is a fallacious statistic because it reflects wealth generated not wealth earned. Wealth is generated by people who live in the home counties, but it appears in the statistics as if it relates to the centre of London. That figure is then divided by the number of residents, so it is a case of apples and pears. However, with that disclaimer about the actual amount of wealth in my constituency. I can also say that, in the ESRC list of the 659 constituencies in the country, which is calculated in order of poverty and reflects the proportion of households in the constituency that satisfy the standard poverty criteria, my constituency is the 48th poorest. In that respect, it is a characteristic inner city seat. I am sure that, by those criteria, mine is the poorest Conservative constituency in the country, and I suspect that my constituency is the only Conservative seat in the top 100. Therefore, I have an interest in the measures being introduced by the Government because any MPs with inner-city constituencies must cope with the problems that poverty in those areas can cause in the education system.

<P>
The hon. Member for Leeds, Central, who, I acknowledge, has an even more characteristic inner-city constituency than my own, raised the question of why outside bodies or sponsors without correct educational experience would want to become involved in city academies. There has already been some evidence of that from city technology colleges, but the behaviour of the livery companies in the City of London during the previous century is a classic example. From a standing start, they became massively involved in all areas of education both inside and outside London. As I have remarked previously, the hon. Member for Croydon, North and I are the only London Members in the Committee. I enjoyed a long and fruitful relationship with Peter Newsam, who was education officer of the Inner London education authority almost until its abolition. For a variety of reasons, going back to the 1970s, my noble mother, who was chairman of Godolphin and Latimer school, decided to take that school independent. It became the only voluntarily aided direct grant girls' school to go independent. Peter Newsam disagreed with my mother and was engaged in opposition to that process, but he was gracious enough to acknowledge to me privately, much later, that my mother had made the right decision.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The abolition of ILEA was not initiated by the then Government, but by a Back Bench amendment tabled by Lord Tebbit and my right hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine). They were unusual proposers of a Back Bench amendment, although it was, in the event, successful and effective. At the time, Peter Newsam told me that his concern about the abolition-it was perfectly right for him to be concerned-was that a significant number of London boroughs would find it difficult to cope with the educational challenge that would be set and which would come from a background in which ILEA had been the education authority for many years. I do not want to dwell on the subject, but I should point out that subsequent events demonstrated that a number of those boroughs had to pay a price. I am not seeking to make a party-political point; indeed, we all know about the problems that have arisen during the past 10 years, which are an added reason for showing interest in the Government amendments.

<P>
The Minister and other hon. Members have already dwelt on the likeness and, indeed, the unlikeness between city academies and city technology colleges. I do not want to spend any more time on the matter, but, in the light of observations by Ministers on various occasions in the Committee about the previous 18 years, I should remind hon. Members that the city technology colleges were an initiative and were, therefore, a harbinger for what the Government are now proposing.

<P>
In 1984 or 1985, Michael Posner, the then chairman of the Economic and Social Research Council, left that organisation to go to the Science Foundation in Strasbourg. Incidentally, he was not wholly persona grata to the late Sir Keith Joseph, his Secretary of State, and was appointed under the Labour Administration. As I was his directly junior Minister, I thought it only courteous to give him a farewell. I took him out to dinner at my own expense, and we had an extremely interesting conversation about his time. I recall vividly hearing him say that those who were engaged in the intellectual engine room of the Labour party in 1975, when Mrs Thatcher, as she then was, became leader of the Conservative party, would never have believed the extent to which the Conservative party moved the intellectual goalposts during the 10 years between 1975 and 1985, in a wholly dramatic manner. It is a compliment-albeit an indirect one-from the present Administration to embark on the introduction of city academies in the aftermath of city technology colleges, which were introduced by the previous Government.

<P>
I must confess that I share the misgivings and anxieties that have been expressed from the Opposition Front Bench and by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about the manner in which the changes are being made. I understand the timing and that there is this window of opportunity, and that Ministers want to get the legislation on to the statute book at the earliest possible stage. Indeed, the Minister made that point at our sitting on 25 May. Speaking personally, and with the promise that I shall be brief, I must say that it is a little surprising that the whole of the health service is being revised on the hoof in the middle of Parliament, without any apparent preparation for what is a fairly massive exercise. In the same way, and on a modest scale, I am a little surprised-I will not put it more highly than that-that, despite the Secretary of State's speech to the Social Market Foundation on 15 March, the decision on what would become Government policy was not taken until Friday 19 May. The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Croydon, North, sent a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry on 23 May. We gathered to discuss the matter on Thursday 25 May. I am conscious that Whips may not speak, so I am hesitant to suggest that they were not wholly prepared for what happened on that day, even though the Government had taken the decision by that stage to go ahead.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sure that it will have occurred to my right hon. Friend that their Lordships, in whose House the Bill was introduced, may also wish to take an interest in the proposals. They have not even seen them yet, and may regard the fact that the matter was touched on in this House and fed back to them as amendments as blackening their reputation. That way of proceeding seems odd.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My hon. Friend reinforces the general point about the manner in which the matter has been conducted. Thinking of reasons for not doing something is a British characteristic that, on the whole, I am pleased to see ignored by those engaged in policy. Pont of Punch, who produced that great series of drawings of British character, would have found it difficult to illustrate that British characteristic. I do not think that he ever did such a drawing. I do not wholly come out against the Government for wanting to push matters forward. I am an inner-city Member. I understand the issues raised by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East; it is difficult to get matters right when they are conducted in such a way.

<P>
I do not want to be unduly critical of the Minister, who has brought the issues before us. However, I must say from the experience that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and I share of being junior Ministers in the old Department, that I cannot help being surprised that the Minister's full briefing for the new clauses introduced on Thursday was given to him on the Wednesday although the Government decision to go forward with the policy had been taken the previous Friday. The late Sir Keith Joseph was unusual, but our problem with him was that we would have been on the battlements at Elsinore for month after month while we paced up and down deciding what to do.

<P>
The Minister must have played a part in the decision on what should become Government policy, not least because he would move amendments in Committee. As far as I can gather, he appears to have been able to decide what would become Government policy without having received a full briefing on it. The point was emphasised for me again today. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, whom I am rapidly coming to think of as an hon. Friend, asked for factual evidence of the success of the charter schools movement in the United States. Even with an extra 12 days of swatting up time during the recess, the Minister was not able to provide the information.

<P>
We are where we are and must make the best fist of the situation. Without wishing to incriminate the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, I share his misgivings that we will put the policy on to the statute book despite the fact that there has been insufficient time for the House to scrutinise it and for the Government to prepare for the exercise.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thank the Minister again for his courtesy in accepting some of the deficiencies in the Government's performance, if not in his own. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) alluded to matters on which there could have been greater support for the Minister. I also thank him for accepting the premise for our starred amendment and for agreeing to table an amendment on Report to address the issue of the relationships and consultation with local education authorities.

<P>
Liberal Democrats strongly believe that we cannot allow underperformance, wherever it exists, to go unchallenged. We are at one with the Government and, I hope, with Conservative Members, in saying that. We have grave misgivings, however, about the way in which the Government have gone about this exercise.

<P>
Let us consider the way in which the Government have addressed underachievement in schools during the three years in which they have been in power. They inherited a massive legacy of underachievement, and I applaud them for bringing it to the fore. Underachievement is to be found not only in schools, but in the performance of the post-16 sector and in higher education, although one would doubt the wisdom of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's attack on elitism as a way to address the problem.

<P>
The Committee considering the School Standards and Framework Bill in 1998 had new initiatives thrust upon it at short notice. At that time, education action zones were to be our salvation: they would bring people together, the private sector would arrive on its chariots and underperforming schools would suddenly be taken out of themselves and become successful. We have had no evaluation of education action zones; no single piece of research has been undertaken to show whether they have been successful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to stress the need to make an evaluation of the education action zones initiative. As this is germane to the point that the Minister made about partnership and co-operation, does he accept that education action zones were a valuable initiative, factually and philosophically, in meeting the Government's commitment to encouraging schools in a specific location to co-operate, as opposed to the divisive grant maintained schools initiative that the previous Government initiated?

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am happy to concur with the hon. Gentleman, but if he feels that there is a significant difference between the GM movement and what is being proposed today, I should explain that, in reality, there is little difference. The previous regime created competition between schools. The right hon. Gentleman did not allude to Sir Keith Joseph's philosophy that competition and market forces were the solution to all Britain's problems, and that has not been the case. Education action zones and the specialist schools that were created were dumped on us. We had to respond to them without a debate on the Floor of the House or a proper evaluation of them. It was simply a matter of ``Now you will respond to that and we will put it in place.''

<P>
In Committee and on Report and Third Reading of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, Liberal Democrats supported the Government's new initiative that would bring schools together and move education forward. The initiative has not been evaluated, and we do not know whether it has been a success. I have tried to find out from the Government how much of the original resources that were put into the first round of bids materialised. Two years later, the Government are unable to give me an answer. The same situation obtains for funding the new specialist schools. We need greater clarification.

<P>
Then fresh start appeared. As soon as one or two of the fresh start schools, of which the Phoenix school in London is a classic example, do not achieve the results that the Government want, off we go in another direction as a new initiative comes along. My objection is not that there are new initiatives, but that there is no research base behind them. I defy the Minister to cite any evidence that shows that the charter school movement, which he accepts comes from the United States, has been a success. I have visited the States to look at some of the charter schools and I shall return in November to look at them two years later.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
There are mixed reviews of charter schools and what they are trying to achieve. Like all schools, their success depends on who leads them, the parent cohort, where the children come from and the dynamic of the school. I could take hon. Members to brilliant state schools in any local education authority in Britain that would outperform the best charter schools in the United States. That is the reality. We should study those models, and not simply say that there is an instant solution in the United States that we can pluck off the shelf and bring to Britain.

<P>
The prospectus for city academies clearly states that their main objective is to raise achievement in cities. The Secretary of State gave the example of a failing school. Achieving less than 20 per cent in grades A to C for three successive years is the standard that the Government will apply in creating city academies. The Minister could not tell the hon. Member for Hertsmere what the criteria for a failing school will be. That is not acceptable. Ministers should not say off the top of their head that schools are failing or refer to less than 20 per cent in A to C grades without taking into consideration the vast array of other issues that are involved.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the questions he poses are made even more urgent because the time scale for the pathfinder projects for the new initiative are so short? People who are interested in taking part are expected to express an interest by 7 July.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hertsmere for making the point, but he should have gone further. The Government are not only seeking expressions of interest, but have asked a number of private sector organisations to express an interest. Will the Minister name the people to whom he has written to say that the Government would like them to take over? That is germane, because there are a few interested organisations in the marketplace, such as Cambridge Education Associates, Nord Anglia and 3's. I should like the Minister to name the others that will develop those schools. Are the Government inviting the Eddison project to come here? Are they asking the Advantage Movement in the United States to come? I hope that the Minister will respond on those issues.

<P>
The rationale for city academies is that the Department for Education and Employment has looked into the issue of free school meals and is now looking at academic success and failure according to how many pupils have attained five A to C grades in GCSEs. That is the basic philosophy behind city academies; that is how simplistic the concept is.

<P>
The good thing about the Excellence in Cities movement is that it acknowledged a correlation between levels of deprivation and poor performance, which previous Ministers had not recognised. The hon. Member for Blackpool, South brought up a key issue relating to mobility, which has not yet been grasped fully by any Minister. It relates to the significance of mobility, not only for the children who are moving, but to the school to which they move and from which they are later removed.

<P>
Neither does the city academies issue address the fact that when the Department did its research on free school meals, a large proportion of schools with a low number of free school meals had poor GCSE results, even though those results would have been better than 20 per cent. A to Cs. If this movement is good enough for the failing schools-and like the hon. Member for Blackpool, South I have yet to find a definition of that term-why is it not good enough for those underperforming schools, often in more leafy boroughs, which are not achieving the sort of results that they should? Why should this be restricted to the inner-city areas? Why are they always under attack?

<P>
The other sad fact is that there is no mention in the prospectus of the enormous amount of work that local education authorities have done to support schools and turn them round. There are four schools quoted in the document. Three of them-Langden school in Newham, Surefields community school in Liverpool and St. Matthew's RC high school in Manchester-were taken out of special measures, and all were supported by their LEA. The schools that remain in special measures have fallen from 25 to 18 as a result of work by the LEAs. LEAs should not always be regarded as the problem. They can be very much part of the solution, yet they are written out of script.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere rightly asked whether the new schools would be independent or state schools. The Minister said that they would, of course, be state schools, yet the prospectus makes it clear that they will be independent. They will be independent from the local education authority and from any other schools in their communities. They will be sold lock, stock and barrel, if we are to believe the legislation. If that is the case, what will the difference be? In the case of the charter school movement in the United States, the buildings were provided by private organisations, but funding for each school came from the state or city. The Government are going a step further and saying, ``You can have the buildings as well.''

<P>
What does paragraph 2(4) of new schedule 1 mean when it talks about disposal? When a site is disposed of, will the freehold be transferred to the new companies? If so, their status will be different from if they were given a lease for five or seven years. I cannot imagine that there are many altruistic companies prepared to put in a significant capital sum without security over and above five to seven years.

<P>
On management and organisation, we are pleased that all teachers will have to have qualified teacher status. As the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Valerie Davey) and I know, one of the sad features of the charter movement in the States is that teachers did not have to be qualified. Anybody could come in off the streets and teach in those schools. The promise here is that the city academies will be able to negotiate pay and conditions with teachers. When the previous Administration brought in grant-maintained schools, no school, as far as I know, accepted that condition. They all kept the terms and conditions that are standard throughout the country. How does the Minister anticipate that fitting in with the new pay structure that will be brought in from 1 September? Will city academies be able to fast-track their teachers and put them on point 9 of the pay scale, entitling them immediately to threshold payments? If so, will those payments be met by the Government and ring-fenced, as the Secretary of State has said? What happens then to the other elements of the scale, and in particular the leadership scale? Will there be immediate access to the leadership scale and will the Government guarantee ring-fenced funding out of state budgets for that? The Minister needs to respond because he cannot simply say, ``We will negotiate pay and conditions with teachers,'' without telling the profession what that means.

<P>
Moving on to admissions, the city academies, according to the prospectus, will select on ability, though they will be able to recruit 10 per cent. of pupils on grounds of aptitude. We will not run the aptitude issue, as we did in the School Standards and Framework Bill, because we were never given a definition by the Government of the difference between testing on aptitude and testing on ability. Despite all the Government have said about grammar schools and getting rid of grant-maintained schools, and the Secretary of State's promise that there will be no more selection, we find that this is another group of schools that will be able to select by ability. Aptitude and ability are the same thing, unless any of the Ministers can come up with a better definition.

<P>
What about admissions? Will these so-called semi-independent or independent schools have to conform to the admissions forum within a local education authority? What will the relationship be between them, for example, on appeals? What will happen if a student is permanently excluded or if a local authority wishes to place a student in one of the academies? Will there be any way of negotiating that.

<P>
Turning to real estate, the Minister knows that there are one or two local authorities-Bradford is a classic example-that are slap bang in the middle of a reorganisation that will make roughly 20 school sites available. What will happen to them? According to the legislation, if a private sector company says, ``I want site A. I want to set up a school there and organise it as a city academy,'' Bradford LEA has to give them the site. If it does not, and the company put a good case-and remember that, according to Chris Woodhead, Bradford LEA and its schools are all failing-the Secretary of State can compulsorily purchase the site and hand it over to the private company, which can charge the LEA for the cost of not only the compulsory purchase but all the administrative and legal fees. I find it amazing that a Labour Government are prepared to go so far towards privatising schools.

<P>
What will happen in authorities that are reorganising or those, such as Leeds, Sheffield and Rotherham, that have been asked by Ofsted and the Secretary of State to reduce the capacity in their schools at the same time as the city academies are being set up? What will happen to the overall admission rolls? As a city academy opens, another school will have to close somewhere else. That is the reality, because there is a finite number of students in any area.

<P>
I could spend the next two hours going through the problems that we have with city academies. The sadness is that we have not been afforded the opportunity to have a full-scale debate on this important and significant initiative. If the Government had provided time on the Floor of the House to hold a debate on the subject we could have explored it through proper parliamentary dialogue.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We are unhappy about the late appearance of the amendments and about our not receiving clarification on many issues, and we are sad that a very interesting initiative might nose dive simply because the Government have, as usual, arrogantly thought that they can implement it with scant discussion or consideration and that everyone can lump it. Ultimately, our children will suffer, rather than the Government.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is an unexpected pleasure to appear before you, Mr. Benton. It would be churlish not to recognise that we have been afforded an additional opportunity to debate the amendments. Although I do not entirely agree with the philosophy of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, I agree with him entirely about the timing of the Bill and the way in which we are considering it. It is far from ideal that at this very late stage we are considering an entirely new initiative that, among other things, sits uneasily with a Bill on post-16 learning and skills rather than on secondary school reorganisation. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry pointed out that the House of Lords has also been deprived of the opportunity to debate the initiative, in which I am sure there would have been considerable interest.

<P>
We all want to solve the problem of under-achieving schools, particularly those in inner-city areas, but we have a number of questions about the policy and we wonder whether the way in which it has been introduced is the best way to get it off to a good start.

<P>
 Some of my questions were asked by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. Whatever one's viewpoint, the same questions need to be asked, particularly on the position of LEAs, the way in which transfer will take place and selection. I do not want to go over the same ground, but I made a point last week about new clause 28. The new clause was very important because it dealt with special educational needs, which have not yet been mentioned this morning. My questions reflect the interest among those who are concerned with special educational needs.

<P>
New clause 28 proposed a regulation-making power in respect of children with special educational needs. The power would enable local education authorities to pay for children with special educational needs at city academies. What consultation has there been with those concerned about that policy? Will the the code of practice on the identification and assessment of special educational needs apply to these schools?

<P>
The Government recently consulted on disability rights in education. Will those apply to city academies as though they were independent schools or maintained schools? This matter is linked to the debate about the character of schools. I was intrigued by the Minister's reply to my question. He said that they were state schools, rather than independent schools, but that does not seem to be entirely clear from the Bill. New clause 27 tacked city academies on to existing legislation on city technology colleges. It is clear that city technology colleges are independent schools, so their being described as state schools sits ill with that; city technology colleges are independent schools and will be governed by the same legislation.

<P>
New clause 28 refers specifically to section 347 of the Education Act 1996, which applies specifically to independent schools providing special education. City academies are being described by the Government for the purposes of special educational needs as independent schools. The section provides that the Secretary of State may approve an independent school
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as suitable for the admission of children for whom statements are maintained under section 324<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, for the purposes of special educational needs, it would appear that the new clause treats city academies as independent schools rather than as maintained schools in the state sector. I seek clarification from the Minister. Is it wrong to describe city academies and independent schools? If not, what is the justification for the Minister's comment that they were state schools?

<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough has already dealt with some of the issues arising under new schedule 1. It establishes a scheme for the transfer of land for schools from local authorities to those who would promote city academies, provided that certain conditions are met. The conditions are important, but before coming to them, I should like to echo a good question that was put by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. He looked at the issue from the point of view of the promoters' interest in the land if the city academy were to end. I should like to hear from the Minister about the beginning. When the procedure under new schedule 1 has been completed and land has been transferred from the local authority to the promoters of the city academies-if necessary, by compulsory purchase, as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough rightly said-what will be the interest in that land held by the promoters of the city academies? We need an answer. It is not entirely clear from new schedule 1.

<P>
Under the new schedule conditions have to be fulfilled before a transfer can take place. Subsections (1)(b) and (c) provide that the city academy scheme can be made only in the case of land that has been used as a school at some time in the past five years, but which is no longer used. The scheme of transfer applies to school buildings that are no longer in use as a school. That would cover some of the cases that we have discussed, but not those that are envisaged in the prospectus for city academies that will replace existing schools. How will city academies be established in the situations described in the prospectus, especially city academies that replace an existing school or schools. What will the powers be, and how will they be used? New schedule 1 would not appear to apply to such schools, as it mentions buildings and land that are no longer in use. What about buildings and land that are in use, but the school has been designated a failing school under whatever criteria that will be used to determine that? Will powers be used to achieve a transfer to the promoters of city academies?

<P>
We should like to hear more about the position of local education authorities and about the criteria for failing schools-a point raised by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and others. The Minister has to give a tighter definition of poorly performing schools. It is difficult to determine what constitutes a poorly performing school in an inner city. The Minister should also say how many city academies he expects there to be. As for land and buildings, it has been suggested that the promoters will have to put up £2 million. How much will each city academy cost?

<P>
The Government's position on selection is not crystal clear. At the end of the previous sitting, the Ministers said that city academies
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>will not select pupils on the basis of motivation in the judgment of the head about which applicants are more likely to benefit from the education to be offered-[Official Report, Standing Committee F, 25 May 2000; c. 741.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the prospectus says that city academies will be able to admit up to 10 per cent. of pupils to each year seven cohort on the basis of aptitude for a school's specialism. Those two statements do not go together. How can city academies assess the aptitude of children without also making a judgment on their motivation, which the Minister said they cannot do? He must clarify that. The difference between aptitude and ability has been debated at length and I realise that I may not receive a satisfactory response, but the situation is far from clear.

<P>
The Government's position sits uneasily with all that they have said about selection, including their modified pledge that there will be no further selection. We know that there is selection in other circumstances, but the Government seem to be introducing an additional element of selection. The problem lies in the internal consistency of the Government's philosophy. I take no issue with selection, but they should explain how this measure sits with their enunciated philosophy on selection.

<P>
There will probably be many other questions on this issue, but the Government's approach is far from ideal. They think that city academies are an important initiative. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster gave an appropriate and pertinent analysis of the time scale of their policymaking. The Government have failed to introduce the measure properly and to give the Committee enough time for full consideration. They have not got the scheme off to a good start, as other hon. Members said. The Government must answer all the questions on this matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> Most people I know who joined the Labour party did so because they wanted to extend opportunity and equality. Selecting 10 per cent. of pupils from a locality will not enhance the aims and objectives of the Labour party, which properly represents the people of this country and will always do its best. Such moves are ill thought out, will not work, will create more divisions and are nothing but a continuation of Conservative policy. It will not help in my locality or many others. Some parents will chase after the 10 per cent. of selected places. The other 90 per cent. of children who go to that school who have not been selected-perhaps because they have not passed the right examination-might be thought of as being second class.

<P>
How do we decide what are so-called failing schools? There are schools in my constituency in which teachers, governors, children and parents work as hard as they can to ensure that children get the best possible education. However-it is obvious, and a blind man on a galloping horse could tell you-that where there is inequality from the day people are born it is crazy to expect education to compensate for all the difficulties of families in constituencies such as mine.

<P>
I do not know whether the proposal will work in London. I respect the views and understanding of the hon. Member for Hertsmere about the nature of his constituency, but I ask him in turn to understand my view of a divisive action, introduced by a Labour Minister for purposes that I do not understand, extending division and creating more examinations and more hurdles and obstacles for people to climb over to get the decent education to which they are entitled. I did not join the Labour party to support that.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Whip sitting on the Front Bench need not worry. For 30 years I have taken the Labour whip and at this time of my life I shall not be siding with the Opposition and giving them a cheap thrill. However, the measure needs a thorough debate. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, who has taken the time to examine the technical details. I do not believe that some of the tax implications that were mentioned have been thought through or that anyone yet has full, detailed knowledge of the consequences of the land transactions envisaged in the provision. We do not really know. When people who do not really know the consequences pass legislation they fail in their duty.

<P>
I have the bit of paper that is being passed round. It is a bit of an insult on such an important issue, where the Labour party proposes to extend examinations, hurdles and obstacles for children who want to get into decent schools, to present us with a bit of paper with a few explanations. On the question of whether city academies will receive special funding advantages, we are informed that they will get an extra £120 per pupil for their specialty. Well, please can I have £120 extra per pupil in every secondary school in my constituency? They all do specialist work-very specialist. It enables some of the most disadvantaged children to get on a bit better in life. I do not need a 10 per cent. threshold affecting who can go to one school or another. If I sound angry it is because I am. I am very angry about the proposal.

<P>
Here we go again, with a question about whether private organisations will make profits. I have worked in the private sector most of my life and I know what it is supposed to do. I urge anyone to go into a business that will pay a few bob, to make a living and enable the other people working in the enterprise to make a living too. Those people, if they have any common sense, will join a union and make sure that they get more out of it than the shareholders. That is a proper dynamic for a capitalist society. Anyone who really believes that the private sector will dole out hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of pounds, with no return in sight, is very far from reality. What do such people think that private companies are? Benevolent societies?

<P>
When I was in the private sector I did not want to work for a benevolent society, but for a company that understood competition and that worked hard and produced the best results, good products and good service, enabling me to earn a good wage. The private sector has a proper place in the mixed economy that I, as a member of the Labour party-old Labour if one wants to put it like that-understand and believe is a proper way to organise society. Now here we are, mixing the sugur and the sand again. There are so many contradictions between the philosophies involved in the project that it is almost damned before it can begin. It beggars belief.

<P>
On the question of a management fee, although I am no expert I can tell the Committee that private companies tend to pay better wages and salaries, and higher fees, than the public sector. However, I know where the money for all this is coming from-the taxpayers in my and other hon. Members' constituencies. That means that instead of getting to the front line, in the new Labour phrase, the money is creamed off and is in someone's back pocket before anyone can say Jack Robinson. That is the nature of private enterprise. It is the only way it can survive. People will not willingly give hours of their time when they think that there will be no return on it, and why should they? Those people have a proper job to do and will continue to do it for as long as they can.

<P>
We have a proper job to do as well: ensuring that all the children in the country have the opportunity to reach their full potential. That is a bit of old Labour. Every time a child goes to school it should be a new learning experience. All the resources that we can muster as the Labour party in control of the state should be directed at the children who need the money most, and should not go into the back pockets of accountants, architects or landowners. You name 'em, I've met 'em. If the proposal had been a Tory project, I would have described it outright as-because it would have been intended as-just another way of making the state more beneficial than it should be to the middle class. Every item of legislation that they ever introduced had the purpose of ensuring that state funds went into the back pockets of entrepreneurs and capitalists. That is not our purpose. Our purpose is to ensure that that money goes into education and that children benefit from it directly.

<P>
I repeat for the benefit of the Whip that I shall not vote against the proposal, but I hope that when the Minister returns to his Department and speaks to education officials he will tell them to think again and to recognise that it will lead to more consequences than they have envisaged. It will be a backward, not a progressive, step in the philosophy of the Labour party, which should run the country for the benefit of the people. It will be another element in the selection process that interferes with the absolute entitlement to education of every child. I ask the Minister for goodness' sake to withdraw the thing altogether and think about the issue more carefully. If he believes that there are fresh ideas to introduce more dynamism into schools, he should get them on the agenda now and not wait for someone else to do it for us.

<P>
I agreed with the Minister-I warmed to him, in fact-when he said that he understood that every day new ideas for improving pupils' opportunities were worked up in schools. That is what happens. Innovation and product development are what the private sector is about-and schools in the public sector, too. Every day there is careful thought about how to extend opportunity and better enable children to learn what will be of use to them in the arts and sciences for their working lives and leisure time. I am talking about the mission of the Labour party. To educate is the first step, but all that we are doing today is putting up yet another barrier on a whim or a fanciful idea.

<P>
I do not know whether the project is imported from America. I have never taken that much interest in what the Americans do. We want appropriate education measures which British people will understand within their culture, and the benefits of which will be shared. We want to take on board the best ideas-even from America, I suppose-that extend the idea of egalitarianism. Egalitarianism in education is not to be scorned, but understood and used. The best thing that the Minister can do is withdraw the proposal and think very carefully about it before he reintroduces it.

<P>

<B>Valerie Davey </B>(Bristol, West): I stand with trepidation. I warmed very much to what my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East said. I speak as someone with a very different type of constituency from that of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. In my constituency of Bristol, West there live some young people from the most seriously deprived areas of the city, as well as some young people who are born with terrific advantage. In other words, my constituency is a microcosm of the world: it has within it the north and the south and young people who need more from their education than do others who receive tremendous educational benefit at home and in their local communities.

<P>
I, too, have seen schools that have terrific potential for doing well by the sort of young people that live in my hon. Friend's constituency of Wolverhampton, North-East and mine. The fact that those young people need all that and so much more means that we have to look abroad to bring back excellence in ideas, dynamism and resources-by resources, I do not just mean money, although that is a factor-to give them the very best. This idea caused me a great deal of concern when it was first put on the agenda. Some of that concern remains, but I want to keep an open mind to see where the ideas are coming from and how they can bring to those city areas that are still failing young people all the enthusiasm and resources to enable us to do the best for them. I am quite sure that that is the Government's intention because that is what the Labour party is about. At this stage, I want to keep an open mind and keep asking questions in the hope of getting answers. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.

<P>
I share the sentiments of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, but with my multi-background constituency, I also want us to share so that all the young people in my constituency, those from the most deprived and the least deprived backgrounds, receive a good education. Perhaps we have been unable to establish the sort of inner-city comprehensive schools for which my hon. Friend and I have worked and fought for decades simply by leaving them be. I am looking for new ideas and I want them to work, but I want them to work in the context that my hon. Friend and I know very well.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We have had an interesting time of it this morning. The comments of hon. Members fall into two categories: criticisms of the Government with regard to process and detailed points of substance. I should like to address them in that order.

<P>
This is probably the longest debate that we have had on any part of the Bill so far in Committee. We have been at it for an hour and a half today and for about an hour at the previous sitting, although I might be corrected on that. It is certainly one of our longest discussions, so I am slightly baffled when, after a week or so of recess, during which hon. Members have had time to consider the material, we are still hearing the criticisms of the Government's approach that we heard before the recess. We have tried extremely hard, within the constraints that I have clearly outlined, to give hon. Members the chance to scrutinise the legislation and to raise detailed points. The length and number of detailed points raised this morning demonstrates that hon. Members have had plenty of time for consideration. The time might not be sufficient in their view, but it is not fair to accuse us of not having allowed time. I would take exception to such an argument.

<P>
I will address the many detailed points in a moment. The mere fact that Government and Opposition Members have had the opportunity to raise many important and detailed points demonstrates that we are open and want the matter to be properly scrutinised. We recognise the importance of the Committee having proper scrutiny. I hope that I will be able to reassure hon. Members by answering the detailed questions that they have raised. The hon. Member for Daventry suggested that we had only touched on the legislation. I would not have chosen that verb after what has been getting on for an hour of detailed criticisms.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister will be aware that I must have made that comment about an hour ago. We might have touched on the legislation, but at least two Government Members have since put the knife in firmly behind his shoulder blades. With all respect to the Minister, we have revealed in the exchanges what I described as bedside manner. There are real concerns relating to process and policy, which would have benefited from a separate Bill and a discreet consideration of the matters.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful, as always, to the hon. Gentleman. I hoped that I had set out before the recess the reasons why we brought the matter forward. There is the perfect world and then the real world in which we live. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster recognised the constraints under which Governments always inevitably operate. We have done our best within those constraints to allow time for scrutiny. As I have said, the number of detailed points, which obviously come from a detailed reading of the proposals, demonstrates that we have allowed time.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster referred to Whips not being prepared to speak. I say in passing that that has never been my experience of them, but the right hon. Member has a longer and more extensive memory than I do.

<P>
I should clarify one point about my offer to write to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough with regard to the evidence on charter schools. As he said, the matter is detailed and complex, with much academic literature. I want to give hon. Members a full, accurate résumé of that literature rather than an off-the-cuff answer in Committee. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me. It is a matter, not of a lack of preparation, but of a desire to be accurate and precise in answering an accurate and precise academic question. He asked for academic evidence and he will get an academic response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I will press on with that point, if I may, because I do not wish to miss any of the many detailed questions. I am anxious that I might do that and I want to make progress.

<P>
Before I turn to the detailed points raised, I will address the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, who gave a passionate outline of his beliefs. I, and every Government member, share those beliefs. The reasons that he gave for joining the Labour party were the reasons why we joined. We have no quarrel about those reasons. He defended passionately the extension of opportunity to everyone, including the most disadvantaged and deprived members of our community. All Government Members at least are in politics for such aims. There is nothing between us with regard to such issues.

<P>
I hope to be forgiven if I overlooked something in the remarks of my hon. Friend, but I did not detect recognition of the fact that the city academies will be brought into effect when a school is seen to have failed. I will come on to the detailed criteria, but want to emphasise that point. The provision is not instead of but as well as. It will apply in circumstances in which there is a manifest need for new provision. That is the point. Nothing in the proposals undercuts the fundamental goals that we joined the Labour party to achieve. I hope that my hon. Friend can accept my reassurance on that matter. I might not be able to reassure him with regard to all the details of the proposals, but I hope that he will accept that we have common objectives.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> I wish to clarify a point made by the Under-Secretary. He said that city academies would be additional, but the document said-I took it as gospel-that whereas most charter schools were additional, city academies would replace existing publicly funded schools.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I should like to clarify the point on types of provision. I understood my hon. Friend to say that his problem with the mechanism was that it was divisive. However, I was trying to say it would not create new places in a locality and that it would operate only when existing forms of provision have been shown not to be working for the children. He may not be reassured by what I am about to say about the detail, but I hope that he will accept that we share the same objectives and that we are moving towards the same goals.

<P>
I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I have inadvertently overlooked anything. A large number of individual points have been made and I would be happy to be reminded of any that I have missed. I am tempted to say that I would be delighted to stay here for a long time to discuss all of these matters. Such a suggestion would perhaps be stretching the point slightly, but I am willing to address any matter that I have overlooked.

<P>
Several hon. Members asked about criteria. I had hoped that I had addressed the matter before the recess, but I shall speak further about it for the sake of clarity. A city academy can take over from a failing school only when that school has closed. A community school cannot close unless closure is decided by the Secretary of State under special measures and according to Ofsted-judged criteria, or the LEA proposes closure. If the latter occurs, the procedure goes through the school organisation committee. Unless its verdict is unanimous, the matter will go to the independent schools adjudicator.

<P>
Status was also mentioned. I apologise to the hon. Member for Hertsmere if I have misled him. I thought that I had said-and I hope that the record will show this-that the academy was a state school, insofar as it is publicly funded. Its legal status is that of an independent school, although that term is used colloquially to cover schools that raise their funding through private fees. Perhaps I inadvertently misunderstood the remarks made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, but I hope that my comments clarify the legal status.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's clarification and for his assurance that a city academy can take over only when a school has closed and that there is no question of schools being taken over before that. That is not clear in the prospectus and it is not what local education authorities understand from it, so the position needs clarification. If a borough or LEA has the relevant number of school places and a school closes, will not the opening of a city academy impact on the local authority admissions forum, on admissions policy and admissions numbers for the whole authority? Might not that result in the closure of another school elsewhere? That was the point that I tried to make earlier.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. That is not the case and it is not our intention for that to happen.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Chaytor </B>(Bury, North): May I pursue the point about the impact on an adjacent school of the establishment of a city academy? Even though the Government might not intend academies to have a knock-on effect on admissions levels in adjacent schools, is not it statistically inevitable that the attraction of the city academy, with its £120 extra per pupil in revenue funding and its additional capital investment, will automatically draw in pupils who would otherwise have gone to the immediately adjacent schools? That happened with city technology colleges. Are we not simply moving the problem around the table?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The short answer is no. The establishment of a city academy will not have an automatic impact, quite simply because it replaces the school and its role. I think that my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough are suggesting that the city academies will be so attractive and successful that they will have an impact on surrounding schools. I cannot give a cast iron guarantee that that will not be the case. The fact is-I return to the fundamental point-that city academies will replace provision that has failed. That is the reason for extra funding. It is not divisive. There is a clear distinction between the experience of city technology colleges under the previous Government, which were privileged, and city academies, where the funding will put right provision that is not delivering for children.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> I get more and more confused. I do not know of an example of a city technology college pulling in pupils from outside its catchment area, other than because of its extra resources. That has happened in my town where buses take children to the city technology college in Telford. If more money is given to a school, it is inevitable that it will have better equipment and will offer more to its pupils. It is common sense that parents will prefer a school that is better funded than a less well funded school in their locality. Any parent would.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Of course I understand the concern and respect the constituency experiences of hon. Members, but with the greatest respect, the situations are not analogous. The parallels are inaccurate because the circumstances are different. I hope that I can reassure hon. Members on that. City academies will be established only if existing provision fails.

<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> At the risk of provoking more interventions, the circumstances are not analogous.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to pursue the point again. The key issue is not that of failing schools, but of the total number of places in a given catchment area. Leaving aside the definition of a failing school-I would use the phrase under-achieving rather than failing-the reality is that in most inner-urban areas with under-achieving schools, the admission pattern is such that neighbouring schools have a significant number of spare places. If all places in all schools in a relevant area were full, I accept that a city academy would not have an impact on admissions to adjacent schools because the number of children would broadly match the number of available places. However, it is almost inevitable that under-achieving schools in inner-urban areas will have a considerable number of spare places. It is equally true that if one school is re-established and is more attractive than others, it will suck in additional pupils. Adjacent schools will lose pupils and have more spare places to fill.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is an intervention.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> It is an intervention. If a city academy does not become sufficiently successful to attract those pupils, what is its purpose in the first place?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I will rise briefly. I am sure that there will be another intervention, and I should prefer to wrap up my answers in one go.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I have a slightly different perspective on the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North. The thrust of the concerns is the fear that city academies may have a destabilising effect on schools in surrounding areas. I hope that that will not be the case, but to avoid doubt, would it not be possible, as part of the prospectus process with the city academies and in future statements on their development, to define more precisely the responsibility of city academies to share provision, experience and, if necessary, teaching with schools in surrounding areas? My analogy highlighted the differences between the EAZs and GM schools. If the Government could develop that further, many of the concerns would be addressed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West) rose-

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I will, of course, give way. I am delighted to see that the hon. Gentleman has arrived and is listening carefully. May I just first welcome the helpful suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South? We will consider it and, I hope, respond positively.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I wondered whether the Minister wanted to wrap my comments up with those of his hon. Friend.

<P>
If the Minister came clean, he would be advocating a model for education in cities with which I might be comfortable. In that competitive model, a city academy would draw people from less successful schools, which would close and become city academies, so raising standards in that area.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> If the hon. Gentleman had been here earlier, he would have heard the answer to that in what I said about partnership and co-operation. I gave a similar response to my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South.

<P>
I recognise the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor). The experience of the model in many constituencies has not been very good. We are determined to learn from our experiences. I hope that hon. Members are reassured. No one knows what effect city academies will have in each constituency, but we are determined to ensure that they deliver for children who are not getting the education that they deserve-I choose my words carefully-and that that will not be at the expense of other children in the same area. The extra funding is designed to recognise the problems that schools experience, which are often considerable. I do not want to attach any blame because many schools operate in difficult circumstances, but that is no excuse for not taking decisive action to tackle the problems when urgent remedies are needed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Let me make some progress. I am repeating my points in the hope of persuading hon. Members of our good intentions. The circumstances in which the schools will be established will not give rise to the adverse consequences that have been described.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am not repeating a point that has already been made. If the admission forum has the requisite number of places to meet local education authority requirements and there is an expanding population, will a city academy be introduced to meet that expansion even if no school is closing?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Yes, it will.

<P>
I am anxious to tackle some of the other issues that were raised by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. He asked who had been written to. I hope that he will understand that we cannot give a full list, as some of the information may be confidential. I can, however, tell him that it does not include Edison, which was one of the companies that he mentioned, and that it does include a number of LEAs. It also includes the Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church and other parties that have expressed an interest, such as Peter Vardy of Reg Vardy plc and at least one livery company. I cannot recall which hon. Member expressed doubts about the level of interest in the city academies on the basis that no management fee will be payable, but I hope that I have provided reassurance.

<P>
Let me turn to the concerns expressed about LEAs by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. City academies will create an additional option for LEAs in deciding how to tackle the problems of seriously under-achieving schools. As I said, a number of LEAs have already responded positively to the initiative. We believe that the status of city academies is crucial, as it enables them to have the flexibility to innovate in curriculums, staffing and governance. We have made it clear that we expect sponsors to work in collaboration with LEAs and other local education partners.

<P>
I shall now deal with selection.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes </B>(South Holland and The Deepings): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The hon. Gentleman has just arrived. As always, I am delighted to see him here, but he has missed most of the debate and I should like to make progress. I shall be happy to give way later.

<P>
Selection has exercised a number of hon. Members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I was hoping that the Minister would talk more about the involvement of LEAs. I asked about reorganisation, an issue that is not yet finalised, and mentioned the specific example of Bradford. Does not the Minister see that city academies could become the basis of any new reorganisation? He has now admitted that they will be introduced in relation not only to failing schools but to expansion needs and reorganisation. Does he recognise that an LEA could adopt the city academy model for all its schools when it is planning reorganisation?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Yes, if that was the right solution for the LEA, but I keep returning to the fundamental point, which is that there is always an argument in favour of the status quo. It is a general argument for a general organisational principle, that change can be disruptive. All change can be disruptive, so we must consider the particular circumstances in which an LEA will take the route that we are discussing, which provides a specific remedy for specific problems. We can hypothesise all we like about individual circumstances, but it is better to focus on what is most likely to happen and on the specific concerns expressed by hon. Members.

<P>
A great deal of worry has been expressed about selection. I should like to repeat a point that I made before the recess, which is that the policy does not involve a significant change of principle. In line with other specialist schools, city academies will be able to admit up to 10 per cent. of pupils each year on the basis of their aptitude for the specialism concerned. They will remain all-ability schools. There is no question of any pupil at any city academy being second class, which I think was the fear expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East.

<P>
In that sense, city academies are no different from all the other specialist schools that exist, and we are expanding because of the evidence that they have tended to achieve more rapid improvements in standards than comprehensives. All the evidence suggests that that is because of what specialist schools do, not because of the pupils who attend them. After all, for the vast majority of specialist schools, the GCSE results relate to pupils who were already in the schools when they became specialist. Specialism helps schools, damaging the interests of neither other schools nor children in the locality. I hope that that will be of reassurance to the hon. Members who have expressed concerns on that point.

<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough asked about land and what constituted a disposal. The land transfer provisions relating to the interests of the local education authority will come into effect whether the land is freehold or leasehold. If land ceases to be used for the city academy, it will be transferred back to the LEA. I made that point before the recess and it is made clear in paragraph 5 of the schedule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The point about the provisions is not made clear in the prospectus. A private company might take over a school and the freehold of the land would be transferred to it. There is no recognition in the prospectus or in the Bill of the status of the land with regard to its being reacquired by the LEA. The value of the land could have risen significantly in five or seven years. The Bill makes it clear that the company will get real value for the land when it transfers back. That could be at a huge cost to a local education authority, which will have to pay according to the legislation. That was the reason for my freehold question.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I refer the hon. Gentleman to paragraph 5 of the schedule because the point is important. As I said in Committee on 25 May:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Paragraph 5 protects the position of an LEA that has transferred land for the purposes of a city academy when that school ceases to be a city academy. The paragraph provides for the Secretary of State to make a scheme for the transfer of the land back to the LEA that made the transfer to the city academy, whether or not the original transfer was subject to a scheme made by the Secretary of State.-[Official Report, Standing Committee F, 25 May 2000; c. 734.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> With respect, it does not. I read in Hansard what the Under-Secretary said and he said nothing about the value of the transfer. The value of the transfer is what is so important. If a lease is transferred, it can be agreed for five or seven years on a rolling basis. If the freehold is transferred to a private sector company, the school being considered independent under the regulations relating to city technology colleges, as we have now agreed, the value of the land might rise significantly. I can understand why such companies would want to be in business if the enhanced value must be repaid to the company.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern but the transfer will be at nil cost to the LEA. The land was the LEA's and will return to it through a scheme that it will have proposed. The hon. Gentleman's concerns are not justified. He has not understood the operation. He refers to a situation in which land achieves a notional value. The value applies only if it is realised in the marketplace. It does not apply if ownership transfers from the Secretary of State. Transfers are at nil cost in both directions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Tell us, then-

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand the point if I pursue it. Money does not change hands. The notional value of the property on the real estate market at the time is irrelevant. It is transferred at nil cost and it will be transferred back, in the appropriate circumstances, at nil cost.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We are now going into the realms of fantasy. It is being suggested that a private sector company will invest a minimum of £2 million in a site and yet will accept that when the property is transferred back about five years later it will receive no enhanced value from what has been achieved. No company would go into an arrangement on that basis.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I will not go into great detail about the psychology of companies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I will make the point first and then I will give way. We have already had expressions of interest from the private sector. [
Interruption.] The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough can listen to this and be enlightened or can continue his conversation with other hon. Members. Companies in the private sector have expressed an interest. They understand the basis of the proposal, and I prefer to trust that rather than the speculations of the hon. Gentleman. I am now happy to give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> This seems like a session of harrying the Minister, but that is not my purpose. We might be confused by the use of the term freehold, which has an understanding in law. A condition cannot be imposed on a freehold transfer that it shall be given back for nothing; otherwise it is not freehold.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> With respect to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, I shall not give a legal opinion in Committee. I am happy to write to hon. Members on points of law or tax and I undertake to do so, but the question is whether private sector companies will go into this for any reason other than making a profit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am thrilled that my remarks excite so much interest, but everybody would benefit if I could make the points before hon. Members intervene. Experience shows that private sector interests go into things without intending to make a cash profit; they have other interests. Everyone in this country, including private sector companies, has an interest in having a properly skilled work force in every area of the country and every part of the community. Members of the Committee are being a little cynical about the motives of those coming forward. I shall give way to the hon. Member for Hertsmere, or the hon. Member for Daventry.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. He is conducting proceedings rather like a sophisticated auctioneer. I have experience of a co-operative organisation that built up a considerable capital asset, the equity of which inflated over the years. The difficulty is not so much the initial intentions of companies, although I do not cavil at what the Minister has said. The fact remains that if there is a contingent capital gain in prospect when disposal of land is contemplated, that colours the way in which people look at how that gain should be captured and to whom it should be made available. That is the point that is exercising members across the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am afraid that I will not speculate on the tax consequences of individual companies. They are very complex and I am not an expert. However, my understanding is that there will be no contingent capital gain as such. The Bill provides for a transfer back at nil cost.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister direct the Committee's attention to that part of new schedule 1 that provides that the transfer back from the city academy will be at nil cost?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall be happy to do that in a moment. I should first like to reply to the questions that the hon. Gentleman asked about special educational needs provision, which is very important. We are taking a regulation-making power precisely because we need to consult interested parties. He asked whom we had consulted. Consultation is still underway and we shall have to wait for the outcome, but we recognise its importance of and I hope that he will be reassured by our commitment to consultation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I know that by the Minister's definition I have only just come in, but I have had the benefit of listening to five or six speeches on the issue and I want to pick up the point about support from commercial organisations for the schools. He may be right that there are a few philanthropists who will give money and support to schools as he describes, but most commercial organisations will be looking for win-win situations, where both parties get something out of the deal. There is nothing wrong with that, but we need to be up front about it. We should not assume that commercial organisations will not be looking for some gain. That is nothing to be ashamed of, but he seemed to be refuting it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I was not refuting the general proposition about how capitalism works. I was merely drawing attention to the provisions of the Bill, rather than speculating about the motives of private companies. None of us has any idea about their motives for doing such things. We could go on speculating, but I want to focus on specific concerns about the provisions of the Bill. There have been many detailed questions and I shall continue to answer them.

<P>
I was asked by the hon. Member for Hertsmere about the precise part of the Bill covering transfer back of land at nil cost. He is correct that paragraph (5) of new schedule 1 is not explicit, but I hope that he will accept my assurance that this will be included in the schemes for which the Bill provides.

<P>
I am sorry if I am darting around the various points that have been raised. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough raised the question of exclusions and how they will be dealt with. We would expect city academies to take account of DFEE guidance on all aspects of discipline, including exclusions. We would directly address the issue of exclusions in each city academy funding agreement. The policy detail is still being developed, but let me make it absolutely clear that city academies will not be allowed to exploit their legal status as an independent school to the disadvantage of other maintained schools. I hope that I have answered his specific concern.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The Minister has addressed only part of the problem because it is a two-way problem. At the moment, local education authorities, which are legally required to find places for full-time education, can instruct a school to take a child. Will they be able to instruct a city academy to do so? My understanding is that, given their independent status, that would not be the case.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> It is not the case.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I would be grateful to know whether the Minister has finished responding to my questions on special educational needs, because I asked two. I am happy to repeat them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> That would be extremely helpful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> First, will the code of practice on the identification and assessment of special educational needs apply to city academies? Secondly, will the proposed disability rights in education apply to them as independent schools or as maintained schools? The latter is an important point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I had hoped that I had explained that in my remarks about consultation. We shall have to see the results of the consultation before we make a decision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> How does the Minister square that with what is contained in the new clause about section 347 of the Education Act 1997, which says that they will be independent schools for these purposes?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we will make a decision once the consultation has been concluded.

<P>
Many detailed questions have been asked. I hope that I will be forgiven, but I have forgotten which hon. Member asked me how much city academies would cost on average. We do not know yet. We want to establish 10 pathfinder projects and costs will vary according to the circumstances of each project. As a guide, we expect that they will cost about £5 million to £10 million each.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> Is that the capital cost or the year-on-year revenue support? Similarly, I am still not sure whether a local authority could impose a displaced pupil on the independent school.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> No.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> It will not be able to?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We are not in a position to give a definitive answer. I apologise to my hon. Friend, but I would not want to be tied down on that. I have given a guide, but it is wrong to be more specific because we just do not know. Funding will vary according to circumstances. I do not want to be held on such a precise point. We are still exploring the matter. We must await the outcome of those explorations. I am happy to keep all members of the Committee informed of the progress of the initiative. I may have covered all the points that were raised already. If not, I shall give way again.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I asked how the waiving of national conditions of service for staff would affect pay scales and, in particular, whether threshold payments would be ring-fenced if there was an accelerated movement up the scale.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I had omitted to mention that. City academies will have freedom to decide matters of remuneration, as indeed will city technology colleges, but they will have to take their decisions within the budget.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> That was okay when city technology colleges and grant-maintained schools were introduced, but the Secretary of State has introduced two new measures. Threshold payments will be ring-fenced within the £1.1 billion additional budgets that the Minister for School Standards announced last year. That is therefore outside the normal SSA for schools. Secondly, new lumps of money have been allocated in the Budget this year, which is direct funding of schools from the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I realise that there is intense interest in performance related pay. I have heard the hon. Gentleman's views on this on several occasions. I understand why he raises this issue. I shall shortly give him a direct answer to his question, but let me first say that I understand his concerns about teachers. We want city academies to be exciting and rewarding places for teachers to work, but the answer about ring-fencing is no.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I want to come back to the issue of surplus school places and reorganisations in an LEA. The Minister will know that the Government have powers to intervene where there is a surplus of places or a reorganisation has not taken place as a result of changes in the dynamics that were referred to earlier. Should the need arise, do the Government intend to use those powers?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I will have to write to the hon. Gentleman about that.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I should like to thank the Minister for his patience and courtesy in responding to the debate. There have been a large number of questions. The Minister's bedside manner has been shown to his best advantage, but the position is unsatisfactory, to put it mildly. He has been a victim of the way in which the policy has been managed from the original idea through to its implementation in legislation. There has been an obvious lack of preparation at every stage. Consequently, not only could the Committee not deliberate in a normal parliamentary way-the House of Lords has been deprived of that ability altogether-but there are serious conflicts between the Government's prospectus and what appears on the face of the Bill.

<P>
The prospectus states clearly that city academies could replace existing schools or schools that have closed or to meet additional demand. But the Minister told us today that that will not happen: they will replace not existing schools in that sense, but schools that have been closed. The Minister has not explained how those different parts of the policy will link together. That is just one example. I am not satisfied with the replies that I have received about special educational needs or about the status of the schools. I am not happy about the financing of the schools. I am still curious about how the Government's internal views on selection hold good in the light of this measure. I am not satisfied with the explanations that the Government have given about a series of measures.

<P>
That is not to say that we disagree with the Government's intention to improve schools or to seek new solutions for failing schools, but we are concerned about the way in which this has been prepared. It bears all the hallmarks of badly managed legislation, which, although we have done our best, has received inadequate scrutiny. The Government told my noble Friend Baroness Blatch that her grammar school amendment was opportunistic because the Bill did not deal with secondary education. That accusation has come home to roost because they have been opportunistic themselves in seeking to tack this measure on to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I cannot let the point about grammar schools go. We are introducing these measures to try to help some of the most deprived and disadvantaged children in our community. The point about grammar schools has nothing to do with that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The point I was making was that the Government accused my noble Friend of being opportunistic. I seem to recollect, although I may be wrong, that she was accused of being opportunistic on other grounds as well. Her measure on grammar schools was extremely well thought out, compared with the botched way in which this has been brought before the House.

<P>
There is an important point to be made by us as legislators: we do not want legislation to go through in this unsatisfactory way. Badly scrutinised legislation provides the worst possible start. I am tempted to oppose the amendment on that basis. It has been proposed in an unsatisfactory way. We simply cannot allow it to pass when it has received such unsatisfactory consideration, despite our best endeavours. The Minister, through no fault of his own, has not been able to answer the questions. The problem is the overall way in which the policy has been prepared. It has not been thought out properly. That does not bode well for future legislation. We must make a point about this and signal our displeasure about the way in which the Government have proposed the policy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I will not repeat word for word the comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere, but I agree with everything that he said. I echo his remarks about the Minister's courtesy and the valiant way in which he has tried, by sending notes backwards and forwards, to respond to questions asked on both sides of the Committee. It is refreshing that Labour Back Benchers have entered into scrutiny so vigorously. That is welcome, and neither the Whips nor the Ministers should regard them as disloyal, because they are fulfilling the Committee's purpose.

<P>
The Committee has made no progress since it began this morning. The same questions need answers. There is still confusion over the Government's policy. Everyone can see the conflict between the prospectus and the amendments. I resent the Minister's implied criticism that both the Opposition and the Labour Back Benchers are interested only in maintaining the status quo. Anyone who considered my professional career and regarded me as someone who supported the status quo would need locking up.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I have not caught a bug for intervening today, but I must say that I was not criticising. I said only that sometimes the status quo is insufficient. No criticism of hon. Members on either side of the Committee was implied.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful for that clarification. We all recognise the problem that the Government are trying to tackle and we want to be as supportive as possible. We oppose the amendments not because we do not want advances to be made or because the proposals have no merit, but because we want them to be more coherent.

<P>
We are at the end of the debate, yet I still do not understand the difference between what Surrey county council did with King's college, Guildford, and what is bring proposed. A private sector company took over a so-called failing school-King's Manor-and invested private sector money and additional Department for Education and Employment resources to create King's college. What is the difference between granting that college foundation status, for instance, under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, and Surrey county council's desire for many of its schools, particularly those in urban areas, to go into group foundations through the same process? The Government could have used other legislation to further its objectives.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will think again about the appalling situation regarding exclusions. One school can be told that it can permanently exclude students with challenging behaviour-I think that that is the new terminology-from its roll, but other schools will not be able to send children to that school under the current legislation. That is one of the Bill's most attractive prospects. Schools will receive not only an extra £5 million to £10 million from the Government-because we are told that the local education authority will not provide that money-but at least an additional £2 million from a private sector benefactor. My goodness, that ought to be the national policy for schools. Given such resources, we could solve all our problems. However, the one difficulty, which is shared by the free school movement that the hon. Member for Daventry and his friends support, is that nobody knows where the excluded children would go, other than into sin bins, as they are ludicrously called.

<P>
I ask the Minister to think again about staff terms and conditions. That is not a simple issue. Performance-related pay has caused a major problem and raised a serious issue in our schools. It is unsatisfactory to offer new terms and conditions without thinking through the consequences and the funding. As a humble past public servant, I may not understand the technicalities of freehold legislation, but what on earth is the point of transferring the freehold when it has no recognition in law, other than that it can come straight back? Why not just have leasehold? It is a simple matter to offer a lease on the buildings and the premises.

<P>
We are grateful to the hon. Member for South Holland and the Deepings (Mr. Hayes) for spending so much time with us. I last met him at Southampton university on the eve of the Romsey by-election, when he confidently predicted a different result, but it is still nice to see him. He is right to say that, if the Government want the private sector to be involved in our state education system-I believe that they want that-they should be upfront about it. We should have a proper debate, and I do not see any difficulty in that. We might come down on different sides of the fence, but that is irrelevant. The point is that a genuine debate must be held.

<P>
During the three years that we have been waiting for that debate, the Education Committee, which was then under the chairmanship of the Under-Secretary, began to deal with the issue but did not complete it. [
Interruption.] I am told by the hon. Member for Blackpool, South that the report will be published soon. We await it with bated breath. The private sector's involvement in state education is a real issue. It is worthy of a Green Paper, which would allow a proper debate, rather than things being done secretly.

<P>
Some companies involved in the education market, including 3Es, Nord Anglia and Cambridge Education Associates, are not in the business purely as altruistic partners-they are in it to make a profit. I do not decry that, but let us be honest about it. Not everyone is involved simply for the benefit of students. If we divide, we shall reluctantly oppose the amendments, because the Government have introduced them cack-handedly. We hope that a fuller debate will take place on Report and that the House will be given enough time to discuss an issue that affects all hon. Members.

<P>

<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> Throughout what has become the longest debate on a single issue in this Committee, not one sentence has touched on the purpose and efficacy of extending selection in an area that is supposed to have an under-performing school. We have heard nothing to justify extending the principle of selection to such schools, and justification is needed. The Minister must defend the selection of 10 per cent. of pupils and tell us why it is an important part of establishing an academy. It would be helpful if the Minister changed irrevocably the policy on selection, which is so obnoxious to members of the Labour party, or at least recognised that we simply do not support it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I want to respond to my hon. Friend's last point. I listened with great interest to the comments made by other hon. Members. I understand the passion with which my hon. Friend speaks about selection. However, I must quarrel with his use of the phrase ``extending selection''. The principle is already established that only up to 10 per cent. of pupils will be selected on the basis of the school's specialism. The purpose of specialist schools is to develop specialist skills. That has been shown to benefit all the pupils in a school. It is helpful for such a school to have a 10 per cent. nucleus of pupils who have an aptitude in the school's specialism. The underlying reason is that specialist schools have been shown to deliver for the children who attend them, and we all want to achieve that goal.

<P>
I am sure that I shall not persuade the hon. Friend, but I hope that he will be reassured that our objective in implementing the measure is the same as his. He might disagree with the way in which we are going about it, but that is why we are going down that road.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> This is extraordinary logic. Schools select 10 per cent. of pupils on the basis that they havean aptitude in a subject. The other 90 per cent. are allowed in without barriers. What should we expect from that 90 per cent. of pupils? The logic is hopeless.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am not sure that this is the time to get into-

<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
