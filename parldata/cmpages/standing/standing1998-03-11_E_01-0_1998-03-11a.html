<B>The Chairman:</B> For hon. Members' information, there is a misprint in the Chairman's provisional selection of amendments. Under clause 2, amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 should be deleted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope </B>(Christchurch): I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 6, leave out `but excluding public transport'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we shall take the following amendments: No. 25, in page 1, line 6, leave out `public transport' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`vehicles constructed or adapted to carry more than eight passengers in addition to the driver.'<P>

No. 7, in page 1, line 6, after `transport' insert
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> First, Mr. Stevenson, may I welcome you to the Chair. I note that you are a signatory to early-day motion 18, and that you therefore have a great interest in this subject.
<P>
I had not intended to say a great deal at this point, but the Bill's promoter and some of its sponsors appear to be confused about the purposes of the Committee stage. Last night I received one or two telephone calls telling me that I was being unreasonable in tabling amendments, and that the Bill should go through on the nod. One of the four amendments before us has in fact been tabled by the Bill's promoter, and the majority of the 48 amendments tabled are in the name of the promoter, the Government, or Labour or Liberal Democrat Back Benchers.
<P>
Although I am a source of concern to the Bill's promoter and sponsors, I hope that you, Mr. Stevenson, will protect the right of Committee members to amend, scrutinise and test the proposals before us, and to consider them with the detail that Parliament requires.
<P>
Road trafic is at the heart of the Bill. As I understand it, the Bill's promoter, the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis), is not against road traffic, but against its adverse impacts. On Second Reading, I made clear the Opposition's view. I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In government and now in opposition, the Conservative party has adopted a consistent stance on the issue. We want to reduce road traffic congestion and increase the proportion of travel by public transport. We believe that an arbitrary target for reducing road traffic is, in itself, meaningless. Targets are no use unless the means by which they are to be achieved are spelt out and command popular support.''--[Official Report, 30 January 1998; Vol. 305, c. 675.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill's sponsors appear to be confused about its purpose. Amendment No. 5, which seeks to omit the words ``but excluding public transport'', is intended to deal with that confusion. The Bill's sponsors wish to confine the definition of road traffic to the types of mechanically propelled vehicles that can cause adverse impacts.
<P>
I tabled amendment No. 5 because public road transport vehicles are capable of generating seriously polluting exhaust fumes. The Bill's sponsors are behaving inconsistently by excluding public transport from the definition of road traffic.
<P>
I have here an extract from page 3 of the briefing entitled ``Answering the Arguments'', which was sent out in January 1998 by the Bill's sponsors to their supporters. It asks:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Why do we need road traffic reduction?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There is so much evidence on this point that we can only summarise here.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The briefing puts forward two main points in support of the argument for road traffic reduction. First, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Millions of people breathe air heavily polluted by exhaust fumes. 53 per cent. of all nitrogen oxides, 90 per cent. of all carbon monoxide, 46 per cent. of all hydrocarbons and 47 per cent. of all black smoke emissions come from road traffic.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Secondly, it comments:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Up to 15 million people could be suffering health problems caused by traffic fumes. Up to 10,000 people die prematurely as a result of particulates pollution every year.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Are the adverse consequences for personal health resulting from traffic congestion and pollution to be regarded as public enemy No. 1? If so, public transport vehicles--many of which heavily pollute the atmosphere--should be included in the definition of road traffic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): Some of the buses that run on old-style diesel are a disgrace. Is it not critical to tackle public transport vehicles directly through their engines and fuels, rather than indirectly through the inclusion of their mileage in road traffic reduction targets?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Clause 2 states that the Bill will deal with the adverse impacts of road traffic on the environment and on safety and health. Why, therefore, is one category of road traffic--public transport--excluded from the Bill's scope?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I will give my hon. Friend a partial answer. Most of the people who work in the City of London can afford to have cars, and they have cars. If 80 per cent. of them go to work on public transport, we do not want to reduce that proportion, but rather to increase it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> There is a lack of consistency in my hon. Friend's approach. I did not have the privilege of serving as a Member of Parliament during the previous Administration, but I know that there were long debates over several sessions about road traffic reduction targets.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) was a prominent supporter of the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997, which contains a different definition of road traffic from that which he promulgates today. Does he now think that public transport should be excluded from the definition of road traffic? If so, why should it not be excluded from the definition of road traffic used by local authorities when they set road traffic targets?
<P>
The approach is inconsistent. My amendment supports the definition in the 1997 Act and, as a result, I hope that it would improve the Bill. Neither I nor my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West think that the sponsors are saying that public road transport does not emit exhaust, black smoke and particulates. Old buses and coaches are some of the most polluting vehicles on our roads. It is no consolation to a victim of air pollution caused by a motor vehicle to be told, ``It's okay, it's a bus. Don't worry, it's a coach.''
<P>
I know of campaigns against bus garages in residential areas because of the threat of concentrated air pollution. Everyone has been stuck behind buses and taxis pouring out clouds of black smoke. It is folly to exempt public transport vehicles from a Bill designed to reduce the adverse impact of road traffic.
<P>
The Committee may be familiar with the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology, House of Lords Paper 13, which was published in 1996. I shall not quote the report extensively, but paragraph 4.15 states that another way to take a lead
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is to target those vehicles which are often the most polluting in the most environmentally sensitive areas. Urban taxis and buses are two obvious examples. They have high mileage in urban areas, many have old diesel engines which can be very polluting, and the necessary infrastructural adjustments could be made at lowest cost.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why do the sponsors ignore the fact that many buses and coaches contribute to the pollution that the Bill will regulate? There are approximately 72,000 buses and 400,000 heavy goods vehicles on our roads and they are responsible for 55 per cent. of the PM10s emitted by urban road transport. In 1997 those buses and heavy goods vehicles emitted twice as many PM10s as 24 million cars.
<P>
The sponsors should demonstrate that the Bill is not anti-car or anti-lorry, but that it is against the adverse consequences of road traffic and road traffic congestion. Buses and coaches were not excluded from the definition of road traffic in the 1997 Act. To exclude them now is folly.
<P>
A recent example demonstrates the extent of the problem, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West knows. City diesel is available in London and in other cities. It reduces particulate pollution and is effective in reducing the adverse consequences for the environment and for people's health.
<P>
Are coach and bus operators rushing to fill their vehicles with city diesel because of their concern for the environment? No. Many responsible private motorists choose to pay extra for city diesel to help the environment and the health of fellow citizens and of their own families, but many bus operators do not. Any suggestion in the Bill that a bus or coach, however unnecessarily polluting it may be, is better than a private car will give rise to the suspicion that the Bill is more anti-car than anti-pollution. The sponsors of the Bill assure me that that is not so, so I hope that they will accept the amendment.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): How many journeys are made by coaches and buses? Why has the hon. Gentleman not mentioned light rail, tram and other sustainable forms of transport?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks a relevant question. I refer him to the transport statistics report on bus and coach statistics for 1996-97, produced by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. It is available at all good book shops, and is free to the hon. Gentleman but costs &#163;20 for others. The document contains a series of tables, which differentiate between the volume of passengers and the number of services operated by bus and coach companies, and also between conurbations, inter-urban transport and rural areas. In 1996-97, local bus service supply in Britain increased by 3 per cent. to 2,693 million vehicle kilometres, or about 1,300 million vehicle miles. That follows the upward trend over the decade. It is an awkward truth for the Labour Party, whose propaganda suggested a decline in local bus services as a result of deregulation and the promotion of competition by the Conservative Government.
<P>
Supply has remained static in the English metropolitan areas. Bus mileage increased by 6 per cent. in the English shire counties and by 5 per cent. in Scotland in the year to 31 March 1997, but it stabilised in the English metropolitan areas. There were small declines in London and Wales--the latter may be of interest to the Bill's promoter. Total bus mileage has steadily increased by a quarter over the past decade. In London, where there is the highest concentration of activity, vehicle mileage has increased in the same period, reaching a peak in 1994-95.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> The point that I was trying to make concerned what proportion of journeys is made by buses, which, according to the figures that I found when I was preparing for this morning's sitting, is about 6 per cent. In response to the hon. Gentleman's earlier points about the quality of public transport and the mechanical ability of buses, I would argue that many operators have found that deregulation has caused difficulties in promoting and advancing the cause of buses. In my constituency of Scarborough and Whitby there has certainly been a substantial decline in bus services, particularly on rural routes. Many villages in that area are fortunate if they have one bus service in and out of the village every week. The key aim of the Bill is to set up a framework to allow us to set targets--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I ask hon. Members to assist the Chair by keeping their interventions to the point and as brief as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I take the opportunity to tell the hon. Gentleman that I shall have the pleasure of visiting his constituency tomorrow, albeit briefly, when I shall speak at the meeting of the National Housing and Town Planning Council.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment is about public transport. I have read the group of amendments carefully. The amendments refer also to bicycles, motor cycles and transport for people with disabilities; they do not refer to the hon. Gentleman's diary commitments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I accept that, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): How will the hon. Gentleman travel to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) tomorrow?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> It is my intention, unless I am unduly provoked, to travel by train, but when I reach the station in Scarborough, which I have not before had the privilege of visiting, I hope to be collected by a car rather than have to make my way on foot or wait for bicycle to be delivered so that I can reach my destination. If the hon. Gentleman has any doubt about my credentials as somebody who believes in using all forms of available transport, I hope that my record will speak for itself.
<P>
In response to the intervention by the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby, I point out that he must have in mind table 11.3 in the Transport Statistics Report, which sets out the share of passengers miles by mode of transport between 1952 and 1996. You will be relieved to hear, Mr. Stevenson, that I do not intend to read out that table. It is true to say--whatever else I am, I am certainly fair-minded--that in 1996, the last year for which figures are available, 44 billion passenger kilometres were travelled by bus and coach in this country, which represents roughly 6 per cent. of total transport.
<P>
Significantly, that figure was higher than it was in 1992, when I left the House of Commons after serving as the Minister for Roads and Traffic. I like to think that the increase in bus and coach mileage that followed the policies that I had the privilege of implementing is partly attributable to the legislation that I helped to put on the statute book.
<P>
That 6 per cent. is a proportion of all passenger mileage, and at this early stage in the Committee's proceedings it is worth comparing it with the 620 billion passenger kilometres travelled by car, van and taxi. Even if the share of passenger kilometres travelled by bus and coach were to double, that would have relatively little impact on the overall amount of traffic on the roads.
<P>
I have tabled amendment No. 5 because the adverse environmental and health impact of grossly polluting buses and coaches is significant. About 6 per cent. of passenger kilometres are accounted for by bus and coach. In 1997, however, the urban emissions of PM10s attributable to buses and heavy goods vehicles were double those attributable to the country's 24 million cars. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper) is persuaded of the importance of amendment No. 5.
<P>
The Bill's promoter and the hon. Lady the Minister for Transport in London support amendment No. 25, which replaces the words ``public transport''. We are at one on that, which might concern the Minister, who never thought that she would be at one with me on anything. I, however, got my amendment in first. It says that we should take the words ``public transport'' out of the clause. The Minister has, however, gone further and wishes to add the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``vehicles constructed or adapted to carry more than eight passengers in addition to the driver.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is the purpose of that? Why is a vehicle that can carry 10 people per se worthy of exclusion from the Bill?
<P>
As I said earlier, the Government are storing up a practical problem for themselves by supporting amendment No. 25. The problem results from the difference between the definition of road traffic in the 1997 Act and the present definition. The Act defines local road traffic as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``mechanically propelled vehicles on roads for which the Secretary of State is not the traffic authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have not yet heard when the Act will be implemented. A consultation process is under way on the draft guidance that the Government will issue under it. The guidance was, however, not produced until January, which demonstrates a certain lack of urgency about the issue at a local level. As a result of the Act, however, the Secretary of State will receive reports from local authorities about the levels of road traffic in their areas, including
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``vehicles constructed or adapted to carry more than eight passengers in addition to the driver''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I know that it is always dangerous to try to assist a colleague--especially on one's own side--to get a point across easily. Would it be sensible for my hon. Friend and I to table amendments on Report or to ask the supporters to organise an amendment to the Act in another place so that it is consistent with what we decide on definition? That would achieve my hon. Friend's objective and might even save the Committee some time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I ask hon. Members to refer to the amendments before us. I do not know what progress we shall make by speculating about what the Government's and the Opposition's intentions might be as a result of the Committee's deliberations. I am sure that the hon. Member for Worthing, West understands that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I welcome my hon. Friend's intervention. His sagacity is well known. Perhaps he is putting gentle pressure on the Government, in his inimitable way, to ensure that there is consistency between the Bill and the Act that was passed by the Conservative Government last year.
<P>
I cannot anticipate the response to my arguments--I shall not be aware of it until I have heard from the promoter and from the Minister. Why should local authorities have to include public transport buses and coaches in local reports if the Secretary of State does not include them in his? There will be all sorts of problems in the calculation involved, and in aggregating and disaggregating the various categories of vehicle.
<P>
Will the Minister or the promoter explain why a vehicle constructed or adapted for 10 people or more, which is travelling with only the driver on board, is a ``better'' vehicle than a car with four passengers on board?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cynog Dafis </B>(Ceredigion): Because it carries more people and therefore has a reduced impact in all sorts of ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cope:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman misheard me. I asked why a vehicle constructed or adapted for 10 people or more, with only the driver on board, is a better vehicle than a car with four passengers. That is a serious point. Empty running of lorries is a problem in this country and throughout Europe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): Following the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member For Scarborough and Whitby, will you give a definite definition of what you mean by ``public transport'', as referred to in the amendment? Of course, a car containing four people could be a hackney carriage. On top of that, does your amendment include guided buses and light rail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am advised quite properly that the hon. Gentleman should address his remarks through the Chairman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. He addresses his intervention to the wrong person, however. The promoter--supported initially, as I understand it, by the Minister--included the words ``public transport'' in the Bill. It would be inconsistent for me to argue for the removal of those words while asking a lot of probing questions about what they mean. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the words ``public transport'' are susceptible to rather wide and uncertain definition. Had I supported the retention in the Bill of those words as an exception to the definition of road traffic, I should have asked the promoter to define what he has in mind. Does he mean taxis, guided buses, trolley buses, trams such as the Sheffield supertram, or what?
<P>
When the hon. Minister for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis) speaks to amendment No. 25-- I am verging on speculation in which you, Mr. Stevenson, have asked hon. Members not to engage--the Committee may well find that he tabled it because of the concerns that he raised. It would remove the words ``public transport'' as the exception to the definition of road traffic. Will the hon. Gentleman or the Minister explain why a public transport vehicle--to use colloquial language--such as a bus or coach that is empty running is better than a vehicle with more passengers on board?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> I have little doubt that the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong. If I understand the thrust of his argument, however, he seems to be advocating that one way of encouraging greater use of public transport is for would-be passengers to present themselves to the garage, rather than for the bus to present itself to them at, say, a bus stop. He also seems to be advocating, in his concern for empty public vehicles, even greater use of traffic. For example, community transport vehicles move people with disabilities. Is the hon. Gentleman also advocating that people with disabilities present themselves by another form of transport before they get on to the community transport bus?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Chope:</B> If I understand the Minister right, that is an uncharacteristically facetious comment. Indeed, it is not I who is seeking to incorporate this definition; it is the Minister.
<P>
I know that the Minister does not know the rural areas as well as many of us, but I shall not open up that countryside debate. In the rural areas it is less polluting if a person goes on a one-off journey to the doctor, the hospital or the train or coach station by taxi than if a bus, which is a much larger vehicle, comes and collects that person as a single passenger.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. That is especially true if the bus is a double-decker.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. Certainly where my mother lives in Cornwall there are double-decker buses--indeed, I have seen them in the roads near where I live in Christchurch--going down country lanes with hardly a person on them. That is one of the reasons why it was very good for the environment to deregulate and to encourage privatisation of so many bus services. The consequences has been major investment by many bus operators in new, smaller, more user-friendly, often low-loading vehicles for the transport of passengers through rural and, indeed, urban areas.
<P>
It disappoints me that some Government Members seem to think that it is better that a bus should travel through the countryside with two passengers on board than a car with four passengers on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn </B>(Islington, North): I think that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood some of the sedentary comments that have been made. Our concern is that rural buses travel empty because they are so expensive that nobody can afford to travel on them. Consequently, the service is cut. By contrast, in London, where deregulation did not take place, there has been a considerable increase in bus usage: outside London there has been a reduction. That is the legacy that the hon. Gentleman bequeathed to the country when, fortunately, he lost his seat in 1992.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I call on the assistance of hon. Members not to lead the Committee down the road of a general debate on the merits or otherwise of privatisation. Again I refer them to the terms of the amendments, to which I am sure they will want to adhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. I remember the debates that I had with the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) during the passage of the Road Traffic Bill--
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> In this Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Indeed. The hon. Gentleman's recollection is the same as mine. We were dealing with, for example, red routes in London. I do not think you had the pleasure of serving on that Committee, Mr. Stevenson. In relation to red routes and in many other respects, the arguments that we put forward on that occasion have proved to be valid and relevant in the longer term.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman makes a fair comment about London. The point of my remarks is to emphasise that only about 34 per cent. of people and households in this country have easy access to regular public transport services, by which I mean services that run at a frequency of 15 minutes or less.
<P>
It is important that when we consider policies affecting road traffic, we recognise that in rural areas, it will never be economic--in financial or environmental terms--to run a series of minibuses or coaches, except where there is sufficient demand for such services. Local authorities can subsidise individual services if they choose to do so--that means winning the support of local people who vote in local elections. Thus, with the consent of their charge payers, local councils--the previous Government extended the power not only to district councils but to parish and town councils as well--can subsidise so-called public transport.
<P>
Instead of or in addition to giving concessionary bus passes to, for example, the elderly, many local authorities choose to give them vouchers that can be used for taxis. It is often more appropriate for the elderly and disabled to travel by taxi than by a large bus. Those who live in areas that are remote from public transport services are thereby given access to ``public'' transport to enable them to go about their daily lives.
<P>
The debate raises some important issues, but I want to know why the problem seems to be ignored by the Bill's supporters. I would be among the first to support, where appropriate, the use of or experimentation with high-occupancy vehicle lanes. By that I mean treating all vehicles on a par--a vehicle which contains a large number of occupants is better for the environment and better for the economy than one that does not. There is no point in providing for blanket subsidies which would merely enable more buses to run relatively empty on rural and semi-rural roads.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 proceeds on the assumption that the promoter and the Minister will win the vote on amendment No. 25. No doubt the Clerk who was responsible for arranging the amendments in this order--perhaps you were, Mr. Stevenson--did so so to enable me to speak to amendment No. 6 on the basis that the Committee would accept amendment No. 25. The latter amendment would mean that the Bill would distinguish between good vehicles and all others. Once we go down that road, to use the expression that you have already used, Mr. Stevenson, it would be logical to widen the definition of ``good'' vehicles to include vehicles carrying or designed to carry people with disabilities.
<P>
The orange badge and Motability schemes reflect public policy, which is that road transport for people with disabilities is a good thing. The benefits of freedom and mobility conferred on the users substantially and significantly outweigh the usual arguments about the need for parking restrictions and penal vehicle tax.
<P>
Some of my constituents attended an advice centre last week to express concern about the Government's harsh line on the disability living allowance. It is--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman please be kind enough not to refer to social security benefits? To do so is to stretch the debate too far.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Certainly, Mr. Stevenson. My point is that there are many people who have used the DLA to obtain a vehicle for their use under the Motability scheme. It is in that context that I mention the DLA, which some Labour Members might find a sensitive issue. The fact that Governments of both political persuasions have supported it is a sign that we, in Parliament and in successive Governments, think that there should be special arrangements to facilitate the transport of people with disabilities and to enable them to have as rich a life as possible.
<P>
The Motability scheme gives disabled people the opportunity of using their vehicles. There are many carers who, at weekends or during their spare time, go to old people's homes and nursing homes to take friends and relatives ``out for a drive''. Surely that is a good thing. Therefore, why should it be put on one side by the supporters of the Bill?
<P>
There are many vehicles which are designed to accommodate wheelchairs and wheelchair passengers. Sometimes, by the time a wheelchair has been put in, there is room only for the van driver and one other person. Under the definition given by the Minister, a vehicle designed to take a wheelchair, a driver and one carer would not be excluded from the definition of road traffic, unlike a vehicle which had a larger capacity. We know that there are charity buses, transit vans and other types of vehicle which collect people and take them to luncheon clubs and day centres, on outings and to hospital. There is an enormous amount of that activity in my constituency of Christchurch, where the average age of the population and electorate is much higher than elsewhere.
<P>
Do the supporters of the Bill really want to reduce vehicle use by disabled people and by their carers? I shall give them the benefit of the doubt. I hope that in replying to the debate, the Minister and perhaps the promoter will explain something to me. In what I shall refer to as the January 1998 version of the Bill, which was published and distributed by Friends of the Earth under the title Traffic Reduction File 10, why does page 2 of that document have what purports to be the Road Traffic Reduction (United Kingdom Targets) Bill set out in detail? When this was sent to me, I thought that it would be the form in which the Bill would be presented to Parliament. When the Bill was printed, about three days before Second Reading, it was very different from the version which was circulated by the promoters and supporters.
<P>
In clause 1, as originally provided in the Bill, the following definition applied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In this Act the following terms shall have the following meanings that is to say:--``road traffic'' means traffic on roads but excludes public transport, cycles and transport for people with disabilities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
An explanation reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Section 1 defines terms used. The Bill is to cut car and lorry traffic, not cycling, public transport, or transport for disabled people.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems eminently sensible. Indeed, that was what the supporters of the Bill had in mind before the Government, the Minister or the Minister's officials got to grips with it.
<P>
I hope that in replying to the debate, the promoter will accept the opportunity which amendment No. 6 offers and will recommend to the Committee that it be included in the Bill. That will restore the situation, although, as I said at the outset, I believe that it is anomalous to try to differentiate between one type of road vehicle and another. However, if we are to do so, road vehicles designed and used for transporting people with disabilities should be included in the exception from the definition in the Bill. If not, the Bill's supporters and the Government will be open to the charge of wanting to reduce vehicle use by disabled people as well.
<P>
That brings me on to amendment No. 7, which is a further example of the same principle being extended. It would provide that mechanically propelled vehicles should include pedal cycles, motor-assisted pedal cycles, mopeds and motor cycles. Bicycles are totally non-polluting. I stand unchallenged in that assertion. However, I accept that cyclists sometimes breathe more heavily because of the exertion and may emit more carbon dioxide. I am glad that some members of the Committee appreciate the insight that I bring to the subject, which the Minister does not share; it comes from having used my tandem on many occasions.
<P>
The other three forms of transport--motor-assisted pedal cycles, mopeds and motor cycles--are far less polluting than cars and, indeed, many buses. Pedal cycles can be used in bus lanes. Therefore, a recognition already exists in legislation that it is reasonable for pedal cycles to be treated as a special category. Many--perhaps not the Minister--would like motor cycles to be able to use bus lanes to encourage the use of that form of transport which, particularly in urban areas, takes up much less road space. If not motor cycles, why not that new form of pedal cycle which has a small motor attached to it, which eases the burden slightly for the person pedalling?
<P>
Do the Bill's supporters want to reduce cycle use or motor cycle use? I think not, but I could be wrong.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> Bicycles are not included because they are not mechanically propelled. Or does the hon. Gentleman regard the cyclist as a kind of mechanism?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that insight into the definitions. I always thought that if one took one's bicycle to the bicycle shop, a bicycle mechanic would deal with it. Therefore, one might say a bicycle is a mechanism. A vehicle driven by a motor is different, but I will accept what the hon. Gentleman says about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Drew </B>(Stroud): Surely the key word is ``propel''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am sorry. I did not hear what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Drew:</B> The key definition is propel, in the sense that the vehicle is mechanically propelled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman making that point. I hope that he is prepared to develop his argument in relation to the argument about motor cycles and power-assisted pedal cycles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake </B>(Carshalton and Wallington): If the hon. Gentleman has included motor cycles in his list, he should perhaps also have included in it motorised skateboards.
<P>
Mr. Chope: It is noteworthy that the first intervention in the debate by a Liberal Democrat Member should be of such low quality. I am disappointed by that. The Liberal Democrats may think that it is a good idea, but I do not. Indeed, if there were less terrorising of pedestrians by skateboarders, the world would be a better place. Those of us who often walk along the south bank in the vicinity of the Royal Festival hall are among those who feel concerned about the problem of skateboards. I know that one of the distinctive policies of Liberal Democrats councils, where they exist, is to promote skateboard parks.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let us return to the purpose of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am pleased to do that, Mr. Stevenson. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) took us down what I would have regarded as a blind alley.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Ceredigion and the Minister will be able to give me some solace and indicate their preparedness to meet the arguments that I have deployed in support of the amendments, as a great deal will depend on their attitude. I shall not detain the Committee any further on the amendments, but I look forward to hearing what other hon. Members say about them.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I should advise hon. Members that the contributions so far have ranged pretty wide of the amendments. I shall take that fully into account in the context of a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> It is a pleasure it is to be in the Committee and to have you chairing it, Mr. Stevenson. I shall depend considerably on your guidance as time goes on. I am not as experienced in Committee matters as the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope), nor am I so good at speaking at length on very little as the hon. Gentleman. I tend to stick to my script, and I find it embarrassing to expand at great length with little substance.
<P>
It is an honour to be considering this important Bill, which provides a framework to tackle one of the big issues of our time--the need to bring an end to and reverse the seemingly inexorable growth in road traffic. However it has brought benefits; nobody would quibble about that. The benefits that the hon. Member for Christchurch has mentioned, particularly in relation to disabled people, are known to everyone and we all appreciate them. There is no doubt either that the growth of traffic to its present unsustainable levels is creating serious economic, social, environmental and personal problems.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Some of the amendments would seriously weaken the Bill. It is, therefore, important to emphasise that there is widespread support for it and that opposition has been limited. I had assumed that the Conservative party supported the Bill's general principles; I certainly know of many prominent Conservatives who support them. I was, therefore, disappointed to hear some of the doubts that the hon. Member for Christchurch expressed, but we shall come to those later.
<P>
I am delighted to have worked with the Minister for Transport in London, the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson). We first agreed a version of the Bill for Second Reading and then brought together the amendments before us. In doing so, we were assisted by the hon. Lady's civil servants, whose constructive approach I appreciate. I am glad to have been able to table the amendments jointly with the Minister. The Committee's job is to discuss them, and I and the Minister hope that it will accept them. We must also consider other amendments from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, including some interesting amendments from the hon. Member for Christchurch. Some of the amendments would strengthen the Bill and some would weaken it in an unacceptable way. The hon. Member for Christchurch has tabled amendments of both kinds. I hope that we can move through the process of considering them with expedition.
<P>
Amendment No. 25 would replace the phrase ``public transport'' with a more preferable definition of the type of vehicle that would be exempt from the Bill's provisions. That would allow exemption from any requirement to reduce road traffic not only for what we usually regard as public transport buses, but for minibuses and vehicles owned by charities. Such vehicles are not strictly public, but they make collective provision and their use might increase in the context of a general strategy for reducing road traffic. The amendment is a common-sense provision.
<P>
I must say a little in response to the lengthy speech of the hon. Member for Christchurch and to the amendments that he tabled. It is extraordinary for him to suggest that we should not accept the increased use of buses as desirable. We cannot reduce traffic, the damaging effect of high levels of traffic and, ultimately, congestion without increasing the use of public transport and of collective provision for people in vehicles. It was strange to hear the hon. Gentleman pursuing the line of argument that he did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The hon. Gentleman misunderstood my argument. He said that I did not accept that there was a role for public transport. At the outset, however, I said that we wanted to increase the proportion of travel by public transport. The burden of my argument related among other things to the inconsistency between the Bill's proposals and the 1997 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants there to be an increase in the use of public transport, it would obviously be unreasonable for the Bill not to exempt public transport from the policy to reduce road traffic. A general reduction in road traffic would imply the possibility--indeed, the likelihood--of increased use of public transport, so it is extremely important that it is exempted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> If the hon. Gentleman insists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I want to press the hon. Gentleman about the position of local authorities. Why should public transport vehicles using local authority roads--in other words, roads that are not motorways or trunk roads and are not therefore the responsibility of the Highways Agency--be categorised differently from public transport vehicles using other roads?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> The general point is that it is important to allow an overall increase in public transport in various situations. That is the point of the exemption in the Bill. The amendment in my name provides a more precise definition of the vehicles that we want to exempt. I do not want to pursue that matter further.
<P>
There would be no chance of getting public support for reduced road traffic unless there was increased provision of high-quality public transport.
<P>
The hon. Member for Christchurch said a great deal about pollution and the undeniable fact that many public transport vehicles are of poor quality in that respect. That issue must be tackled, but not in this Bill. If we reduce the number of vehicles on the road, there is no doubt that we will reduce the quantity of pollution. There are other ways of tackling vehicle emissions, which we need to deal with more thoroughly. There must be incentives to improve technology for public transport. Such considerations would be part of the strategy that those of us who support the Bill would like to be implemented.
<P>
There is the question of disabilities. Supporters of the Bill recognise the enormous benefits that the availability of the car has brought to disabled people. The Motability scheme and others are perfect examples. We would not want there to be any reduction in such transport; indeed, there is a strong case for allowing additional provision.
<P>
The question is whether we should specifically exempt from the Bill transport for people with disabilities. I am advised--the Minister might like to say a few words on this matter later--that it would be difficult to do so because it is impossible to quantify the amount of traffic within that category. It is possible to work out how many vehicles for registered disabled people are on the road, but it is not possible to work out how many miles such vehicles travel. It would be best, therefore, not to include that exemption in the Bill. However, any strategy to reduce road traffic would have to take into account the possibility of increased use of traffic for that purpose.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 would exempt bikes and motor bikes. We recognise that it has substance. We have already covered ordinary cycles, which will, of course, be exempt from the Bill because they are not mechanically propelled, although as the hon. Member for Christchurch said, they may be mechanically repaired. Motor bikes are a more difficult issue. We would like to allow for further consideration on that point. It is not always the case that motor bikes are less polluting. I am told that some of the more powerful motor bikes are less fuel efficient per person even than motor cars. It may not be right to set a blanket exemption for motor bikes. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw amendment No. 7, and not push it to a vote.
<P>
I am mindful of time, and I shall draw my remarks to a close. I plead guilty to being one of the people who telephoned the hon. Member for Christchurch last night. I was not guilty of misunderstanding the purpose of the Committee stage; I simply wished to find out how the hon. Gentleman intended the amendments to be debated. As I said, some of them have substance, and some of them make useful points. I wished to know, however, whether the hon. Gentleman intended to use them to spin out time and to make it difficult to get the Bill through Committee.
<P>
The matter was given some illumination this morning, and it is now easier to understand what the hon. Gentleman has in mind. I fervently hope that he does not intend constantly to frustrate the Committee's progress. Such an approach would be very bad for his party's reputation, and I am quite sure that he would not be supported by Conservative Members if he were to adopt it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I join in paying tribute to you, Mr. Stevenson, to the hon. Member for Ceredigion, to the Minister and to those who worked with her in helping to bring proposals before Parliament that are likely to meet the wishes of the House and of the Committee and to be made law.
<P>
The only serious problem that we face, besides the question of whether improvements to the Bill can be proposed and improved, is timing. Because of the progress--or lack of it--of another Bill, no one should be under any illusions about the fact that private Member's Bills will face severe difficulties this year.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ceredigion asked whether the Conservative side of the House--not of the Committee--will delay the Bill. The answer is no. The previous Government made progress possible in relation to local targets, and Conservative Members would like to do the same with regard to national targets. In the later stages of their consideration of the Bill, hon. Members will see that many of the issues properly raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch can be taken into account by the Minister in reporting to Parliament and in setting the targets.
<P>
It is clear that the main reason for the growth in road traffic, and to some extent for that in rail traffic, is prosperity. We face a double challenge. We must consider what happened in the past and what is likely to happen as this country, in the same way as others, becomes more prosperous. We should not wait until an absurd limit is reached, and everyone is driving around in a car 24 hours a day, and therefore there cannot be more road traffic--not that such circumstances are possible.
<P>
The matter involves communal interest. We should work out ways of ensuring that, as people become better off, the pursuit of individual interests can lead to less congestion, less use of vehicles, less unnecessary use of vehicles and less growth in vehicle use. The best way of doing that is openly to consider how people can be encouraged to choose to make fewer and shorter journeys, rather than how they can be made to do so.
<P>
That point can be illustrated fairly simply. If I were to have the choice of changing my job or where I live--many people have such choices every year--I could take into account the reduction of the journey burden. I would gain by spending less time charging around in a car, bus or train. Instead of the habit of the 1970s, when roads improved, and people spent 40 minutes in a traffic jam to travel from Hayes to work in Heathrow--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman would assist me by raising issues that relate to the amendments instead of rehearing what may be interpreted as Second Reading issues.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Absolutely, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
With specific regard to amendment No. 5, I should say that people could take advantage of improvements, and spend 40 minutues travelling 40 miles rather than four miles. That illustrates the problem.
<P>
Amendment No. 25 is the most interesting amendment in the group, and I do not say that just because I have added my name to it. The question is whether the definition in the amendment is better than the one in the Bill. The subsidiary question is whether, if we choose to accept amendment No. 25, we should try to amend the Bill further so that it is consistent with local road traffic targets. We cannot consider that in detail yet, because I have not tabled such an amendment, but I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch for prompting me to think about it. It would be even better if the advisers to the Bill's promoter and the Minister would consider whether such an amendment would be suitable. It would seem to fit in with the Bill's title, and I am sure that it could happen at a later stage.
<P>
I do not regard bicycles and motor bicycles as the most important issue. The difference between propulsion and transmission has been well illustrated. We are therefore left with the question of the disabled. We should do no more than ask the Minister to say at some stage how she plans to take their needs and interests into account. She will be able to say that much public transport has now been required to be made more accessible--even when it is not required, it is in the interests of public transport operators to make their vehicles more accessible. I pay tribute to the mobility unit in the Minister's Department for the way in which it has worked with people to find practicable and often profitable ways of making public transport more accessible.
<P>
If I were disabled and there was an affordable, reliable and accessible public transport alternative, I would be just as likely to choose that over my own car or arrangements as an able-bodied person with no disability to overcome. We ought, therefore, to accept amendment No. 25.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should have declared an interest before. I do not think that it is relevant to the Bill, but perhaps it should go on the record. I am the director of a business that counts cars going into car parks.
<P>
Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch described me as sage. If I were to extend the herb theme, I would say that he was thyme. I hope that he does not take up too much of it during the rest of our sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Thank you, Chair. The only point that I ask the Minister to respond to is whether--
<P>
<B>Mr Chope:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Is it in order for the hon. Gentleman to address you as ``the Chair'' or ``Chair''?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have been called some interesting things in my time, but I think that a Chairman is normally referred to as Mr. or Mrs. whatever their name is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Stevenson. Does the Minister think that amendment No. 5, which would require a reduction in public transport traffic, would remove the viable alternative to the private car that the Government are seeking to achieve and thus reduce people's options to travel?
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> May I add my welcome to those that you have already been given, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion spoke of feeling a sense of humour in presenting the Bill to the Committee. I am sure that all members of the Committee feel it an equal honour to be in the Committee with him and join me in acknowledging the hard work that he and Friends of the Earth have done. I was grateful for his acknowledgement of the work that my officials and parliamentary counsel have also been engaged in.
<P>
I am mindful of the remarks of the hon. Member for Worthing, West regarding ``time'' and I shall therefore attempt to keep my comments brief. When he opened our proceedings this morning, the hon. Member for Christchurch begged for your protection, Mr. Stevenson, in the light of telephone calls that he had from those whom he regarded as accusing him of not supporting the Bill. If he was serious about protection, he should not have made an almost hour-long speech. I am sure that I am not alone in feeling that his aim was to prevent the Bill from reaching the statute book.
<P>
Digging into his speech, his main concern seemed to be that amendment No. 25, which I support, would disadvantage people with disabilities. That is not the case. Moreover, the Bill could not list all the potential vehicles. That is not within the powers of primary legislation. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman's amendments can be accepted. If we accepted amendment No. 5, which eradicates the phrase ``public transport'', and then accepted, which I trust the Committee will not do, amdendments Nos. 6 and 7, there would be a big hole, because they require insertions after the word ``transport''. But if amendment No. 5 is accepted, the word ``transport'' disappears, so it is an incongruous sequence of amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 25 gives a closer definition of what constitutes a public transport vehicle. The main aim is to ensure a reduction in vehicles that carry, at best, only two--a driver and an additional person--but, in the main, only one person. That is why we believe the amendment adds clarity to the Bill. We strongly urge the Committee to accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): I sympathise with the motive behind amendment No. 25, but I am curious to know why it is limited to eight passengers. Some vehicles, such as hackney carriages, which already have access to bus lanes, can carry more than one or two passengers and provide a public transport function.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> If I am incorrect, I shall write to my hon. Friend, but I understand that the purpose is to ensure that vehicles that may have two extra seats but can be defined as public transport vehicles do not fall into this category. We are looking at vehicles that are provided by voluntary organisations with specific aims. I touched earlier on the transportation of people with disabilities. We would not wish that facility to be excluded because it does not fit in with the definition of public transport or how it is funded or presented.
<P>
We believe that amendment No. 25 assists the Bill. We hope that the Committee will accept it. Equally, we hope that the hon. Member for Christchurch will withdraw his amendment, which does nothing but cloud and fog the issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I want to raise a couple of points. The first follows from the discussion about hackney carriages, or taxis. I do not want to argue their merits too strongly, but they can underpin changes in lifestyle that should be encouraged if we are to reduce road traffic radically.
<P>
In our house we have gone down from two cars to one. The private ownership of cars is important. If one owns a car, there is always the temptation to use it. The result of going from two cars to one is that we walk more and use buses more, but we also use taxis more, because of their flexibility and convenience. They can underpin changes in lifestyle which could help to achieve the targets in the Bill.
<P>
I am not an expert on motor cycles--I avoid them like a plague--but a wide range of vehicles can be called motor cycles. We must reduce the impact of polluting, noisy, powerful motor cycles, but motors can be attached to pedal cycles, which, in hilly towns like Lancaster, can make cycling more accessible to older and less fit people and encourage them to get out on two wheels rather than four. There are also low-powered motor cycles, which I do not think many people would choose if they wanted to look good riding, but again they provide an efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to the motor car and can be part of a range of transport options that could take us away from the problems of congestion and pollution.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution. I am mindful that taxis and minicabs, or private hire vehicles, are perceived--it is the Government's perception too--as part of the public transport system. That is particularly important, as the hon. Member for Ceredigion said, in relation to the provision of public transport in rural areas. I hope that the Committee will accept that this is an issue to which I shall be happy to return on Report.
<P>
On the issue of motor cycles and cycles that genuinely move only by mechanical transmission, I accept some of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson), but we wish to see a reduction in road traffic, not exclusively because of the pollution that it emits. I accept that, in many instances, motor cycles are cleaner than cars, but there are many other pollution aspects to the ever-growing use of our roads as the primary or, in some instances, sole means of transport.
<P>
The Bill is valuable because it builds on existing road traffic reduction Acts for local authorities and acknowledges that the country cannot go on as it is without a move towards presenting us all with genuine choices about the way in which we travel, the journeys that we make and the mode of transport that we use. I have said that I am prepared to re-examine the issue of taxis and private hire vehicles in a public transport context. We could go on discussing the definition of a positive contribution in this area for ever, and the Bill should not be exclusively about lists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Had the Minister concluded?
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I had.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to speak?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> It is a pity that the Minister concluded her remarks at that moment. I was about to suggest to her that an appropriate course of action might be for her and the Bill's promoter to agree to withdraw amendment No. 25 now and to bring back on Report an amendment that reflects the Committee's desire to ensure that taxis are included on a par with other forms of public service vehicle. The Minister, who assisted the hon. Member for Ceredigion in drafting the Bill, has already had two stabs at it. It would be rather messy to try to amend amendment No. 25 to reflect the Committee's views in the way that the Minister agrees she would be content to see. It would be better for the onus to be on the promoter to withdraw it and to put matters right with the support of Government draftsmen in the interim. We would then have a chance of having a better Bill. It was unfair of the Minister to ascribe unworthy motives to me.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister might be impatient to get on, but she needs to face up to the fact that Parliament has an important scrutiny role. The other day in a Committee, the Minister refused to give way to interventions on half a dozen or more occasions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I seek the hon. Gentleman's assistance. He should refer to the amendments, which are what the Committee is all about. I look to all hon. Members to restrict themselves to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Stevenson. It is important for all members of the Committee to have the chance of benefiting from your strong chairmanship. That would ensure that we had the maximum exchange of views and that we could improve the Bill where necessary. The constituent--it was a constitutent and not the hon. Member for Ceredigion--who told me last night that it would be unreasonable of me to table amendments will be pleased by the report of today's proceedings. That constitutent will see that, as a result of the arguments that I and other hon. Members have deployed, the Bill's promoter has agreed to reconsider the issue of people with disabilities. He has accepted that it is not the Bill's intention to reduce the amount of road traffic generated by or on behalf of people with disabilities. He has said that he is prepared to consider the matter further because of his understandable concern. If I am wrong in my interpretation of what the hon. Gentleman was saying, I will give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> All I meant was that the need to allow an increase in the use of vehicles by disabled people should be considered in the strategies that will be drawn up to implement the Bill's provisions. I did not mean that the Bill should be amended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> In that case, I am disappointed. I thought that the hon. Gentleman had accepted that an increase in the use that disabled people make of motor vehicles was desirable. He was, by analogy, arguing that the only way to demonstrate in the Bill that the Government and the Committee were in favour of increasing the use of public transport vehicles was to include the definition in amendment No. 25. I understood him to be saying that it was important for both categories of vehicle that we are discussing to be dealt with on the same basis in the Bill. If it is possible to allow an increase in the use of vehicles by disabled people through an amendment or by including a reference to that matter in the strategy document--which will support the Bill, whenever it is produced--why is it not possible to have a similar reference to public service vehicles? The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre made an eloquent point about hackney carriages. A reference to public service vehicles would allow hackney carriages to be incorporated and special targets to be set for them. It may well be that we should aim to double the number of taxis on our roads and that by so doing we could signficantly reduce other forms of road traffic. Indeed, you, Mr. Stevenson, may be aware that some more enlightened rail companies are offering fares that include the use of a taxi at the point of arrival to take a person from the station to his or her ultimate destination. That is integrated transport working for the benefit of the environment to reduce unnecessary road traffic. I am disappointed if the Bill's promoter, the hon. Member for Ceredigion, is saying that he will not further consider that point.
<P>
I intend to withdraw amendment No. 7 in the light of the fact that the Minister will give further consideration to the issue of motorcycles.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I made no commitment to examine that issue. With the agreement of my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion, I give the commitment that the issue of public transport vehicles in the form of taxis and private hire vehicles will be reconsidered on Report, not least because we are mindful of the specific and particular difficulties in many rural areas of providing what could, in an urban context, be deemed public transport vehicles. I made no commitment whatever to readdress the issue of excluding motorcycles.
<P>
<B>Mr Chope:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for part of what she said, which is now on the record in unambiguous terms, but I am disappointed that she is not demonstrating a willingness to reconsider the issue of motorcycles. I understood that the Committee felt that there was a case for exempting the more fuel-efficient motorcycles. I hope that the promoter of the Bill will consider that point.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members will feel that we have had a constructive and productive debate. The issue is which of the amendments, if any, should be pushed to a vote and which should be withdrawn. In the light of our debate, I shall not press amendment No. 5 to a vote. However, I seek further clarification from the Minister and the promoter of the Bill about how they plan to bring the definition of ``road traffic'' into line with that in the 1997 Act. That point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West.
<P>
I do not know whether the hon. Member for Ceredigion is in a position to say whether he would accept such an amendment if it were moved. He was diffident about explaining why the Bill contains a different definition from the Act, and I found that disappointing. I do not know whether he can enlighten us further on that point. I find it extraordinary that the promoter of the Bill, who was also closely associated with the Act, is prepared to have a different definition of road traffic in the Bill but is not prepared to justify why traffic on local authority roads should be categorised differently from traffic on trunk roads and motorways, and is not prepared to reconsider the issue. I know that I have an ally in my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West, and we will seek to ensure that on Report the definition of road traffic is consistent with that used by local authorities in setting targets.
<P>
I intend to withdraw amendment No. 5 and, in the light of what has been said, I shall not press amendment No. 6 to a vote because I hope that we shall have the chance to debate that further on Report. I hope that we shall also have the chance to debate the issues arising from amendment No. 7 on Report. Perhaps those who wish to use their pedal cycles when going uphill in Lancaster and Wyre, if nowhere else in the country, will lobby the Bill's supporters, make their mark and find themselves a special place in parliamentary history. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Amendment No. 8 is a probing amendment. It is drafted in terms that most members of the Committee will find familiar. I am rather surprised that the Minister for Transport in London has not signed the amendment. On 23 January 1997, when the hon. Lady was a Back-Bench Member, she signed early-day motion 289 calling for a 10 per cent. national traffic reduction target to be set by the then Government. On 8 February 1997, on Hampstead high street, in her own constituency, she also signed the Road Traffic Reduction Bill petition, calling for 10 per cent. national traffic reduction by 2010. I am sorry to see the Minister scowling. My amendment gives her the opportunity to show that she meant what she said and did on two separate occasions just over a year ago.
<P>
I do not want to personalise this matter. [Laughter.] I agree with the hon. Member for Ceredigion that a substantial number of other Ministers and supporters signed early-day motion 18. They might have been recipients of Traffic Reduction File 10, in which they would have read the headline article, ``Landslide Support For Bill'' and seen the quotes from not only the Minister but also the Minister of Transport, who is a member of the Cabinet. The latter wrote to somebody called Kay Allen on 17 January 1997:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I strongly support the objective of this Bill. There is an urgent need to reduce road traffic''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A Minister of State and two Under-Secretaries at the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions added their views, and the Minister for London and Construction, the hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), wrote to his local paper:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I have always made my views clear . . .  our over-riding priority must be to reduce the total volume of traffic''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He wrote to a constituent in October 1996 to ``reiterate'' his support
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for traffic reduction, both locally and nationally''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister of State with responsibility for regional development has also, according to the file, signed early-day motions supporting national traffic reduction targets.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Instead of regaling us with the reported views of all and sundry Government Members and other hon. Members, will the hon. Gentleman tell us when he had the blinding revelation that he should change his mind totally on the issue and come to the Committee with amendments which he made it clear on Second Reading he could not possibly support?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I ask the hon. Gentleman to bear with me and hear the burden of my argument. He will then understand the context in which I am promoting my amendment. He referred to the reported views of himself and many of his hon. Friends, including Ministers in the Government whom he worships. As I understand it, they were their actual views--not just their reported views--and I am sure that when the Minister told people in Hampstead high street just over a year ago that she supported the Road Traffic Reduction Bill and the setting of a 10 per cent. target, she was not deceiving her electors but genuinely believed what she said. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that, although the Minister's name, signature and the address of the House of Commons appear on that petition, she did not support it or that any of the other hon. Members who signed the early-day motion did not support that.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the date is central to the concerns that were felt, because we were labouring under a Conservative Government at that time? There was no hope whatever of the incumbent Government even acknowledging the need for such a Bill--they would certainly not have facilitated a private Member's Bill. Happily, that situation no longer prevails.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman resumes his speech, I think that he has, in his inimitable and effective way, made his point about the Minister's attitude a year ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am glad that you support my arguments, Mr. Stevenson. However, the Minister must not be allowed to get away with suggesting that when she signed the petition in Hampstead high street, the then Government were not actively involved in the Road Traffic Reduction Bill, which became an Act.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Kicking and screaming.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister says, kicking and screaming. She is grudging in her recognition of anything that is done.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> Vengeful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister says that she is vengeful, which is a new one for the Committee. I thought she was accusing me--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am examining the amendments and I can see no reference to the Minister's demeanour. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would speak to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I accept that the Minister's demeanour can be reported only by words that appear in the record and I have done that, so it is unnecessary to do it again.
<P>
My introduction to this discussion of amendment No. 8 refers to Traffic Reduction File 10. A number of Ministers, when in opposition, supported the setting of specific targets for road traffic reduction. There was a reference in that document to ``landslide support for Bill'' and it was thought that they were supporting the Bill published by Friends of the Earth in January 1998, which included in clause 2 the very terms that are now repeated in amendment No. 8.
<P>
It is reasonable to ask the promoter of the Bill and the Minister a question that was not asked on Second Reading. If the idea of setting specific targets, as set out in the amendment, seemed so attractive to them a few weeks ago, why has that now been withdrawn?
<P>
One of the purposes of a Standing Committee is to probe and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West said in a seated interjection, this is a probing amendment. I hope that our debate will be short and succinct and that we shall have a proper explanation from the promoter and the Minister of why the Bill is an emasculated version of what was called for in early-day motion 18, which was supported by all members of the Committee except my hon. Friends the Members for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) and for Wycombe (Sir R. Whitney). It was also signed and supported by you, Mr. Stevenson.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that this is a probing amendment and that he does not intend to press it to a Division. It is normal practice for probing amendments to reflect the general views of those who table them. Has the hon. Gentleman now concluded that there should be ambitious targets such as 10 per cent., even if they are not in the Bill, or is he saying that not only should we have such targets, but they should be in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I know the well-known tactic that attack is the best form of defence. When the hon. Gentleman responds to my probing questions, I hope that he will be a lot more candid than when we discussed the matter on Second Reading. When we have heard both his explanation and a better explanation from the Minister of why she has changed her tune, I shall be more able to judge the arguments that lie behind what appears to be a volte face by Ministers and many of their supporters. I know that it may be uncomfortable--
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would care to withdraw the phrase ``volte face by Ministers'', as it is inaccurate and misleading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I look forward to the Minister's explaining why the phrase ``volte face'' is inaccurate and misleading. If, having heard her explanation, it is obvious that my accusation does not stand up, I shall withdraw it. However, at the moment, I am not exactly in a prosecuting role, but I am asking questions that demand explanation. So far, there has been no explanation from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman's statement is inaccurate and misleading in its use of the word ``Ministers''. The evidence that has has submitted to the Committee this morning consists of statements made before I or my hon. Friends were Ministers, when the Government of the day was the lamentable one that he chose to serve.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that all hon. Members are aware of the date of the previous general election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> In the light of the Minister's explanation, I certainly shall not withdraw my accusation, because she is engaging in semantics. She is trying to argue that a Member of Parliament may make a statement before a general election and may argue after the election, if the party that she supports has got into government and she has become a member of that Government, that nothing that she said before the general election counts. She maintains that they are starting a completely fresh sheet and that she cannot now be questioned or held to account for anything that she said in the run-up to the general election, when those whose support she sought listened to her in Hampstead high street.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I asked the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the phrase ``volte face by Ministers''. He did not say ``volte face by Members of Parliament''; he did not say ``volte face by a particular Member''. He said that it was a ``volte face by Ministers''. There is only one Government at a time in this country; at the moment, they are the Government whom I am privileged to honour and serve. The period of time to which he referred was when the lamentable Government whom he supported were in power. I ask him again to withdraw that misleading remark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister is now proposing that if a Minister or a Prime Minister--there have been examples already of the Prime Minister saying something before the election and now doing something rather different--does or says something that is totally at odds with what he said before an election, I cannot accuse him of a volte face. My comment was extremely fair, and I shall stand by what I said.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman offers an interesting way to approach all problems: that a title may be conferred by anyone who wants to do so. I understand that the title of Minister is the right of the electorate; it soes not rest in the hon. Gentleman's hands. I ask him again to withdraw his misleading and inaccurate statement.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will either withdraw or not. The point about what may or may not have been said and in what capacity has been laboured for the past 15 minutes. I am becoming worried about repetition. It is up to the hon. Gentleman whether he withdraws or not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I share your anxiety about the matter, Mr. Stevenson. I envisage the Minister--
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Is it in order for the hon. Gentleman to fail to withdraw something that is plainly nonsense and inaccurate? It has been drawn to his attention on a number of occasions, and he is delaying the Committee with his persistent obduracy.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Members of the Committee will have noted my concern about delays to our proceedings. However, it is up to individual hon. Members to decide whether to withdraw any statements that they have made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Before the hon. Member for Islington, North intervenes, I want to say that I am concerned that some Labour Members will try to portray me as responsible for delaying the Committee's proceedings. Clearly, the repeated interventions of hon. Members are to blame. Perhaps I will be chastised for my generosity in giving way, which is in such stark contrast to the Minister's normal behaviour. Surely it is wrong for members of the Committee, especially Labour Members, to create a situation in which my generosity in responding to their challenges enables them to claim that I am responsible for delaying proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyne:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. If a Member of the Committee makes a statement that he knows to be inaccurate, and the inaccuracy is drawn to his attention, he could be said to be misleading the Committee if that statement is not challenged and later withdrawn. He must therefore be required to withdraw the statement.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have already made my views known on withdrawing statements--it is entirely up to the Member. In the interests of the Committee making progress, I repeat that during the two hours and one minute that we have been sitting, you, Mr. Chope, have spoken for 74 minutes. Irrespective of whether Members regard that as a delay, those are the facts of the matter. I urge members of the Committee to be as brief and succinct as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am sure that in your timekeeping and refereeing, Mr. Stevenson, you have taken note of the time spent dealing with points raised by Labour Members. I do not need to tell you that in your capacity as Chairman you would have immediately brought me to order if at any stage I had failed to address my remarks to the amendments. I venture to suggest that I have been speaking for a large proportion of the time because much of our debate this morning has concerned amendments that I proposed. Surely no one should therefore be surpised that I have spent a long time debating. When I was a Minister, I found that if the Government were proposing the amendments the Minister would be expected to speak to them and answer points made about them, which would inevitably take up more time than would be taken up by Members questioning the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> My hon. Friend said that the amendment was a probing one, which would require a short speech. At the risk of playing on words again, when does a short probe become a long bore?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I shall not be drawn to answer my hon. Friend's point, as I might be tempted to refer--
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. If an hon. Member has tabled an amendment that has been selected and called by you, and fails to get around to moving it, at what point would you accept a closure motion?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am bearing that point closely in mind. I urgently request that we return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to you for looking after me, Mr. Stevenson. The hon. Member for Islington, North, who wants to rough me up, is trying to put me off my stride but is not going divert my attention from the amendment. I recall that I moved it formally. If that is not your recollection, Mr. Stevenson, I shall move it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As I recall, the hon. Gentleman did refer to moving the amendment and to its nature. We should now get back to its purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The purpose of the amendment, shared by everyone who signed the early-day motion, was to reduce the level of road traffic compared with 1990 when it was significantly lower, probably by about 25 per cent. From the Minister's ``National Road Traffic Forecast (Great Britain) 1997'', we know that by 2010--the date to which the amendment refers--road traffic is forecast to be significantly higher than it is today, even given the Government's policy to increase the cost of fuel by 6 per cent. above inflation each year.
<P>
The amendment tests the attitudes of the Government and the hon. Member for Ceredigion and is intended to find out whether the Bill's wording, which is different from that circulated to supporters of Friends of the Earth in January, resulted from a recognition that the targets set were unrealistic and impossible to achieve. Does he still believe in those targets, although he does not wish them to be in the Bill but to be introduced by subterfuge through the powers that the Bill will give to the Minister?
<P>
The travelling public and road users have a right to know whether the Bill's promoter and the Government intend to reduce road traffic by about 50 per cent., as implied in my amendment, or whether they have relented and faced up to the reality that economic growth means increases in traffic. We want to reduce the rate of increase.
<P>
Without specific targets the Bill is a pale shadow of what was said before. Many people are concerned about the environment, health, the consequences of CO2 emissions for global warming, road safety and mobility and freedom. They include people living in rural and semi-rural areas; 65 per cent. of people have no access to public transport. Those people demand to know whether the promoter of the Bill and the Government intend to impose a ludicrous 50 per cent. reduction in road traffic compared to 1990.

<P>

<B>Mr. Drew:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Is it in order for an hon. Member who has flagrantly moved an amendment in which he does not believe, to continue to push it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am persistently trying to probe the minds of hon. Members in my attempt to chair the Committee to the best of my ability. The answer is that I have no idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I can understand your frustration, Mr. Stevenson, and that of the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) who has, in his short time in the House of Commons, contributed significantly to promoting rural interests. He has been a pain in the neck for many of his hon. Friends on the Front Bench. He has been fearless in that--and in raising his point of order. You, Mr. Stevenson, as a signatory to the early-day motion, must have been wondering why the traffic reduction targets that have been set out specifically in successive early-day motions and Bills have, in the couple of weeks since the publication of the National Road Traffic Forecasts, been withdrawn. That is the essence of my probing amendment. I hope for an explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Will my hon. Friend accept my apology for the way I spoke in a previous intervention?
<P>
Before he reacted to the point of order made by the hon. Member for Stroud he was putting a sensible question about what the Minister and the hon. Member for Ceredigion had in mind in changing the formulation. It would have been more useful if my hon. Friend had said that he preferred the new wording to the old. The Minister or the promoter could have spoken for 10 or 15 minutes and there might have been the sort of discussion that would normally take place on clause stand part. My hon. Friend should consider whether some of his ways of approaching the amendments are delaying the explanation and debate that the Committee should be conducting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> My hon. Friend has tremendous experience in such matters, having served with distinction as a transport Minister. He will know that some hon. Members are more willing than others to provide answers and explanations. My hon. Friend has always been assiduous in dealing with issues on their merits and tackling the arguments. I am concerned to press this issue hard. I am not sure how much of the debate my hon. Friend took part in on Second Reading but he would, while there, have noted a marked reluctance by the promoter and certain sponsors to explain the difference between the present Bill and what he thought he was supporting when he first signed the early-day motion and became a sponsor.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West asks me to decide what attitude I shall adopt towards clause 2, in the light of what the hon. Member for Ceredigion and the Minister may say in response. I am sure that if my hon. Friend had tabled an amendment he would think it fair to wait to hear the response before reaching a conclusion. During the debate on clause 1, as soon as I suggested that I would withdraw amendment No. 5, I noticed a marked reluctance to respond to the concern that had been expressed about the matter of consistency between the Bill and the 1997 Act. Inevitably, one has to respond to the atmosphere in a Committee. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West is right and that my questions will receive a proper response.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I may be able to help the Committee. The Bill on local government targets went through a process of discussion, compromise and agreement, and this Bill has clearly gone through that process, too. We cannot make up our minds about the merits of an amendment or a clause unless the Bill's promoter and the Minister have spoken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> That is certainly right. My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West invites you, Mr. Stevenson, to decide whether the Minister and the promoter of the Bill should give an interim response to my amendment. I should listen to their comments and go on to speak on the other amendments that appear in my name. Before my hon. Friend's intervention, I had intended to speak in my opening remarks to all of the amendments. I interpret your silence, Mr. Stevenson, to mean that a reasonable way in which to proceed--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I called amendment No. 8, which is in the hon Gentleman's name, and the amendments that the Committee agreed should be grouped with it. I am sure that all Committee members know that implicit in that agreement is an awareness that it would not be acceptable to debate each of the amendments ad nauseam. Amendments are grouped to help the Committee make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am sure that all Committee members agree that we should not do anything that might lead to nausea.
<P>
I spoke to the hon. Member for Ceredigion last night about amendment No. 11, which is a technical amendment. There should be different reports in different circumstances, rather than one national report. I hope that he approves of the amendment and agrees that there should be not one report but separate reports for different circumstances. If I understood him correctly when we spoke last night, he is concerned about whether there should be separate reports for separate regions--I believe that he has tabled an amendment to that effect, which we shall come to later.
<P>
Amendment No. 24 would insert in the Bill the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reducing the rate of increase of road traffic growth''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a very serious amendment. It relates to our economic prosperity as a nation and to our international and regional competitiveness. If Parliament imposes unrealistic, unattainable and unacceptable requirements in its efforts to reduce road traffic, the consequences for our economy and for the people's quality of life would be dire.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> For the past hour or so we have had a rather tortuous lecture from the hon. Gentleman about the Bill's consistency. Would it be reasonable to conclude that he is simply seeking to frustrate the Bill's progress? Is that why he tabled amendment No. 24, which is wholly inconsistent with amendment No. 8? Can the hon. Gentleman offer another explanation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I can give one explanation immediately. It is part of my purpose to embarrass the Government and their supporters out of their silence on this matter. I know that the hon. Member for Islington, North shares my concern. If my knowledge and understanding of where he is coming from is correct, he must be as dismayed as many others that the Bill's wording differs from the draft. That is the short answer to the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> There must be a longer answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The other part--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. No matter what views an hon. Member may have about contributions made by other hon. Members, each hon. Member is entitled to be heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Stevenson. For protecting what appear to be minority rights. The Bill's promoter knows what it is like to be in a minority in the House, because of his views on fox hunting. He, I am sure, will be broad-minded and generous in responding to hon. Members, even those expressing a minority view.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will treat amendment No. 24 seriously. It asks that we should set targets for reducing the rate of increase of road traffic growth. That will be a much easier way of taking the public with us. It is more realistic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> Reducing the rate of traffic growth will still encourage an increase in traffic. Can the hon. Gentleman explain that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am not saying that it will encourage an increase. It allows an increase, but recognises that in not one country in the developed world has road traffic fallen nationally unless that fall was associated with a dramatic economic decline. The figures for traffic growth in the United Kingdom show that only during the recession, when the previous Government were in office, was there an abatement of the rate of growth--that was for only one year; and only in some areas was there a reduction in the amount of road traffic.
<P>
There is a link. It is spelled out in detail in the ``National Road Traffic Forecasts'' and all the data that underlies it. There is an inexorable link--my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West referred to it earlier--between road traffic growth and economic prosperity. There is also a relationship between road traffic--
<P>
<B>Mr. Dafis:</B> There is no point in desisting from intervening on the ground that we want to facilitate matters. Time is being wasted, so we may as well make our points now.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman should recall the words of the previous Secretary of State for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who forcefully made the point that the link between economic growth and traffic growth had to be broken. Unless that link is broken and we cease to associate economic improvement with increased traffic, it will lead to a national decline in the quality of life. That statement was probably the most distinguished environmental commitment made by the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I agree with such a wish list. I agree that the link should be broken. I hope that the hon. Gentleman and the Minister can say how it can be done. It ill behoves our sovereign Parliament to prescribe targets based on wishful thinking, without setting out details of how they are to be achieved.
<P>
<B>Ms Joan Walley </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, North): At the risk of delaying our proceedings further, I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the latest report from the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment and urge him, in the interests of road traffic reduction, to allow the Committee to make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Committee is making much greater progress than many others. If I had wanted to delay the Committee--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know time is getting on, but it is not in the gift of any hon. Members to delay proceedings--ensuring that progress is made is the Chairman's responsibility.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I accept your ruling, Mr. Stevenson. When people criticise me for delaying the Committee, they are implicitly criticising you for allowing me to speak when I am in order. That issue is clearly preoccupying Labour Members. If I had wanted to delay the Bill and not address the issues, I could have encouraged a debate on the sittings motion or debated other amendments at greater length; I could have tabled a host of amendments that were not relevant to the substance of the Bill. Instead, I chose to focus the Committee's attention on the vital issue of the difference between road traffic reduction and reduction in the rate of increase of road traffic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbyn:</B> The hon. Gentleman believes that the growth of road traffic cannot be halted or reduced; he talks only of controlling the rate of growth. When he was a Minister, he went through the debates about road building and encountered much opposition to his Government's road building plans. Does not he accept that, unless we reduce the traffic on the road in real terms--including car usage and mileage--the cost to the country will be a huge amount of road building, with all the accompanying environmental damage? His Government turned their back on those environmental consequences, but our Government are not committed to such a road-building programme. Either we create a problem in the near future or we decide now, as a society, to end out love affair with the car and start reducing the amount of road traffic by introducing a rational system of integrated public transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises what I would describe as Second Reading issues. I am concerned about the impact of road traffic. We should not be concerned about an individual vehicle per se--we should direct our attack to that vehicle's adverse effect on the environment, road safety, health and the economy, if the vehicle is involved in heavy congestion.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman represents a London constituency and even if he says it should be better served, London is well served by public transport. Sixty-five per cent. of people in this country do not have access to public transport. If the hon. Gentleman is truly keen to increase public transport availability, he should address that issue before penalising those who at the moment do not have a choice about car use. I want to explore the implications for orinary people of the Government's policies and I hope that I can do so in our next sitting.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will accept amendment No. 24, which deals with the reduction in the rate of road traffic growth. It is but the first stage in a process of changing people's attitudes. This morning, I received a letter from a constituent who is a supporter of Friends of the Earth. She said at the outset that she was concerned about the rate of increase in road traffic, but she did not say that she wanted absolute reductions. She is a realistic as the next person and knows that we have an aging population, with increased numbers of women drivers--as a result of women having been given greater opportunities--and significantly increased numbers of women in the older age groups.
