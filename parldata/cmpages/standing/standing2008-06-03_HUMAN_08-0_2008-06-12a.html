<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000310"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Dawn Primarolo):</b>
I have one last point to make in response to the issues raised by hon.
Members.</div><a name="0806133000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East asked about whether the
fact that a child was donor-conceived should be on the birth
certificate. In recognising the difficulty that others, such as the
Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Royal College of Midwives, have
with that being on a public document, he raised the prospect of whether
one way round the problem would be to have two birth
certificates&#151;one public and one private. The private one would
be longer and would indicate that the individual was
donor-conceived.</div><a name="0806133000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not express an opinion either way, because we are discussing one
of the options that we would need to consider when carrying out a
review, which we have committed ourselves to doing within four years of
the Bill coming into force. The question is whether there is a way in
which the law can be changed to balance the issues that hon. Members
have raised&#151;the right to know of the donor-conceived child
against the rights of the donor and anonymity&#151;and to make
progress. That is certainly the sort of issue that could be explored,
and that was why the Government decided that it was better to consider
it in the context of a review and to report back to the
House.</div><a name="0806133000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule is long because it deals with England and Wales; where the law
varies in Scotland, it deals with Scotland, and it also deals with
Northern Ireland. Much of it is duplication, but for different
jurisdictions.</div><a name="0806133000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806133000311"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): In the previous sitting, the
Minister mentioned the pre-screening of embryos and that type of thing.
She made a perfectly valid point, but I think that she would recognise
that many diseases for which there is a genetic predisposition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>cannot be properly screened for, certainly at the embryo stage. Also,
over the 18 years before the child can make inquiries about his genetic
background, there might be other discoveries that link genetic factors
with illness. It is therefore not a complete answer to say that the
embryo that is the subject of in vitro fertilisation is privileged in
that respect. It will be privileged in some respects, but there will
still be a
problem.</div><a name="0806133000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000312"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am sorry to disagree, but I do not think that
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point makes the case either. First, to say
&#147;Well, something could happen in the future, but we don&#146;t
know,&#148; applies to us all. Secondly, the parents will have a duty
and all parents will want to do the best for their child. If something
happened before the individual was 18, the parents would clearly need
to think very carefully about what steps they might be able to take in
those circumstances. We are talking about screening for things that we
do not know that we need to be screened for. With respect, it is a
preposterous proposition to say that therefore this should apply to
somebody else. Of course, when the child gets to 18, they have an
absolute right to know the identity of the person. This is an
interesting debating point, but it does not shed any light on the
reasons why we would want to put the proposed information on the birth
certificate.</div><a name="0806133000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not saying that the Government have set their face against the
proposal. I am saying that this is a highly complex issue, which
balances a whole series of rights, including those of the donor. We
need to consider the possibilities in the light of the new legislation,
and that was why the four-year review was
proposed.</div>
<a name="0806133000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806133000313"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): I agree with
both the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for
Southport&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I know that that
is hard to do, but I am trying to bring members of the Committee
together.</div><a name="0806133000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be advances&#151;perhaps even genetic chips&#151;in the
future, and we might be able to screen for diseases that we cannot
screen for at the moment. Nevertheless, the Minister is right that we
cannot future-proof things, and my hon. Friend&#146;s point is not a
good enough argument for changing the current position. Indeed, I do
not think that it will ever be a good enough argument for invading the
privacy of families. There is always a risk that we will inherit
something&#151;life is full of risks.</div>
<a name="0806133000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000314"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> There is no end to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
talents. He is&#151;I say this genuinely, but also as a bit of a
joke, so I hope that he takes it in the right spirit&#151;a
conciliator as well. He makes the important point that the distance
between what I and the hon. Member for Southport are saying is not that
great. We are both saying that we need to consider the issue properly
and balance the rights of all those involved, and we should not do that
in
haste.</div><a name="0806133000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806133000315"></a><b class="B">Mark
Simmonds</b> (Boston and Skegness) (Con)

<a name="0806133000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000316"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> That was a good, conciliatory point to end on,
but the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness wants to intervene
first.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div><a name="0806133000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806133000317"></a><b class="B">Mark
Simmonds</b><b class="B">:</b> I understand what the Minister says, and
she is right that these matters are extremely complicated. Will she say
a little more, however, about how the Government came to the view that
four years was the appropriate length of time for the consultation?
Although these are complex issues, four years is still an
extraordinarily long time to take reaching a conclusion.</div>
<a name="0806133000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000318"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> We made a commitment to carry the review
forward within four years. As I said, the Government were seeking
common ground by making it clear that we had not set our face against
the proposal or decided on the issue in principle. We also clearly
needed time to assess things such as &#147;telling and
talking&#148;, the Donor Conception Network project and the extra
work on counselling. Equally, we were trying to meet the legitimate
concerns of Lord Jenkin, who proposed the four-year period in his
amendment in another place. We picked that up, but included the caveat
that the review would happen within four years. I assume that Lord
Jenkin was looking for a sunset provision to ensure that the review
would definitely be done by a certain time, although it could be done
earlier if necessary. That was why we settled on four years. To follow
on from the comments made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon, let me say that the Government were trying to be
conciliatory&#151;we were trying to find common ground.</div>

making of, a surrogacy
arrangement.&#146;.</div><a name="0806133000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
59 brings us back to surrogacy arrangements, which are not enforceable
in law, as the Minister correctly said. The Surrogacy Arrangements Act
1985 prohibits organisations or people, other than intended parents or
surrogate mothers, from undertaking certain activities relating to
surrogacy on a commercial basis, and that is absolutely
correct.</div>
<a name="0806133000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not-for-profit
bodies can charge a fee to initiate negotiations with a view to making
surrogacy arrangements and compiling information about surrogacy.
However, they are not allowed to receive payments for offering to
negotiate a surrogacy arrangement or for taking part in negotiations
about them. However, they are allowed to do such things if there is no
charge. There is thus potential for cross-subsidisation, with
not-for-profit organisations charging more for the activities for which
they are able to charge so that they can undertake those activities for
which they are not able to charge.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div><a name="0806133000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would ensure that cross-subsidy was prevented, and that charges that
were allowed for initiating negotiations or providing information could
be commensurate only with the costs incurred in fulfilling those
specific roles, and not in generating revenue so that not-for-profit
organisations could get involved in other
things.</div><a name="0806133000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000320"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> We have discussed various elements of surrogacy
as it relates to the Bill. Clause 59 amends the 1985 Act to clarify the
position in law of non-profit making surrogacy organisations. It makes
clear that they may charge for their services on a non-profit making
basis, and enables them to advertise the services for which they may
charge. Such bodies get involved in initiating negotiations with a view
to making surrogacy arrangements, and compiling information about
surrogacy with a view to its use in making or negotiating a surrogacy
arrangement. We recognise that it is difficult for surrogacy
organisations to provide a service for a small number of people who
seek advice and help with surrogacy in the UK if they are unable to
recoup the costs of providing those
services.</div><a name="0806133000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would ensure that non-profit surrogacy organisations could
recoup the costs incurred only for initiating or taking parting in
negotiations with a view to making surrogacy arrangements, or compiling
any information with a view to its use in making surrogacy
arrangements. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that that is what the Bill
does, albeit in a slightly different
way.</div><a name="0806133000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
59 says that an organisation may charge for certain activities, but
only if it is</div>
<a name="0806133000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not carried on
for
profit.&#148;</div><a name="0806133000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may charge for: initiating negotiations with a view to making a
surrogacy arrangement; enabling interested parties to meet each other
to discuss possible surrogacy arrangements; compiling information about
surrogacy with a view to its use in making or negotiating a surrogacy
arrangement; and establishing and keeping lists of people willing to be
surrogates or intended parents.</div>
<a name="0806133000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
absolutely assure the hon. Gentleman that subsections (2), (4) and (5)
insert provisions into the 1985 Act that achieve exactly the intentions
behind his amendment. I make it clear that the measure will allow
organisations to recoup the costs of providing these services only on a
not-for-profit basis. The provisions would enable not-for-profit
organisations to charge for putting couples in touch with each other,
but not for any more direct intervention in the discussion. I
appreciate that that is a fine line&#151;it is exactly the line that
the hon. Gentleman wants to ensure is in place&#151;but I assure him
and the Committee that the amendments to the 1985 Act are not intended
to turn surrogacy into a commercial industry. The arrangements will be
kept exactly as they are. The 1985 Act contained firm steps to ban any
commercialisation of surrogacy and that principle has not been
changed.</div><a name="0806133000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that those strong reassurances will satisfy the hon. Gentleman
that we have stayed on the correct side of the fine line. I am grateful
for the opportunity to spell that out
clearly.</div><a name="0806133000283"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="0806133000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000321"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
constructive response to my probing amendment and for her reassurance
that there is to be no movement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div>away from the principle that surrogacy is prohibited from becoming a
commercial activity in this country. I am assured from what she said
that the point behind the amendment is covered elsewhere in the
clause.</div><a name="0806133000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I withdraw the amendment, I want to point out that I am still somewhat
concerned about something. I do not suggest that non-profit
organisations in the surrogacy field would do so, but I am aware that
there are other non-profit organisations that are good at increasing
their cost base to make sure that they do not make any profit and that
they therefore come within the guidelines, but they do so while
increasing their revenue streams. We certainly would not want to deter
people from participation in surrogacy for financial reasons and
financial
purposes.</div><a name="0806133000058"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000322"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I agree about the importance of that. I should
also have made something clear to the hon. Gentleman about attempts at
a cross-subsidy&#151;something that he touched on&#151;by showing
that costs were very high for the introduction, on a so-called
not-for-profit basis. If there was seen to have been a cross-subsidy in
the arrangements, in any way, that would be an offence under the
Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985, and would be dealt with accordingly. I
hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman about
that.</div>
<a name="0806133000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000323"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful for that point, which clarifies
the only outstanding point I had to raise about the amendment. I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="0806133000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000324"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 179, in
clause 59, page 49, line 38, leave
out subsection
(7).</div><a name="0806133000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to advertising. At present, there is an outright ban
on advertising for surrogacy services. The purpose of the amendment is
to extract from the Minister what positive changes she believes will
come about as a result of the changes to the 1985 Act. I understand
that the clause would not allow profits to be used for advertising
services, except with regard to initiating or negotiating an agreement,
or compiling information. My understanding is that those concerned
would be able to advertise that they had a list of people who were
willing to be involved in surrogacy, for example.</div>
<a name="0806133000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
would return the rules on advertising to the existing ones under the
1985 Act and prevent not-for-profits from advertising any particular
services. I cannot see&#151;and I have not heard anywhere, prior to
our discussion now&#151;any defence of, or justification for, the
change. Presumably people who were thinking of using a surrogate would
be able to find the information anyway, without advertisements, because
they would have been interested in it and thinking about it for several
years. It would also be wrong to influence people by
advertisements.</div>
<a name="0806133000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would the
offences in relation to contravening the ban on advertising under the
clause be the same as for contravening other provisions of the 1985
Act, or would that be something additional to be included in a
subsequent Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div><a name="0806133000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000325"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s probing amendment
deals with the extent of what can be advertised and whether there is
variation from the provisions of the 1985 Act. I shall deal with those
specific questions.</div>
<a name="0806133000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
clause 59 amends the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985 to clarify the
position of non-profit making surrogacy organisations. It allows them
to charge for their services on a non-profit basis, and it also enables
them to advertise the services for which they may charge. The
activities that those bodies carry out involve the following:
initiating negotiations with a view to making surrogacy arrangements,
thus enabling interested parties to meet each other; and compiling
information about surrogates, with a view to using it in making or
negotiating surrogate arrangements&#151;to establish and keep lists
of willing surrogates and intended parents. Those two activities have
to be considered together. The question is how to put the intended
surrogate, the woman who is prepared to be a surrogate, and interested
parents in touch.</div>
<a name="0806133000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would remove the provision on advertising. At present, it is unlawful
for anyone to advertise that they are or may be willing to enter into a
surrogacy arrangement. It is also against the law for people to
advertise that they are looking for a surrogate or for intended
parents. Those provisions are contained in 1985 Act, and the Bill does
not change them. Clause 59(7) amends the 1985 Act to allow
non-profit-making bodies to advertise the services for which they may
charge&#151;for initiating or taking part in negotiations, or
compiling information with a view to making surrogacy
arrangements.</div>
<a name="0806133000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the
hon. Gentleman that the Bill clarifies what a not-for-profit
organisation can do without undertaking commercial surrogacy
activities. It can advertise its own services, but it would need to be
very clear about the fact that it has to stop at that point. What is
still prohibited is individuals advertising the fact that they are
looking for a surrogate and the publishing of names. Such specific
services are still covered&#151;the Bill has not changed
that.</div>
<a name="0806133000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Committee recognises that the provisions are not intended to make
surrogacy into a commercial business. We recognise that, for some,
surrogacy is an option of last resort and that the organisations that
provide them with advice and information need to be able at least to
publicise the fact that their services may be of assistance. It seems
unnecessary to make things more difficult than they already are, but it
is necessary to clarify matters and to ensure that the 1985 Act
prohibitions stand. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts my
explanation.</div>
<a name="0806133000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000326"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her response.
It might be that the confusion&#151;if that is the right
word&#151;rests on what &#147;advertisement&#148; means. Is it
the same as making information available, or does it mean promulgating
a service and attracting an audience to a service provision? There is
no problem if it means information, but the word
&#147;advertisement&#148; has a commercial connotation. The
Minister gave a clear explanation of the meaning of proposed new
subsection (1A) to section 3 of the 1985 Act means and the difference
that applies, but she did not explain why the measure has been drafted
or what positive difference it will make. I have not had any experience
of, or been contacted by, anybody, either from my constituency or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>elsewhere, who has not been able to find out about matching and
commissioning people who are prepared to be surrogates, so there is no
failure in the structure of the 1985 system. I am therefore not sure
that the word &#147;advertisement&#148; adds anything.</div>
<a name="0806133000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
was right to reconfirm that the measure does not amount to a
commercialisation of surrogacy, and I agree with her. However, what
difference would the measure make to those who were trying to access
surrogacy services by allowing those who provide the service to
advertise over and above the current provision of services? The measure
does not seem to make any difference, so I do not see the point of
it.</div><a name="0806133000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000327"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> My answer will take longer than a normal
intervention. The Government are aware that a number of
agreements&#151;the number is small rather than vast&#151;are
reached each year, as I mentioned in my contributions to debates on
other surrogacy measures, which is linked to the point that the hon.
Gentleman made on what can be
advertised.</div><a name="0806133000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the point is that bodies can make a charge, on a non-profit making
basis, for initiating negotiations with a view to making a surrogacy
agreement and, as I said, enabling interested parties to meet each
other. Some organisations would find it difficult to present such
services&#151;they are not commercial, which is to say that they are
not for profit&#151;under the 1985 Act. The Government are clarifying
the difference between what we consider to be commercial and not for
profit. We are not going to see adverts on television because we are
talking about a specialised area and small group of people. The
advertising can draw the public&#146;s attention, but charging people
who want to initiate negotiations is not for
profit.</div><a name="0806133000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept what the hon. Gentleman said. He said that those parents who
have taken the big step, for whom surrogacy is the last resort, are
more than likely to be aware of everything. It could be considered
churlish to make things more difficult just because we can when we are
limiting what is provided by the 1985 Act. This is about the difference
between what organisations are allowed to provide on a non-profit
making basis and thus charge for, which is basically the introduction,
and the commercial aspect. Individuals are not allowed to advertise and
we do not allow the publication of a list of individuals, or for people
to say, &#147;I&#146;m an individual looking for a
surrogate&#148;. That type of advertising is not permitted. That is
the fine line that we seek to draw. That is a slightly elongated
attempt to pick up the points, but I hope that I have clarified the
situation.</div><a name="0806133000284"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30

clarification. She is absolutely right to highlight the difference
between non-profit-making and charging elements. However, I ask that
she and the relevant civil servants monitor the situation carefully,
because there is concern that it might be possible to stretch the
envelope in ways that were never intended for the advertising and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000330"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> As a member of the Science and Technology
Committee that compiled the report, I can say that the quotes are
correct. However, I would interpret the report slightly differently
from my hon. Friend. We cite, as Select Committees do, evidence that we
receive. The only evidence that we received on this point&#151;I
remember reading it&#151;was from the Scottish Council on Human
Bioethics, which is a mixed body. The council is not exclusively
religious, but it is not recognised as a body that has the status of a
peer review scientific or academic organisation. We noted what it said,
but we did not share its conclusion. Its conclusion was that much
stronger restrictions were needed. We merely pointed out a statement of
the obvious, and the position was shared by the Academy of Medical
Sciences. The academy&#146;s report says that there needs to be
risk-management procedures appropriate to the status of the scientific
knowledge about the risks. There are already those procedures in labs
and we welcomed the Government&#146;s response on that. Again, we
stated the obvious, that there needs to be risk management. I share my
hon. Friend&#146;s view that this should be a probing amendment
because whatever the risk management procedures are, treating this as a
genetically modified crop does not seem to be the appropriate practical
measure and runs the risk of allowing other people to argue that the
issue is being trivialised, which is not the
intention.</div><a name="0806133000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as I am aware, environmental release of human admixed embryos is
not envisaged in any laboratory. While I am delighted that the Science
and Technology Committee report has been cited&#151;and cited
accurately&#151;the conclusions that my hon. Friend draws are not
necessarily the ones that we would need to
draw.</div><a name="0806133000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000331"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b><b class="B"> </b>Despite the disparity of interpretation
of the Select Committee quotes by the two hon. Gentlemen, can the
Minister clarify whether this amendment, if it were to be included in
the Bill, would undermine the special status of the embryo, which is
the cornerstone of this particular piece of
legislation?</div>
<a name="0806133000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000332"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Let me answer that question. Yes, it would
undermine the legislation, and I shall explain why. It conflates two
different issues. Genetically modified human embryos are presently
excluded from regulation on genetic modification of organisms in the
Environmental Protection Act 1990. The 1990 Act regulates the use of
genetically modified organisms for the purpose of preventing or
minimising any damage to the environment, which may arise from the
escape or release from human control of genetically modified
organisms.</div>
<a name="0806133000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked whether an embryo or human admixed embryo could cause
damage to the environment if it was released. The answer is an
unequivocal no. A pre-14-day embryo would be incapable of entering into
the ecosystem as it would be insufficiently developed to survive.
However, safeguards are provided. Clause 60 ensures that genetically
modified human admixed embryos are excluded but that they are properly
regulated in protocols and research laboratories with regard to their
disposal. The clause prevents dual regulation that is not necessary and
ensures that the HFEA requires centres to have a documented procedure
for disposal of embryos, which is appropriate and takes into account
the special status of human embryos. Therefore, it is a different
set  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>of requirements. I hope that I have clarified why we do not need the
cross reference. I trust that the hon. Member for Southport is
satisfied by my explanation and will withdraw the probing
amendment.</div><a name="0806133000092"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000334"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> It would be helpful if, when responding to my
brief contribution, the Minister will explain the amendment. My
understanding is that it will merely necessitate a report being
produced by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to the
Secretary of State. I want to be sure that the annual report will be a
public document and that it will be available for scrutiny, hopefully
at the appropriate time for debate in Parliament. I clarify that the
necessity to produce a report is not insisted on under the 1990 Act. It
is a new provision that has been inserted into the
Bill.</div><a name="0806133000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000335"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Section 7 of the 1990 Act requires the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to produce an annual report.
Currently, section 7(1) requires a report covering the year from August
to July, reflecting the fact that the HFEA came into operation on
1 August 1991. The amendment is a technical, administrative
provision. The Treasury&#146;s financial reporting manual requires
non-departmental public bodies, such as the HFEA, to produce an annual
report to accompanying the body&#146;s annual
accounts.</div><a name="0806133000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is therefore practical that we amend the reporting period to cover the
financial year April to March, in line with the requirements of
financial reporting manuals. It is a purely administrative requirement.
There will be no change to the requirement that the Secretary of State
lays the annual report or any other report under the schedule before
Parliament. There has never been a requirement that the report will
automatically be put down for debate, but it must be laid before
Parliament after which time it will be open through the normal
procedure in Parliament for hon. Members to debate
it.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000336"></a>Dr.

to raise that issue at this stage. If I am wrong, I stand to be
corrected.</div><a name="0806133000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
simply wanted clarification about the whole thrust of the
legislation&#151;what is banned and what is not? It is fairly clear
that the Bill bans placing animal gametes in a woman, placing human
admix embryos and animal embryos in a woman, placing human embryos in
an animal and placing human admix embryos in an animal. However,
neither the 1990 Act nor the Bill expressly ban the placing of human
gametes in an animal. There may be a good reason for
that&#151;perhaps to allow the possibility of human ovarian tissue
being matured or whatever&#151;but the legislative loophole, if it is
one, would also allow the potential development of a human or
part-human embryo in a non-human primate, by a gamete intra-fallopian
transfer. That loophole has been spotted. If it is not a loophole, I
would be grateful for any clarification that the Minister can give on
the
issue.</div><a name="0806133000121"></a>

financial privileges were not infringed. It is therefore necessary to
have a purely technical amendment to remove the privilege amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000340"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="0806133000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause relates to the complex issue of birth certificates, which we
touched on earlier. In the context of the debate surrounding part 2,
new clause 1 relates to some of the issues raised when we discussed
schedule 6. The new clause would ensure that the Secretary of State
made regulations either to annotate a birth certificate or to provide
two versions&#151;as the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East suggested
earlier in today&#146;s proceedings. The Minister explained the
Government&#146;s view that there should be a four-year period of
reflection, although if possible they should report earlier. I think
that that is too long, and that we should get clarity as fast as
possible.</div>
<a name="0806133000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
significant issues surrounding birth certificates, and I would like to
make a point about the new clause on the record. The welfare of the
child should be paramount in the consideration of these issues, and it
is important that the Secretary of State holds detailed consultations
about this, particularly as regards the changes in the Bill. There are
some anomalies. For example, if an unmarried couple, who may have known
each other for only a short period, are treated with donated sperm,
they are both recorded on the birth certificate as parents. However, a
same-sex couple in a civil partnership are not both listed as parents
and the woman who did not give birth to the child would have to adopt
it in order to have any legal claim. Under the proposals, at least
theoretically, although I suspect that in a small number of
circumstances it could be the reality, neither of the people named on
the birth certificate&#151;mother and father or mother and other
parent&#151;will have a genetic link to the child.</div>
<a name="0806133000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fulcrum of
the debate is whether the birth certificate should be primarily a
biological or a social record. That throws up all sorts of issues and
the interesting thing is that the bodies that represent the
donor-conceived community&#151;if I can call it that&#151;have
differing opinions that are almost inversely opposed, and that makes
these arguments even more complicated. I would like to suggest why the
fulcrum should be moved towards the biological end of the spectrum,
rather than the social end. Earlier, we discussed genetic diseases.
That subject will become more and more prevalent and important as
medical and scientific advancements take place and there is a greater
understanding of inherited diseases, such as cancer and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>others that we have mentioned, which we hope will be circumvented by
mitochondrial and other technologies.</div>
<a name="0806133000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue
is the deception of the state, and someone knowingly conniving&#151;I
use that word in its softest sense&#151;in trying to remove the
child&#146;s genetic parentage from the birth certificate. There is
the issue of sperm donors and donor anonymity, and the point raised
earlier by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon about donors
having the choice to remain anonymous was pertinent. Inappropriate
marriages may occur if people do not know, or at least have an
indication, about their genetic history, and that goes back to some of
the debates that we had about the age for obtaining the information
from the HFEA.</div>
<a name="0806133000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Discrimination
is another issue. Refusing to mark the birth certificates of those who
are donor conceived, yet allowing two women to be shown as the parents
of a child, inevitably makes a clear distinction between the two types
of donor-conceived people. There are those who are donor conceived and
for whom the information is made public&#151;two women clearly cannot
be the biological parents&#151;and those for whom the information is
not shown on their birth certificate. That seems to be an anomaly. The
new clause, which I accept is not perfect, attempts to put on the
record the great concern and strength of feeling about this
issue.</div>
<a name="0806133000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Personally, I
favour the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East of
a dual birth certificate, although I accept that that could be
bureaucratic. I see the sensitivities of people who might not want to
have it marked on their birth certificate that they were donor
conceived. They may think that an infringement of privacy&#151;why
should someone have to produce that information when applying for a
passport, or whatever birth certificates are used for? However, it is
important that a child has an understanding, wherever possible, of
their genetic make-up. A child should not necessarily have to wait
until the age of 18 to understand that they are donor-conceived,
although most parents do make an attempt to inform the child about such
matters.</div>
<a name="0806133000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
conflicting legal opinion on this matter. There are questions about how
the human rights of the child and the right to health safeguards in the
United Nations convention on the rights of the child will be met if a
child is brought up without the requisite knowledge to avoid particular
health consequences. It is important for healthy family life that
genetic defects and intermarriage of relatives are avoided if at all
possible. There is a real danger that, unless some solution is found to
this complex problem, we will exacerbate an already difficult
issue.</div>
<a name="0806133000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806133000341"></a><b class="B">Robert
Key</b> (Salisbury) (Con): I endorse entirely what my hon.
Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness has said. I would like to
press him a little and to concentrate on the second paragraph (b) in
the new clause, on the provision of a detailed birth
certificate.</div>
<a name="0806133000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to a number of organisations and individuals who have been in touch
with me&#151;the partnership focus group, the British Association of
Social Workers Project Group on Assisted Reproduction, and the Donor
Conception Network, to name but three. I am particularly grateful to
Professor Eric Blyth, professor of social work at the university of
Huddersfield, with whom I have had some correspondence on this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>matter. It seems to me that, in view of the discussion in the other
place and what my hon. Friend has said, there is a problem that we must
crack with the short birth certificate and the so-called long birth
certificate. In the other place no proposal has been made that does not
involve extra bureaucracy, which would risk compromising the privacy of
parents or donor-conceived people, or other members of their family.
The principle risk to privacy is the fact that birth certificates are
public documents. Not only is the long birth certificate, which
provides details of the individual&#146;s parents, increasingly
required for a range of legal and other purposes, but anyone who is
armed with minimal information and prepared to pay a modest fee can
obtain a copy of the long birth certificate of any other person in the
country. I shall not repeat what I said earlier about the discussion in
the other place, but I wonder if my hon. Friend would agree that all
certificates of birth&#151;in other words, the short birth
certificate&#151;could include this text:</div>
<a name="0806133000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Further
information relating to the individual whose birth is recorded on the
certificate may be held on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority register of information, the parental order register or the
adopted children register.&#148;</div>
<a name="0806133000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">All certified copies of
an entry pursuant to the Births and Deaths Registration Act
1953&#151;in other words, the long birth certificate&#151;could
have this
text:</div><a name="0806133000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Further
information relating to the individual whose birth is recorded on this
certificate may be held on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority register of
information.&#148;</div><a name="0806133000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Adopted
people and people subject to a parental order as a result of a
surrogacy arrangement already have an adoption certificate or a
parental order certificate, respectively, in lieu of a long birth
certificate, clearly indicating their status. The proposal I am making
would mean that all individuals had access to a birth certificate that
alerted them to the existence of other registers. It would not single
out any one individual or, by implication, their parents or family
members; everybody would have this. Thus, the information could act as
a trigger for the individual to make their own inquiries of the
registers, subject to the legally mandated age limits for accessing
such information. Both in advance of undergoing a donor procedure and
as part of the new provisions for parent education, adults who are
contemplating building their family through donor conception would in
the future receive a clear message about the merits of early disclosure
and would be advised about the new text on birth certificates. That
would provide parents with an added incentive for early disclosure,
rather than risking later and possibly traumatic disclosure. That seems
to be something that both Houses have thought is the best way
forward.</div><a name="0806133000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806133000342"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): I have given this
a lot of thought, but it seems to me that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
proposal would increase the bureaucracy that he was trying to avoid by
the previous suggestion. Most of us would want to know whether other
information was available. We would want access to all those registers
to find out whether we were donor conceived and to see whether they
contained other information about us. That would result in a huge
bureaucracy.</div><a name="0806133000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div><a name="0806133000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000344"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> Most of us are concerned about the privacy of the
individuals and their parents. Making the information available online
would not get around the objections that most of us have to putting
marks on the short birth

<a name="0806133000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000345"></a>Robert
Key:</b> I accept that argument. The hon. Gentleman is
absolutely right; we should not go there. However, it does not destroy
the argument that it would be a way of indicating on everybody&#146;s
birth certificate where they might seek further information if there
was any doubt. Its other great virtue is that it would undoubtedly put
some pressure on parents to come clean about their children&#146;s
origins.</div>
<a name="0806133000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000346"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Having had the chance to reflect on our earlier
debate, I accept some of the concerns of donor networks that knowing
about someone&#146;s genetic origins is not in the public interest,
except in rare circumstances. I can imagine that those conducting a
research project into the effect of the environment versus inheritance
would justifiably feel miffed if some of those who were the subject of
research for public health purposes turned out not to be the persons
who they thought had been genetically identified. Except in extreme
cases, there is no genuine public interest in the public, the employer
or anyone else having access to information about a person&#146;s
origins. In a sense, the birth certificate is giving away the fact that
there has been a donor conception.</div>
<a name="0806133000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, many
people accept that individuals have a right to know about their genetic
inheritance. To put it another way, it is wrong in all but the most
exceptional cases to withhold that information or to mislead people
about it. Although there is a sort of abstract right&#151;one can
make inquiries if one thinks there is reason to do so&#151;we have a
real right to know our genetic inheritance, and we have the capacity to
exercise it.</div>
<a name="0806133000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also
involves someone else having the duty to disclose that information, but
who is that someone else? The onus could be put on the parents or the
state, but none the less someone ought to have a duty of disclosure. We
are struggling with how to balance that duty with other legitimate
rights&#151;to privacy, to an undisrupted family life and so
on&#151;but neither we nor the Government have a solution that
adequately addresses that problem.</div>
<a name="0806133000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that the Government were going to think about the matter, with a
review lasting more than four years. It may take four years to come up
with an adequate solution, but we should not pretend that there is not
a problem&#151;and the Bill does not solve
it.</div>
<a name="0806133000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000347"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Member for Southport summed up the
problem very well. The Committee is struggling&#151;three suggestions
have been made on how it might be solved during this short
debate&#151;to understand how we can balance obligations to the
donor, the parents and the donor-conceived child. The hon. Member for
Salisbury said that the point of this&#151;if I am wrong, I am sure
he will correct me&#151;was to ensure that we kept up the pressure
and encouraged parents to be truthful to the children from the
beginning. I concur with that view; it represents everything that the
Government are trying to do. We can all quote influential groups that
take a different view about why the birth certificate should be
annotated and why the new clause should be accepted, although some
might go further, taking the view that it is counterproductive and
would work against the objective pointed out by the hon. Member
for Salisbury.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div><a name="0806133000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pray in aid
the Royal College of Nursing, which commented specifically on the new
clause rather than speculating about what it might mean. The RCN made
it clear that it supported the Government&#146;s position as stated
in another place, because we needed to be clear about what we required
clinics to do, who must be notified, how any annotations on birth
certificates must be provided, and where the obligations lie. The RCN
ended up in the same place as the hon. Member for Salisbury. It decided
that it was best for the parents themselves to tell the
children.</div><a name="0806133000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking
at some of the other stakeholders, it is not just the Royal College of
Nursing, a considerable and influential organisation that supports the
Government&#146;s position. The Donor Conception Network, which
represents donor-conceived children and their parents, also does, and
has said so in submissions to Committee members with regard to birth
certificates. The Donor Conception Network goes further. It starts by
agreeing absolutely&#151;again, who would not?&#151;with the
proposition made by the hon. Member for Salisbury, which is that if
children are donor-conceived, their parents should communicate that
important information when they think it appropriate and by a definite
time, after which children have a right to know provided for in
legislation.</div>
<a name="0806133000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
Donor Conception Network goes on to say that it is concerned that a
move to annotate birth certificates, in whatever fashion, may be
counter-productive. Parents who planned to tell their children about
the details of their conception may decide when registering the birth
not to give those details to the registrar because they do not want
that sensitive information made public. They may find it much harder to
tell the child if they have not been as open as they should
be.</div><a name="0806133000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East suggested that two birth
certificates might be the way forward, but the Donor Conception Network
takes the view, and I agree strongly, that it is necessary for the
Government to evaluate certain pieces of work alongside the review in
order to come to an understanding and proceed. That involves the Donor
Conception Network&#146;s planned programme of work, which is
supported by the Department of Health, to promote telling children at
an early age that they are donor-conceived. The network is working
directly with parents to understand the concerns and barriers, and what
is necessary to move forward. The network&#146;s programme is
concerned with non-identifying information&#151;just the
straightforward fact that children are donor-conceived. We can all
understand the importance of the rights of donors and of guaranteed
anonymity.</div><a name="0806133000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going
further, the Department is funding a second project that will work with
prospective parents hoping to conceive using donated gametes. Again, we
seek to understand clearly what the barriers are and what can be done
to help. It is entirely reasonable to say, in what we have all said is
a difficult and sensitive matter, that we should pilot and evaluate
such work to ensure that we have the best way to communicate with
parents and prospective parents. We should get the feedback of
information from it, include it within the review on birth certificates
and what should be on them and come to the right conclusion. A decision
made in haste might not be the right one. We might end up cutting
across the important principle, identified by the hon. Member for
Salisbury, of parents informing, explaining and discussing issues with
their donor-conceived children.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div><a name="0806133000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why the
Government continue to resist putting any compulsion in the Bill to
move now. We think that it is sensible to collect the information,
speak directly to those concerned, and make a judgement on that basis
and no other. I hope that the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness will
not press his new clause to a vote, but if he does, with regret and for
the best of reasons, I will ask my hon. Friends to oppose
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000348"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to all those who contributed to
the debate on new clause 1. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury
made some very pertinent points and some of the issues that he
mentioned about the Minister&#146;s review deserve much more detail
and consideration. Today&#146;s exchange demonstrates the
difficulties in coming to a conclusion. I understand and accept that,
but none the less I do not regret having tabled the new clause for

however complex and challenging, on the record.</div>
<a name="0806133000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
convinced that the Minister should be prepared to accept a four-year
time period in which this should be reviewed. Pressure should be put on
whoever is responsible for that review to come to a conclusion, in
consultation with the necessary people, in a much shorter time scale. I
was also intrigued by the Minister&#146;s defence and praying in aid
outside organisations to defend the Government&#146;s position, as
there does not seem to be one. The Government&#146;s position seems
to be that this is complex and that there should be a review that
reports in four years&#146; time.</div>
<a name="0806133000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
why many organisations&#151;those who represent donors and others
such as the Royal College of Nursing&#151;do not support the second

placing</div><a name="0806133000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a

felt that without that in the new clause, we would not be able to
debate the specific issue.</div>
<a name="0806133000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, the
priority must be for parents to inform their children about their
origins, in consultation with counselling and other facilities that are
available. However, I also think that very detailed consideration must
be given to the necessity, where possible, of allowing a child to
understand their genetic make up and where they come from as early as
possible. A sensible and easy way of doing that is through some
mechanism such as an extended birth certificate or via access to other
information. I will withdraw new clause 1, but I would like to reserve
the right to return to the issue on Report. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the motion.</div>

expectancy in the other place that this House would give guidance on
the proposal to create a national human bioethics committee. On Second

about that proposal. In her closing speech in the discussion, Baroness
Royall of Blaisdon
said:</div><a name="0806133000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government have made clear their view that there is value in the

parliamentary standing committee on
bioethics.&#148;</div><a name="0806133000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">She

Parliament? That is not to say that I am not grateful, however, for all
the thought that the HFEA has given to bioethical issues in this policy
area. Nevertheless, it has been difficult for it on occasions, and it
has sometimes made the wrong decision, in my opinion, which it has
occasionally reversed after further consideration and in the light of
more
evidence.</div>

I would like to see a parliamentary bioethics committee established to
consider all bioethical issues, relating to animals or humans. I have
tabled these two amendments to sound out right hon. and hon. Members of
this Committee today, and to seek the views of my right hon. Friend the
Minister. The amendments have been framed in a narrower way than I
would have preferred, so that they stand within the scope of
the

her discomfort.</div>
<a name="0806133000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alan Doran,
acting chief executive of the HFEA, told a symposium at the BioCentre
in November 2007:</div>
<a name="0806133000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do
not claim to be a National Bioethics Committee. We are not a body whose
primary function is to resolve ethical issues. I do not think the HFEA
was set up as an ethics
commission&#148;.</div><a name="0806133000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
opponents of the establishment of a national or parliamentary human
bioethical committee have pointed out the existence of the Nuffield
Council on Bioethics, which is financed by the Nuffield Foundation and
the Wellcome Trust. However, it decides on the topics of debate, not
Parliament.</div>
<a name="0806133000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
other organisations also cover bioethics, including the Genetic
Interest Group, the British Medical Association, which publishes
&#147;Medical Ethics Today&#148;, the General Medical
Council&#146;s standards and ethics committee; the Royal Society of
Medicine, and the Academy of Medical Sciences. I should also mention
the Scottish Council on Bioethics, to which reference has already been
made today in this Committee. Again, these organisations do not dance
to the tune of Parliament, but they are a valuable source of
information.</div><a name="0806133000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
respect to research, we should not forget the important role that local
medical ethics committees play. We could consider that there is a
double lock on research of this kind, one local lock, and one national
lock, namely, the HFEA. None of those bodies, however, is responsible
for making the law, as we
are.</div><a name="0806133000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Governments
or Ministers have established national bioethics committees in a number
of other countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland, as
well as Australia and the USA. However, we must be a little cautious
when national committees are created in that way. I cite, for example,
what has happened to the US committee. It has become very politicised,
if one looks at its proceedings.</div>
<a name="0806133000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, in its
2005 report entitled &#147;Human Reproductive Technologies and the
Law&#148;, the former House of Commons Science and Technology
Committee recommended the formation of</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div><a name="0806133000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a single
commission to develop policy issues relating to assisted reproduction,
embryo research and human genetics&#148;.</div>
<a name="0806133000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">For right hon.
and hon. Members who wish to establish a national human bioethics
commission, I recommend that they read Baroness Warnock&#146;s
arguments against the proposal in the 2008 Whitsun edition of
&#147;Science in Parliament&#148;, which has recently arrived on
hon. Members&#146; desks, and in <i class="I">The</i> <i class="I">Observer</i> of 13
January 2008. Referring to a parliamentary human bioethics committee,
she said in <i class="I">The Observer</i>
that</div><a name="0806133000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
overriding merit of establishing such a committee, rather than a new
commission, is that it would be a recognised part of parliamentary
procedure, often part of that procedure that leads to the passage of a
law.&#148;</div><a name="0806133000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion to her piece, Baroness Warnock
said:</div><a name="0806133000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
believe that setting up a new style of
committee&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0806133000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">she
was referring to a national human bioethics
commission&#151;</div><a name="0806133000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;independent
of Parliament would seem to make the role of Parliament less central,
its responsibility and its authority less great. That would, in my
view, be an actual weakening of the rule of
law.&#148;</div><a name="0806133000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
happen to agree with her
views.</div><a name="0806133000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am informed that setting up a parliamentary human bioethics committee,
or a committee of the type mentioned in my amendments, is not a
legislative issue. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that. However,
setting up a national bioethics commission, I believe, would require an
amendment to the Bill, but I am against such a proposal. Of course, ad
hoc committees have been established in Parliament before to consider
bioethical issues. Lord Walton of Detchant, for example, chaired a
Select Committee on Medical Ethics from 1992 to 1993, which considered
the law on euthanasia and assisted
suicide.</div><a name="0806133000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I believe that we should have a statutory, human bioethics
committee to consider the difficult issues that we have looked at today
and during the passage of the Bill through Parliament. I look forward
to hearing the views of the Committee on the issue, including those of
my right hon. Friend the
Minister.</div><a name="0806133000186"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000352"></a>Robert
Key:</b> I strongly endorse the comments of the hon. Member
for Bolton, South-East. I served on the Select Committee to which he
referred in the last Parliament. The inquiry into human reproductive
technologies and the law visited both Sweden and Italy and met their
national bioethics committees. In Italy I was quickly aware that the
committee was not what it seemed&#151;seemed to me, anyhow. I think
that I recall, for example, that there was only one woman on the
committee, which reflected the political reality of Italian democracy,
but convinced me that it was not a satisfactory way of proceeding in
this country. I also recall that when the Joint Committee scrutinised
the Bill last summer and produced our report, the Government listened.
The Government took us seriously. They gave the Bill a new title and
binned a huge chunk of their proposals. That surely shows the virtue of
such a Committee. I commend the Government for listening to
Parliament.</div><a name="0806133000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
Houses of Parliament are, de facto, the national bioethics committee of
this country. We should be jealous of that. It would not be possible to
create another body, independent of Parliament, that would have
anything like the authority that we have, with the authority of
democratically elected Members, representing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>every constituency in the country, together with the authority of the
men and women in another place, who have come there via a variety of
routes, which may evolve in the future. However, we have a de facto
national bioethics commission in Parliament itself. We now need to find
how to establish a new Joint Committee, which would be a Standing
Committee, like the Joint Committee on Human Rights or some such body,
which would sit for the duration of a Parliament and would be made up
of members nominated, as they are for existing Joint Committees, by the
Leaders of both
Houses.</div><a name="0806133000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the other end of the spectrum, I endorse what the hon. Member for
Bolton, South-East said about local medical ethics committees. I do not
think that members of the public generally realise that in every
hospital or clinical research establishment there is a local ethics
committee which considers all the factors as they are legislated for
and played out in their local communities and establishments. They are
extraordinarily influential bodies, and they are localised to a degree
that makes them credible to our constituents at a local
level.</div>
<a name="0806133000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
approach that we ought to take in future. We should not rely on the
setting up of a joint Committee for the pre-legislative scrutiny of a
particular bit of legislation; we should have a permanent Standing
Committee of both Houses to deal with such bioethical issues, which
will only get more complicated and arise more frequently. It will not
be another 18 years before more legislation. Mark my words,
Mr. Hood: we will be back within 10, maybe five years,
because something else will have happened. Medical technology and
science will have moved forward so fast that once again Parliament will
have to catch up. The voice of Parliament should set the ethical and
moral framework and the regulatory authority should decide on
individual cases within it. That is the way we should be going, and
that is why I strongly support the new
clause.</div><a name="0806133000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806133000353"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Gibson</b> (Norwich, North) (Lab): I, too, support the new
clause. I do not think that there will be any problem with the Nuffield
Council on Bioethics, which has done lots of work that I shall explain
in a minute. It is quite independent, is financed independently and
does fine
work.</div><a name="0806133000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Joint Committee, while we were discussing the Bill, high-octane
meetings were held with people from the Lords and the
Commons&#151;everyone who had some ethical view about
everything&#151;and it was good to have the opportunity to talk about
things. There was nothing more tendentious than the need for a father.
That evoked some heavy stuff, and there was a lot of disagreement on
both sides, but it was important to have that debate. We have never had
such a debate properly in Select Committees and so on, because there
just ain&#146;t time. We need a place to discuss those
issues.</div><a name="0806133000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could say lots about bioethics. It is the fastest growing profession in
the medical world at the moment. People are suddenly realising more and
more that biology and the biological sciences are developing new
technologies and ideas that will have to be considered in terms of
society&#151;not just this society but other societies, such as in
the developing world and so on. I think that such a Committee would
have a lot to say. Some of the things that it would look at include
genetic screening and age discrimination. When do we start and stop
breast screening? Do doctors behave differently depending on the age of

<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>the patient in front of them? I think that I know, but I will not say it
here. A lot of discrimination goes on. There are also ethical and legal
issues involving human tissue that we have discussed here, such as
animal-to-human transplants or xeno-transplantation&#151;the odd bit
of pig appears in people&#146;s aortas during some
treatments&#151;mental disorders and so
on.</div><a name="0806133000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000354"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. As we are getting to the end of the
Committee, I ask the hon. Gentleman to stay in order when addressing
the
Committee.</div><a name="0806133000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000355"></a>Dr.
Gibson:</b> Then, of course, there are stem cells and so on,
and pharmacogenetics&#151;it is almost a continual process&#151;and
the DNA database. There has never been a more important arena. More and
more information is being brought to our notice. We need a place where
people can contemplate and think about those issues and build them into
hard science and medicine. I am glad to support the idea of a joint
bioethics Committee in this
place.</div><a name="0806133000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000356"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I warmed to the proposal when it was mentioned on
Second Reading, but since then, scepticism has grown on me. I accept
that the remit should be wider than defined in the new clause and that
the HFEA, the Nuffield Council or whoever do not actually do the jobs
envisaged by those who tabled the new clause. Most ethical committees,
as I understand them, are basically endowed with a set of principles
that they apply with respect to a certain group of professionals. What
I think that we are asking for, implicitly, is a bioethics commission,
parliamentary or otherwise, to formulate a set of principles to take us
out of the moral mire that we are in.</div>
<a name="0806133000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally,
ethics is a tricky business. I have spent a lot of my life studying it
from the philosophical point of view. There is no agreement about what
it is or how ethical disputes should be resolved, even where consensus
has arisen. For example, in the Warnock report, Baroness Warnock states
clearly that she applied utilitarian principles to resolve the moral
dilemmas. But if we are not utilitarians, we would simply not buy into
that in the first place. There is nothing blindingly obvious with the
moral consensus that we have at present, but there might be a pious
hope that we can have a bioethics group and, through that, a consensus
or solution from a group of moral experts who will just tell us what
framework we need to work
within.</div><a name="0806133000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existence of moral experts has been a matter of debate since the time
of Plato and it is still yet to be
resolved.</div>
<a name="0806133000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000357"></a>Dr.
Gibson:</b> He is not here at the
moment.</div><a name="0806133000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="0806133000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000358"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> No, he is not, nor is anyone who we can be assured
knows what is good and what is right. A group of moral experts does not
get Members of Parliament off any moral hoof of thinking ethically
ourselves. If we think of the committee as a mechanism for reflecting
ethical opinion, encouraging ethical debate or ensuring that decisions
are made in an ethnically informed way as opposed to
pragmatically&#151;I take on board the comment made by the hon.
Member for Norwich, North about scientists not being pure&#151;we
would have a modest committee that could do a useful job.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div><a name="0806133000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, our
difficulty, which no committee can resolve in connection with the
legislation, is that we are not working within a clear, ethical
framework. There is no clear ethical thread binding all the various
moral decisions that are made in the context of the Bill. That is not
only my view. I read the evidence presented to committees on draft
legislation and the remarks of Professor Haldane and others, and that
is exactly what they picked up. There is a series of ad hoc commissions
and things that we believe are right on balance, and a series of
case-by-case arguments, but if we went for the position that we wanted
in respect of the Mental Health Bill and said, &#147;Here is a piece
of legislation but, before we get into the detail, let us put in the
Bill the moral principles that will guide us&#148;, and explained why
we made various decisions in the clauses, we would be in serious
difficulty. We would be incapable of taking such action, and many
people who reported on the draft legislation said precisely
that.</div><a name="0806133000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
bioethics committee that is prepared to fill a modest role might have a
place in the mix. However, what we shall not achieve&#151;and perhaps
what hon. Members are hoping for&#151;is a cast of modern Solomons.
We might reach the position when people know why they are making such
decisions, as a result of which ethical rationale would be laid out
with greater clarity, but we would not achieve wholesale agreement on
what is right unless&#151;this is the fear of some people&#151;we
rig the committee in such a way that it would be guaranteed
consensus.</div><a name="0806133000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the past, many of the debates on ethnical committees have been about
whether they are set up fairly or whether the balance is such that the
democratic verdict goes in one direction rather than another. I do not
know how that can be resolved. A great deal of hard work has to be
done. On the assumption that we have something that adds grist to the
mill&#151;that adds something to the general picture and informs the
decisions of Parliament&#151;there would be nothing wrong with it,
but it will not take us out of our current bind of making hard, moral
decisions for all time on particular
issues.</div>
<a name="0806133000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000359"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I declare an interest as a member of the British
Medical Association medical ethics committee. The hon. Member for
Salisbury mentioned local ethics committees. He is right; they are well
developed in research ethics. I was a member of one of those committees
for many years. They are moving on apace in respect of clinical ethics
in
hospitals.</div><a name="0806133000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was on the same visit to Sweden and Italy to which the hon. Gentleman
referred, and the system was not ideal. I support the thrust of the new
clause, but I want to put it in the context of the Select
Committee&#146;s recommendation on human reproductive technologies
and the law in 2005. The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East read out a
recommendation. We argued that the HFEA&#146;s policy-making aspects
and the Human Genetics Commission could be combined usefully in one
commission that would advise a standing parliamentary
committee.</div>
<a name="0806133000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
with the HFEA&#146;s current policy-making role, as some people see
it, is at least twofold. First, because primary and secondary
legislation can cover only a certain number of things, the HFEA is

<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>upon currently and will be called upon under the Bill to develop policy
in areas where there is not regulation and where it has discretion. The
HFEA does its best to do that; I am not arguing that it has not done a
good job, but because it does not have any of the
&#147;antis&#148;, arguably there is not the same degree of debate
in its policy-making committee, as opposed to its consultations, that
we have here in Parliament.</div>
<a name="0806133000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
problem is that, as a result of that lack of debate and the fact that
the HFEA makes policy in sensitive areas, it is liable to be criticised
by politicians. That is the nature of things; politicians criticise
those whom we have set up and given the power to make decisions for us.
Perhaps that is unfair, given that we have voted for a measure that
gives the HFEA discretion to make policy. There was one occasion when
the Science and Technology Committee criticised the HFEA for making a
decision about pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. The Committee was
provoked into doing that partly by the combative performance of the
former chair of the HFEA, now Baroness Deech, my constituent. She is a
woman whom I greatly respect, but she was quite combative and there was
a critical report, which I thought was unfair because the HFEA was only
doing what it had been asked to do in the 1990 Act&#151;to make
policy.</div>
<a name="0806133000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">To avoid that
problem, one could have the best aspects of the HFEA&#146;s
policy-making function combined with the Human Genetics Commission. It
is hard to see a distinction between those two, and indeed, the Human
Genetics Commission provided evidence and a view on hybrid embryos
during the HFEA&#146;s consultation. The best elements of those could
be combined into a committee or commission that gives advice&#151;a
Standing Committee of Parliament. Such a Committee would have the
advantages of being in Parliament. It would also, because of the way in
which such things work, be able to capture all the strands of opinion,
so that those, for example, who were not supportive of embryo research
would not be excluded from policy development, which the HFEA has to
deal with.</div>
<a name="0806133000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, the Science and Technology Committee of 2005 was right in its
report to say that the policy-making functions could be taken away from
the HFEA, which could then concentrate on regulation and inspection,
but that that was worth doing only in the context of a parliamentary
Standing Committee. For the reasons that have been given in the debate
already, there are huge advantages in creating such a
Committee.</div>
<a name="0806133000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">What would be
the powers of such a Committee? Another Select Committee making
recommendations mainly to the Government, which the Government felt
they had a mandate to accept or reject as they saw fit would not be
ideal. That is why a model like the Joint Committee on Human Rights is
a good one. In its reports, the Joint Committee on Human Rights does
not simply make recommendations to Government and other organisations
as other Select Committees do; it gives specific advice to Parliament
on human rights issues. In that sense, it goes beyond the normal role
of a Select Committee and both Houses can choose to accept or reject
its
advice.</div><a name="0806133000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second merit of the Joint Committee on Human Rights is that it was set
up by statute. I do not know what advice the hon. Member for Bolton,
South-East received, but it may not be possible within the scope of the
Bill to give a Committee statutory functions. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>Joint Committee on Human Rights does have statutory functions in respect
of declarations of incompatibility by the European Court. The fact that
it is statutory gives it authority; the fact that it is joint gives it
authority, and the fact that it is a Standing Committee gives it
authority, as well as the confidence and the staff to produce useful
reports. We saw in the debates in this House yesterday and the day
before that the Joint Committee on Human Rights has now gone further.
Where a majority agree with a recommendation, members of the Committee
are tabling amendments not in the name of the Committee but which
reflect the recommendations of the Committee. The primary function of
that Committee, other than its statutory one, is legislative scrutiny
from a human rights perspective.</div>
<a name="0806133000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
significant merits in the idea of a parliamentary ethics committee. It
would enable Parliament to visit these issues on a more structured
basis and far more regularly than we otherwise do. I do not share the
confidence of the hon. Member for Salisbury that we will be back in
five years with another Bill. I think that he is right that science
will progress quickly in the next five years&#151;perhaps even in the
field of IV-derived gametes, but I will not open that up again. Science
will move on, but I suspect that we will not be able to come back in
the next five years, or even 10 years. However, a parliamentary
Standing Committee with authority&#151;even without statutory
powers&#151;would put pressure on the Government of the day to enable
a free vote to take place, even if it had to make majority decisions. I
think that my hon. Friend the Member for Southport was right to say
that there would never be unanimity, which would probably be unhealthy,
on some of these fundamental issues. They are generally free vote
issues so it is difficult for parties to seek a mandate at a general
election and say, &#147;This is what we are going to do&#148;,
because the matter would be subject to a free vote&#151;rightly, in
my opinion&#151;which requires that the Government do something. It
is quite difficult to do that, for reasons of the parliamentary
timetable, the pressure of legislation and that such measures contain
yuck factors, which Governments run a mile from. It is to the
Minister&#146;s credit that she has not run as fast as some Ministers
might have, from taking on the issues. I am sure that she enjoyed the
prospect of dealing with the
Bill.</div><a name="0806133000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that we are in a moral mire. If we are, I think that we
are climbing out of it with measures such as the new clause. There is a
clear basis for establishing such a Standing Committee. Its remit
should be wider than simply embryology. I accept the point made by the
hon. Member for Norwich, North that it might have been difficult to
raise the issue within the scope of the Bill if the Committee proposed
in the amendment had not been restricted to embryology. If this is a
probing amendment, I hope that the Minister is listening and will come
back with a proposal that has the support of a number of Select
Committees. I echo the view of the hon. Member for Salisbury that not
only did the Joint Committee that considered the Bill do good work, as
did the Science and Technology Committee on the hybrids issue, but that
it was good that the Government listened and changed their position.
They were not accused of a U-turn, but were applauded for
listening&#151;I repeat that. I pay tribute to all the members of the
Joint Committee, especially the Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for
Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), for his
work.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div><a name="0806133000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
understand that the new clause is probing, I would like to associate
myself strongly with the thinking behind it. I hope that we see
something like the Committee that the hon. Gentleman proposes, to give
Parliament the ability to debate emerging ethical issues
transparently&#151;so that the public can see us debating
it&#151;and with some effect
.</div><a name="0806133000214"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000360"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I would also like to express my sympathy for the
new clause, although I am not sure that its wording is correct because
it might have some knock-on effects, which the Minister will probably
come to. I would like to explain three or four reasons why I am
sympathetic to the general thrust of what the hon. Members for Bolton,
South-East and for Norwich, North are trying to
do.</div><a name="0806133000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
clearly, if this Bill is to last as long as the 1990
Act&#151;18 years&#151;it is going to have to be amended by a
subsequent series of regulations, provision for which is scattered
through the Bill. As we have discussed, many of the regulations will be
subject to the affirmative procedure, but we all know in the House that
it is very rare, despite consultation, for regulations to be altered
significantly. A Committee such as that proposed could have a remit of
examining the regulations that are subsequently used to amend the Bill.
That might be a reason for the Government not to want such a Committee,
but I think that that, among other functions, would be a good remit for
the
Committee.</div><a name="0806133000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second reason for looking carefully at such a Committee is that it
would provide a positive and necessary link, both for the scientific
community and for those concerned about the ethical issues that
surround such complex areas. There is not a permanent body related to
Parliament that has that specific role at the
moment.</div><a name="0806133000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third issue, which other hon. Members have touched upon, is that there
is understandable discomfort with the HFEA operating in a vacuum and
deciding and making up its own policy&#151;almost as scientific
developments occur&#151;because there is no other responsible body.
Indeed, the point made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
was absolutely right: there is not inevitably a balance on the HFEA to
give the other side of the ethical dilemma of many of those scientific
advances. That is another strong reason for looking at the concern
closely.</div><a name="0806133000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other issue, which was given as a defence as to why certain things are
in the Bill, is that we are merely catching up with scientific
advancements that the HFEA has already approved. That is primarily
because no detailed discussion from an ethical position has taken place
in Parliament since the passing of the 1990 Act, although obviously
regulations have been discussed in Committee. That provides another
very powerful reason for why the Committee should be set
up.</div>
<a name="0806133000289"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="0806133000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three
or four difficult areas must be addressed with regard to the remit of
the Committee. The first is the ethical balance of who will sit on it.
I strongly believe that the Committee should be made up of
parliamentarians. It should not be extended beyond that for the reasons
set out clearly by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East. The size of
the Committee must be carefully considered.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div><a name="0806133000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806133000361"></a><b class="B">Mike
Penning</b> (Hemel Hempstead) (Con): My hon. Friend makes the
good point that the Committee should be made up of parliamentarians.
However, with the greatest respect, it should not be made up of the
usual suspects. Its members should not be those who have always sat on
Committees considering such matters. It must reflect a broad view from
within the House.</div>
<a name="0806133000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000362"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> My hon. Friend makes a sensible point. Having
said that, there is a balance to strike. If such a Committee were set
up, it would be important for people with expertise, knowledge and
experience to be on it, as well as those who could bring fresh ideas
and thoughts. I would a view a Committee of around 30 members, both
from this House and the other place, as too large to co-ordinate in any
sensible way.</div>
<a name="0806133000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must also
do some detailed thinking about the remit and standing of the Committee
and its purpose and scope. What will it scrutinise, who will it advise,
and on what basis? It is a very strong argument that if we want the
Bill to survive for a long period, there must be a body based around
Parliament that has democratic accountability and that provides ethical
and scientific analysis as scientific advancement takes
place.</div>
<a name="0806133000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point
is that after the next general election, the Minister will have a lot
more time on her hands. She might wish to participate significantly in
such a Committee.</div>
<a name="0806133000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000363"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Well, at least the hon. Gentleman acknowledges
that I have a safe seat.</div>
<a name="0806133000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
issues have been raised, some of which I agree with and some of which I
do not. I will try and proceed through the points. We all echo the
point made by the hon. Member for Salisbury and my hon. Friends the
Members for Bolton, South-East and for Norwich, North about the
importance of Parliament deciding. We are elected to come to terms
with, and decide on, inevitably very important issues on behalf of our
constituents. The issues raised about matters of embryology, for
instance&#151;although that is not the only ethical issue&#151;are
matters that we as Members of Parliament must consider.</div>
<a name="0806133000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a number of
occasions during consideration of the Bill, through the review of the
1990 Act and during pre-legislative scrutiny, there has been a debate
about whether we should have a wider bioethics commission, and whether
that should be independent of Parliament or made up from
representatives of both Houses. Clearly, as the Bill has proceeded, it
has raised ethical, legal and social issues giving rise to a diverse
range of views, some of which are very strongly held. How we in
Parliament and those elsewhere respond to such issues goes to the heart
of our existence as individuals and families in society. It is, quite
rightly, the place of Parliament to consider this.</div>
<a name="0806133000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">In moving the
new clauses, I understand that my hon. Friends had to ensure that the
provisions were in the scope of the Bill. I do not think that this
matter should be limited only to the issues that have been raised
during the proceedings of this Bill, and I understand that my hon.
Friends have raised the issue to start a clear discussion in Parliament
about whether there is support for such a proposition. I am of the view
that the structure that we have set up with the HFEA, the way in which
it regulates&#151;it is not the only source of information and advice
for us&#151;and the way in which we have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>proceeded with the Bill are correct. I absolutely do not accept that
there is something wrong with the HFEA. It is, frankly, not very
helpful to hear senior Members of Parliament talk about needing
&#147;antis&#148; on the HFEA, because that fundamentally
misunderstands the nature of the authority.</div>
<a name="0806133000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The nature of
the authority is that it advertises for candidates, and
anyone&#151;people of all faiths and cultures&#151;can apply.
However, potential members must be prepared to accept the fundamental
principles behind the authority&#146;s existence. That has served us
well over a period of time, but of course, the arrangements are further
reinforced by the fact that appointments are made by the Appointments
Commission on behalf of the Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="0806133000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we are
debating an incredibly important issue, I hope that nobody outside our
proceedings here will read what has been said today and draw from it
that we do not have confidence in the process. I know that it is not my
hon. Friends&#146; intention to suggest that we do not have
confidence in the HFEA&#146;s ability, as constructed by Parliament,
to discharge its
duties.</div><a name="0806133000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, as the hon. Member for Salisbury pointed out&#151;and I have
always been of this view&#151;parliamentary scrutiny has demonstrated
very clearly that Parliament has the ability to discuss bioethical
issues effectively, whether in Select Committees, during
pre-legislative scrutiny or through consultation. The Science and
Technology Committee under the chairmanship of my hon. Friend the
Member for Norfolk, North produced a very extensive report in
2005.</div><a name="0806133000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000364"></a>Dr.
Gibson:</b> I will have that constituency too&#151;it
happens to be a Liberal Democrat seat. Mine is Norwich,
North.</div><a name="0806133000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000365"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to
intervene, he should do so. If not, the Minister can carry
on.</div><a name="0806133000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000366"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I apologise to my hon. Friend if I have had his
constituency incorrectly recorded in
<i class="I">Hansard</i>.</div><a name="0806133000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
very good and extensive report was produced in 2005, which was the
outcome of a year&#146;s study of human reproductive technologies. It
had considerable influence on the Department of Health&#146;s
subsequent public consultation. As has already been acknowledged, the
Bill has changed considerably from its draft form.</div>
<a name="0806133000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real
point&#151;my hon. Friends will correct me if I am wrong&#151;is
whether we need a wider bioethics Select Committee or Joint Committee
of both Houses to consider not just issues that are pertinent to this
legislation, but wider matters. Personally, I want parliamentarians to
continue to do that, and I think that the Government would resist any
idea of anything independent.</div>
<a name="0806133000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my noble
Friend Baroness Royall said in response to such a debate in the other
place, we see merit in a Standing Committee of Parliament on bioethics.
However, that is not something that it is appropriate to set out in
primary legislation, and it is not a matter for this Bill&#151;we
certainly could not get the proposal in order, given the wider
considerations. That is ultimately a matter for Parliament to consider,
so let me gently suggest how a consensus may emerge.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div><a name="0806133000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The decision to
set up a new Select Committee is one for the House&#151;or both
Houses, if it is decided that there should be a Joint Committee. Of
course, the Government would consider any suggestion for a new Select
Committee that had sufficient support from all parties. In addition to
taking account of the views that have been clearly expressed during our
deliberations in Committee, it might also be appropriate if views were
sought from the Modernisation Committee and the Procedure Committee
about why and how this step could be taken forward. I am advised that
this would be a matter for the House and that progress should be made
through the usual channels.</div>
<a name="0806133000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my
hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East will not push the new
clause to a Division, but as the Minister responsible for the Bill, I
will ensure that I draw the comments of all members of the Committee on
the wider issue to the attention of the appropriate authorities in the
House. Such a Committee, perhaps a Joint Committee, could strengthen
our understanding, and the way in which we discharge our roles as
Members of Parliament, when we address these important social and
ethical issues.</div>
<a name="0806133000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000367"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> I am grateful for my right hon. Friend&#146;s
comments, which are very acceptable. The other place asked for guidance
from this end of Parliament on the issue and it would have been remiss
of us if we had not discussed it this afternoon. I think that some
guidance has been given from this Committee to the other place and to
Parliament in general. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, we now need
to lobby outside this Committee.</div>
<a name="0806133000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred to the Joint Committee on
Human Rights. My idea was to have a parallel Committee with a similar
membership. It has always amazed me that we discuss human rights in
this place, but we do not, in parallel, discuss ethics, which are
becoming much more important as Bills such as this pass through
Parliament. It might well be that 30 is too many members for the
Committee, but the figure of eight that was mentioned in the other
place would be too small. Somewhere in between those two numbers would
be acceptable, I am sure.</div>
<a name="0806133000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, the
new clause is too narrow; it had to be drafted in such a way that it
would remain within the scope of the Bill. My preference would be not
only to have a broader Committee for human bioethics, but to introduce
consideration of animal bioethics, because matters such as
xenotransplantation cross both the human and animal
spheres.</div><a name="0806133000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been good to have the debate and I thank my right hon. Friend again
for her comments. I am sure that we have given some guidance to the
other place as the Bill has proceeded, so I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000368"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Before we conclude our proceedings, I would
like to make a few comments. I would like to thank you, Mr.
Hood, and Mr. Gale for the excellent way in which you have
helped us through the Committee proceedings. My thanks to the Clerks,
who are ever vigilant and have done their best to ensure that we debate
all the issues identified as necessary by the Committee. Thanks to the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> staff, to the police officers and to those to whom I am
not normally supposed to refer: my officials. I thank them for all the
hard work&#151;over a long time now&#151;that they put into
producing an excellent
Bill.</div><a name="0806133000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to thank the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness for his
measured, thoughtful and constructive approach, which I appreciated. We
have been considering subjects that were difficult and challenging for
me, as a Minister, but I know that that would be even harder in
opposition without such detailed support. The issues that he raised
helped our debate, as did those raised with considerable skill by his
hon.
Friends.</div><a name="0806133000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also thank the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, who turns out
to have many skills&#151;all excellent. He truly has followed and
worked on the subject for a long time. He has considerable expertise.
We are glad that he shared some of that expertise with us, but we might
have been here longer had we heard it to its full extent. I thank him
because I know that he follows the debate with great diligence and
passion. His colleague, the hon. Member for Southport, has not always
agreed with him. It was interesting to see one intervening on the other
during speeches. They disagreed slightly, but they have been helpful to
the
Committee.</div><a name="0806133000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I thank my hon. Friends, who brought considerable knowledge, patience,
advice and consideration to their support of me as the Minister on the
Bill, even when they did not always agree with me. I am particularly
referring to my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston
and Bellshill, who is not able to be here this
afternoon.</div><a name="0806133000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
has been an excellent Committee and I am grateful for our proceedings
and everyone&#146;s participation. I look forward to further debate
on the Floor of the
House.</div><a name="0806133000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000369"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I join the Minister in expressing my thanks to
you, Mr. Hood, and to Mr. Gale for the excellent
way in which you have chaired the Committee and for the advice and
guidance that you have given as and when it has been appropriate. I
also thank, in particular, the Clerks who have been involved in the
Bill, who have provided support and advice to Opposition Members, who,
as the Minister rightly pointed out, do not have the support of the
expert civil servants that she clearly
has.</div><a name="0806133000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank members of the Committee, particularly my hon. Friends the
Members for Salisbury, for South-West Devon, for Hemel Hempstead and
for Rugby and Kenilworth, who have all participated in our proceedings.
In their individual ways, their informed and measured contributions
have been helpful and constructive in our
debates.</div><a name="0806133000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to say how much I have enjoyed the contributions from, and the
interaction between, the hon. Members for Oxford, West and Abingdon and
for Southport. It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>always said that the Conservative party is a broad church, but we have
seen today that the Liberal party is even broader. It would be helpful
at some point to see whether the two hon. Gentlemen agree about
anything. I also thank Labour members of the Committee, particularly
the hon. Members for Norwich, North, for Bolton, South-East and for
Brighton, Kemptown who, again in their individual ways, made
significant contributions at different times in our
proceedings.</div><a name="0806133000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I thank the Minister for, most of the time, her extremely calm and
considered response to the debates. She has always been helpful,
constructive and clear, and she responded with great clarity to the
concerns that were expressed, the questions that were asked and the
amendments that were tabled. Such issues are complex and challenging. I
am sure that the right hon. Lady would acknowledge that neither she nor
I are scientists and that trying to try to get to grips first with the
science, and then overlaying the ethical issues, is extremely
challenging for anyone who does not have a grounding in such areas. I
wish to put on the record the fact that I thought that she did so with
great aplomb. She has obviously put a tremendous amount of work into
understanding the detail behind the Bill. While we might not agree on
every political issue, I hope that the constructive way in which the
questions have been put and the amendments have been explained have led
to a constructive response from the Government, and that that will mean
that the Bill, when enacted, will last just as long&#151;if not
longer&#151;than the 1990 Act.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806133000370"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I take this opportunity to thank you,
Mr. Hood, and your co-Chairman, Mr. Gale, for the
way in which you chaired the Committee. I note that we have finished
earlier than we had catered for, which is a testament to the fact that
we have made excellent progress throughout. It is only fair that I
first associate myself with the remarks of the Minister and the hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness in thanking all those who have been of
great help to the Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div><a name="0806133000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I congratulate
my hon. Friend the Member for Southport on putting his views so well.
We have been debating a free-vote issue, and clearly neither he nor I
have the skill shown by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness as he
represented all strands of the Conservative party. We decided to split
the questions and ensure that we gained clarity from both sides on some
fundamental ethical issues. On the one hand, I was delighted that my
hon. Friend was to be a member of the Committee while, on the other
hand, I was worried about it because he puts his views, which I
sometimes do not share, so
well.</div><a name="0806133000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness for his kind words, as I
thank the Minister for hers, although I wish to reject absolutely her
scurrilous allegation that I have any skill as a draftsman&#151;or
that I claim such skill&#151;or even that I have skill as a
conciliator. I thank her for her approach in her more positive moments,
which made being a member of the Committee as much of a pleasure as her
less positive moments made it less so.</div>
<a name="0806133000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">In concluding,
I thank Becky Purvis from my office. She has had a heavy load to bear
over the past few years on the issue. I welcome the contributions to
the debate from other members of the Committee whose parliamentary
career has been engaged in the study of some of the scientific issues
involved. Although we have finished our proceedings well within time, I
hope that that does not mean that we will not have enough time to
debate on the Floor of the House issues that need to be decided on a
free vote. We have had so few Divisions during our proceedings and
finished so quickly because we know that other voices need to be heard
on certain issues. I look forward to hearing them on
Report.</div><a name="0806133000259"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
