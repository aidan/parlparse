<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Pollution Prevention and Control Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The sittings motion sets the times and dates for discussion on the Bill. I am sure that I can rely on all members of the Committee to make that discussion as civilised and constructive as such discussions normally are. Several hon. Members raised many interesting points on Second Reading, and I am sure that our debates in Committee will be at least as stimulating.
<P>
We propose to meet twice daily on Tuesdays and Thursdays under normal circumstances. I do not suggest, however, that we should meet this afternoon. I hope that that will be by the Committee's agreement.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.&#151;[Mr. Allen.]
<P>
<UL><UL><UL>Adjourned accordingly at twenty-nine minutes to Eleven o'clock till Thursday 17 June at Nine o'clock.
