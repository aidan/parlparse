On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Clause 95 is a necessary step in the creation of the new scheme for asylum seekers. It excludes persons subject to immigration control from income-based jobseeker's allowance and from other specified social security benefits.
<P>
The current position is something of a mess. Asylum seekers who make their asylum claims at ports of entry are able to obtain social security benefits, at least until their initial application has been determined. After that, they cease to be able to claim ordinary social security benefits and they are supported by local authorities. Those who apply in country are not able to obtain social security benefits. Instead, they must look to social services legislation for emergency support, using it in a way that was never intended. That has also meant that, where the benefits are local authority based, certain areas have suffered an excessive burden.
<P>
Some authorities have sea ports or airports within their compass; others, either through tradition or through natural accretion, have become home to concentrations of particular groups. Asylum seekers have tended to gravitate towards those areas, or finding themselves there, have remained there by inertia. That has resulted in some areas shouldering more of the social and financial burdens of providing for asylum seekers than others. That is inherently unfair.
<P>
Direct cash benefits provided under the social security system have proved to be a magnet, drawing economic migrants to the United Kingdom and undermining the integrity of the asylum system. Our objective is to restore its integrity. Economic migrants have placed intolerable demands on the system, making it more difficult to give swift consideration to the cases of genuine asylum seekers. It is essential that we deal with the problems in the system, enable genuine refugees to be recognised and helped quickly and deal with the backlog.
<P>
Removing access to benefit, which is a factor for economic migrants, will, in the long term, help to restore integrity to the system and enable genuine refugees to be recognised more quickly. Less of a burden will be provided by those seeking mere economic migration rather than having a genuine claim under the 1951 convention. That group is important for the purpose of excluding people from a range of benefits. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will support the clause.
<P>
I shall deal with the withdrawal of disabled living allowance, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. The provisions of clause 75(1) will allow for higher levels of payment for disabled people and others if their essential support needs require that. The Government's policy in respect of other people who are subject to immigration control is that they should not have direct access to state-funded Department of Social Security benefits.
<P>
The Bill will enable us to support the disabled and those who have special needs. In due course, we shall introduce the requisite regulations that will enable us to do that. Given those reassurances, I hope that the Committee will approve the clause.
<P>

<H4><center>Clause 96</center></H4>
<H4><center>Amendment of section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948</center></H4>
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Again, I am uncomfortable about the withdrawal of safety nets, especially given the context and history of the National Assistance Act 1948. It was clearly pioneering social welfare legislation that was introduced by a Labour Government in the spirit of optimism that followed the second world war&#151;a time of so much pioneering social legislation in Britain.
<P>
We debate the clause in that context because the courts deemed it sufficiently encompassing to cover those who would otherwise have been left utterly destitute by the 1996 Act, which was introduced by the previous Government. Lord Justice Simon Brown made an important and significant judgment when he deemed that no one in a civilised country should be left utterly destitute. The Government now propose to remove that safety net from this category of people in a way similar to the removal of benefits, their defence obviously being that the new support arrangements provide an alternative method of saving a person from destitution.
<P>
In earlier debates, we heard about people being exempt from the support arrangements&#151;perhaps because of an act that they had carried out, or a rule that they had broken. So our disappointment remains that a safety net in the 1948 legislation that was introduced in a pioneering social welfare sense, and designed to cover all people resident in the country, is being removed.
<P>
I question the Government's motive. I understand the wish to remove the burden from local authorities, but I wonder whether, if the 1948 Act's provisions remained in force, the Government would be able to answer Lord Justice Simon Brown's point by saying that we now have a new support system for asylum seekers and that therefore there is no harm in leaving it in place. After all, the Government have admitted that they will provide for the vast majority of asylum seekers through their support arrangements, and have said that people will no longer have recourse to the 1948 Act under the terms by which they were given access by the courts, because access was conditional on there being no support arrangements whatever as the 1996 Act envisaged them. It is regrettable that the Government have withdrawn the ultimate safety net. The only justification that they can claim is that there are strong grounds for thinking that it would be brought into play and would cause an on-going problem for local authorities. I know of no evidence to support that. If an asylum seeker went to the courts in the same way as people took test cases to court under the 1996 Act, on the basis of the 1948 Act a court could properly say, ``No. You have support from the Asylum Support Directorate. The National Assistance Act does not apply.'', so the earlier local authority problem would no longer exist. Taking away the safety net seems an unnecessary belt-and-braces approach. In symbolic terms, it is a retrograde step that will create a class of people whom the Minister says he does not wish to be socially excluded but who will be excluded from social welfare provision. I fail to see the difference between social exclusion and a category of people who are excluded from all the normal benefits and support arrangements that are available to others but depend on the Secretary of State's largesse when he interprets the regulations to be made in his support arrangements.
<P>
I shall be interested to hear if the Minister can offer reasons for why this is necessary since these utterly destitute people will not exist because he will have provided for them in other ways. Does he have advice of which I am not aware to suggest that asylum seekers would still be able to present themselves to local authorities under the National Assistance Act, if they had an acceptable and reasonable offer from the Asylum Support Directorate that the courts considered made the person not so destitute that, in Lord Justice Simon Brown's terms, he would have to bring the Bill into play?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The 1948 Act has an important role in delivering care to the community. Asylum seekers with specific needs will continue to be eligible for such support, However, the Act was never intended to provide financial support and accommodation for asylum seekers solely because of their destitution. When the clause takes effect, the Act will cease to be necessary for that purpose.
<P>
The clause also removes the entitlement from others who were never intended to benefit from it. Asylum seekers will no longer be able to say, ``We refuse to accept the provisions of the Asylum Support Directorate and instead will rely on the alternative provisions under the National Assistance Act.'' If we did not remove the entitlement, an alternative system would be available to asylum seekers, who could say ``I don't choose to accept that provision. Instead, I shall exercise my rights under the National Assistance Act.'' Although we are setting up an alternative scheme, the other provisions still have effect in law. Therefore, we must remove those provisions to avoid arbitrage, whereby asylum seekers choose the support system under which they wish to operate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The clause seems to be particularly obnoxious in its effect. My understanding is that it takes away the powers of public authorities to offer additional forms of support on a discretionary basis, so it seems wholly unnecessary. The Government might have an argument in respect of the National Assistance Act and, perhaps later, the Children Act 1989 that they were saving local authorities from the mess created by the 1996 Act by allowing them a defence against having to provide any assistance via those Acts, but that logic does not apply in respect of the other Acts referred to in the clause.
<P>
If a public authority, for whatever reason&#151;perhaps local reasons&#151;wishes to create additional forms of support, it seems odd that the Government should explicitly deny it the ability to do so in legislation. The clause seems to ensure that, even if local authorities wanted to, they would have no powers to offer additional support in those ways. If my understanding is correct and these are discretionary powers that the local authorities cannot be forced to use in respect of asylum seekers, can the Minister justify denying health authorities the ability to provide assistance in those ways?
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Local authorities will be able to provide, under sundry local authority legislation, other areas of support&#151;in order, for example, to support clusters. We do not want legal challenges creating a series of alternative support mechanisms. We want to establish a mechanism of support especially for asylum seekers, which will ensure that they know what is on offer. We do not want to enable them to mount legal challenges to create different systems of support, thereby being able to choose which system of support they would prefer.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam refers to various powers. He knows that it would be unreasonable not to expect some local authorities to exercise certain powers in certain circumstances. The best approach therefore is to remove the opportunities. We are clear about the mechanisms of support that we are going to establish for asylum seekers and we want to ensure that our system&#151;not others&#151;is used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am not at all convinced by the Minister's answer. The powers that we are talking about affect such matters as local authorities' contribution to the welfare of old people and arrangements for the prevention of illness. If someone were mounting a legal challenge because of problems with the welfare of old people and with the prevention of illness, I would personally like to see that challenge succeed and additional support given. I am not at all comfortable with clause 97 and the Minister's defence is unacceptable in terms of the public interest.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I have to register concerns similar to those raised on the previous clause. This clause brings in the same kind of restrictions in the Scottish context. It is particularly relevant now, when an enlightened Administration are apparently forming in Scotland, and they may wish to make social welfare provisions above and beyond those in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman know something that the rest of us do not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I used the word ``forming''. Nothing has yet been formed. All the discussions are taking place in the Scottish context without interference from Westminster, but we are having to put in place a Bill that restricts the ability of the authorities in Scotland to make additional or exceptional provisions. We talked in earlier debates about asylum seekers in Scotland, and the different arrangements that apply because of the smaller numbers.
<P>
As was said in our debates on clauses 96 and 97, it is regrettable that we will tell the Scottish authorities that they cannot, for example, offer either additional assistance for the prevention of illness, or care and aftercare, under the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978. I can certainly think of circumstances in which that kind of additional assistance would be welcome and, to repeat my comments on the earlier clause, I would not be too unhappy if someone who fell within the criteria and could achieve additional support for the prevention of illness, or for his care and after-care when he had fallen ill, made a challenge on that basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Immigration, asylum and social security support arrangements for asylum seekers are reserved matters. I recognise, however, that the Bill includes provisions relating to devolved matters such as social work for which the Scottish Parliament will assume responsibility on 1 July. In future we would normally seek the consent of the Scottish Parliament before legislating on devolved matters. It is, of course, not possible to consult the Scottish Parliament now about the provisions of the Bill. However, once the Parliament is established and it takes over responsibility, I expect that Scottish Ministers will wish to make a statement to the Scottish Parliament explaining how the provisions in the Bill affect devolved matters.

Clause 98, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 99</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Children Act</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 418, in page 58, line 27, leave out `may be' and insert `are being'.
<P>
We now come to an important subject, which has been a mattter of great interest to many who have commented on the Bill and taken an interest in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hope that I have not said anything controversial.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Not yet, but I expect we will get to it. It may help the hon. Gentleman to know that he does not have to convince me that in new subsection (9A)(b) of section 17 of the Children Act the phrase ``may be'' needs to be amended. I am not convinced by his wording, but I know that there is a lacuna there that needs to be dealt with. That may help the hon. Gentleman to develop his argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is helpful. I hope that we will be able to investigate the matter a little further to make sure that all possible lacunae are closed. The provisions of the Children Act 1989 act as a safety net.
<P>
In the debates on the preceding clauses, we dealt with the support systems available to asylum seekers other than the new asylum support system that will be administered by the Home Office. We have removed the other systems one by one, so that those eligible for asylum support will not be able to use them.
<P>
We now come to the support available to asylum applicants and their families under the Children Act. Section 17(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It shall be the general duty of every local authority (in addition to the other duties imposed on them by this Part)&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) to safeguard and promote the welfare of children within their area who are in need; and
<P>
(b) so far as is consistent with that duty, to promote the upbringing of such children by their families,
<P>
by providing a range and level of services appropriate to those children's needs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means caring for children, and caring for them within families. Family life is important for the welfare of children. The amendment is designed to establish that the Bill does not put the children of asylum seekers into an inferior position to other children in the United Kingdom by making them ineligible for the protection available under section 17 of the 1989 Act.
<P>
The Minister has helpfully conceded that the word ``may'' in suggested new subsection (9A)(b) is a problem; it was identified as a problem by ILPA. Given what the Minister has said, I shall not go into too much detail, but clause 99(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A local authority may not provide accommodation or other assistance under subsection (1)''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the Children Act 1989&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to persons whose need for such accommodation or assistance&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) arises only because of&#151;
<P>
(i) their being destitute; or
<P>
(ii) physical effects, or anticipated physical effects, of their being destitute; and''&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT>this is the important bit&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(b) may be met by the provision of support under section 74 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Therefore, if people's needs may be met by the provision of support under clause 74 of this Bill, they are not eligible for support under section 17 of the Children Act 1989.
<P>
When we and ILPA saw that provision, we thought that it left many potential gaps. In many cases, a child's needs would not be met by the support provided by clause 74 of this Bill, I shall not rehearse all the possibilities, because the Minister's concession appears to have taken that point on board. However, I look for a simple assurance that all asylum seekers' children will be eligible for support under section 17 of the Children Act.
<P>
I do not want to leave any possible openings that would allow a child to fall through the safety net. We have taken away the safety nets for other people by removing the other types of support available, and we did not vote on that. However, we want a safety net to be in place for children. Therefore we look for an assurance from the Minister that asylum seekers' children will not be placed in a position inferior to that of other children, and that there will be no holes in the safety net through which they can fall. We do not want them to become destitute or to have to be taken into care by local authorities. We prefer to see children brought up by their families; family life is important to the welfare of children.
<P>
I have described the broad assurance that I seek from the Minister, and I hope that I shall be grateful when I hear his reply. If the Minister's aim is the same as mine, the best way to proceed would be to delete clause 99 from the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere has made an important point; his amendment draws attention to the relationship between the Children Act and the provision of support under clause 74. There are huge conflicts in the requirements of the Children Act and the support arrangements. The Government have dealt with something fairly simple&#151;removing the current duty of local authorities under the Children Act to provide care for families&#151;in a way that does not work. It is not what they intended, and I am grateful to the Minister for saying that they will try again. However, they will end up in trouble. In view of the guiding principles of the Children Act, it is hard to see how it can be made compatible with the support arrangements, and it is important to remember that it had all-party support.
<P>
The Children Act does not separate a child's physical needs from its other needs, and in adding the suggested new section 17(9A) of that Act the Government are concerned merely with whether the child's physical needs are being met. However, the intentions of the Children Act go far beyond that: the statement of principle says that the courts should consider children's physical, emotional and educational needs. Such language is entirely appropriate and should be applied to all children, irrespective of where they are from, but other provisions use phrases such as ``may not have regard to any preference''.
<P>
There is a potential conflict between a court being required to have regard to those extraneous factors and a support system that is so clearly and narrowly defined that it excludes having regard to anything except destitution, which is defined purely in terms of material goods.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment touches on a fundamental conflict between existing enlightened legislation, albeit 10 years old, which those involved in children's welfare, and all the political parties, have supported since its inception, and a measure that is overreaching in its attempt to impose conditions on asylum seekers. In the context of clause 99, families seeking asylum will find the Children Act coming into conflict with the support system. The Minister will have to grapple with the problem of allowing local authorities to continue to provide for children's physical, emotional and educational needs in the context of a support system which depends on a narrow definition of destitution.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I had a useful meeting with representatives of children's organisations yesterday, and afterwards my officials and I discussed their concerns in the light of how the clause might operate. I am satisfied that there is a lacuna which we did not intend, and we will table an appropriate amendment to deal with it.
<P>
The Children Act was not intended to deal with accommodation and financial support. When that measure was enacted, it was assumed that accommodation would be provided in the normal way and that social security payments would provide financial support for asylum seekers' children. However, the removal of that safety net in the 1996 Act resulted in responsibility for support falling to local authorities under the Children Act, which was not what was intended.
<P>
The Government's aim is to restore the situation in which the children of asylum seekers who are in need will be entitled to the same support under the Children Act as the children of local residents. Needs other than accommodation and essential living requirements will be met by the new asylum support system. That is how we will ensure a seamless safety net for all children, much as there is now, except that the asylum seekers' support system will be in place instead of the arrangements before the 1996 Act, when social security could provide support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I want to probe the Minister's intention that support and essential living needs will be met within the support system and not be the responsibility of local authorities under the Children Act. What about the children and families who are not receiving help under the support system?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> When children are entitled to support under the support system, they should be able to receive it. The clause as drafted affects the responsibility of local authorities to provide for children in need and their families when those people fall within the support scheme established in clause 74 for the benefit of the asylum seekers, their families and their dependants.
<P>
Local authorities will not be responsible for providing for asylum seekers' families' basic living needs in the sense of financial support and accommodation. As I said earlier, it was never intended that the Children Act should be used for that purpose; the current situation has arisen only because there was no alternative. Whatever one's views on clause 74, it provides that alternative. The additional needs of asylum seekers' children that go beyond what would be catered for by clause 74, and which are therefore not catered for, will continue to be a matter for local authority social services departments, as they are at present. Asylum seekers' children will continue to have the same safeguards as they have at present, except with regard to the support provisions set out in clause 74.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will they not be entitled to receive just the sort of support that the Minister described&#151;non-accommodation and non-essential living needs support&#151;under clause 99 as drafted?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We will ensure that children are adequately supported and that the provisions work well. I was impressed by the arguments advanced by the children's organisations during our meeting. We considered the matter with great care and it is clear that there is a gap in the provisions in the clause as drafted.
<P>
It is arguable that in establishing the scheme the Government, via the Secretary of State, may theoretically provide a narrower range of services than the powers allow. This Government may not do so, but another might; it would therefore be possible for the Secretary of State not to make provision, even though, in law, there is a need for assistance that, to quote the Bill, ``may be met''. In such a case there would be no provision under part VI, but equally because of clause 99, the local authority would not be empowered to provide such support under the Children Act. There would thus be a gap in provision, which some children might fall through. We want to plug that gap. The hon. Gentleman's proposal to include the words ``are being'' identifies the gap but does not plug it properly. The substitution of the words ``are being'' suggested by the amendment does not address the problem. We are considering a way round that, as we want restrictions in clause 99 to apply to people who are being assisted and to those who would be assisted if they chose to apply.
<P>
We want to ensure that part VI arrangements are the usual port of call for asylum-seeker families. We accept anxieties that clause 99, as drafted, may not quite hit the target. Unfortunately, the amendment does not hit that target either. I assure the Committee that the Government will table an amendment on Report dealing with the matter, so I request the hon. Gentleman not to press the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If I may develop my point&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is this an intervention?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I readily give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall briefly develop my point in a speech.
<P>
I want to be optimistic, but that is difficult as we have arrived at a pass. We have considered the Bill for some time and have heard expert evidence. A week or so ago, the Minister told us that there would be Government amendments to clause 99. That was before the meeting that he mentioned. I am pleased that he is talking to children's charities, and hope that he listens to them.
<P>
However, we are in a difficult position as the order paper does not include a Government amendment to clause 99. Therefore, we cannot examine such an alteration and see how it fits into the Bill.
<P>
I do not wish to be churlish, but that rather denies the nature of the Special Standing Committee. Having listened to the representations of the organisations which made submissions, we are now in the position of not being able to see what the Government propose to do.
<P>
For one reason or another, asylum-seeker children and their families may not receive support, such as accommodation or help with essential living needs. For example, a child may have disentitled itself by rejecting a preference. Will the family of that child receive support with accommodation and living needs under section 17 of the Children Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If someone is not eligible under clause 74, his or her asylum-seeking family can go to the local authority for support, and may be granted support, including accommodation and basic living needs, under section 17 of the Children Act. Does that deal with the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> No. My point concerns the family that are eligible but do not receive support under clause 74. I shall use an example cited by ILPA in its evidence to the Committee:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``What of the child whose destitute asylum-seeking parents `may' qualify for section 74 support but have disentitled themselves by rejecting an offer of accommodation in a far flung location''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 262.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My point does not concern eligibility, but whether such a family receives support. Is a family that does not receive support under the new asylum support entitled to receive support under section 17 of the Children Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is asking whether a family which is entitled to receive support under clause 74, but chooses not to receive it, can choose whether to accept an alternative system of support. No, it cannot. We do not provide for such families to choose which system of support they wish to opt for under section 17 of the Children Act.
<P>
The position under section 17 of the Children Act is, in many ways, unsatisfactory, as local authorities define need, the amount that they pay and how they pay it in different ways. We must establish a standard system so that asylum-seeker families know what is available to them. They will be entitled to support under clause 74, if they are eligible for that support. They cannot opt for support&#151;including accommodation and basic living needs&#151;under other provisions. However, should such families have needs beyond essential living needs and accommodation, those will be catered for by section 17. The safety net will be there. The only area where the safety net is replaced by clause 74 is in relation to accommodation and basic living needs. Otherwise there is effectively a seamless net for the protection of children.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I would not want to be a high-wire artist performing with one of the Minister's seamless safety nets after listening to his idea of one. We have come back to the point that concerned me initially and which the amendment attempts to rectify.
<P>
The Minister says that people cannot have help through section 17 of the Children Act 1989 if they choose to ignore it, and not receive it. Let us be clear about who ``they'' are. They are the families. We are concerned about the welfare of the children. We do not want a child to suffer under any circumstances because of decisions that its parents may have taken under the new system. Let us think about the welfare of the child, which is the basic principle behind the 1989 Act. As the hon. Member for Hallam said, the child's interests come first. They are of paramount importance, as lawyers are used to parroting.
<P>
[Mr. Colin Pickthall in the Chair]
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman explain why he believes all the concerns about children were met by the removal of access to support by the 1996 legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have come back to that 1996 legislation many times today. Perhaps we can stick to the Bill because it is the Bill that we are examining. I do not want to be diverted by the Minister because these concerns come from a large group of organisations, many concerned with children's welfare, but charities as well. I hope that the Minister will think again.
<P>
Let me take the Minister through an earlier relevant example. We suggested in an early amendment that a family should at least be given an opportunity to express a preference for accommodation, although not necessarily that the preference be acted upon. Under the Minister's scheme, the asylum support system is forbidden to take preferences into account. It may not take account of the preferences of asylum seekers about where they are sent to live. So an asylum-seeking family coming into the country might express a preference to live in Leeds because it has family there, but it could be sent to Aberdeen or Southampton because there might be clusters of people of its ethnic origin in those cities despite wanting to be near members of its extended family. If a family is offered a place in Aberdeen or Southampton, and it then ups sticks and go to Leeds, it has disentitled itself from support. What will happen to the children in those circumstances? The Minister is telling us that as the family would not be eligible for support the children cannot receive support through section 17 of the Children Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> There could be another area of potential conflict, as the hon. Gentleman may realise. The reason that a family may have chosen not to take the Aberdeen option and want to go to Leeds could be that a particular welfare issue related to a child of the family. For example, a member of the extended family might have responsibility for the care and education of the child. Therefore, in terms of the Act, it would be entirely reasonable for the family to go to Leeds but the Bill, when enacted, would cause problems for that family if it did so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Absolutely. What would happen to the child then? The local authority could&#151;probably should&#151;still take the child into care if the family was destitute and sleeping on the streets in Leeds. But would the child's best interests be met by taking it from the family? We raised this with the Minister earlier when we debated the definition of ``dependents'' of asylum seekers because we want to avoid children going into care. That ought to be avoided because it is not in a child's best interests. Family life, which all of us are concerned about, is a child's best interest. A child should stay with its family.
<P>
I urge the Minister to relent in his view on this issue. I say ``relent'' but we do not know his precise view because we have not seen the amendments. However, we are clear about one area of difference. I invite the Minister to think again.
<P>
The Minister talked about his meetings with children's organisations. I received a joint submission from Barnardos, the Children's Society, Save the Children, Unicef, the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture and the Refugee Council. I will read it to the Minister so that he does not think that it is merely lawyer talk about children's welfare being of paramount importance. Referring to the 1989 Act, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The principle that underlies the Act is that a child must be treated as a child first, foremost and above all else and that the best interests of the child be taken into account in matters which concern him/her. This in turn reflects the underlying principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which the UK ratified in 1991. These principles were to be applied universally, as much to asylum seeking and refugee children, whether alone or in families, as to all children.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The area of difference between us is clear. It follows from that that a safety net will be in place for all children in the UK, except asylum-seeking children. The section 17 safety net will not be there if the family are entitled to support and, for whatever reason, are not receiving it. That follows from what the Minister said. The difference between his view and our amendment is not merely technical and it is not that we share the same objectives, but that he believes that our way is not the right way of going about it. There is still quite a wide difference of principle between us on this.
<P>
[Mr. John Maxton in the Chair]
<P>
I am sorry that my early optimism has dissipated. We want to adopt a constructive approach here, but one that is consistent with the principle of the Children Act 1989 which had all-party support and was seen as a big step forward. We do not want something that will pick away at that and remove some children from the protection of its provisions. I am concerned by what the Minister has said this evening and I shall want to consider it more carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Still on this issue, the hon. Member for Hertsmere has referred to various categories of people who might be excluded. Could the Minister clarify his intentions in respect of any amendment he may propose on other categories? First, there are those who may make themselves ineligible for support by virtue of having broken one of the conditions, such as those who smash up their accommodation or commit some other offence which we now know will lead to loss of support. They may have broken the conditions, such as interview requirements with immigration officers.
<P>
Will such people be deemed to be those who could be receiving support and have voluntarily given it up and whose children in the revised version would be excluded, or would their children be included? It could be seen as bad if that category was rewarded and those with children were eligible for additional support even though they had done something which transgressed the rules set out by the Secretary of State, but we do not want children to be punished for the behaviour of their parents.
<P>
The second category is those who are on the verge of destitution. We had a lengthy debate about the point at which one becomes destitute. Children in family units who are somewhere near the point where destitution is defined may be an important category, and we see no reference in clause 99 to the clause 79 provisions to provide temporary support. The Minister talked about people's ability to support themselves for 14 days but I can see a period when they have been required to wind down their assets and will be living on small amounts of money. At that point they will be half way between self-sufficiency and falling within the provisions of clause 74 and possibly clause 79 if a decision is taken to give them temporary support. Under those circumstances, I can easily foresee a situation in which the local authority wishes to give them some kind of support before the clause 74 assistance kicks in.
<P>
I hope that the Minister can look at those two categories&#151;those who have been taken out of the support system for whatever reason and those who are just at the point of entry, although not yet in it, and whose children are suffering hardship as a result of their financial circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall deal first with the comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere. He spoke about his concern for family life, for principle, for children and for the large group of organisations that have made representations to him. His concern has all the elements of fluff and hypocrisy. In 1996 the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues happily voted for legislation to remove support from families. They seemed to have little concern for children or family life then, so I am unimpressed by the hon. Gentleman's attempt to present himself as a champion of family life. The hon. Gentleman's record&#151;and that of his party&#151;has been so tarnished by what happened then that he should never be allowed to make the sort of comments that he made today without having them pushed back in his face.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam has the merit of greater consistency in his approach. However, there are problems with his attempts to develop it. Despite his consistency, he has not learnt from experience and does not appreciate that his suggestions for the restoration of the benefits system are likely to lead to abuse of the asylum system. I shall not rehearse all the arguments again on the merits of benefits or a direct system of support, but there are many reasons why we do not wish to return to the benefits system. We have already debated them.
<P>
We all want children to receive an adequate level of protection when they are in need, and no one wants the aims of the Children's Act to be undermined. That Act was never intended to deal with accommodation and financial provision&#151;social security legislation was appropriate for that. That was reviewed and the current legislative proposals then came into play.
<P>
We are now dealing with the lack of provision by making a new provision for a new support system. In so far as asylum seekers are eligible to receive that support, they should not be able to rely on section 17&#151;but only in that narrow area. They have exactly the same rights as children in this country in other respects&#151;if, for example, they have special needs or are subject to abuse or neglect. We want asylum seekers' children to have exactly the same ability as any other child to access local authority social services departments in those respects.
<P>
In this one respect, however, we are providing a different level of provision, which we believe is adequate. In this one respect alone, we do not want asylum-seeker families to be able to say, ``We are not having the Government's system. We want to claim local authority support under section 17 in respect of essential living needs and accommodation.'' Some local authorities interpret section 17 in one way; others interpret it in a different way; and we are back to the shambles of the current system.
<P>
We want to restore the sort of framework that the framers of the legislation intended&#151;whereby provision for the accommodation and financial support of asylum-seeker families should be made not under social security legislation but under the Bill. In all other respects, as I have said, the situation will remain the same for asylum-seeker children.
<P>
Decisions on dispersal locations will not take account of preferences, but the circumstances of families&#151;which might include the special needs of children&#151;can be taken into account. A child might need access to specialist medical services, which might be available only in certain areas, and we would be able to take those circumstances into account when deciding where to locate an asylum-seeker family. Does my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington want to intervene?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Not just now.
<P>
<B>Mr O'Brien:</B> Our aim is to create a support system that acts as a complete safety net for children. All their other needs will be met in the same way as they are for any child in this country. However, when they are eligible for support under clause 74, they should look to that for state support and not to any other provision. They may seek private support from other sources, and that will be a matter for them. They will be free to choose.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam made several interesting points. He asked about the adults that destroy the accommodation into which they have been placed and, as a result, the family are evicted. That prospect may also face some council tenants. In such circumstances, they may be evicted and, consequently, have needs that social services departments will have to address. However, asylum seekers in that position will have access to the welfare system. We shall consider the welfare circumstances of a family when considering whether to offer alternative accommodation.
<P>
Let us assume that a father returns home drunk and smashes up the accommodation. As a result, and through no fault of the children, a landlord might say that he wants that family out. They are then evicted. At that point, the Asylum Support Directorate will assess the welfare implications and provide alternative accommodation for certainly the children and one parent and, perhaps, for the whole family. When assessing the needs of the family, the directorate will have to take into account the fact that there are children with needs. That will affect how quickly a decision is taken and where alternative support is provided. If a family&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the Minister will not mind if I point out that he is straying from the amendment. He will be able to make his point on later amendments and on the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful for your advice, Mr. Maxton. The amendment deals with possible gaps in support, and I accept your suggestion that I should not discuss wider issues.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam thought that there might be a gap when people enter the system, but are not acknowledged to be part of it. The Bill contains provisions to deal with people who are in the process of seeking access to support, and we have already discussed them. We also intend to provide direct support to refugee and other organisations. Therefore, immediate needs will be met. The Refugee Council and other organisations are very good at providing immediate support when someone enters the country. Other charitable and voluntary organisations take in asylum seekers at airports and ensure that they are given advice on where to go and on how to link up with the support systems.
<P>
The regulations may need to consider how we provide immediate support or access to immediate support under the Asylum Support Directorate. Alternatively, we may need to provide temporary payments to enable people to access support from the directorate. However, we envisage being able to deal with the case that the hon. Member for Hallam described.
<P>
I do not want to trespass on to other matters, but there is not intended to be a gap in our provisions for 24-hour cover for asylum-seeker families. If the Home Office is not immediately available or if other needs, including those of accommodation and essential living needs, must be met, there will be no gap. The Home Office will contract with a local authority to provide 24-hour cover and support for asylum-seeker children. I do not envisage gaps arising or the Home Secretary failing to provide what he should. Our aim is to make the provision as seamless as possible. That is how we want the clause to operate.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> The Minister argues that he is providing a seamless safety net for asylum-seeker children. I am afraid that I beg to differ. The amendment is designed to ensure that no asylum-seeker child falls through the net. We are now discussing the protection afforded to children by the Children Act 1989 and a provision of the Bill that many Labour Members&#151;even those who swallowed the entire Bill whole&#151;have a problem with.
<P>
The Minister's case might appear compelling to those who do not know much about asylum seekers. His arguments on all aspects of the Bill can be boiled down to three points. The first is that all asylum seekers are&#151;to use his favourite word&#151;bogus. Secondly, they are all&#151;to use another favourite word&#151;abusing the system. Thirdly&#151;and this is the most compelling point in an age of realpolitik&#151;no one really cares.
<P>
However, all those ad hominem arguments about motivation, intent and free choice do not apply to children. Whatever one might say about their parents, children are not abusing the system. They are not bogus asylum seekers and people care about them. I do not believe that the millions of people who support the Labour party want to open the newspapers and read about the plight that might befall asylum-seeker children if the clause is accepted unamended.
<P>
My colleagues are asking the same question as other people will ask. Why should asylum-seeker children not be afforded the full protection of the Children Act? The Minister spoke about a seamless safety net, but I must say to him, in the kindest and most comradely way, that I find that point disingenuous. He claims that the support system provided for in the Bill will be seamless.
<P>
The system will be seamless all right&#151;except that almost everything will be at the discretion of Ministers and Home Office officials. It is seamless so long as there is not a charity, a family, a mosque or anyone else from whom one could reasonably be expected to obtain support. It is seamless, but to a standard that we do not know, because the Minister has not told us. It is seamless, but it will make only vestigial allowance for any form of inspection. It is seamless, but people will not be located according to their choice. It is seamless, but on a cash-limited basis.
<P>
What kind of seamless safety net is it when so much is discretionary and so much unknown, and when Ministers have taken care to reflect at every point in the Bill their concern for cash limits? There is no concern about social exclusion, about which the Minister professes to care. At every point in the Bill there is a concern for cash limits rather than for statutory rights.
<P>
If the Bill is accepted unamended, asylum-seeker children will at best find themselves shuffled between local authorities and the support system. At worst, the only way in which local authorities will be able to fulfil their residual responsibilities under the Children Act is to take children into care. That is a wholly inappropriate and disproportionately expensive way of meeting their needs.
<P>
The Minister claimed that asylum-seeker children would receive the same protection as other children, with the exception of the tiny matter of having a roof over their heads and their essential living needs met. How can asylum-seeker children have health rights under the Children Act when they may be put in unsuitable, crowded accommodation under the Bill's support arrangements? How can they have the protection that other children have in relation to sexual abuse, when under the support arrangements they may find themselves in overcrowded accommodation shared by young children and adults of a different sex?
<P>
How can asylum-seeker children have the same rights as other children in relation to education, when under the Bill they may find themselves ``dispersed'' away from schools where they have just begun to make a start? They may be dispersed to schools attended by children who have never seen asylum-seeker children before.
<P>
I remind the Minister that section 1(3) of the Children Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a court shall have regard in particular to . . . the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, we have been debating for several weeks a Bill which explicitly rules out taking into account asylum-seeker parents' wishes and feelings. How can the Bill offer asylum-seeker children the same protection as other children? The Minister is engaged in an utterly bogus intellectual exercise, attempting to separate a child's needs for a roof over its head, and for food, clothes and other basic essentials from other issues dealt with in the Children Act.
<P>
That is impossible. Social services will not be able to meet needs relating to health, sexual abuse and education without taking into account housing and essential living needs. Should the Bill be enacted unamended, there will be a gap in protection for asylum-seeker children.
<P>
Ministerial rhetoric about bogus asylum seekers and abuse of the system cannot possibly apply to asylum-seeker children. Even the most xenophobic reader of the Daily Mail would not imagine that asylum-seeker children deliberately intend to defraud the system. I do not accept that my colleagues in the Labour party believe that, as we lay claim to international leadership on humanitarian issues in the approach to the millennium, we should single out a group of children in society&#151;asylum seeker children&#151;and deny it the protection of the Children Act.
<P>
The Minister's arguments do not hold water. His seamless safety net is nothing of the kind. It is highly disingenuous of him to argue that he can offer protection to asylum-seeker children, but take housing, food and clothing out of the equation. I do not know what will happen to the amendments in Committee, but the Minister should be in no doubt that the matter will be raised again on Report. Should it not be resolved then, it will certainly be raised again when the Bill is considered in another place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> The amendment is important because it would close gaps both in the present system and in the Bill's provisions. The Minister does not want people choosing between two systems that run alongside one another. He does not want people saying: ``You have offered me something through the asylum support system. I'm turning that down, and I will go to social services to claim rights under the Children Act.'' I understand the logic of that position, and accept that the Minister does not want an incoherent system. We have had enough of such a system over the past three or four years. We inherited something that was a mess from day one.
<P>
However, without seeing the Government amendment that the Minister says will be tabled on Report, I cannot envisage how the new system will look. However, whether or not such an amendment is acceptable, clause 99 proposes that some people will be ineligible for certain types of assistance from the local authority under the Children Act. People who ought to be eligible for support under clause 74 will not be eligible for certain types of assistance under the Children Act.
<P>
I am afraid that I can see practical, everyday problems arising when decisions are made on such a basis. Social services have to make a decision when someone turns up at their department. What are they to do? Do they say, ``We judge that you are not destitute''? Do they refer the asylum-seeker to the Asylum Support Directorate to judge whether he or she is destitute?
<P>
People may be bounced from one department to another as decisions are made about whether they qualify under clause 74 and whether they are eligible for anything under the Children Act. However the clause is amended, problems will arise if we retain a fundamental division between those who will be eligible for everything under the Children Act and those who will not.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There will be people in the support system who, under the Children Act, will be eligible for assistance that does not include accommodation or basic living needs. That means that the local authority will take decisions without taking into account the context of a family's total needs.
<P>
I always assumed that the principle of the Children Act was to examine holistically overall needs. Should responsibilities be divided between an agency and the local authority, practical problems may arise in relation to who is responsible for a certain service and who decides whether a family should receive something. The amendment attempts to close such gaps.

<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> What my hon. Friend says about split responsibilities reminds me of something that many Committee members will have encountered when an older person is about to leave hospital. In such cases, responsibility is divided between the health service and social services. Over a period of many months, one department will attempt to palm off responsibility on to the other. That is bad enough for elderly people in hospital, but the same thing is now going to happen to children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> We know that such things happen, and we would not be surprised to learn of their happening in another context.
<P>
We have tied ourselves in knots trying to close gaps and find a system that will work. I am afraid that that is the inevitable result of a decision to have a cashless system. That is the root of the problem that we are trying to address in clause 99. Once a decision has been made to have a cashless system, gaps have to be closed if that system is to become workable. People cannot be given the option of using the National Assistance Act 1948 or the Children Act to obtain certain accommodation.
<P>
The clause and the amendment both attempt to close such gaps. Going for a cashless system means that we are getting into repeated arguments about bureaucratic structures and systems that may be required to prevent such-and-such a gap. We are led into such difficulties as a consequence of choosing a certain economic method of deterring fraudulent claimants.
<P>
I suspect that individuals will inevitably lose out in the arguments about whether responsibilities fall on the local authority or the Asylum Support Directorate and&#151;if the amendment is agreed&#151;whether such responsibilities are covered by clause 74. The amendment emphasises the unworkable nature of the system that we are in danger of agreeing, but even if it proves not be unworkable, the department responsible for delivering it will not be capable of doing so.
<P>
I hope that, before Report, my hon. Friend the Minister will re-examine carefully what we are doing. He has promised the Committee amendments. It seems almost pointless to debate the clause if it is to be amended in some way of which we are unaware on Report. The amendment highlights the dangers of this part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am saddened by the uncharacteristically personal attack by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. I have never indulged in rhetoric that suggests that all people who claim asylum are bogus. My hon. Friend will see, if she reads the Official Report, that I have not used the word ``bogus'' once during our proceedings. I said that there was a serious problem of abuse of the asylum system, but there are many genuine people claiming asylum. Indeed, 17 per cent of those who claim are recognised as genuine by the Government. That figure increased from 6 per cent in 1997. Also, as my hon. Friend knows, she has no cause for complaint about the position of people who are granted exceptional leave to remain. Therefore, she was unfair and uncharacteristically objectionable in the language that she used on ascribing views to me or those who support the Bill. They are most certainly not our views.
<P>
I and some of my hon. Friends' other colleagues are dismayed that she thinks that she is the only person who has any worries about children. A number of us have children and we share her concern that they be treated properly. For this reason, we have made it clear that we intend to put in place a safety net for children. The protection that her child receives, other than in respect of essential living needs and accommodation, will be the same as that given to the child of an asylum seeker.
<P>
The Government's aim is to ensure that the support that we have given children is not undermined. Local authorities will have to decide how to provide support under the Children Act 1989. They may decide that, at the moment, there are different ways of doing that. We need to ensure, at least in terms of support and accommodation, a consistency that simply does not exist now. To argue otherwise is to say that either we keep current practice or we move to something that the Government find untenable&#151;the complete restoration of benefits. We have made it clear that we are not going down that route.
<P>
My hon. Friend offered the Committee a series of what I considered were intellectually bogus&#151;to use that word&#151;arguments about&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Let me deal with my hon. Friend's comments. The terms in which she made various points were questionable. First, she said that sexual abuse was not covered because children would be in overcrowded conditions with non-family members of the opposite sex. That is absolute, pure nonsense.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I will give way to the hon. Lady in a moment. She must be aware that every member of the Committee wants to ensure that children are not abused; that the health needs of children are met; that children are not put into schools where they will be abused; and that children will not be treated in any objectionable way. For the hon. Lady to suggest otherwise is ridiculous. Her suggestion that our provisions would not allow a basic level of social services protection for children is simply wrong.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Where precisely in the Bill is there any specification about the quality of housing for asylum seekers? Where in the Bill is there any statutory protection against asylum seekers being placed in overcrowded accommodation?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If children are placed in overcrowded accommodation with non-family members of the opposite sex, it is quite clear that that accommodation is not adequate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am dealing with the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington.
<P>
The hon. Lady said that asylum-seeker children would be placed in a damaging position, but we do not accept that. Asylum-seeker children will be in the same position as the children of those who are settled here&#151;with the sole exception that basic support for accommodation and essential living needs will be provided under clause 74, in much the same way as was intended under the Children Act. I do not know whether the hon. Lady was a Member of Parliament when that legislation was passed, but hon. Members who voted for it intended that other provisions would deal with benefits, accommodation and so forth.
<P>
The hon. Lady wants those who refuse the Government's support to be able to choose what form of alternative support they prefer. Our clear aim, however, is to provide an adequate system of support which is appropriate for children. If parents decide not to take it, their children will be protected by section 17 in the sense that, although they will not receive benefits, they will have the same recourse to social services departments if they fall into poverty or are neglected. We will also ensure that 24-hour cover is provided. I was enormously disappointed by the hon. Lady's unnecessary comments, which amounted more to hyperbole and rhetoric than to genuine argument and debate.
<P>
I should like to deal now with the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard). He made coherent arguments&#151;unlike, I regret to say, my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. I understand his concerns about the wording. He is worried that proposed subsection (9A)(b) amounts to a splitting of responsibility and that in certain circumstances it could be unclear who is responsible.
<P>
We believe that the responsibility is clear and that it should be evident from the first moment that asylum-seeker children arrive in this country. But that does not mean that they should be able to decide whether they want support under clause 74 or under section 17 of the Children Act. We cannot allow that sort of trade-off. The parents should not be able to use their children to create that sort of choice; that is not what the Bill is about. Nevertheless, we do want to provide an adequate safety net for children in respect of accommodation and financial support and the full safety net that other children have with respect to all other needs.
<P>
We are considering how to deal with the problem of ``may be'', posed by the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere's amendment. There are several ways of achieving that&#151;

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We were debating amendment No. 418.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The aim of talking to various groups and consulting widely on the way in which the Children Act will develop is to ensure that the clause provides the sort of safety net to protect children that we want and that the provisions and responsibilities are there. We will be offering extensive non-statutory guidance to local authorities on the effect of the new provisions in part VI and on the continuing role that they will have in relation to the whole range of their functions. There is also a power to issue statutory guidance to local authorities on the exercise of section 17 of the Children Act.
<P>
We intend to honour our commitments. We intend to ensure that the provisions of the Children Act are properly applied. They were never intended to deal with issues of accommodation and direct financial support and are only used for that purpose now because of the deficiences of the 1996 legislation. Once we have remedied those deficiencies and put in place an alternative system of support, there is no reason why they need to continue to carry a burden which they were never intended to carry. In all other respects, asylum seeker children will have the support of section 17 of the Children Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Perhaps I should say that this has been a useful debate. It perhaps has not gone entirely the way that I would have expected, in view of the Minister's intervention at the beginning of my opening speech. I shall want to consider his words carefully, but at present it seems that my concerns, which are shared by many others, remain. Things are getting a little chaotic. We are now debating, not clauses or amendments, but statements of intention, and we have no idea exactly how they will work out and fit into the Bill. We saw that earlier with clause 77.
<P>
I am not sure that what the Minister described as a concession alters things much from what they already are on the face of the Bill. I was concerned about the family, who for their own reasons, might refuse an offer of support or not have their preference taken into account and go to a different area. The Minister told me by way of a concession that although preferences may not be taken into account, circumstances may. I did not derive much comfort from the example that the Minister gave of circumstances that might be taken into account&#151;the child with special needs who went somewhere that provided specialist medical care. Who on earth would ever suggest that a child with special medical needs should go anywhere other than a place where he or she could receive specialist medical care? If that is a concession, we shall need to see something a little better than that.
<P>
I am not at all happy with the way that things stand. I am tempted to press the amendment to a vote. We have identified what the area of difference is and it has not been met by what the Minister said.There was a difference at the beginning and it is still there now. The amendment I moved was suggested by ILPA. It identified whether eligibility or the fact that someone is receiving support determines whether they can receive support under the Children Act. It is a perfectly good amendment and as the Minister is not prepared to accept it I am tempted to press it to a Division. However, I am an eternal optimist&#151;perhaps not as optimistic as I was at the beginning of the debate&#151;and full of goodwill, which we need at present, especially as it is directed at the Government Front Bench.
<P>
This is an extremely important subject to which we shall definitely want to return on Report. Far be it from me to make rhetorical points, but in a spirit of goodwill and optimism, and wanting to see what the Minister will table, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister said that the Children Act 1989 was never intended to provide accommodation. We know that accommodation and other essential living needs have been provided under the mechanism of that Act because under the 1996 Act people have no recourse to any other support.
<P>
However, the Minister's reason for including clause 99 in the Bill seems to be that if the provisions of the Children Act are not removed, an asylum seeker would be able to choose which method of support to take up. I am not an expert on the operation of the law on these matters, but is it really the case that any other citizen could refuse housing benefit and income support and ask the local authority for assistance under the Children Act? That Act is a stop gap when nothing else is available, yet the Minister tells us that the system he proposes for families with children will be perfectly adequate. I therefore question whether a family that has received an offer of support from the Asylum Support Directorate would really have that option. It strikes me that that option would be available only if it was open to anybody&#151;British citizen or not&#151;who refused any other method of support to go to the local authority. Surely, the fact that there was an alternative support arrangement would be a relevant factor in a court's judgment.
<P>
The Minister may argue that the provisions are all-encompassing and that anybody who had refused another method of support could use section 17 of the Children Act. I hope, therefore, that he will explain why clause 99 is necessary.
<P>
The only motivation for anybody to go to the local authority would be that the support package offered by the Asylum Support Directorate was worse than they could expect under the Children Act. Yet we all know that support under that Act is chaotic; the system does not work well and the support arrangements are inadequate. Is the Minister telling us that the support offered to families by the Asylum Support Directorate will be so bad that people will prefer to go to the local authority and ask for support under the chaotic arrangements in section 17 of the Children Act 1989? If the Minister has any confidence in the adequacy of the proposed system to provide for the needs of families, no one in their right mind would ever call into play section 17 of the Children Act. There is thus no reason to take the significant step of making a fundamental change in principle to exclude a category of people from that provision.
<P>
Section 17 of the Children Act is not a safety net but a safety rope that stops people when the safety net has given way and they have fallen through it. If the safety net of the Asylum Support Directorate is adequate, the safety rope will be available only in the most exceptional circumstances&#151;circumstances, I suggest, in which some other form of support would be necessary.
<P>
I hope that the Minister can tell me why, if some support arrangements can be challenged and alternative support provided under the Children Act, that is not the case for support arrangements such as the benefit system for people deemed to be destitute.
<P>
Why does the Minister lack so much confidence in the arrangements that he expects people to prefer the inadequate means of support available from local authorities to what he said would be at least the equivalent of housing benefit and income support? If the support is at least the equivalent, I cannot see why the Minister fears the prospect of hordes of people presenting themselves to local authorities to ask for inappropriate section 17 support.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> The system of support that will be proffered if the clause remains in the Bill will not be a seamless safety net. As I said earlier, much of the system will be discretionary and standards have not been specified. As we have found out today, the Minister seems to envisage provision by the voluntary sector and faith communities substituting for, not supplementing, statutory provision. We will not be able to provide asylum-seeker children with exactly the same protection available to other children. A roof over one's head and food and clothing are central to other welfare issues.
<P>
The Minister said in response to my intervention that no one intended to put asylum-seeker children into overcrowded accommodation. I have never argued&#151;no one on the Committee has&#151;that the Minister intends to put asylum-seeker children into overcrowded accommodation. However, we have heard about the emphasis that has been put on asylum seekers staying with relatives. Does the Minister think that Somalian, Nigerian and Kosovan asylum seekers in Hackney have holiday cottages in their back gardens where they can accommodate their relatives?
<P>
Given the economic circumstances of most asylum seekers, once one says that accommodation with relatives can provide an acceptable alternative to statutory entitlement to accommodation, one automatically suggests that some of them will live in overcrowded conditions. Many asylum seekers are poor, and do not have sufficient space for themselves let alone any relatives who may enter the country.
<P>
The Bill does not set minimum standards for occupancy or the size of accommodation. The failure to specify standards and the emphasis that will be placed on the voluntary sector and relatives mean that some asylum seekers will find themselves in overcrowded conditions and facing the welfare implications that I mentioned earlier.
<P>
Unlike most members of the Committee&#151;you are one of the exceptions, Mr. Maxton&#151;I was in Parliament during the passage of the Children Act 1989 and voted for it. One of its central themes was that the wishes and feelings of the child should be taken into account. However, this Bill explicitly states that, in certain particulars and especially in housing, the wishes and feelings of a child cannot be taken into account. If the system of support that is in the Bill is so good, the Children Act might never kick in. If the Minister is so confident that no one will fall through the net and no child will suffer, he has nothing to fear from the Children Act.
<P>
We shall return to this subject on Report. References to hyperbole and female hysteria will not help them. Colleagues will expect the Minister to argue the principle for excluding asylum-seeker children from the provisions of the Children Act. In so far as an argument has been made in Committee, it has been a pragmatic one. He said that it would be inconvenient, difficult and might create problems to use the provisions of the Children Act for asylum-seeker children. On report, he must use an in-principle argument to explain why the Government seek to remove such children from the comprehensive protection of the Act. For his sake, I hope that by then he will have prepared remarks to that effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is an important clause, and we have had a good debate on it. I have already expressed my concern that some children will fall through the net. I understand from the Minister that some children will simply not be eligible for support under the Children Act. Others may be eligible, but, as the hon. Lady said, decisions will be entirely at the discretion of officials. With the best will in the world, officials can sometimes take wrong decisions and there will be no safety net for those adversely affected when officials' discretion is wrongly exercised. The safety net of the Children Act is being removed.
<P>
I heard what the Minister said about all the other services&#151;other than accommodation and essential living needs&#151;that will be provided, but that seems to be what was originally envisaged.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When I read the explanatory notes on the clause, I realised that the Minister's supposedly new view of it and the new amendments that he might propose had distinct echoes of those notes, which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This clause provides that local authority social services departments may not provide assistance to the families of children in need solely because the family is destitute in cases where they would be entitled to assistance from the Secretary of State under the provisions of Part VI of the Bill. In such cases assistance under the respective Children Acts would only be available to the child. Unaccompanied children will continue to be entitled to assistance from social services departments under that legislation. Other duties of social services departments to children in need or at risk will also continue to apply.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister told us earlier about the other duties of social services departments to children in need or at risk, but that was always going to be the case. That is not a concession. I have heard nothing yet from the Minister that represents any departure in principle from what he originally envisaged, as set out in the explanatory notes.
<P>
The Minister's problem is that a child has a right to family life&#151;one of the main principles of the Children Act. It is a vital factor in the welfare of children that they should be able to live with their family and not be taken inappropriately into the care of local social services. The right to family life is recognised not only in the Children Act but in the UN convention on the rights of the child and in many other such conventions. Early in this Parliament we also passed the Human Rights Act 1998. Article 8 of the UN convention deals with the right to family life. I wonder how compatible the Bill is with that article and with provisions in the Human Rights Act.
<P>
I do not like the idea of taking some children out of the protection of the Children Act. Such protection is fundamental. At present, the Children Act exists for all children and I am tempted by the argument that it should remain there for all children. That is not only my view but the view of many organisations involved in the care of children. I received a submission from Barnardos, the Children's Society, Save the Children, UNICEF, the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, the Refugee Council, the Immigration Law Practitioners Association and members of the asylum rights campaign. Their submission states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We urge the Committee as a whole to make strenuous efforts to preserve the integrity of the Children Act and to reaffirm our commitment to refugee children. As a first step toward achieving this we urge the Committee as a whole to vote that clause 99 should not stand part of the Bill.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am inclined to follow their advice.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> We have already said that we intend, in due course, to take amendments to ensure that the clause provides a clear safety net for children. We want an orderly system, with part VI as the first port of call for asylum seekers. History has shown that gaps in legislation will be exploited. We do not wish, through a court judgment, to risk returning to the present chaotic system as a result of asylum seekers' representatives seeking to gain support for the right of asylum seekers to choose where to live.
<P>
As current provisions are applied, there are several possibilities. First, some people may choose to go to London boroughs and oblige local authorities to provide them with accommodation there. They would also expect support under the Children Act. Therefore the whole concept of dispersal could be undermined.
<P>
The second possibility was raised by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam, and related to creating choice. The hon. Gentleman asked why provision could not be made for people to choose section 17 of the Children Act, so that they could go to the local authority if its system was better than that of the Asylum Support Directorate. At present, local authorities offer variable quality provision under the Act. Some give more than ASD provisions, others give less. The system is chaotic because it varies so much. Some authorities interpret it one way, others another way. Some do not have a standard approach; they try to identify particular needs of asylum seeker families and provide accordingly. There is a great deal of variation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister has misinterpreted me. I did not say that I wanted a system in which there was choice. I queried whether that interpretation was correct. Is the Minister confident that if the Government do not proceed with clause 99 and a person who could have access to an ASD package presents himself to a local authority, it could not refuse to provide support under the Act because the person had an alternative, but that the courts would uphold the refusal because there was an alternative and the children were not in need?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The difficulty would be that someone could present himself to the local authority in an area to which he would not have been directed by the ASD. He could just choose to go to Sheffield, Hallam, although the ASD's aim was to locate him in Manchester, or he could choose to go to London to seek accommodation&#151;which would be more likely.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether I lacked confidence in the ASD's provisions. It is not about that. It is about creating a system that has legal certainty and makes it clear to all that the system is not open to challenge. If a person needs accommodation and support, it will be provided by the directorate. The Government's aim is for the ASD to provide an asylum seeker with the necessary support if that person might otherwise become destitute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is arguing that we adopt the Liberal Democrats' amendment; he implies that the ASD should have a duty rather than a power to provide accommodation. The ASD does not have a duty to provide accommodation; it has a power.
<P>
The Minister advances a bad argument on local authorities' duties under section 17. Is it not a fact that all local authorities are under what section 17 describes as a general duty towards children? The fact that some authorities may be better than others at discharging that duty does not make an argument for taking it from all of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The duty to provide for children in all ways except for accommodation and financial support will remain for asylum-seeker children. Other needs will be met by social services departments in the same way as for any other child. We are confident that failure to proceed with clause 99 will create a recipe for endless litigation. It is important to put the principle in the Bill so that the courts can see it.
<P>
In response to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, we made it clear that we did not expect the voluntary sector to stand in the state's shoes. I gave a clear indication of the Government's position.
<P>
The hon. Lady referred to Somalis who did not have holiday cottages. Well, sarcasm aside, no one suggests that they should or would have holiday cottages. We are seeking to set out minimum standards so that people have access to accommodation that is adequate to their needs for temporary places while they apply for asylum. Those standards will be set out in the contracts and the regulations that we will introduce.
<P>
The hon. Lady knows that we are providing for a statutory inspection system. She knows full well that some minimum standards will be set and that it will be for the House to approve them. Their enforcement will be carried out through contracts and a system of inspection. The concept of adequacy of accommodation is a starting point for ensuring that there are standards. If an asylum-seeker family choose to live with relatives in overcrowded conditions, that must be a choice for them. At the limit, the local authority could take action against overcrowding under the Housing Act 1985 or the Children Act if it believed that the children were not properly housed and were being neglected.
<P>
Various points were raised by hon. Members. I was asked whether other citizens could refuse other benefits and go to the social services under the Children Act? They could do that, but I suspect that what would happen would be pretty much what we intend to happen once we have got clause 99 through. No cash, but advice, counselling and advocacy will be provided to help people make claims either for social security, if they are not asylum seekers, or for asylum seeker support.
<P>
The Children Act was never intended to do what it is now being obliged to do. Neither the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington nor anyone else who voted for it intended that it should be used to provide accommodation and financial support for asylum seekers. We want the Children Act to revert to doing what it was intended to do. When we table the amendments we shall set in place proposals to enable us to provide a safety net and to ensure that we have a system which works effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I must return to this point, as the Minister referred to it in the context of what might happen under another system. He said that if people presented themselves to a local authority saying that they wanted help under section 17 of the Children Act, the local authority could discharge its duty by putting them in contact with the Benefits Agency and getting them set up so that they were no longer in need. I cannot see the difference between that situation and an asylum seeker presenting himself. Surely the local authority could discharge its duty by giving him access to the Asylum Support Directorate, which could then choose to place him in Manchester. The local authority would still have discharged its duty.
<P>
The local authority would still be left with a burden of care to provide accommodation and the essential living needs of those people, only if the Children Act stated that the person had to stay in Sheffield and could not go to Manchester&#151;in other words, if the ASD offer was incompatible with the aims of the Children Act. If we are allowing a system to go forward that will enable the ASD to offer a package of support which, if tested in law, would be found to be incompatible with the aims of the Children Act, that is extremely worrying.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In a sense, the hon. Gentleman makes the point for me. We do not know exactly how the courts might interpret the provisions of the Children Act. We did not know when the 1996 legislation was passed that it would be used to provide varied levels of support. We do not know how legal challenges might be mounted under the Children Act. If we allow things to remain the way they are, all sorts of legal challenges may be mounted under the Children Act. If we allow things to remain the way they are, all sorts of legal challenges may be mounted to undermine the way in which the Asylum Support Directorate provides accommodation in particular areas, offers financial support and operates the dispersal policy. The hon. Gentleman says that the courts may start to decide that provision under the Children Act should be different or varied in some way.
<P>
<H5>11 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I suspect, however, that if we do not accept the clause, there will be a vast amount of litigation as people try to undermine the system operated by the Asylum Support Directorate. Thus we will soon be back to the present shambles of variable systems of support under which some people seek support from the directorate and others do so by means of the Children Act. Some will decide that they want to be accommodated in a particular place, others will be obliged to take accommodation elsewhere.
<P>
We need a workable, effective system that provides some certainty. If the Bill does not make the requirements clear, nobody, especially the local authority, will know quite what its obligations are. At present, the local authorities are unsure of their obligations under the broad requirement of the Children Act. There must be legal certainty, especially about accommodation and financial support, and the clause will provide it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister's interpretation of the Children Act is that people might use it to undermine the Asylum Support Directorate. Another interpretation is that people will use the Children Act to assert the rights of children which are supposed to be universal, as defined in that Act. If that means judgments going against the ASD because something is incompatible with the Children Act, that is the whole point. The Children Act established fundamental principles that are supposed to underlie all services. It does not give me any satisfaction that in order to protect the ASD package the Bill will not allow people to apply the principles of the Children Act to the offers that have been made. I agree with the hon. Member for Hertsmere that we have not got anywhere in our debate on clause 99 except that we have clarified the fact that it takes out a principle of the Children Act 1989. The Minister seems to welcome that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I hope that the Minister will be able to explain his change of heart, which is welcome.
<P>
As originally drafted, the clause was utterly appalling. Its scope was broad and there were no legal safeguards. In the oral evidence that the Committee heard, it was described as potentially pernicious in that it entitled the Secretary of State to authorise anyone to enter any premises in virtually any conditions. Experts pointed out to us that it was likely to breach our commitments under the European convention on human rights, which has now been incorporated into domestic law in the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
The Minister seems to have accepted that criticism by tabling amendments that rewrite the clause dramatically. In amendment No. 799, he has accepted the important principle that justices of the peace should be involved in deciding whether someone has authority to enter premises.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will explain the rationale for that change and the reassessment that he made of the human rights implications. I hope that he will also provide detail on how the provision will work, particularly if the Government have drawn on a comparable scheme in order to set this one up. Will justices of the peace have comparative criteria to use when deciding whether to give authority to the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> We listened&#151;that is the answer. The hon. Member for Hallam unnecessarily described parts of the Bill as chaotic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I claim ownership of the description of the Bill as chaotic.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere described the Bill as chaotic. In the amendments to the previous clause and to this one, we listened to the representations that were made. We have said throughout that we will listen carefully to representations. A broad set of policy guidelines were set out in White Paper last July, but we consulted several groups and members of the Committee on the implementation of them. As a result of our listening, we have tabled amendments when they fit within the broad policy terms that we set out last July and when they are sensible and reasonable.
<P>
That does not mean that the Bill is chaotic. It means that it has been the subject of reflection, proper debate and listening. That is not how the previous Government operated. They bulldozed Bills through without listening and without accepting amendments. We have already shown that we are listening and that we will accept amendments when the argument is convincing. When members of the Committee have made good points, we have shown that we are prepared to examine them and will move on them when we are able to.
<P>
The clause is important. We wanted to ensure that safeguards were put in. We listened to the representations and we felt that they made a good case, which we accommodated in Government amendments. We did not think that human rights legislation had been contravened, but points made in the representations provided additional safeguards which we believed could be incorporated into the Bill without undermining the effectiveness and quality of its provisions.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 101, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 102</center></H4>
<H4><center>Information from property owners</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 842, in page 59, line 21, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and the persons occupying them''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment. We welcome the general thrust of clause 102, which ensures that accommodation is of good quality. We have all had concerns about the quality control of accommodation provided by the ASD.
<P>
The amendment would delete the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and the persons occupying them''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By seeking to delete that phrase, we are attempting to establish whether the Government intend that the provision will be operated entirely for the benefit of the people occupying the premises. Alternatively, is the provision a snoopers' charter? Are we requiring excessive information on people going in and out of a property that may be irrelevant to the quality of accommodation?
<P>
Clearly, there are concerns about the confidentiality of information that is collected. Under the Secretary of State's scheme, we expect people to have a reasonable degree of privacy in the accommodation that they occupy. There is a general provision for the Secretary of State to demand from anyone associated with the property a broad range of information, including details of the area and persons occupying the premises, which may refer to asylum seekers and those directly supported and other residents in the premises.
<P>
We are concerned about the breadth of the provision, its intention on the quality of accommodation, the rules that will govern the Secretary of State's use of information acquired under clause 102, and how that information will be used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The Secretary of State's rights under the clause will be subject to the usual conditions of reasonableness. The Secretary of State must always act reasonably, for example, acknowledging that people have a right to family life and privacy.
<P>
Our aim is not to infringe that, but to keep track of people accommodated under the support arrangements throughout the period for which they remain within those arrangements, thus ensuring that they receive the support to which they are entitled. That will ensure that they occupy accommodation of a reasonable standard, which we are entering into contracts to provide. We therefore need to be able to ask property owners and managers to keep us informed about such matters.
<P>
We may also need information for property management reasons. For example, we need to find out about the kind of residents of a hostel with vacancies, so that we can ensure that they can provide the level of support which complies with the cluster obligations that we are entering into. We would therefore need to know whether anyone from the asylum seeker's ethnic background lived in a proposed place of accommodation to ensure that such accommodation was suitable. Obtaining such information will help us to make the right decision.
<P>
The clause puts beyond doubt what we have the power to do and must remain in its present form. The hon. Member for Hallam said that his amendment was a probing amendment. We are entering into contracts with providers, and require confidentiality concerning the information that is provided. Therefore, the element of privacy breached by checking whether someone is living in accommodation will not become general public knowledge.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We civil liberties obsessives have to probe provisions in which such powers are taken on board. It was useful to put on the record something about the concept of reasonableness and a little about the confidentiality issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clauses 102 and 103 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
