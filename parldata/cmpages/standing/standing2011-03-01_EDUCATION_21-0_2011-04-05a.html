morning and welcome back to the Committee’s deliberations, Mr

leniency—for me in this Committee to wish members of my family a
happy birthday. May I deviate slightly and wish my hon. Friend the

good day, and I cannot think of a better present for her than to sit in

requires an inspection of the new types of academies. What are the
Minister’s intentions about the Ofsted inspection regime for
those new academies? In particular, might any of them immediately fall
into the new inspection category of exempt institutions, which he will
recall that we discussed under clauses 39 and 41? If so, what
safeguards are in place to ensure that quality is unaffected by the
conversion to academy status? I hope that the Minister will respond to
my concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000040">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Welcome to our penultimate sitting on our final

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sympathetic to the concerns of the hon. Member for Hartlepool that
the new types of academy that the Bill will create should be inspected
by Ofsted. I am pleased to be able to reassure him that it has always
been our intention that the two new types of academy will be inspected.
We intend to use the delegated power in clause 52(2) to make the
necessary legal
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
alternative provision academies, the situation is not entirely
straightforward. Pupil referral units are inspected by Ofsted, but some
alternative providers are not inspected due to their legal status or
small size. Only those providers that have at least five full-time
pupils on roll are required to be registered as an independent school
and so inspected by Ofsted. In 2010, Ofsted was commissioned to review
and report on whether all non-pupil referral unit alternative
provision—that is, voluntary and private providers—should
and could be inspected. Ofsted is due to report its findings this
spring. In any case, I reassure hon. Members that we will ensure
alternative provision academies are inspected in line with the position
in the maintained sector, but we want to do so in the light of
Ofsted’s
findings.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I set out in the policy statement that I circulated on last
Wednesday—at 12.4 pm—and as I explained to hon. Members
in our debate on Thursday on amendments to clause 51, I intend to
provide the House with further detail on the consequential changes that
we will make under clauses 51 and 52 at a later stage in the passage of
the

new types of academy. How the new educational institutions will fit
into the existing legal framework is complex. We shall have to consider
legislation relating to maintained schools, independent schools,
sixth-form colleges, pupil referral units, schools generally and
academies, which is why we need additional time to ensure that we get

concerns expressed by the hon. Gentleman about the element of power
that we are taking under the clause, to which he refers correctly as a
Henry VIII clause, to enable us to amend primary legislation are
entirely proper. To raise such concerns is something that I did when in
opposition, too. It is only with reluctance that we have put such
provisions in the Bill. However, I hope that such fears are allayed by
the fact that we have made the exercise of the power subject to the
affirmative procedure so that both Houses would be required to debate
the specific proposals when they are brought
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000051">&#160;</a>

that the affirmative procedure is used with regard to such aspects of
the Bill is positive and welcome. I look forward to hearing further
details as the Bill progresses through the House and, based on what he
has said, I am reassured by his determination to make sure that the

                           </strong> I am happy to do that. Clause 53 amends the
Academies Act 2010 so that in the case of a foundation or voluntary
school with a foundation that is underperforming and eligible for
intervention, the Secretary of State will not issue an academy order
unless he has consulted the appropriate religious body, in the case of
schools designated with a religious character, along with the trustees
and any person who appoints foundation governors in the case of any
foundation or voluntary school. The Government recognise the enormous
contribution that different religions have made to the education of
children in this country. We believe that it is important that
religious bodies such as the diocesan authorities are aware of concerns
in relation to any of their schools that are consistently
underperforming.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
will also be important and of course valuable to seek the
trustees’ and religious authorities’ views on the best
way to improve the schools, including whether an academy conversion is
the right solution. In many cases, such bodies will have made a
significant investment in the school—for example, by the
provision of land and buildings—and it is therefore right that
this investment and partnership in the provision of education is
recognised and reflected in our processes. In many cases, the religious
authority will own the land on which the school sits, and consultation
and co-operation will therefore already be necessary if conversion is
to be successful. We recognise that in all cases intervention will work
best if it is done in collaboration, which is what the clause aims to
reflect.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause also ensures that whenever the Secretary of State issues an
academy order in respect of a foundation or voluntary school that has a
foundation, he must give a copy of the order to the trustees of the
school, the person appointing the foundation governors and, in the case
of schools with religious character, the appropriate religious body. If
the Secretary of State decides not to make an academy order following
an application by any of those schools, he will also have to inform
those parties of his decision and the reasons for
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Good
communication between trustees, religious authorities and the
Government in respect of the schools is vital, which is why the clause
ensures that those bodies receive notice of any academy orders that
have been made for applications for conversion that have been rejected.
It also allows diocesan boards of education and other religious
authorities to continue to keep an informed strategic view across all
their schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000066">&#160;</a>

the Minister’s thinking in introducing the clause. Does he not
think that consultation with parents and local bodies is not only
desirable, but crucial to making decisions that best reflect local
needs? If he does not think it crucial, how will the Secretary of State
be sufficiently well informed to make a right, proper, fair and
reasonable decision when he grants an academy order?<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000074">&#160;</a>

being ignored in the Bill. They are being deprived of a voice in a

                        <p class="tabbed">There are
some serious concerns about the Government’s general attitude
towards consultation, particularly with teachers, who are the employees
of schools. That was highlighted in a letter that the Minister’s
colleague, Lord Hill—another Education Minister—sent out
before

			Column number: 896<a class="bkMark" name="Column896">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Christmas. He wrote to head teachers to warn about what would happen if
they decided that, in their professional judgment, it would be a good
idea and in the best interest of their school community to honour the
national terms and conditions of members of staff on converting to
academy status. He
wrote:<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

                        <p>So
much for head teachers’ professional freedom; they may think
that something is in the best interests of their school, but then they
get a warning shot across their bows from Lord Hill, who says that if
they have that kind of relationship with their local staff, they can
pretty much forget any application for academy status in the current

interesting points about teachers’ participation in decisions to
convert to an academy. We heard in the evidence sessions from the head
of the NASUWT, Chris Keates, who felt that it was entirely appropriate
for her member teachers to strike as part of the process of an academy
conversion. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that
suggestion?<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000082">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Whether people carry out industrial action is a
matter for them. Generally, it is not a good idea for teachers to go on
strike for the obvious reason—the impact that has on pupils. The
hon. Gentleman should understand, however, that if he were experiencing
a change that could significantly affect his pay and conditions, he
would be very interested in the outcome, and he would want to discuss
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My point is
that the Minister, Lord Hill, took the trouble to write to all head
teachers. Believe it or not, that is something that a Minister cannot
just do. There is a presumption in the Department against sending stuff
out to head teachers. There was when I was a Minister there, and I am
sure there still is. We do not want to burden head teachers with lots
of letters and e-mails. There is a presumption in situ against doing
that. Lord Hill took the trouble to breach that presumption and wrote
to head teachers—people who are trusted to make their own
professional judgment—to say “Do not, if it is your local
choice to apply for academy status, under any circumstances enter into
an agreement to honour national pay and conditions, because we will
consider that a mark against you in the decision-making
process.” It is a blot in a head teacher’s copy book if
they decide to do that. At that moment, the Government’s mask
slipped, and we saw how they regard professionals, including head
teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Returning
to the amendments, there is serious concern about the
Government’s attitude to consultation. There is the question of
what the Government regard as the desirable minimum level of
consultation. Does the minimum level include consulting parents? Does
it include consulting other local interests, including a democratically
elected local body? Perhaps the Minister can give us some clarity on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000085">&#160;</a>

to enter into academy arrangements, as an alternative to the

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
218 and 219 seek to achieve the same end: their aim is to ensure that
consultation takes place before an application for an academy order is
made, whereas currently consultation can take place at any point prior
to conversion, either before or after the order, or the application for
the order, is made. Members of the Committee will remember that we had
significant debate about consultation in both Houses during the passage
of the Academies Bill. I think that both the Government and the
Opposition are agreed that a thorough, open and fair consultation is
important; where we may differ is on our approaches to how that
consultation should be captured in legislation and carried out in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As we said
during the passage of the Academies Bill—this is still our
position—schools are in the best position to determine when and
how that consultation should take place. Having the flexibility to
consult before or after an academy order, or an application for an
order, is made allows each school to determine when it has sufficient
information on which to consult, and at what point during the process
it wants to do so. We do not think that it is necessary to require
consultation before applying for an academy order. Academy orders are
simply a procedural milestone that make it possible for the Secretary
of State to sign academy arrangements; they do not require that he goes
on to do so. Consultation is important before a school becomes an
academy, but a school becomes an academy when the funding agreement
comes into effect, rather than when the academy order is issued. I hope
I have reassured the hon. Member for Cardiff West on that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000088">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked why parents are not included in the list of
consultees. Parents are not excluded from those who should be
consulted. We expect schools to consult them as a matter of course. We
do not want to be prescriptive about who should be on the list. We want
the consultation to be meaningful and to include all those who have an
interest. Once we have a list of the groups that we think should be
consulted, however, it raises the question of why other groups are not
included. If the consultation is not appropriate, the Secretary of
State will not allow
conversion.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000089">&#160;</a>

I said, I would expect parents to be consulted. The point is that if we
start to list all the people whom we expect to be consulted, or if we
list just parents and not other residents or groups that may have an
interest, people will ask, “Why have those groups been
omitted?” The important point is that the school determines whom
it thinks it is appropriate to consult. The Secretary of State will
look at the consultation process, and if he feels that it was not
appropriate or adequate, he will simply not allow the
conversion.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000091">&#160;</a>

thin veneer over the attitude that lies underneath, which is currently
causing great problems for the Government on the issue of health; they
believe that they can get away with bringing about major changes
without proper consultation. Consultation is there not to put
bureaucratic stones in the road, but to ensure that when reforms are
brought in, there is if not complete consent, then an opportunity for
everyone to express their view, and indeed occasionally enlighten the
Government about the consequences of their reforms.

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is intended to ensure a role for local democracy in the form
of the local council—I am looking at our Liberal Democrat
colleagues, who are sitting in their little huddle, to see if that
wakes them up a bit. It is about whether local authorities should have
a role in our education system in the future. The amendment would
ensure that the relevant local authority is able to consult before the
conversion of a school that is eligible for intervention—a
failing school—into an
academy.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
was previously argued under clause 43, the Bill will lead to more
schools being eligible for intervention and therefore to more schools
being converted to academies. The local authority is responsible under
part 4 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 for various
intervention measures, so it should have a duty to consult. As the
clause stands, a school’s governing body must consult those that
it thinks appropriate on the question of whether the school should
convert into an academy. The amendment would also enable local
authorities to consult those that it thinks are appropriate, and for
the results to be considered in making the decision on whether the
school should convert. It would open up the consultation to wider
voices based on the local authority, which is the locally elected and
democratically accountable body. I want to hear what the
Minister’s thoughts are on the amendment and on the role of
local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000102">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I want to
raise the issue of selection in grammar schools that convert to
academies. On 21 July 2010, the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale
West (Mr Brady) and the Minister debated the provisions of the then
Academies Bill on the selection process of grammar schools choosing to
become academies. I was pleased to note that, during that debate, the
Minister made it clear that any grammar school that transferred to
academy status would not be able to change its admissions policy under
the terms of the funding agreement, without the support of a parental
ballot. In some ways, it is an irony that parental ballots, which were
so often seen as an enemy of grammar schools, turned out to be a
protection. That goes to show how often provisions have unforeseen
consequences and ones that were little envisaged by those who put them
forward for legislation and raised them
elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister please confirm that that is still the plan? Will he tell
the Committee what steps have been taken to include protections in the
funding agreements for new academies? Will he also provide any
additional details on what protections will be put in place for grammar
schools that become academies in future? If it is necessary and
helpful, I will extend my remarks, but I think that the Minister is
fully au fait with the issues, so I am happy to sit down and to hear
from him.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000104">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 220, moved by the hon. Member for Cardiff
West, seeks to add the local authority to the people who, under the
clause, may consult on whether a maintained school that is eligible for
intervention should be converted to academy status. We are all in
agreement on the importance of requiring a school to consult before it
converts. That consultation will usually be carried out by the
governing body. Clause 54 addresses the need for an alternative option
for a consultation where a school is eligible for intervention. In
these underperforming schools, an academy solution may be proposed to
turn the school’s performance around and we would not want
governing bodies to be able to frustrate such a school improvement
proposal by failing or refusing to consult. Clause 54 addresses this
issue by ensuring that a consultation is still carried out, but that it
can be alternatively conducted by the person entering the academy
arrangements for the Secretary of State; in other words, the proposed
sponsor. It seems logical that this alternative consultation duty
should fall to the proposed sponsor. The sponsor will be heavily
involved in a school’s potential future direction and it seems
right that they should consult on the plans that they have proposed to
turn a school
around.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment to include the local authority as an alternative body which
can consult seems unnecessary. The conversion of a school to academy
status provides schools with autonomy to raise standards and, in the
case of underperforming schools, it is integral that a strong sponsor
is put in place to ensure that these freedoms are used effectively to
ensure improvement. Given the vital role that the sponsor will play in
a sponsored academy, it seems right that the alternative consultation
duty falls on the sponsor and not on the local authority, especially
given that the consultation will be on a proposal to move the school
from local authority control. As I have set out, it is important that
we have an alternative to governing body consultation where a school is
eligible for intervention so that the governing body cannot alone
frustrate proposals to turn the school around. I am convinced, however,
that the Secretary of State’s proposed sponsor is the best
person to carry out this alternative
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000106">&#160;</a>

turn to the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and
Holderness regarding the exchange that took place between me and my
hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale West during the passage
of the Academies Act about grammar schools and grammar school ballots.
The funding agreements of wholly selective grammar schools that convert
to academies contain provisions which reflect the parental ballot
system which applies if a grammar school is within the maintained
sector and that has now been put into model funding agreements. I hope
that that will reassure my hon. Friend that the commitments given
during the passage of the Academies Act have been
fulfilled.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000107">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Of course, a contractual agreement between the
Secretary of State and an academy trust would be binding on future
Governments. There is nothing to stop a future Government changing the
model funding agreements and taking out such provisions. There would
also be nothing to stop a future Government, particularly one peopled
by Opposition Members, from abolishing selection altogether, but when a
Labour Government was elected in 1997 that was a decision that they did
not take. The 1998 Act prevented further extensions of selection, but
it did not remove selection from the existing 164 grammar schools. That
would be a political decision for a future Government and, of course,
my hon. Friend is aware of the parliamentary convention that an
existing Parliament cannot bind future Parliaments—they are
sovereign to do what they wish, so long as they have the backing of the
public to do it. There is a limit to what we can do to protect grammar
schools from the vicissitudes of politics in generations to come, but I
think that a binding contract between a Secretary of State and an
academy trust is a very good
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000111">&#160;</a>

response. It still seems to me that, judging by the record so far of
the new leader of the Labour Party and their reversion to the left, the
reality recognised by the incoming Labour Government in 1997 is
unlikely to be repeated were a Labour Government to be elected in
future. Therefore it seems to me that every possible barrier should be
put in the way. Putting something on the statute book would at least
provide a clearer hurdle than being able to change funding agreements
As we know, Governments can apply pressure through funding agreements.

of the amendment is to ensure that proper consultation takes place
before a school governing body applies to become an academy. This
clause should be improved, as a minimum, by requiring consultation with
families, staff, pupils and the relevant local authority. The Minister
admitted earlier that he would expect parents to be consulted before a
school converted to an academy, although his conviction was not zealous
enough for him to think that that should form part of the

statutory responsibilities for the education of children in its area,
and a much greater knowledge of local conditions than the Secretary of
State, should also be consulted. It makes sense for it to be consulted
before the Secretary of State makes his decision, rather than relying
on the reports of civil servants. What further assurances can the

example, the democratically elected local council? There could also be
consultation with school staff, rather than threatening letters to head

prescriptive list. It is hard to encompass all groups that might need
to be consulted and, in the end, a prescriptive list might stifle a
wider consultation that the governing body would otherwise have carried
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000124">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is just one of the many things about which
the Minister is wrong. I thank him for his birthday wishes, and I hope
that the rule “If it is your birthday, your amendments get

true.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000127">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Why
does the Minister believe that such groups should not have a right to
representation? To make sure that they are involved is another way to
ensure that they will always be consulted. The amendments would not
preclude including a broader group of people, but we would ensure that
such people had a right to representation in
consultations.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000128">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am putting forward the same argument. I am not
saying that the consultation of people such as parents, pupils and
staff is not important. In most cases, a consultation could not be
deemed reasonable if it did not involve those who would be most
affected by academy conversion. We are trying to resist having a
prescriptive list because, inevitably, it would miss out some groups
that, in certain circumstances, might be more important or as important
as the groups that the hon. Lady wants listed under the Bill. That is
why we will not accept the amendments and why we are resisting the
concept of prescribing in detail who should be consulted. On that
basis, I urge the hon. Member for Cardiff West to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000129">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Under our proposal, the list would be not
prescriptive but inclusive. Such groups should definitely be consulted,
but if it was appropriate to consult the unspecified groups to which
the Minister referred, the amendments would not proscribe that. They
would not prevent schools from consulting others. All we are saying is
that we want to make things absolutely clear in the Bill—not
with a nod and wink in Committee. We want everyone to understand that
parents, students, staff and local democratically elected council
members—they are all the people who anyone reading the coalition
agreement would think should be consulted—will be consulted
during a
conversion.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s position is curious because at times the Minister
says that he does not want to prescribe things, yet I read in <em>The
Daily Telegraph</em> today that pupils are being told to do up their top
button and tie, so he can micro-manage by being as prescriptive as
that. He should, however, encourage his Parliamentary Private Secretary
to practice such behaviour sometimes, because he can often be seen, in
his louche way, lounging around 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>the precincts of the Palace of Westminster wearing no tie at all. I hope
that the Minister will prescribe the appropriate
dress.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is an odd mixture under the Bill. It is pretty obvious to most people
that we should consult parents, people working and studying in a
school, and the people elected by the local community to represent them
who have specific duties in respect of the school, but the Minister is
not willing to prescribe such people under the Bill, although he will
prescribe that school pupils should do up their top button and tie
despite the fact that he finds it impossible to enforce such behaviour
on his PPS. Our case has not been met by the Government, so I shall
press the amendment to a

consultation that they carry out on their proposals to convert. If
officials or Ministers have real concerns about such consultation,
including if it is thought that a school unreasonably fails to consult
directly affected groups such as staff or parents, they would have the
opportunity to question that before an academy conversion was approved.
Parents are key to the success of an academy after conversion because
they are the people who will decide whether to send their children to
the academy, so it is of course in the interests of an academy to
consult prior to

thereafter apply to become an academy, so why is it necessary for the

enable a federated school to convert to academy status without
requiring the agreement of the whole federated governing body. The

within a federation that wanted to convert to academy status.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000165">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have
already had the opportunity in Committee to discuss the impressive
record of the academies programme, which has proved to be a genuine
revolution in raising standards in schools throughout the country. I am
proud of this Government’s work to extend the programme. As of 1
March, we have received 638 formal applications from schools
wanting to convert, with more applications coming in every week.
However, conversion to academy status is a significant step that should
not be taken lightly. The hon. Member for Cardiff West is therefore
rightly concerned that there should be proper consideration and that
the decision-making process has appropriate rigour. We share that
concern, which is why officials, Ministers and the Secretary of State
will look particularly closely at the consultation that has taken place
on such schools. However, we also wish to ensure that every eligible
school has the opportunity to convert to become an
academy.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
the moment, if one or more, but not all, of the schools in a federation
wished to convert, a majority of all of the federation governors would
need to agree to

			Column number: 906<a class="bkMark" name="Column906">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the conversion. In addition—and before the conversion—the
school would need to go through a statutory process to leave the
federation, and the local authority would have to set the school up
with a new temporary governing body and new instruments of government.
That process is unnecessarily bureaucratic, and it might result in
schools that are willing and able to convert being unable to do so
because of the contrary views of other schools in the federation. The
changes in the Bill and subsequent regulations have the purpose of
remedying that situation and to allow a group of governors representing
a particular school to apply for academy status even if other schools
do not wish to do so. We believe that school leaders recognise that
federations work only with willing partners, and while we want to
enable conversion of single federated schools through the clause,
whatever the circumstances, we also believe that in many cases a
majority of the full federation would be likely to support the
conversion of a single school within
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
circulated a policy statement last Wednesday setting out the detail of
our proposals, but I will summarise them now. We propose to amend
regulations so that the proportion of governors required to make a
decision is proportionate to the number of schools in a federation. The
group of governors would need to comprise at least three members, and
it would also need to include at least half the governors who represent
the school that wishes to leave the federation. By that we mean parent
governors elected to represent the particular school, foundation
governors appointed for that school, staff governors working at that
school and the school’s head teacher, when he is a governor.
That means that for a federation of two schools, at least half the
federated governing body would be required to approve the application
to convert, while for a federation of three schools, at least a third
would be required and so on. Prescribing a minimum without taking into
account the number of schools in a federation does not seem
appropriate, which is why the Government have proposed this
proportionate approach. It would not be the first time that an
exception to the usual majority decision-making approach has been made
in legislation. The School Organisation (Removal of Foundation,
Reduction in Number of Foundation Governors and Ability of Foundation
to Pay Debts) (England) Regulations 2007 enable a decision to remove a
school’s foundation in certain specified circumstances to be
made, in effect, by a minority of the governing
body.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000168">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman asked in particular about TUPE. The clause does not change
the legal position on rights of staff. The rights of staff, when
transferring from the employment of a maintained school to an academy
trust, are protected by TUPE regulations. That holds true whether or
not a transfer scheme is put in place. A property transfer scheme may
be necessary where the relevant bodies cannot reach agreement. The
things that we expect to be transferred to the new academy trust may
include classroom furniture, maintenance contracts and staff contracts.
In making such a scheme, a Secretary of State would make a fair and
reasonable assessment of the property rights and liabilities that
should transfer to the academy trust and those that should remain with
the local authority or governing body. That is the purpose of the
clause and section 8 of the 2010 Act. I hope that I have been able to
reassure the hon. Gentleman and members of the Committee on that point,
particularly regarding TUPE rights. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
feel able to withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000184">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I welcome what the Minister has said about TUPE,
which, in a sense, just threw into further relief the bizarre comments
of Lord Hill in his letter to head teachers on 15 December. I referred
to it earlier. He said that any agreement by head teachers to respect
pay and conditions of new staff in academies would
be<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“a
significant factor in the assessment the Secretary of State will make

Academy.”<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
other words, head teachers have to respect TUPE in relation to existing
staff. If they want to employ new staff, however, and have an agreement
to employ new staff on the same basis as existing staff—because
they think that would be good for staff relations, in the interest of
the school and an all-round positive thing for the school when it
converts to an academy—and if they come to that agreement with
their staff’s representative associations, the Secretary of
State would be minded to regard that as a negative factor in
considering whether a school should apply for academy status. That
sentence in Lord Hill’s letter clashes in a discordant way with
the Minister’s point that TUPE, employment continuity and
provision in law apply to staff who are transferring into a new
academy. The amendment was probing. Having got that off my chest, I beg

Secretary of State has indicated that he favours the expansion of
grammar schools—at least, that is how I interpret his remarks.

procedures. That particularly applies in relation to the issue that we
discussed earlier about the decision on whether selection is right for
a local area and has the support of the local community. If a community
has decided that that is not a pattern with which it is happy, schools
from neighbouring areas might offer provision on a selective basis in
that area. I

extension to its age range. The actual effect of it would be to prevent
the Secretary of State assessing the impact on other local educational
institutions of any academy or free school proposals that envisage new
provision within an existing selective school—for example,
proposals for new all-age provision that incorporated an existing
grammar school. I am sure we all agree that we do not want to restrict
the circumstances in which an assessment must be made of the impact of
new provision on other educational

                        <p class="tabbed">Under
current legislation, which was introduced by the previous Government,
grammar schools can expand in a number of ways. They, and other
maintained schools, are free to determine their published admission
number annually or publish statutory proposals to expand the school,
either by extending age range or by expanding the overall size of
existing year groups. In relation to statutory proposals, the
presumption for approval by local decision makers that applies to
successful and popular schools does not apply, as the hon. Gentleman
will remember, to grammar school enlargement proposals. That does not
mean that such proposals would not be carefully considered or be
successful.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s general principle is that academies should not be
prevented from taking any action that might be possible within the
maintained sector, such as proposals to expand or increase their
numbers—whether they are maintained comprehensives or maintained
grammar schools. We believe that all good schools should be able to
expand where there is demand. Nevertheless, as with the maintained
sector, we do not believe that there should be new provision for
selection by ability, and we do not intend to change that. All good and
popular schools should be able to expand, but that does not extend to
selective schools extending selection into the primary age
range.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000200">&#160;</a>

grammar schools cannot legally extend downwards to primary-age pupils,

do not wish, however, to prescribe in law the content of an impact
assessment for a school. When we begin to make specific reference to
individual considerations, questions are asked about why other
considerations are not also specified, and whether those considerations
are to be ignored. It is hard to encompass all characteristics that may
need to be considered in specific local circumstances, and it is
unnecessary to do so. Instead of taking that approach, we expect to
take into account all the relevant factors, but they might differ

clause amends part 5A of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998,
which deals with the employment of teachers at independent schools that
have a religious character. In the maintained sector, there is a clear
distinction in staffing provisions between different categories of
schools with a religious designation. Voluntary controlled and
foundation schools with a religious character have a minority of church
representatives at governor level, so they cannot have in excess of one
fifth of staff as reserved
teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000226">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Reserved
teachers are specifically appointed and selected on the basis of their
ability to give religious education in accordance with the tenets of
the religion or religious denomination of the school. In contrast, a
voluntary aided school with a religious character may have a majority
of church representatives at governor level and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 914<a class="bkMark" name="Column914">&#160;</a>
                           </div>may apply faith criteria in the appointment of any teacher at the
school. A central principle of the academies programme is that schools
will convert as is. In particular, academy status should not be used as
a back-door method to gain extra power or to extend a school’s
provision, nor indeed to reduce it. Clause 58 embodies that principle.
Legislation covering all independent schools with a religious
character, including academies, currently states that preference on the
basis of religion may be applied to all staff. The clause ensures that
in the case of converting voluntary controlled or foundation schools
with a religious character, the limit of a fifth of reserved teachers
will be retained in the converted academies, which simply provides
parity with the position in the maintained
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000227">&#160;</a>

the hon. Member for Cardiff West will be aware from debates during the
passage of Bill that became the Academies Act 2010, our preference is
to regulate academies through their funding agreements, but it is
necessary to legislate in this case because that ensures that new staff
employed at, and people applying for posts at, these academies will
have the same access to statutory protections, in particular to legal
redress such as employment tribunals, as their peers in maintained
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000228">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Gentleman is aware, we have received a number of
representations from the National Secular Society raising concerns
about the clause, and particularly about proposed new section 124AA(2)
of the 1998 Act. I responded to Mr Porteous Wood personally to address
his concerns and I hope that that letter and the policy statement,
which have been circulated to the Committee, reassure the National
Secular Society, the hon. Gentleman and other Committee members about
the intentions behind that provision, which makes it possible for the
Secretary of State to issue an order disapplying the clause for a
specific
academy.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the maintained sector, it is possible for a school to move from a
voluntary controlled foundation school with religious character that
has minority faith representation to being a voluntary aided school
with majority faith representation. With that change comes the ability
to appoint 100% of teachers on the basis of religion, with protection
for existing non-reserved teachers as set out in regulations. The
change would be available only if a school had set out a proposal for
its plans, if it had consulted and if it could demonstrate sufficient
support for the
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000230">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
our policy statement sets out, the Secretary of State would similarly
issue an order disapplying proposed section 124AA of the 1998 Act only
if an academy had consulted on, and attracted support for, a change
from minority to majority faith representation on its governing body.
Proposed new subsection (2) therefore simply ensures that there is a
level playing field between the processes available in the maintained
and academy sectors. It is important to re-emphasise that any order
disapplying these requirements would contain provisions to protect the
position of existing non-reserved teachers. On the basis of that
assurance, I hope that the Committee will agree to clause
58.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000231">&#160;</a>

might have been sensible at this juncture—following the
Academies Act 2010 and given that the Government are effectively
seeking to make all schools academies in the longer term—to
create that level playing field right across the piece in legislation,
rather than having the situation that we are going to inherit now.
According to the Minister, all new academies will have funding
agreements to put in place the commitments he has set out to the
Committee according to Government policy, but there will be a whole
batch of existing academies with different funding agreements to which
such provisions will not necessarily
apply.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000232">&#160;</a>

schools, whether maintained or academies—and whether new
academies or Labour’s academies, if we like—for the
powers that they have, as well as their responsibilities around
staffing and employment law. Rather than putting in place the untidy
mess with which we will be left as a result of these uneven provisions,
we could have taken the opportunity to use the Bill to put everyone on

                        <p class="tabbed">Areas
such as the East Riding of Yorkshire received no
money—absolutely nothing—under the wasteful, bureaucratic
and outrageously unfair Building Schools for the Future programme. East
Riding, along with Cornwall, has the greatest backlog of maintenance
and building need. The cost of addressing the deficits and inadequacies
of school accommodation and facilities in the East Riding of Yorkshire
has been conservatively estimated at £491 million. Between
2008-09 and 2010-11, the council had on average less than £21
million a year for capital expenditure on schools. The sum available
for 2011-12 is £10 million. We therefore have £10 million
available for capital this year, thanks to the financial wasteland left
behind by the previous Administration, versus £491 million of
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
concern arises because excellent local authorities such as East Riding
have worked creatively and innovatively to use capital receipts and to
help put nurseries and junior schools together to form primary schools.
They basically found ways of using every possible receipt they could to
deliver higher quality services. Despite their best efforts, however,
they are still seriously behind. Wilberfoss primary school brought in
£364,000 and Bridlington lower school brought in £2.4
million. In each case, those moneys were repurposed and reused to
provide better and more appropriate facilities for local
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000240">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
a time when local authority funding is under significant pressure, we
should ensure that schools have the flexibility to use surplus assets
to improve what, in many cases, is not an acceptable situation. Will
the Minister assure us that such points have been considered and that
they will be factored into the implementation
policy?<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000241">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend
the Chair of the Education Committee, who made some strong, general
points. I have two precise questions about the transfer of land for the
establishment of academies, which relate to local authorities and
decision rights in federations of schools if one of those schools will
have its land and buildings transferred to create an academy. In such
circumstances, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for
that to take place? If a request to the Secretary of State is made
solely by a local authority without the support of the federation, is
that necessary and sufficient to enable a transfer of land and
buildings to take place? Alternatively, are there circumstances in
which the transfer may happen at the request of a federation without
the support of the local authority? On my reading of the Bill, both
those circumstances would be sufficient to enable the Secretary of
State to facilitate a transfer of land and buildings, so I would
appreciate it if the Minister would answer my questions, either in this
debate or at some other
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000242">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister is well aware of my great concerns
about the clause and what it might mean for a number of schools across
the country. In particular, I am worried about what it might mean for
schools that had been part of Building Schools for the Future. I have
no desire to start a debate with the hon. Member for Beverley and
Holderness about whether BSF was a good programme, but I think we can
all acknowledge that there is a need for investment in the schools
infrastructure in the UK, particularly in Wales, and that many schools
have great capital needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000243">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
ways in which BSF was resolving those needs was by moving to new sites.
I can think of several schools in my constituency—Willowfield
school, the Holy Family school, William Morris school and Lammas
school—which acquired land to redevelop and are in various
stages of that process. In particular, Willowfield was cruelly stopped
just as it was about to start the process of building on the new land.
For many of us looking at the clause, that is where we have
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000244">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I tabled some
questions to the Government to try to understand their thinking on
school closures and the disposal of surplus land. The hon. Member for
Beverley and Holderness has set out how schools and local authorities
have been using land and capital to try to invest in new school
provision. The Minister, in response to my question about how much land
the clause will apply to, said that the Government did not hold a
record of that, and that decisions on school closures and the disposal
of surplus land will normally be taken by local authorities. Those of
us who are becoming increasingly aware of the kind of language used by
the Minister will be supremely worried by the concept of
“normally”, which opens the door for many decisions that
are not normal.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000245">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
creates some worrying principles. I hope that the Minister will address
some of those concerns today, so that not just MPs, but local
authorities, which are deeply concerned about the future of the school
maintenance and building projects in England and Wales, will have some
clarity, particularly on paragraph 1(2)(c) of schedule 13, which sets
out the proviso that if the Secretary of State thinks that a piece of
land

                        <p>it
may also be included. I also hope that the Minister will remember the
evidence that we heard from Councillor Pugh during the evidence
sessions, when we talked briefly about the clause and the concerns that
local authorities have about it. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000247">&#160;</a>

where schools become academies, those school sites then transfer out of
local authority control…there is a balance to be struck. If

needs to be the opportunity for the local authority to have a
discussion with Government about how that is best used, so that we are
not losing sites that are of particular value for educational purposes,

what discussions has he had with local authorities about the clause?
Secondly, will he confirm that the disposal of land and assets will
remain the right of local authorities and schools, and that there will
be no interference by the Secretary of State in those decisions?
Thirdly, will the Minister explain how he expects the Secretary of
State to divine when a piece of land is no longer about to be so used,
as set out in schedule 13? Fourthly, who does the Minister imagine will
benefit from such transfer powers, and will he say more about why he
thinks those powers are needed? Fifthly, schedule 13 3(3) talks

                        <p class="tabbed">Sixthly,
what assessment has the Department made of the need for such land by
schools to meet the existing needs of maintained schools? I am thinking
particularly of the schools in my local authority area that were part
of BSF, but which now have no clarity about whether they will have the
land. They were also part of providing additional places. I am sure
that the Minister is aware of the severe pressure on school places in
the London area, and that many of the BSF projects in London were
precisely about meeting that need and making sure that we could provide
schooling for all our children. The idea that land may be taken from
those projects for unspecified purposes is worrying for several
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Seventhly,
in what circumstances does the hon. Gentleman envisage the Secretary of
State not consenting to local authorities disposing of land? Turning
that question the other way round, I notice on page 94, line
45 of the Bill that the Secretary of State also has the ability to
prevent local authorities from doing exactly what the hon. Member for
Beverley and Holderness has said that many do to manage the needs
within their school provision. How does the Minister expect
disagreement between local authorities and the Secretary of State on
the disposal of land to be resolved, especially if the professionals in
the school support such a
disposal?<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
eighth question is whether the Minister would rule out requiring local
authorities that wish to dispose of land from making schools become
academies as a way of reclaiming the assets that will be generated
through the disposal of that land. Ninthly, what is the purpose behind
the powers on page 95, line 25 of the Bill in respect of being able to
reverse the purchase of land? Can he give some examples of where those
powers could be enacted and say how such action could
occur?<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will be pleased to know that I am on my last question about
the purpose of page 95, line 43 and the requirement for local
authorities to help the Secretary of State with compulsory purchase
applications. Will he clarify when those powers will be used? Given
that local authorities have stretched budgets, who would underwrite the
legal fees that such action could incur? I hope that he accepts, from
the questions that I have outlined, our genuine worry about being able
to meet the ongoing maintenance needs and the demand for school places,
especially in London. I fear that the clause could make such problems
worse, not
better.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
can see a situation in which much needed land for maintained schools
could be given to free schools for their renovations, and that could
raise all sorts of questions about whether or not the provision is
appropriate in meeting the need for school places. Furthermore, the
threat that the Secretary of State might decide that land and building
are surplus to schools could create huge problems for schools trying to
manage their estates in the future, especially if we cannot understand
how he will divine whether the land is no longer needed. Above all, the
clause will make it hard for schools to plan for future provision. In
communities such as mine where there are fluctuations in the number of
pupils, the ability to plan for how land is used is something that is
done well with the local authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000255">&#160;</a>

the Minister will take the chance of our debate on the clause to allay
the fears that I have set out and confirm the important role that local
authorities have to play in managing school assets. How will such
measures support the schools that were trying to meeting a need through
BSF? I understand that we do not yet have the details of the capital
investment in schools that the Government now recognise has to be made,
but I hope that he can understand our worries that the funds that might
be generated by the transfer of land could inadvertently be put towards
purposes other than education and supporting existing schools and their
needs for maintenance. I hope that he will respond to my wide-ranging
questions. If he needs further clarification of my points of reference,
I shall be more than happy to provide
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000256">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Lady.
I wish her a happy birthday. It is good to see that, on such an august
occasion, she is taking her responsibilities to the House so seriously
and scrutinising proposed legislation in such detail. I am sure that
the Minister will feel ready for a specialist subject section of
“Mastermind”, and we will be looking to see whether he
gets through it without too many
passes.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Chair of the Education Committee asked crucial questions, and he was
kind enough to refer to the situation in Cornwall. It is certainly my
experience that, in an area similar to his with many small, ageing,
rural primary schools, there is pressure and demand for investment. For
example, on Friday I visited St Tudy school and St Mabyn school now in
a federation under their excellent head, Karen Holmes, at a local
leisure complex at which they were displaying their work. They put up a
fantastic exhibition for parents and the community, and it was great to
see the two schools working effectively in a federation. St Tudy was to
be in receipt of money for a rebuild scheme—not under the BSF
but a different mechanism—but there were problems with planning.
After explorations, the first site identified was judged far too costly
to get to the required standard, so the school looked at another site
and eventually got planning but, by that time, the clock had been
ticking and, unfortunately, the money was lost. The school is therefore
looking keenly for the Government’s proposals for targeting
capital spending at capacity in areas. The two villages have affordable
housing being developed, hopefully expanding the number of younger
families, which might give the opportunity to bid for some of the
capital.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is concern that capital that becomes available for improvements from
sites surplus to requirement elsewhere should be focused on meeting
identified need. The primary school in Camelford, another town in my
constituency, has now moved to the site of the Sir James Smith
secondary school—a school named after a Conservative MP, which I
am sure the Minister is pleased to note. The original primary school
site is now surplus to requirements, and there has been a lengthy
process of discussion in the community and with the council about its
future. It should secure a capital receipt for the local authority, so
it will be able to meet the aspirations of the community in other
regards, including the council’s existing capital
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am delighted that we are starting to make progress with a new medical
centre for Camelford on the site, as well as securing some of the
playing fields as open space. I am not sure how well the Minister knows
the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 920<a class="bkMark" name="Column920">&#160;</a>
                           </div>geography of north Cornwall, but Camelford is a rather hilly little town
and there are not that many flat areas where people can engage in
sporting activity, so the playing fields are
crucial.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
community has therefore been involved with discussing all such issues.
I have my frustrations with how long it has taken the Cornwall council
property function to reach a conclusion in its negotiations with the
primary care trust and so on, and to come forward with a plan for the
site, but there has at least been a process with local involvement.
Hopefully, the plan will secure the capital that the council needs to
meet its commitments but will also secure a site meeting the needs of
the local
community.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000261">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have some concerns about aspirations for free schools, for example,
which might come to fruition in the near future but also might not,
possibly causing other things to be delayed or to be influenced in
unhelpful ways. So I share the concerns voiced by other Committee
members about the provisions. I would hate to see too much power for
the Secretary of State to step in and grab chunks of land which might
well be used for other purposes in the community and which could
provide capital resources to meet the already long list of priorities
in local authority
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000262">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I start by making an important point? The
schedule does not extend the Secretary of State’s powers. It
mostly re-enacts existing provisions, except that ex-academy land is
now
included.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finding
suitable land is a key hurdle for free school proposals so we want to
help overcome that. The schedule is quite long, as a consequence,
because we also thought it preferable, in making the change to include
ex-academy land, to replace the existing schedule 1 of the Academies
Act 2010, rather than introduce a further layer of amendments. Some of
the former provisions of schedule 35 of the School Standards
and Framework Act 1998, which was added by the Education Act 2002, had
already been carried forward into schedule 1, and the remaining
provisions are now being carried forward into the schedule. We will
therefore repeal schedule 35A as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
summary, the schedule re-enacts and amends the existing provisions in
respect of school land, in order to give the Secretary of State
additional powers to ensure that publicly funded land is available for
free schools and to protect land at academies, including free schools,
that has been provided or improved at public
expense.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000265">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is no doubt that the availability of land is the key impediment to new
schools being set up by local groups. We are unapologetic about using
powers to make land available for new schools to meet local needs, when
that land is no longer needed by existing schools. The Bill contains no
powers in respect of wholly private land or land that continues to be
needed by schools, but when a governing body, a trust, or a local
authority is of the view that publicly funded land can be disposed of,
it is reasonable that one of the options considered is that the land be
used for a new free school or an existing academy, as those are the
institutions that will open up new opportunities for young people to be
educated.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000266">&#160;</a>

                           </div>carried forward from schedule 35A to the Education Act 1996, into which
they were inserted by schedule 7 to the Education Act 2002. Schedule 13
to the Bill puts a replacement schedule 1 into the 2010 Act. The
Secretary of State also has the power to direct the transfer of
publicly funded land at foundation and voluntary schools when the
school closes, and the schedule extends that power to situations in
which a school or a local authority thinks that publicly funded land is
no longer needed for the purposes of a foundation or voluntary school.
Before a school or a local authority can dispose of the land, it must
obtain the consent of the Secretary of State, who may instead direct
that the land should continue in educational use for a free school or
an academy. In many cases, there might be no viable proposal for a free
school in the area, but if such a direction were made the Secretary of
State would pay appropriate compensation for any private interest in
the land, just as he would if the transfer were directed on the closure
of the school. The schedule also applies those protections to land at
academies, so that an academy cannot dispose of publicly funded land
without the consent of the Secretary of State, who again may direct the
transfer of the land to another school—an academy or a
maintained
school.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000267">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the specific issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley
and Holderness, the Education Committee Chairman, I can reassure him
that the clause and the schedule relate to the retention of surplus
land for educational purposes, and I hope he approves of that. The
phrase “unspecified purposes” has been used in the
debate, but the power, which already exists and is being extended
slightly to ex-academy land, enables the Secretary of State to use the
land only for educational purposes. The power will be used only when a
school converts or if there is a suitable free school proposal in the
area. All alternative proposals will be considered before a decision is
made, and in many cases it is likely that the land will continue to be
disposed of by local authorities for the purposes that my hon. Friend
suggests, of spending capital on repairs and
refurbishment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000268">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On special schools, often, as in the East Riding
of Yorkshire, provision is never quite where we want it or how we want
it. Plans are made—which are challenging from a capital point of
view—to establish new provision and to restructure existing
provision, using capital receipts for that purpose. Could there be a
conflict if some parents wanted the existing special school to stay
where it was, maintaining what they had and found convenient, even if
it was not convenient for most children in the area? It might then be
impossible to restructure special school provision in that
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000269">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will come back to my hon. Friend on that point.
The basic principle is that where the land that is being proposed to be
disposed of is regarded by the local authority as surplus to its
requirements, albeit that the local authority is buying land elsewhere,
the land that is being disposed of would be subject to these
provisions. However, I just want to clarify my own thinking, to ensure
that I am right about where it is being done as part of an overall
proposal, of swapping one piece of land for another piece of land, and
I will come back to him on that point.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will
address some of the other comments about how the Secretary of State
will divine when land is no longer needed. We are not trying to take
land away from schools. The powers have already existed for 10 years or
more and they only apply where a school is about to close or where the
land has been clearly identified as not being needed for the school. If
a school and local authority do not accept that the land is surplus,
these powers would not be
applicable.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000273">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The
Minister just said that if local authorities disagree that land is no
longer in use they will have the right to veto any powers of the
Secretary of State. Can he clarify why that line is in schedule 13 and

why the proviso

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
come on to some of the other points raised by hon. Members. My hon.
Friend the Member for Bedford asked what the necessary and sufficient
grounds are for land to be transferred to a federated school that
wishes to convert. The federated school would need to apply to the
Secretary of State for an academy order and the local authority would
then need to provide the school’s land on a long lease, or the
land could be transferred if the school was previously a community
school. If the school was a foundation or voluntary school, appropriate
arrangements would need to be made with the relevant
landowner.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000278">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Walthamstow asked a number of questions, many of which do
not relate to the changes that we are making to the Bill. She is, in
fact, questioning existing legislation rather than our amendments to
the Bill. It would be better if I wrote to her to set out the answers
to her questions where they do not relate to issues that are being
changed by the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000279">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
also asked what discussions there had been with local authorities about
the clause and its implications. The clause extends existing law and
makes new provision only in relation to foundation and voluntary

local authorities as part of our regular discussions and we made that
point very clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000280">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
clarify one thing that I said earlier. I said that these powers do not
extend the Secretary of State’s powers. What I meant to say is
that they do not extend the Secretary of State’s powers in
relation to community school land. That is an important point to make.
I think that I also referred to schedule 25, when I should have
referred to schedule 35A. I just want to ensure that the record is
absolutely correct.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000281">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister will not be surprised to know that I
am very concerned that he does not know the answer to a number of my
questions. The particular issue that really troubles many of us is
whether he can rule out the notion that land can only be disposed of
for the purposes of free schools or academies, so that where there
might be a maintained school that would benefit from land, such as the
school described by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness, such a
scenario would not be acceptable any more under the Bill. Perhaps the
Minister can do things the other way round—if he does not know
what the provision is for, can he rule out what it is not
for?<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000283">&#160;</a>

which existed under the Labour Government. I know that she is new to
the House, but her points relate to existing legislation. I have

                        <p class="tabbed">The essential
issue is that such matters will be dealt with case by case. Broadly,
the provisions enable the Secretary of State to prevent a sale of land
for cash where there are alternative provisions—where that land
could be used for educational purposes. The Government are maintaining
and continuing that position with the consolidation of the provisions
in new schedule 1 to the Academies Act 2010. We are extending the
provisions, however, to include former academies’
land.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000285">&#160;</a>

question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall about
whether land is being tied up unnecessarily, I should say that land
will be transferred to a free school only when the school is ready to
proceed. It will not be held by the Secretary of State to await a
future free school in the area, so we will not be creating a
supermarket land bank that we can tap into when someone wishes to
expand a free school in a certain area.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000286">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment is intended to probe whether there
is anything in the provision that might result in a land grab. For
example, a local authority might acquire land from a former independent
school that has ceased to operate within the past eight years. As part
of its estate strategy, the authority might plan to use that land to
provide homes at a local level.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000295">&#160;</a>

circumstances, could the Secretary of State use the powers in the
clause to claim the land for use as an academy, for example? What
matters would be considered if the local authority had specifically
acquired the land from an independent school as part of its strategy to
provide necessary housing for people in the area? Would it be an
extreme measure to take at the centre to prevent a local authority from
pursuing its democratically accountable objectives, on which it might
well have fought an
election?<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000296">&#160;</a>

since the Leaning and Skills Act 2000 to make a scheme to transfer
local authority land to an academy if it has been used for a community
school in the previous eight years, but is no longer so used, or is
about to become so. Since then, there has been an increase in the
different sorts of schools and therefore in the powers that need to be
updated.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000297">&#160;</a>

                           </div>funded land in a similar way, which is why the Bill makes a change yet
again, and refers simply to “schools”. That means that
local authority land that has been used by an academy will be treated
in the same way as land that has been used by maintained
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000298">&#160;</a>

State’s power in relation to land. He would be unable to make a

object to its disposal or appropriation for the authority’s
non-educational functions. It is reasonable that local authority land
that has been used for a school, but is no longer being used for that
purpose, should be available for a new free school if suitable
proposals come forward. The option of its remaining in educational use
should be fully considered before it is disposed of or otherwise

that had been previously used as a school. If it had been used as a
private school, the interpretation could be the other way. From what he
said, I am taking it that he is telling us emphatically that if a local
authority purchased a former private school site, it would not be
covered by the provision, and it could go

                           </strong> The land provisions are complicated. The final
paragraphs of schedule 13, in particular, apply to some specific and
unusual situations. The amendment, as drafted, would prevent the
Secretary of State from making a direction before independent
arbitration in only one rare situation, in which land is held on trust
by both the governing body and other trustees.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000312">&#160;</a>

replicates existing provisions applying to school closure that were
first enacted in this form by the previous Government in the School
Standards and Framework Act 1998. Those provisions did not include a
requirement for independent arbitration, nor did the more general
provisions concerning the transfer of local authority land to academies
that have existed in various forms since the Learning and Skills Act
2000.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000313">&#160;</a>

independent arbitration is needed before the Secretary of State
determines the transfer of publicly funded land is an important
principle. It is true that in some cases, when schools convert to
academy status, it is necessary to do some work to determine ownership
of the land. I appreciate the concerns and the intention to provide an
additional mechanism for ensuring that decisions on land ownership are
fair to all parties concerned, but we believe that it is unnecessary to
add a requirement for independent arbitration before the Secretary of
State can make a direction. In the vast majority of cases in which the
governing body of a maintained school that wishes to convert to an
academy holds land, it is clear to whom and under what conditions that
land should transfer on conversion.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000314">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I beg to move amendment 232, in
clause 60, page 49, line 15, after
‘Academy’,
insert—<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000327">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would ensure that local authorities, as the admission
authorities for community and voluntary controlled schools, and the
governing bodies of schools that are not admission authorities, can
object to the school adjudicator regarding an academy’s proposal
to change its admission
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000328">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have heard a lot in recent days about the need for the
Minister’s Parliamentary Private Secretary to do up his top
button and wear his tie while on duty, but we have also heard a lot
from the Government about the squeezed middle. Clearly, admission
arrangements in the Bill will affect the squeezed middle quite a lot.
The implications for parents of what the Bill does on admissions are
quite significant.<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000329">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Objections
are limited to schools in the “relevant” area, which is
roughly the area in which the parent would send his or her child to
school. By virtue of new section 88H(6)(a)(i), maintained schools and
local authorities have a right to object, because they are referred to
in new section 88F(3). Parents’ right to object to the
adjudicator in respect of an academy are dealt with elsewhere, and a
parent is not an appropriate person for these purposes. It is said that
putting academies in the same framework as other schools on admissions
is a good thing, although the objection rights of local authorities and
schools are not guaranteed in primary legislation. Why is that not the
case?<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000330">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Which bodies
will be prescribed in regulations under new section 88H? If local
authorities are not allowed to object, there will be a loss of informed
objectors. Elsewhere, the Government want to perform a leadership role
for parents and pupils, particularly vulnerable children, so that
schools are not tempted to change their admission arrangements to make
it harder for such children to gain entry. What progress has been made
on the draft code of practice? There was a further leak in <em>The
Guardian</em> last Tuesday. Fran Abrams wrote:<a class="bkMark" name="11040560000331">&#160;</a>
