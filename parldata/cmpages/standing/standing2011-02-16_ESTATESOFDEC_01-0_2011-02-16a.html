their help and support on Second

clause introduces a deemed predecease rule in certain limited
circumstances, as do clauses 2 and 3. Overall, under clause 1 a person
who killed a deceased person, under clause 2 a person who disclaims an
inheritance, and under clause 3 a person who dies a single parent under
the age of 18, will all be deemed to have died immediately before the
deceased for inheritance purposes. The aim of the Bill is to make the
law fairer by removing technicalities that run contrary to the general
policy rules on succession. It will stop people being unfairly
disinherited in certain limited circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11021660000011">&#160;</a>

congratulate the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire on introducing
the Bill and on the success that he has enjoyed thus far and, I hope,
continues to enjoy. On the face of it, the Bill is a dry measure, but
it is important. It was noted on Second Reading that some 200 cases to
which the measure is relevant arise each year; from now on, the
legislation will apply to those cases, with positive effect, we
hope.<a class="bkMark" name="11021660000014">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am surprised and, I have to say, slightly disappointed that the right
hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) was not appointed
to the Committee. I always enjoy his input. On Second Reading he
highlighted the Law Commission recommendation on trust provisions and
its concern that a killer, for example, could benefit

                           </strong> I, too, congratulate my right hon. Friend the
Member for East Yorkshire on choosing the Bill and getting it
successfully to this stage of proceedings. I announced on Second
Reading that the Government support the measure because it will make
the law fairer. That is important in any situation,
but perhaps it is especially so in the tragic circumstances of unlawful
killing or early death, in which some provisions will
operate.<a class="bkMark" name="11021660000019">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South mentioned the trust issue that the
right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed raised on Second Reading. I
wrote to the right hon. Gentleman, and, without spending too long on a
complicated matter, I can tell the Committee that when the Ministry of
Justice consulted on the proposals in December 2009 as part of the
consultation on and pre-legislative scrutiny of the Civil Law Reform
Bill, several criticisms were made of the special trust provisions. A
small number of consultees doubted whether they were necessary, and
pointed out that the protection they conferred was limited.<a class="bkMark" name="11021660000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Ministry
of Justice re-examined the proposals with the Law Commission and agreed
that they should be removed. The law already provides protection for
minors’ inheritances. In reaching those conclusions, we have
worked closely with the Law Commission, which is content with the Bill,
and taken careful account of expert practitioners’
views.<a class="bkMark" name="11021660000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill will implement the Law Commission’s recommendations in its
2005 report, “The Forfeiture Rule and the Law of
Succession”, subject to modifications arising out of the
consideration of the results of the pre-legislative scrutiny. I am
grateful to the Law Commission for its work on the
subject.<a class="bkMark" name="11021660000022">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South
for his constructive comments. After the Second Reading debate, I asked
the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed whether he wished to be a
member of the Committee and, indeed, to place his ideas before it by
way of an amendment. However, he indicated that he was broadly content
to leave matters as they were following the Second Reading debate. If
the Bill proceeds today, it is open to him to table an amendment on
Report if he still feels troubled.<a class="bkMark" name="11021660000023">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I underline
the Minister’s comments that the special trust provisions are
unnecessary. They would also be expensive to operate. The
Minister’s view, which I share, is that existing law already
gives the court power to intervene and supervise
the administration of an estate when dealing with a minor.<a class="bkMark" name="11021660000024">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I believe
that the current provisions are wide enough to deal with the sort of
problem that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed mentioned,
and that the Bill is a better measure without the additional
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11021660000025">&#160;</a>
