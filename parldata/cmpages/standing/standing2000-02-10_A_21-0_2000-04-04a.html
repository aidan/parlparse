</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): On a point of order, Mrs Roe. At the latest possible time last Friday, the Government tabled  56 amendments. Without notification, members of the public, Opposition Members and members of the Committee could not have known about such action and the first that they would have seen of the amendments would have been yesterday. As a result, members of the Committee would not have had the opportunity to table amendments to the Government amendments.

<P>
The Government have rewritten six out of 10 subsections of clause 58 and, given that the remaining subsections (7) to (10) are significantly shorter than the amendments, it means that the majority of the clause has been rewritten. The Government have also rewritten clause 79 and have made major inroads into clause 81. I know that tabling amendments on Fridays falls within the rules, Mrs Roe, but do you believe that such action is the optimal way in which to scrutinise the Bill? Will you seek a ruling from Madam Speaker on the matter? We are facing a new development in parliamentary scrutiny whereby the Government table many amendments in Committee, giving very little notice. The convention has been that there are two weekends between Bills being discussed on Second Reading and in Committee, thereby enabling people outside and inside the House to study them before they are debated in Committee.

<P>
The Government have tabled 328 amendments, vast chunks of which have been tabled at the last possible moment, giving little, if any, time for members of the Committee to scrutinise them and people outside the House to make observations. Can you obtain a ruling from Madam Speaker on how Committees can deal with vast swathes of Government amendments that rewrite major sections of Bills?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. The point that he raised is not a matter for Madam Speaker nor is it appropriate for me and my co-Chairman to comment on it. I remind him that the Government tabled the amendments within the deadline. However, I am sure that the Minister has listened to the hon. Gentleman, whose comments will be on the record, which I am sure will be useful for others when they table amendments in the future.

<H4><center>Clause 57</center></H4>
<H4><center>Help for disadvantaged groups of electricity customers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 734, in page 57, line 35, leave out ``persons who supply electricity'' and insert ``authorised suppliers''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may consider Government amendments Nos. 735 to 739.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The amendments are minor and technical. They are designed to make it clear that references to suppliers, distributors and transmitters are to those authorised by a licence or exemption. The second part of amendment No. 736 relates to licence modification in the event of a scheme being introduced. It deletes a reference back to section 6 of the Electricity Act 1989, which is considered unnecessary. Amendment No. 739 has a more substantive purpose. It is intended that any order under clause 57 should make it clear whether a cross-subsidy scheme is confined to domestic customers or whether the costs of cross-subsidising the disadvantaged group should be borne additionally by commercial and industrial customers. That would be subject to consultation before the making of an order. As it is difficult to predict the timing, extent or form of the cross-subsidy scheme, it is sensible to afford the widest discretion, and that will be achieved by the amendments.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendments made: No. 735, in page 57, line 41, leave out from ``by'' to ``provision'' in line 45 and insert

<P>

</UL></FONT>

<P>
This morning we will deal with several amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) and myself. They would help the Government to achieve what they intend in clauses 57 and 78, which is to give enhanced consumer and environmental protection and to help us to achieve the Kyoto targets.

<P>
The amendment relates to consumer protection, and would prevent tariff and pricing follies from besetting the industry as they have in the past. During my days in local government, it was the schools' advantage to leave lights on and burn their power up to qualify for a lower, discounted tariff and get into a cheaper tariff band. The amendment would ensure that tariff proposals cannot be designed in that way and that no group of consumers will pay a greater charge for receiving a lesser amount of electricity. It is a straightforward attempt to close a marketing loophole that is counterproductive to the Government's aims and imposes a burden on consumers and the environment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As I understand it, the amendment would limit the impact of the cross-subsidy on certain groups of consumers. It would also restrict the flexibility that we have introduced into the clause. We have allowed for maximum scope to develop a cross-subsidy scheme that would effectively exercise the powers in the Bill should that, contrary to our expectations, be necessary.

<P>
The amendment implies that those customers whose charges would be adjusted to subsidise the disadvantaged group should not pay more if they receive less electricity. However, as drafted, it is open to several interpretations. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) may be proposing that customers on lower user tariffs should be exempt from contributing-that is a reasonable proposal, with which many would sympathise-but the impact on different groups of consumers is a matter to be determined at the relevant time and as part of the consultation process in developing a workable scheme. It would not be helpful to prescribe the ingredients of a scheme, which, as the clause stands, may be drawn up in response to developments.

<P>
The introduction of such mandatory conditions might make it impossible to devise an effective scheme; that cannot be what the hon. Gentleman intends. It is especially important to monitor developments in the existing measures to assist the fuel poor, and in the forward movement of market and price structures. Over time, the wider picture and the realistic options available to help the fuel poor could change substantially. In that light, I urge him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Listening carefully to the Minister's reply, I think that I saw a chink of light in it; the matter should perhaps be discussed elsewhere. I accept his point that, because of its wording, the amendment may not achieve what it is designed to achieve.

<P>
Presumably the regulatory system would want to avoid there being an advantage to consumers in overusing the product in order to qualify for a lower tariff. The amendment is designed to limit that excess. If it helps the Minister, I am happy to explain that more clearly than perhaps the amendment does. We may want to return to the matter on another occasion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 755, in page 58, line 18, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) The Secretary of State shall, after consultation with the Authority, Council, Competition Commission and licence holders, publish a statement of policy with respect to the definition of ``members of a disadvantaged group'' and which shall, in particular, clarify the extent to which a scheme may permit cross subsidy from one group of consumers to another'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 754, in clause 78, page 85, line 13, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) The Secretary of State shall, after consultation with the Authority, Council, Competition Commission and licence holders, publish a statement of policy with respect to the definition of ``members of a disadvantaged group'' and which shall, in particular, clarify the extent to which a scheme may permit cross subsidy from one group of consumers to another.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendments concern the definition of the phrase ``a disadvantaged group'', which clause 57 for electricity and clause 78 for gas seek to assist. They give the Secretary of State the power to stop one group of customers being treated less favourably than another. The explanatory notes say that the clauses permit
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Secretary of State, by order, to make schemes which have the effect of providing a cross-subsidy in favour of disadvantaged customers in relation to the charges they pay for their electricty or gas.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
These probing amendments are designed to elicit from the Government a definition of customers who are treated less favourably. The Gas Act 1986, the Electricity Act 1989 and the Competition Act 1998 require the avoidance of undue preference or undue discrimination. Under those Acts, there must be objective reasons for differing treatments, unlike the subjective criteria in the clause. Therefore, the appropriate criteria for defining disadvantaged groups must be clarified. Again, any licence amendments must be subject to due process and to reference to the Competition Commission if no agreement has been reached. Can the Minister spell out how the provisions are consistent with the Competition Act requirement not to cross-subsidise? Will he also describe the circumstances in which an order might apply under clauses 57 and 58?

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for tabling the amendment, because it allows important questions to be asked. It is absolutely true that it is difficult to define a clearly identifiable category of consumers. Some fuel poverty campaigners have suggested that the Bill should say exactly whom the power is intended to help, but we are leaving that flexible for now.

<P>
We will need to define the target group quite closely. Obvious examples could be prepayment meter customers and frequent cash payers. However, those categories do not necessarily correlate closely with fuel poverty. The hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) pointed out that prepayment meters are ideal for second home owners. Many old people, who could certainly be defined as fuel poor, always pay by cash, including my old mum, who refuses to pay by direct debit or to have a prepayment meter because she likes to know how much she pays every month or quarter. I think that that is what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) is getting at: it is very difficult to define disadvantaged groups, and that is why we have left the definition open.

<P>
Changes in housing or market conditions in the near future might mean that an eventual target group is different from those that are currently the obvious ones. We recognise that there will need to be extensive discussion with the authority and others likely to be affected, before a scheme is drawn up. For example, it will be important to monitor the evidence from fuel poverty initiatives to assess whether the cross-subsidy power should be exercised, which is very much a reserve power.

<P>
There is no need to make the provision suggested by the hon. Gentleman. We want to consult as widely as possible.

<P>
<B>Mrs Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): Will my hon. Friend confirm that the interministerial team that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe co-chairs with Lord Whitty will play an important role? It was set up with the issue in mind. Tomorrow, we will debate the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill for the first time. That also seeks to grapple with the complex issue of identifying the fuel poor and the policies needed to deal with their problems.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Yes, that committee will make an important contribution. I know that my right hon. Friend has gathered together a committee of various talents, among which hers shines like a beacon.

<P>
We are not persuaded that a policy statement, as prescribed in the amendment, would contain anything more of significance than we would expect to produce in explaining the reasons for, and the effect of, any proposed order. Therefore, we cannot support the amendment, and I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for that response, which was full and frank on my first comments. Could the Minister comment on the conflict with the Competition Act? My understanding is that the measure goes against the requirement not to cross-subsidise between sets of customers.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I can make a definitive statement about that. We certainly could not introduce a scheme that would conflict with the rules in the Competition Act. The Government would not contemplate that. I am glad to supply that answer to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, because that answers my question. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The amendments are all designed to strengthen the hand of the Secretary of State and ensure that consumers receive the protection that he believes they should. Amendments Nos. 568 to 570 hang together as a group, as do amendments Nos. 571 to 574.

<P>
The intention of the first group is to impose a duty on the Secretary of State to proceed. The amendments would specify more exactly what the powers should be and what should be done. That would ensure that disadvantaged and financially vulnerable customers get the protection that is currently permissive rather than mandatory, because it is important to ensure that they are not discriminated against. A scheme is needed to ensure that they can afford fuel, which is essential to their well-being. Our concern is that the clause does not require the Secretary of State to proceed. It would be appropriate to stiffen the wording.

<P>
In the second group, amendment No. 571 would ensure that there was a proper timetable, and amendment No. 572 would require the impact of changes and potential changes to be assessed. There would have to be a response without the Secretary of State stepping in. Amendment No. 574 is in a slightly different form, because it is designed to ensure that the necessary information is passed to the council so that it is available for inspection and comment. The consumer impact assessments are important, but would be of little value if they were not disclosed and available for examination and comment. As the Minister knows, concerns have been expressed elsewhere-and will probably be expressed again-about the flows of information between the authority, providers and suppliers and the council.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's flow but I am finding it difficult to understand the wording of amendment No. 568. It refers to ``access to essential suppliers''. Should that be ``essential supplies''? In its current form, it does not seem to make sense. I am sorry if I misread it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman, but not a lot. I suspect that he has detected a typographical error, which had eluded me. I apologise to the Committee. Perhaps the intent of the amendment can be considered, and, at the appropriate moment, I shall seek to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Is it supposed to be ``supplies'' or ``suppliers''?

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> It should of course be ``supplies'', and I apologise to the Committee for the defective typography. I hope that the arguments are sound, whatever the defects of the typist.

<P>
First, a future Secretary of State, who does not necessarily share the intentions of the current Secretary of State, should have a duty imposed on him to proceed and introduce required schemes. Secondly, that should be done in a timely and appropriate way. Thirdly, when consumer impact assessments are carried out, they should be reported to the council so that they are open to inspection and review. The amendments provide a way of protecting the consumer, and ensuring a watertight regime that achieves the results that the Secretary of State wants. Typography permitting, I hope that the Minister will regard the amendments as worthy of consideration.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The eagle-eyed hon. Member for South Dorset stole my thunder with regard to ``supplies'' and ``suppliers''.

<P>
When we discussed clause 57, it was acknowledged that it would be extremely difficult to define a target group that would benefit from the cross-subsidy to adjust charges. A cross-subsidy scheme to ensure affordable access to gas supply would be even more difficult to implement. It would be especially difficult to define the target group and devise a scheme to ensure that it had access to the system. Indeed, ``access'' could be interpreted in several ways-access to supply at low prices or access to a connection, which may or may not be economic or practicable in the circumstances. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove did not mean access to anyone who demands it. There will be consumers in his constituency, as there are in mine, for whom the cost of laying a gas pipeline would be extraordinarily prohibitive. In terms of the wording of the amendment, that is an important consideration.

<P>
We are working with the market to reduce prices through competition. The way forward is for utilities to develop a range of tariff and payment options appropriate to the circumstances of the fuel poor, and to support them through energy efficiency packages. I know that the hon. Gentleman shares our strong desire for such initiatives to be pursued vigorously, and to deliver results for the fuel poor. We have made it clear that we hope never to have to use this reserve power. Such a scheme would be complex and difficult to administer, and the amendments would create additional complexity.

<P>
On amendment No. 569, I understand the hon. Gentleman's intentions . Fuel poverty is an important issue. However, the amendment would give the Secretary of State no option but to make an order introducing a cross-subsidy scheme if he considered that a particular group of disadvantaged customers was being treated less favourably than other customers in the charges that they paid for gas. I repeat that the power under the clause is intended purely as a reserve power. The amendment would require the Secretary of State to act immediately, once satisfied that there was a class of disadvantaged consumers, without regard to the success or otherwise of many other measures to address the serious problem of fuel poverty. No Secretary of State should be under a duty to introduce a scheme of the kind described in the amendment, regardless of market developments. Market innovation offers the best chance of helping such vulnerable customers.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 571 and 573 would remove the Secretary of State's discretion to determine the timing and frequency of the authority's reports to him on the effect of orders made to introduce a cross-subsidy scheme. The frequency would be fixed at once a year. It is important to retain the flexibility that the clause provides. In some circumstances, the Secretary of State might consider more frequent reports to be necessary, perhaps because of perceived problems in a particular year.

<P>
I understand the motivation behind amendment
No. 572, which is to ensure that the impact on consumers is properly reflected in the authority's reporting to the Secretary of State on the effect of a cross-subsidy scheme. We fully agree that the authority would need to consider that impact, and the principle objective would be to require it to do so. My problem with the amendment is that it is superfluous and over-prescriptive in the context of the clause-what the hon. Gentleman seeks to achieve is already achieved. It is difficult to envisage how the authority could fulfil the requirement to monitor the effect of orders made under clause 78 without focusing precisely on the impact on different consumers affected by the cross-subsidy. The effectiveness and value of monitoring would be seriously diminished without such information.

<P>
Amendment No. 574 would require the authority to pass to the council information that it may have requested from gas suppliers and transporters to help to fulfil its duty to monitor the effect of a cross-subsidy scheme. Such a provision is unnecessary. Under clause 22, the council may require the authority to supply it with information that it requires in the exercise of its functions. If the council wanted infomation provided by the companies in the course of the authority's monitoring of the implementation of the cross-subsidy-because it was relevant to the council's job of promoting the consumer interest-it would be entitled to ask the authority for it anyway.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Is not that a crucial point in relation to the authority's powers and the role of the council? Concern has been expressed that there will be occasions when that information will not be transparent of transmitted. Will the Minister accept that the intention behind the amendment is to ensure, at least in relation to this request, that such flows of information take place? Can he provide assurances on that?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I can certainly try to reassure the hon. Gentleman I have recently spent a large part of my life trying to construct a consumer council that would be effective in that crucial area. I thereforee find it difficult to believe that the flow of information will not be free, open and transparent. I fear that over-prescriptive amendments might allow the authority to restrict the flow of information to a frequency of, for example, once a year. In fact, the flow should be much more open and organic. I hope that, in the light of my coments, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Over the weekend, most members of the Committee will have received a letter dated 31 March from the gas consumers council, in which it challenges how it will receive information and whether it could publish it. It is difficult to mention such matters when we have already dealt with the appropriate clauses, but the Minister has just described the information that will be released. Has he received a copy of the letter? Given that the gas consumers council said that it wants amendments to be tabled to the Bill on Report and that it is supposedly the group from which the Government are taking advice, can he throw any light on what it has asked for and say whether such information will be forthcoming?

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The gas consumers council is a fine body. It is independent and is entitled to say what it wants. Whether it was asleep when we were dealing with the relevant clauses, I have no idea, but if it wants to draft amendments, that is entirely up to the council. I am sure that the hon. Member for South Dorset will be an appropriate vehicle for any gas amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister for his postscript, as I do for dealing in some depth with the amendments. If we put too much detail into the amendments, they are described as over-prescriptive and if we generalise them and widen the powers, it is said that they are not prescriptive enough. There always seems to be a good reason, even if it is sometimes contradictory, for not accepting amendments tabled by Opposition Members.

<P>
I took a little comfort from what the Minister said about the intention of the Secretary of State. Perhaps the Bill is intended to last only for the duration of the Government. However, Labour Members might believe that they will still be in power in 100 years' time.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Like the Third Reich.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I hope that the Minister's comment will be recorded in Hansard.

<P>
We should not simply base a Bill on the supposed or actual good will of the current office holder in a Department of State. If we want enduring protection for consumers, we must ensure that the Bill is an appropriate and suitable vehicle. I noted the Minister's comments on amendment No. 571, which focuses on the requirement for an annual report. It was certainly an interesting interpretation and one that we can pursue. Perhaps the Secretary of State has in mind making quarterly reports to match each round of bills and the amendment would restrict his ability to do so. Who knows? That struck me as a little fanciful. The clear and obvious intention of the amendment is to ensure that the Secretary of State does not leave such matters for five years and that they are revisited. The Government must so direct their attention, even if they decide at one particular time not to change the schemes and arrangements, and the authority agrees with them.

<P>
The gas consumers council and the Consumers Association have been in touch with members of the Committee, drawing attention to the fact that the way in which information can flow is at the behest of the authority rather than as of right to the newly established council. Our intention was to ensure that the new authority would have to transfer the information as a matter of law, rather than one of business practice and procedure.

<P>
That could be important when some information is thought to be commercially sensitive. If the scheme involved cross-subsidy, as it probably would do, that might be the case. I was disappointed to hear what the Minister said, although encouraged to hear that at least he and the Secretary of State believe that it would be usual and appropriate for that information to be transmitted. I hope that his words on the record will stand someone in good stead in future because, given the Bill as drafted, I fear that that is all that can be relied on. I shall not take up any more of the Committee's time. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 740, in page 85, line 11, leave out ``under this Act''.

<P>
The amendment mirrors the provision made under Government amendment No. 736 relating to licence modification in the event of a scheme being introduced. It deletes a term that is not generally used in the Gas Act 1986.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 741, in page 86, line 4, at end insert-
<P>

<P>
The amendment is the gas equivalent of Government amendment No. 739 to clause 57. The extent of a cross-subsidy would be one of the key issues in the consultation process before the making of an order. The clauses should be flexible on that point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> When reading some of the clauses and those subsections that exclude bits of another clause that refer to a different Act and so on, I am reminded that we shall later debate new clause 4, which is designed to rewrite the Electricity and Gas Acts because of the substantial amendments that have been made to them over the years. Will the Minister smile on such a new clause? As we discuss the convolutions of the Bill and the amendments that have been made to the Acts, those who will have to understand the rights of consumers and electricity companies will require a consolidated Act of Parliament to help them to do so.

<P>
The Minister is putting more complexities into the Bill, so will he look kindly at new clause 4 when we reach it?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman raised a good point about the need for clarity and ease of interpretation, but I must say that the Bill is the most organic one with which I have been involved.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As this clause and clause 79, which is its gas equivalent, are important elements of the Government's environmental strategy, I will explain in general terms how they will work, taking account of the amendments tabled by the Government and our plans for the use of the powers contained in them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Why were the amendments tabled on Friday?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Because that was when they were ready for tabling.

<P>
Clause 58 replaces section 41 of the Electricity Act 1989, which provides for the regulator to set standards of performance in connection with the efficient use of electricity by consumers. They are known as energy efficiency standards of performance, or EESOPs for short. I shall use that term many times. I do not know whether the hon. Member for South Dorset had anything to do with that acronym.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> The Minister is obviously attempting to use me as the straight man for a joke about fables. I take the opportunity to say that we should be renaming the Bill. Instead of being a utility Bill, it is a futility Bill. Clearly, Aesop's fables have a lot to do with that.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Excellent light relief.

<P>
Clause 79 makes the same substitution as clause 58, for the equivalent gas provision: section 33BB of the Gas Act 1986. The two clauses have virtually identical effects, and everything that I will say about clause 58 applies to clause 79.

<P>
The clause allows the Secretary of State, rather than the authority, to impose obligations on licensed electricity suppliers or distributors, or both, by order subject to affirmative resolution. Those obligations require them to meet targets for the promotion of improvements in the efficient use of electricity, gas conveyed through pipes-which means gas covered by the Gas Act-or any other energy source specified in an order.

<P>
The shift of power from the regulator to the Secretary of State is in keeping with the Government's commitment that social or environmental measures with significant financial implications for consumers or for the regulated companies should be backed by new and specific legal provision.

<P>
An order may provide that activities relating to combined heat and power, which includes cold produced in association with the generation of electricity, may count towards meeting the obligation.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions plans to lay a draft order before Parliament at the end of next year. That order will take effect immediately after the EESOPs set by the regulator for gas and electricity suppliers expire in March 2002.

<P>
The Government are consulting on the possible use of the proposed powers. On 9 March, we published a consultation document entitled ``Energy Efficiency Standards of Performance 2002–2005'', at the same time as the draft climate change programme was published. Copies of the document have been made available to the Committee. It proposes an obligation on gas and electricity suppliers-but not on electricity distributors or gas transporters-that would equate to an estimated nominal cost per customer of £3.60 per utility. That would be three times the level for 2000 to 2002 introduced by the regulator.

<P>
Let me explain why I use the words ``estimated nominal cost''. An obligation will set a target for each licensee to carry out activities that achieve a specified total amount of improved energy efficiency. Such activities might include installing loft insulation, providing energy-efficient light bulbs or filling cavity walls. In a publication recently, I noticed photographs of members of all parties, including me, witnessing cavity walls being filled.

<P>
An order may provide that activities relating to combined heat and power, which includes cold produced in association with the generation of electricity, are encompassed within the range that may count towards fulfilling an obligation. However, it will be for the licensees to decide which activities to carry out, and how to undertake them. They will be under a firm obligation to carry out sufficient activities to meet targets, and that will provide an incentive to meet them as cost-effectively as possible. It is impossible to specify what precise effect the measures will have on consumers' bills, but the Government will take into account the likely costs when deciding on the level of obligations. The consultation document proposes that they be set at a level equivalent to a cost of about £3.60 per consumer for each fuel bill.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
An order will specify the total amount of improved energy efficiency to be achieved, which could be denominated in either kilowatt hours or carbon emissions saved. The Government intend to denominate the energy efficiency obligations in kilowatt hours.

<P>
The clause contains much important flexibility. An order may specify an obligation in relation to a specific technology, which could encourage the development of innovative new technologies. Although we do not envisage the need to set such specific obligations, the Bill would give us the scope to do so if necessary. An order may provide that particular activities must be carried out to fulfil all or part of an obligation. For instance, it may require that some or all activities must relate to the fuel poor.

<P>
An order may also provide for overachievement or underachievement in meeting an obligation in a given period, to be reflected in the size of a licensee's obligation in a subsequent period. It may provide for obligations trading between licensees. They will be able to contract out the actual operation of the activities needed to meet their obligations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am struggling with the amended wording. It is difficult to work out why the Government have changed it, and what it actually means. I thought that the Minister would explain that to us, but he has not.

<P>
In the original wording, the description of the electricity distributors covered by the clause reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>electricity distributors or electricity distributors of any description.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That in itself seems tautologous. One assumes that by changing that description to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on each electricity distributor (or each electricity distributor of a specified description)<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Government are attempting to deal with that tautology.

<P>
Where in the Bill do we get the specified description? Who will do the specifying? I would have thought that if one wanted to specify a description, one could do so without such strange wording.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The ``specified description'' would be in the order. As the hon. Member for South Dorset knows, because he is very much an energy buff-

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> An energetic old buff.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Technology can change quickly, and so can definitions. Part of the purpose of the Bill has been to distinguish between suppliers and distributors; that should give us enough leeway to cope with any changes. That is my interpretation, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept it.

<P>
The purpose of amendments Nos. 759 and 768 is to make it clear that an order will impose duties on licensees to meet specific requirements. Instead of giving the Secretary of State the power to require licensees
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to meet  targets for the promotion of energy efficiency,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the amendment allows the Secretary of State to impose an obligation to meet targets
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the promotion of improvements in energy efficiency.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will not greatly assist the Committee to get into a discussion about the semantics of the two versions. It is more important that we are now clear that the clauses allow the Government to impose measurable obligations on licensees to implement programmes of activities aimed at improving energy efficiency.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I want to speak to a significant number of amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes and myself, which are all very much aimed at the same point. Clause 58 is central to the Bill and is of real significance to the industry-which will be subjected to a new regime-to consumers and to the environment. We welcome the broad intentions of the clause, which we welcomed in its first form; we are slightly less clear about whether we welcome the clause in its second form, because we have not had a chance to get to grips with all the implications. Of course, our amendments relate to the original wording, and it is therefore a matter of conjecture in some cases as to how they might best be imported into the current Government proposals.

<P>
Amendment No. 668 is important because it would ensure not only the promotion of various wonderful things, but their implementation in the scheme that is brought into play. I refer hon. Members to the original wording of the clause:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may by order require<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
various people
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to meet, within a specified period, targets for the promotion of energy efficiency.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the amendment were accepted, the words ``targets for the promotion'' would be removed, and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>obligations for the promotion and implementation<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would be inserted.

<P>
The difference between a target and an obligation is central to many of the subsequent amendments in the group. It is interesting to note that the Bill previously referred to a renewables obligation, in capital letters. Clearly, it is something defined and inescapable-an obligation placed on the system and suppliers. However, clause 58 refers throughout to targets. We strongly believe that the use of the word ``targets'', rather than ``obligations'', is a mistake in a clause that is central to what the Government say that they want to achieve. In addition, talking about the ``promotion of energy efficiency'' without attaching a reference to the implementation of energy efficiency represents an omission, with which the amendment is designed to deal.

<P>
Amendment No. 577 would insert a reference to the ``improvement'' of energy efficiency, so that the clause did not refer only to the promotion and implementation of energy efficiency.

<P>
Amendment No. 578 would introduce specific targets linked directly to the United Kingdom's obligations and the Government's intentions and aspirations. The obligation could include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>targets for reducing CO2 by 12.5 per cent. by 2010 and energy efficiency by 20 per cent.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, we must ensure that the Bill specifies what the Government want to achieve.

<P>
During the previous debate, my suggestion was criticised for being over-prescriptive, but if the clause is left full of targets and aspirations, it will not achieve the Government's aims. The clause must include obligations and clearly defined destination points. Various organisations have told us-and, no doubt, the Government-that the clause should help the industry, consumers and the environment. We endorse many of those comments, and the amendments that we have tabled, including those by which we would substitute the word ``obligations'' with ``targets'', represent a serious attempt to achieve that aim.

<P>
We believe that the broad direction of the clause is right, but we hope that the Government will acknowledge the fact that it should be more firmly and strongly drafted, so that it contains not simply targets and aspirations but substantial obligations. If they believe that a renewable obligation is the right formulation elsewhere in the Bill, why should it not apply to energy efficiency?

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The current provisions that require the electricity industry to promote energy efficiency are contained in section 41 of the Electricity Act 1989. Those provisions resulted in an additional cost to consumers of about £1 or £1.20 a year, depending on their electricity bills, but they have been enormously successful in promoting energy efficiency projects. The consultation document to which the Minister referred states that, based on the illustrative set of possible measures described elsewhere in the document, the Government estimate that the likely cost to customers would be:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for gas prices, an additional 0.02p per kWh, an increase from 1.69p to 1.71p;<P>
</UL></FONT>
or 90p per quarter on each fuel, for an average bill and including VAT, averaged over the years of EESOP 4.
<P>
That is equivalent to £3.60 a year-the figure that the Minister has mentioned-but it is three times the current cost to customers. That represents a 300 per cent. increase in the levy. Will he confirm that that will be the likely outcome of the measure?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have already confirmed that, and I assume that the hon. Gentleman heard me. We take the problems of environmental pollution seriously, which is why we are tackling them in Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister also confirm that the increase will be no more that 300 per cent.?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I can certainly confirm that we have calculated that that will be the average change under the energy efficiency standards of performance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> An increase of 300 per cent. is extraordinarily high. In effect, it is a form of taxation on customers. It is yet another of the many stealth taxes that the Government have imposed.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we as a society should take such matters very seriously, that the real terms increase is not huge when spread over a year and that, if it produces results, it will be of benefit to this and future generations?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I fully support the measures in clause 58; they build on those in the original legislation that privatised the electricity industry, which has been enormously successful. However, we object to the level of the tax that is being imposed on the customers. If the Government want to implement an energy efficiency programme at such a level, they should use the taxation system and Government spending in the usual way. Using customers' electricity and gas bills to implement an environmental programme is wrong. It is a highly regressive method, under which the more fuel is consumed by customers, the more stealth tax they will have to pay.

<P>
Such a measure discriminates against large families, a group that finds making ends meet the most difficult of all groups in society. It discriminates against the elderly, who tend to consume more fuel because, first, they do not go out to work and their houses need to be heated all day and, secondly, they need better heating in their homes because of the effects of old age. Such taxation is extremely regressive. It is our principal objection to the Bill.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> If, as a result of this small increase-200 per cent., not 300 per cent.-we can promote the more efficient use of energy, does it not follow that families in the future will pay less in outgoings on energy, because they will be using less energy because it will be used more efficiently? The hon. Gentleman has missed the point of the clause, which is to try to reduce all energy bills by increasing efficiency, as a result of which we shall improve the environment considerably.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Government have said that such meausres will be targeted at certain people in society, not the whole of society. That is the first point on which he is wrong. Secondly, that argument can be applied to every element of the Government's spending and taxation policies. Yes, building new community centres or village halls will benefit an entire village-any public expenditure will benefit the whole of society; that is its purpose-but we object to public expenditure being funded through electricity and gas bills. They were not devised to be progressive and fair, and to extract more money from those who are better able to afford to contribute to the communal pot. The clause is capricious in how it intends to raise money from the public.

<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that sometimes one has to invest to save? The Audit Commission verifies that previous EESOPs schemes have delivered significant savings. It is estimated that EESOPs 4 will save about £12 a year on current levels of investment and the levels that my hon. Friend the Minister is talking about will give rise to much more significant savings per year than will be raised through the orders.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have no objection to the sum of £1.20 being levied on bills that existed under the previous regime. What is objectionable about the Bill is the huge increase in the level of payments from £1.20 to £3.60.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Huge?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The sum of £2.40 may not be huge to the Minister, but we are talking about one project under two clauses in one Bill in one year of the Government. Sums add up. If we divide any public spending programme that the Government want to implement, it will result in a small figure. It is the accumulative effect of such measures that we find objectionable. I object to how the money is to be levied. Today, it is £3.60; it could be £5 next year and £10 the year after that. That is the wrong way to raise funds from the public sector. It should be done through the tax system, through votes in Parliament and not by stealth through people's electricity and gas bills.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the energy saving estimate whereby the annual savings to low-income consumers by 2010 will be £40 to £60? Does he not feel that that is a whorthwhile investment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I keep making the same point. I have no objection to social programmes that assist particular sectors. We support he Department of Social Security system to help those who fall through the net and to assist those on low incomes. Moreover, many of the current measures were implemented by the previous Government. We object to paying for such worthwhile social and environmental projects through people's electricity and gas bills. That is regressive and capricious. It is not done through carefully crafted tax provisions, which are designed to be fair.

<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if he had the opportunity to invest £1 in order to save £10 on his gas or electricity bill, he would seize it? That is exactly the kind of return that the current EESOPs provide on average bills. An amount of £1.20 provides an average return of £12 per year.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> But that conceals all kinds of differences. If it is in an individual's interest to take such advantage, he will do so anyway. Encouragement through advertising or information could be funded by the £1.20 increase. It is the £3.60 increase to which Opposition Members object.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend is using the figure of £3.60 per customer. He should be wary of the speedy delivery of the Minister, who clearly said that that figure was ``per customer, per utility''. That is already £7.20 per customer, assuming no further additions. As he rightly points out, that is merely the Minister's initial estimate. Nothing in the Bill willstop the figure reaching £360 per customer, per year.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point, for which I am grateful. The consultation document states that the addition will be on each fuel. Therefore, people who have a gas and electricity supply into their homes will pay £7.20 on average. For large families, the figure will be significantly higher. Why should a family with four or five children, in which the couple are on an average income of £20,000 a year, pay £7.20, £8 or £9, because of high fuel usage, to fund the Government's social or environmental programme? Why cannot the Government fund the programme through the Treasury tax and spend system, as all other programmes are funded? That goes to the root of our objections to the Bill. It uses the mechanisms of the industry regulators, and of people's electricity and gas bills, to implement the Government's social and environmental programme, not only in terms of energy efficiency but in a range of measures. The £7.20 increase is only the first of many measures in the Bill that will lead to higher costs being imposed on consumers.

<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that it is Conservative party policy to pay for such a programme through taxation? If so, is it a new Conservative spending pledge?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It has always been Conservative policy to have honesty in politics, taxation and spending. We believe strongly that the Government's social programmes should be considered by the House and funded through the taxation system. No Conservative Government devised such a method for raising large sums to fund public spending. It is wrong in principle, and will be unpopular in practice.

<P>
Such an approach is wrong, discriminatory and regressive. In view of the way in which they were tabled, I shall urge the Committee to vote against all the Government amendments to the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I rise on a point of principle. It concerns the way in which the clause uses electricity distributors as the mechanism to encourage efficient use of electricity and gas. I criticsed the previous Government for introducing the principle that the distributor, which makes all its money out of selling a particular product, is given the decision-making and tax-raising powers to determine how people should reduce their use of gas an electricity. That principle is nonsense.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for instructing the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that that was a Tory policy. The previous Government invented EESOPs and, until a moment ago, I thought that they defended the system.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The great thing that the Minister is learning is that we in the Conservative party listen. Having lost the general election because of making various mistakes, we have listened to people and thought fundamentally about our policies. I am willing to acknowledge, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, that the principles used were wrong. I understand why this and previous Governments used them: they represent a neat way of collecting some tax. The Tory party found a way of collecting £1 from each consumer, and most consumers and, I suspect, most members of the Committee, did not know that it was being collected. It is the Committee's duty to tell people that those who use an average amount of gas and electricity will pay £7.20 on their bills up front. What are the Government trying to achieve? They are rightly trying to encourage people to use electricity and gas more efficiently, and we should be discussing the mechanisms that should be used to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Is the hon. Gentleman saying that such costs should be raised through the tax system? If so, how much extra tax would the Conservative party charge to pay for the scheme, or would they not have such a scheme?

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am always grateful to my hon. Friend-I use the word in its non-political sense-for setting up what I am about to say. I do not believe that it is right to tax customers for the efficient use of energy. Cost-free methods should be used to achieve the Government's aims. For example, the building regulations should be used to ensure that those who carry out alterations to their homes and those who build new houses are forced to insulate them. I would support any measure that the Chancellor introduced to reduce the cost of insulation materials. It is daft that VAT is charged on insulation materials; it goes in the opposite direction to the way in which the Government want to go. Chancellors have struggled with that problem, and I understand that improvements will be made.

<P>
Extremely good measures have been introduced to provide consumers with information on the energy efficiency of appliances. If taxes are increased, they should be increased on inefficient appliances. This is not a tax raising matter, but if enough tax were levied on inefficient appliances, no one would buy them. Appliances should be inspected to determine whether they meet the required standards. If a green levy were put on inefficient appliances, no one would want to pay the tax and companies would stop manufacturing such appliances. That would be better than the Government saying, ``We know best. We will save you money by taxing you.''

<P>
Another logical point that has not been mentioned is that the green lobby's rhetoric that people could save £40 a year through energy efficiency suggests how we should proceed. We should tell consumers that they can save money and that one should invest to save. They are good at getting through the bumf and rubbish that they receive from those who are lobbying for inefficient ways of being efficient. They ask themselves whether they can afford insulation or whether they really want double glazing. If we allow the consumer to decide whether such measures are cost-effective, that will be a good way in which to proceed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I will in a moment, because I know what the hon. Gentleman is about to say. Those consumers who can afford to use such a mechanism up front should do so. He probably wants to jump in and say, ``But the fuel poor cannot afford to get their homes to that level.'' In such situations, the right route forward is for them to be able to borrow money at a zero rate and to pay it back out of the savings that they make. That will ensure that people do not borrow money for items that are cosmetic and will not produce savings. Instead, people will look for the savings.

<P>
The Government are trying to take away the responsibility from the consumers, who will be the only people who can achieve the energy efficiency targets. We should work with the grain. Instead, the Government are saying to the consumer, ``You have a lovely Government. We have to take £7.20 away from you for ever more'' because the poachers-those who want to sell the electricity-will decide how the money is best spent, rather than the consumers or a separate body, because the Government will not tax through the usual taxation system and provide funding for what they regard as a social need.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for attempting to answer my intervention before I had made it. How will the 3,000 residents of Stockport who are in short-term rented accommodation and those 5,000 residents who are in protected tenancies, often in 19th-century terraced property, find the wherewithal to raise the money? More to the point, why is it their job to do so when the property is owned by landlords whose investment will neither worsen nor improve if they make such an investment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman misses an important point. I am glad that he referred to landlords, because the only group of people who must have their gas and electricity inspected annually to ensure that it is running efficiently are tenants of private landlords. I am not sure whether that applies to tenants of landlords in the public sector, but a certificate must be provided by all landlords-a measure that was introduced by the previous Government-to ensure that energy efficiency measures are employed in the burning of the fuel. Gas boilers must be inspected and maintained to ensure that carbon monoxide is not leaking.

<P>
Private landlords would also be caught by the regulations. People who intend to rent out properties often have to convert them first and building regulations would catch them. The provision of energy efficient appliances will be caught also. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove argues that the current tenants who will pay the starting rate of £7.20 a year will pay it to the electricity company. The private landlord will not see any of that money and will have no incentive to improve the efficiency of the equipment. I do not understand this point.

<P>
Given that the amendment refers to specified distributors, perhaps the £7.20 that will be collected from the poor tenants should go directly to the landlord, who, in turn, will have to spend £7.20 a year to improve efficiency and insulation generally for his tenants. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, without meaning to, we have a defective mechanism as far as those tenants are concerned.

<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> I want to clarify that the hon. Gentleman is talking about the requirement to have appliances checked for safety purposes. To my knowledge that has only a marginal impact on fuel efficiency. Would he therefore support a programme, as part of the measures that we are discussing, which would take an energy audit of properties? The programme could, through a defined SAP-standard assessment procedure-rating, enable landlords to bring affordable warmth to their tenants. There is a huge difference, as he well knows, between properties in which tenants must pay 5 per cent. of their income on fuel and those in which they must pay 20 per cent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I was only too delighted to give way to the hon. Lady, and not just because she has a delightful new hair style, which unfortunately will not be visible in Hansard. However, it is strange that when she wants to make a speech about a scheme that she favours, she has to intervene on me to avoid having her legs broken by her Whip. I think that in response to her intervention I should sit down and allow her to make a speech about what she feels would be an excellent way of improving the situation.

<P>
Speaking as a private landlord, however, I disagree with the hon. Lady. In order for me to get my certificate, a man must come round to inspect and maintain my boiler. He cannot give a safety certificate before he has checked that the boiler is working efficiently. The system was brought in because carbon monoxide was poisoning people, but it has actually had a positive effect on efficiency. It provides the only linkage with the private landlord, who has to do things to improve the efficiency of electricity or gas sytems within the remit of the Bill.

<P>
I hope that now that the hon. Lady has had a think about it, she will stand up and make a speech asking the Minister to give a commitment. She is shaking her head, although the Minister is turning round, smiling, and saying, ``Please speak, there's no problem.'' We have the whole of this week and part of next week to get the Bill out, so she should speak-there is absolutely no problem at all. The clause is very important, and Conservative Members are hesitant about allowing it to go through. Labour Back Benchers and the Liberal Democrats seem keen to improve on the clause, so I will sit down to give the hon. Lady plenty of time to speak.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I will deal quickly with some of the comments made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. The issue is in many ways the defining one between us.

<P>
When I read about the details of the existing regime I saw great strengths in it. I thought that EESOPs were a good way of dealing with the question-the hon. Gentleman is wrong to criticise his colleagues in the previous Government for their vision. It was a progressive means of increasing energy efficiency. The Electricity Association has welcomed the proposals for the new obligation, as have individual companies such as Eastern and PowerGen. PowerGen said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The new EESoP scheme will give companies like PowerGen the  flexibility to deliver emissions savings in an innovative way across the whole country. We welcome the principles of the Government's approach and the opportunity to deliver further benefits to our customers. We look forward to examining the Government's proposals in more detail.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No doubt there will be many comments of that sort. That is what the consultation document is for, and the DETR has offered to hold detailed discussion meetings with the industry.

<P>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove tabled real amendments to the clause. He argued that the word ``obligations'' should replace ``targets''. The problem is that there would then be obligations to meet obligations, which does not make sense. I do not think that he has considered that. The provision would become meaningless. There is an obligation to meet a target. A target is measurable; an obligation is not. Therefore, he must reconsider the drafting of the amendment. However, I know where he is coming from and I will try to deal with some of the issues that he raised.

<P>
In my rather lengthy introduction to this group of amendments, I hope that I dealt with the issues raised by amendments Nos. 668 to 680 and 687 to 699, which I will ask the hon. Gentleman not to press to a vote. I want to make it clear to him that we have given full and careful consideration to the amendments that he has tabled. We sought to reflect them as far as we could in amendments Nos. 759 and 768, without undermining the underlying structure of the clauses, to try to accommodate the concerns that he has expressed. I ask the Committee to support the Government amendments and I suggest that we have gone a long way towards taking on board the purpose of his amendments.

<P>
Amendment No. 576 would require a licensee to meet his obligation within one year. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that the scheme being developed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions will impose an obligation over three years. That is a suitable period to enable companies to develop and deliver effective and innovative programmes of promoting improvements in energy efficiency. In addition, it will allow time for the energy efficiency industry to gear itself up to meet the higher demand created by the new obligations, and it will demonstrate the Government's long-term commitment to energy efficiency measures.

<P>
We have considered amendment No. 577 carefully and have sought to take it into account. Again, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that Government amendments Nos. 759 and 768, which refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the promotion of improvements in energy<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
consitute a satisfactory reflection of his concerns.

<P>
Amendment No. 578 is designed to write targets for the use of the powers into the legislation. As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe argued earlier, it is not right to set obligations in stone. The powers set the framework for the obligation; they should not prescribe it. The Government are consulting on the obligation, and it would not be right to set the obligations without listening to the views of the industry, consumers and other interested groups.

<P>
Amendment No. 247 is a variation on the preceding amendment. It would require the Secretary of State to have regard to national CO2 emissions targets in setting an obligation. The Government have already made plain their intention to have regard to greenhouse gas emissions in setting obligations. That is why we published the consultation on the use of the powers at the same time as the climate change programme consultation. Adding that duty would achieve nothing, except to create a potential conflict with the existing environmental duty in clauses 12 and 8, dealing with electricity and gas repectively. Those clauses place the environmental obligation in the right framework for the legislation, whose primary focus is the economic regulation of gas and electricity.

<P>
In the light of my rather lengthy explanation, I ask the Committee to support the Government amendments. I hope that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove has been persuaded not to press his amendments to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The Minister seeks to persuade me that the Government amendments deal with some of the points at the heart of our concerns. Although we accept that his draftspeople had difficulties in meeting Friday's deadline, he must recognise that we now have considerable difficulties with interpretation, and he might forgive me for being sceptical, but I recognise that we are broadly attempting to achieve the same outcomes.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Let me remind the hon. Gentleman that amendment No. 759 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In this section ``energy efficiency target'' means a target for the promotion of improvements in energy efficiency.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is pretty clear and straightforward.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I certainly accept that there have been wording improvements, and I appreciate the fact that the Minister has drawn them so carefully to my attention.

<P>
Out underlying argument is for strong and effective regulation. I dissociate myself from the remarks made by the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for South Dorset, because I think that we have a useful mechanism. The hon. Member for South Dorset put his finger on it: there is a clear difference between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat approaches to the issue.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
I will not press my amendments to a vote, although I retain considerable doubts about whether the clause is sufficiently strong. I look forward to future debates and to dealing with the issue more completely at a later stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Opposition object not to the measures relating to energy efficiency, but to those placing a hefty increase on gas and electricity bills for consumers. That is a regressive method of raising taxation, and it will become increasingly unpopular as people realise how much extra they are paying on their electricity bills.

<P>
The Bill was designed to assist the consumer. That was how it was promoted on publication. The reality, however, is that the consumer will have to pay a hefty price for its provisions. It is the Opposition's job to bring that fact to the public's notice in the months leading up to the general election.

<P>
We will vote against the amendment and all other Government amendments to clauses 58 and 79 because of the way in which they were tabled, and not the principle behind them. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove made the same point. He and his colleagues have not been able to scrutinise the amendments in such detail as they would have liked, because they saw them only on Monday. Nobody outside the House has had the opportunity to examine the amendments, or to make their concerns known to Committee members in time to enable them to table amendments to the amendments. That is unacceptable.

<P>
The Government are railroading the measures through the House and showing the contempt for Parliament that we have seen all too often from them. On a point of principle, I urge the Committee to vote against all the Government amendments.

</FONT>Question accordingly agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 753, in page 59, line 35, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) For the purpose of this section the Secretary of State may make a levy on any supplier where the average consumption of that supplier's customers rises by more than a specified amount.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment takes us in a different direction, but it relates to the problem of relying on market forces to deliver energy efficiency measures. Any supplier of an energy product gains its profits from selling more of the product. It may do that either by encouraging existing consumers to consume more energy or by recruiting more consumers to take energy from its source. The amendment would provide a mechanism by which the Secretary of State can use the market to restrict the propensity of market forces to lead to increases in energy consumption. It would allow him to introduce a levy where there was a growth in the average consumer consumption for a particular supplier's customer base.

<P>
Such an idea has been discussed elsewhere and, given the triumph of market forces in the energy sector, one of the issues that we must face is how to provide a market-driven incentive for suppliers of energy to speak to their customers and encourage them to use their products more efficiently. Clearly, that can be done with the levy that we discussed earlier, requiring the customer to pay for the installation of efficiency measures. The hon. Member for South Dorset deployed that argument and, although I disagree with the outcome of what he said, he was right that such a mechanism would not have an impact on the producers and suppliers of electricity or gas. It would be a transaction between the consumer and the Government.

<P>
The levy would put in place a mechanism that hits the supplier and gives a market signal that the way in which to make profits is not by persuading existing customers to use more electricity, but by supplying them, for example, with appliances that will use existing resources more efficiently. The profit for a supply company will come from selling low-energy computers, photocopiers or electrical and electronic appliances, not from encouraging them to couple up more inefficient products.

<P>
The levy would be simple in plan and in concept. I accept that it would take the Bill in a novel direction and that it is a matter for discussion rather than for adoption, but it is important to challenge the Government to look hard at how they can harness market forces to ensure that the market knows that selling more product is not the way in which to make more profit in the energy sector. It is a straightforward approach. It would impose on suppliers that expand the consumption of their existing customers a levy that would reduce the value of taking such action. The amendment would allow them to recruit other customers because it refers to ``the average consumption''.

<P>
Incidentally, as well as having a desirable market effect in the promotion of efficiency, the amendment would have a social effect in that small consumers would be of value to suppliers because the average consumption would be reduced. That might overcome another problem that exists in the current market, which would certainly be much greater in a totally unregulated market. Small consumers are the least attractive to suppliers; they tend to be the poorest people and have the greatest difficulty in paying. Providing a countersignal to that problem via such a levy represents another way forward.

<P>
I urge the Minister to consider some innovative thinking and to tell the Committee how energy supply companies can generate greater profits in future, if not simply by selling more energy in the market. I am happy to have moved the amendment in a spirit of inquiry and open debate, but I understand that the Minister is not likely to accept it at the drop of a hat.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct, and I shall ask him to withdraw the amendment, which is wrong in principle and wholly out of place in the context of the Bill. Under the amendment, the Secretary of State would be allowed to fine companies whose customers use more energy than specified. That would be contrary to any principle of natural justice and might be incompatible with the European convention on human rights. Companies cannot control how much energy their consumers use. That is why the obligations are intended not to achieve energy savings by consumers but to promote energy efficiency. Companies should not suffer financially for behaviour that they cannot control. Moreover, a levy would penalise all the customers of such a supplier, not just those who used excessive amounts of energy, assuming that they did not simply switch supplier.

<P>
A proper enforcement regime already exists for companies that do not fulfil their obligations under the clause. The full range of the authority's enforcement powers will be available, including the power to impose financial penalties. The Committee should note well that those financial penalties can be imposed on companies only for failure to meet their obligations, not for their customers' energy consumption. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> That answer was disappointing but not unexpected. To save the Committee's time, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 760, in page 59, leave out lines 36 to 42 and insert-

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Government amendments Nos. 760 and 769 are necessary to make the obligation work properly. They will allow the flexibility to make provision for new entrants to the market after an obligation has been imposed. Clearly, it would not be right to impose the same obligation, designed to be carried out for three years, on a company that entered the market only two years into the period of the obligation.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 761 and 770 are technical. Although extensive, they will not alter the purpose of the provision and will ensure that it works properly. They will amend the powers to make provisions by order. Paragraphs (c) and (e) deal with the authority's method and role in assessing the extent to which any action taken by a licensee will meet its obligations. Paragraph (d) and subsection (5) deal with the information that the licensee may be required to give the authority to enable it to assess the contribution that the licensee's proposed actions will make to an obligation. Paragraph (f) and subsection (5) deal with the information that a licensee may be required to give the authority for the purpose of verifying the licensee's compliance with its obligation.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 762 and 771 include an important addition. Paragraph (c) introduces a new concept. The rest are technical amendments to ensure that the Bill works properly. Paragraph (c) specifically allows for overachievement by a licensee in meeting obligations in one period to be carried forward to the next. That is the complement of paragraph (e), which allows for carry-forward of underachievement by a licensee in meeting obligations into the next period. In relation to amendments Nos. 761 and 770, paragraph (a) allows for reapportioning of obligations under an order to take account of exit and new entry to the market. Paragraph (b) provides for delegation by a licensee in carrying out the actions through which targets will be met. Clearly, it would not be right if there were a requirement to fit energy-efficient light bulbs, and the licensee could not delegate the task.

<P>
This is certainly a large group of amendments, which I commend to the Committee.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I want to speak to amendments Nos. 681, 730, 729, 682, 685, 684, 575 and 686. Important principles are at stake, which should be examined.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 681 and 685 are designed to ensure that the EESOPs system is calibrated in carbon emissions, which will allow it to be included in a future carbon trading arrangement. Neither the current system nor-as far as we can see-that in the Bill would make that simple or straightforward. The amendments would achieve that, and allow for appropriate progress.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 730 and 684 deal with two aspects of what has come to be called banding. Technology banding relates to the possibility of setting prices of entry at different levels for different technologies. Without such banding there will be one preferred renewable technology, which will receive the benefit of the renewables trading arrangements. More expensive technologies would not therefore receive the necessary development and expansion. To achieve the Government's targets by 2010 and, moreover, beyond 2010, we will need more than one renewable technology. If one looks further ahead-two, three or four decades-we will need substantial contributions from a variety of renewable technologies. Allowing different technologies to enter at different starting levels-to develop the necessary diversity, price reductions and technological and marketing changes-requires technology banding. Amendment No. 730 addresses that point, and I hope that the Minister will move in that direction.

<P>
Amendment No. 684 deals with customer banding. There might be a desire for discrimination in relation to pensioners or other low-income consumers. The amendment makes it clear that a minimum can be set, and must be delivered using a specific technology or technique. If there were not such clarity, the clause might not give the Government sufficient powers to promote new energy efficiency technologies and eliminate fuel poverty.

<P>
Other amendments relate to similar detailed changes, but the underlying drive is to ensure that the trading arrangements fit into a national and international renewable energy trading regime; that we have banding, which allows new technologies to be brought forward in sequence to develop necessary efficiencies and market penetration; and that we have protection for the consumers who are in need and a requirement for their energy to be supplied from renewable sources. The amendments would help to strengthen the clause and we hope that they will find favour with the Minister.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendments Nos. 681 and 685 are designed to allow obligations to be set in terms of emissions saved as well as energy saved. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government share that objective. I am happy to confirm that we have drafted the provision to allow for the flexibility to denominate in emissions savings as well as directly in kilowatt hours savings. While the wording of the clause will be changed slightly by Government amendments Nos. 761 and 770, that will still be the effect. The amendments are not necessary. Nevertheless, I must point out that the Government propose to denominate in kilowatt hours. An important reason for that is that it will allow the more effective targeting of measures at disadvantaged customers who may take more of their savings in comfort rather than reduce their consumption.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 730 and 684 would specify that obligations may be set in relation to specific technologies or groups of customers. I have every sympathy with such proposals, because it is the Government's policy that there should be that flexibility. That is why we have allowed for that under the clause. Again, the amendments are not necessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Does the Minister accept that there is some risk that, under the Bill as drafted, some technologies that should be used and developed over the coming decades will not get a look-in? Will he assure the Committee that it is not the Government's intention to exclude technologies that need further development work before they can be used at the sort of price to which an unbanded structure would lead?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> That is why we have tried to keep the clause as flexible as possible. I am a great optimist and believe that technologies will be developed to increase efficiency. It is a great project, and the last thing that we want would be to exclude such arrangements in the future.

<P>
Amendment Nos. 729 and 575 would remove subsection (6)(c) from clauses 58 and 79 respectively. However, the Government regard both provisions as important elements of flexibility that must be included in the powers under the Bill. I do not agree with the objectives of the amendments because they would rule out the possibility that the authority can allow a proportion of a licensee's obligation to be carried forward from one period of an obligation to the next. The hon. Gentleman said that that might give rise to the concern that the provision was a let-out from the obligation. I assure the Committee that that is not the case. Flexibility is important to make the provisions work properly in practice and to provide a margin of error in meeting an obligation. That is entirely reasonable, because it will not always be possible for a licensee to hit the target spot on.

<P>
Without that margin, the authority would have to consider exercising enforcement powers, which would not be appropriate when the undershoot was small and was neither negligent nor deliberate. The provision ensures that the licensee would not escape an obligation entirely in those circumstances. Licensees could also be forced to aim for levels above their obligations, to be sure of meeting them. The Government's policy is not to set obligations with that expectation in mind. We aim to set obligations at the right level in the first place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> This is a very important point. The Minister is right in saying that our amendment is designed to remove a let-out clause. I would like to hear some substantial reasons why that is not necessary. He referred to possible small overshoots and undershoots, but the clause permits all kinds of overshoot and undershoot and is not restrictive at all. Nothing seems to stop a carry-over into a second or third year. We want some reassurance on those issues.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have tried to give reassurances, but there are fundamental differences in our approaches. We believe that there must be some flexibility, whereas the hon. Gentleman prefers precisely defined targets and time limits. For the provisions to work, we must have flexibility. I fear that we must beg to differ on that.

<P>
Amendments No. 682 and 686 would make provision for green certification. Such provision needs to have a purpose, and there is none here. It is not necessary to allow for trading of obligations under the clauses, because that it already provided for.

<P>
The development of emissions trading, nationally and internationally, may require further enabling legislation. If so, it will be necessary to identify what provision is required. However, it is futile to try to predict now the changes that may be needed in the future, as the amendments would. Again, that raises the issue of flexibility. There must be sufficient flexibility to accommodate any changes that may occur. I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendments to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister. He is right in saying that my hon. Friends and I want legislation that bites. We are concerned that, even during the consultation process and the development of the Government's energy and renewables policy, there has been significant drift. If aims are not tightly specified, they will not be achieved-particularly in the field of energy supply and distribution, in which many other forces are trying to divert action from the environmental and conservation agenda. Nevertheless, we must accept with regret that the Government are the Government, and we are not-at least at the moment-so I will not press the Liberal Democrat amendments to a vote.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 764, 772 and 773.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendments Nos. 763 and 772 will make provision for obligations under clauses 58 and 79 to be enforceable by the authority using its normal enforcement powers, including the power to impose financial penalties. They will put enforcement where it belongs-on the face of the provision, rather than tucked away in a schedule.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 764 and 773 are technical amendments. They will allow the possibility for new entrants to the supply market to be put under a different obligation for their first year in the market from that which will be imposed on established companies. That is in order to avoid raising barriers to market entry.

<P>
<B>Mr.White:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 637 page 61, line 9, after ``premises'', insert ``through pipes''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendment No. 756.

<P>
Amendment No. 26, in page 61, line 12, after ``heat'', insert ``or chilled water.''.

<P>
Amendment No. 638, in page 61, line 14, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) any gas or liquid subjected to a cooling effect produced in association with electricity.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Government amendment No. 774.

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister will be relieved to know that this is the last amendment that I shall move to this Bill. Given that Wales stuffed Ireland on Saturday, I hope that he will be more amenable to these amendments, which I tabled simply because the Bill does not cover chilled water. I understand from discussions with officials from the Department of Trade and Industry that the drafting of the amendments might be defective, but I hope that that is not true of amendment No. 638, which is important because it deals with matters that the Government amendments neglect.

<P>
The Government amendments cover matters similar to those dealt with in amendments Nos. 26 and 637. If my hon. Friend can confirm that Government amendment No. 765 covers the points dealt with in amendment No. 637, I shall withdraw it. I understand from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions that EESOPs 4 will not specify particular technologies. Under clause 58, the Government will have the power to set targets-climate targets, for example-in future.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> This is an historic moment. I shall accept amendment No. 638, and I congratulate my hon. Friend on tabling it. However, I ask him not to press amendments Nos. 637 and 26 to a vote. I ask the Committee to support Government amendments Nos. 765 and 774 instead.

<P>
Government amendment No. 765 and amendment No. 638 will allow orders under clause 58, which amends the Electricity Act 1989, to provide that activities relating to combined heat and power, including any cooling effect as well as the heat produced in association with electricity, shall count towards the fulfilment of a licensee's energy efficiency obligations. Government amendment No. 774 will achieve the same purpose under clause 79, which relates to the Gas Act 1986. It has always been the Government's intention to allow CHP to count towards the obligations and those technical amendments are necessary to achieve that aim.

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Amendment proposed, No. 765, in page 61, line 10, leave out ``combined heat and power stations'' and insert

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 775.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> These amendments are similar to those debated on clauses that deal with renewable sources of energy. They will simply provide that a company cannot be compelled by an energy efficiency order to produce information that is protected from disclosure under the rules of the High Court.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 651, 776 and 777.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> These are essentially technical amendments. Government amendments Nos. 767 and 776 will simply widen the drafting of the consultation provisions to include the term ``other persons'' so that they will be consistent with consultation provisions elsewhere in the Bill. Government amendments Nos. 651 and 777 will make the drafting of the provision for affirmative resolution in clauses 58 and 79 consistent with similar provisions elsewhere in the Bill. For the sake of clarity, it is important that the drafting of such a complicated Bill is as consistent as possible.
