<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I start by welcoming you to the Committee, Mr. Malins. I am sure that we shall find the experience mutually beneficial. I am indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) for creating the concept of clusters of amendments. Those that we are about to discuss fall into three natural clusters. Amendments Nos. 85 to 129 form one cluster, amendment No. 15 forms another and the remaining amendments form the third cluster.

<P>
I shall explain the amendments in reverse order, beginning with our technical proposals that would tidy up the Bill. Clause 1(2) sets out some definitions, as does clause 41, which refers back to clause 1. The amendments would bring the definitions together to avoid different provisions in the Bill conflicting with one another. They would consolidate into one clause the definitions that apply to part I of the Bill. Seven of the 15 definitions under clause 41 refer back to clause 1. They include important definitions of owner and interest and explain the status of the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads. It would be preferable for all those definitions to be in one part of the Bill.

<P>
When we tabled the amendments, we did not realise the importance of the definition of inner London. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) has made it clear that, to him at least, that is one of the central features of the Bill. It may be surprising, but we try to help each other. The definition of inner London under amendment No. 14 coincides with the Minister's definition that he explained to the Committee at our previous sitting. The amendment should knock the matter on the head once and for all, so that we do not have to discuss the definition of inner London again.

<P>
Similarly, local highway authority has the same meaning as set out under the Highways Act 1980 and local or private Act
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>includes an Act that confirms a provisional order.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This cluster of amendments would put the definitions into one part of the Bill. That is important because much of the Bill will depend on definitions and on their future interpretation. I hope the Under-Secretary will consider them sympathetically.

<P>
Amendment No. 15 suggests that ``land'' should not include land covered by water. That is a different matter, but is still clearly about definition. It is on a point of principle about what the Bill seeks to achieve. The access provisions throughout the Bill are concerned with rights of access on foot. Other parts of the Bill make that explicit, such as schedule 2, which prevents bathing and the use of vessels or sailboards in non-tidal water. Those issues and that of rights of navigation are obviously for separate consideration.

<P>
I should be interested to hear what the Under-Secretary has to say about the amendment, as it is by no means theoretical. The access regime to many lakes and reservoirs in mountains and the open country has tremendous practical implications. He will be aware that we have had and will have more arguments about safety considerations, and obvious and specific safety considerations relate to areas covered by water.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Was my hon. Friend concerned when the Minister for the Environment airily dismissed the issue at our previous sitting by saying that it would be absurd not to give people access to streams that go across land? That ignores the question of high-level ponds, lakes and reservoirs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I agree that the Minister dismissed such possible safety problems in a slightly cavalier way. I hope that we shall have a less cavalier response from the Under-Secretary. My hon. Friend makes it clear that we are talking not only about streams, but about significant areas of water that can be dangerous.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 85 and 129 relate to clause 2 and concern a discrete and separate issue, but I can understand why they are included in this group. The definition of an owner is clearly one of the most important practical considerations for anyone attempting to operate the regime that the Bill will introduce. The drafting of the relevant part of clause 2 is slightly bizarre, in that it does not deal with the problem of sharing the powers and rights of ownership between the owner of the land and an agricultural tenant as defined. It simply states that all the ownership rights are invested in the tenant. I am genuinely puzzled as to how the Government have come to that definition. There is an argument for saying that there is an implicit regime of shared ownership between the owner of a piece of land and its current tenant, but it seems bizarre to say that the owner has no ownership rights. The amendments would tidy up the definition and give the owner some of those rights, which seems acceptable. I hope that the Government will accept that, or at least provide an extremely good explanation for the current drafting. The issue is not theoretical, but practical.

<P>
Clearly, the Bill will affect areas of land that ultimately have one beneficial owner and several tenants. Somebody may behave unacceptably on a piece of land, or go on to the land on a day when access is excluded for perfectly good reasons. Somebody may be on the land and doing one of the many unacceptable things that are still mentioned in the Bill. A tenant can only move such a person to the next-door tenancy. The person may still be on the same piece of land. Indeed, he can carry on doing the unacceptable thing until the next tenant comes along and tries to remove him for the rest of that day. I cannot believe that it is intended that people should be allowed to behave in such an evasive fashion when they are abusing the right of access. The anomaly arises because, with an agricultural tenancy, the ``owner'' is defined as the tenant.

<P>
As I said, I am interested to know the rationale behind the current drafting. Apart from the practical effects on people who abuse the right of access, the Bill seems to be a recipe for worsening relations between landlords and agricultural tenants. Again, I cannot believe that the Bill is meant to achieve that, even inadvertently. As the Minister knows, there are many arguments about the principle of the Bill, and whether it will lead to outright confiscation of property rights. Whatever position one holds, that is possibly the worst example. It is a question of principle, although it cannot be discussed with this group of amendments, whether the Bill is trying to achieve that.

<P>
The Bill says that the remaining rights of ownership will be invested in one person, and that that person cannot be the owner of the land. It seems unarguable that that goes further towards naked class warfare than any other aspect of the Bill. If that is the Minister's intention, he will no doubt happily tell the Committee so. If not, two of the amendments would provide a more practical way forward, which would protect the interests of wildlife and the environment from anyone who abuses the right of access, without creating a source of friction between owners and agricultural tenants. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept those amendments and, for the reasons that I have advanced, the other amendments in the group.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Malins. As the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) rightly said, the group of amendments encompasses various issues; it is not a homogenous collection. I hope that the Minister will address the amendments that deal with definitions, because what the hon. Gentleman said about collecting the definitions in one place and thereby improving the Bill's readability made a great deal of sense.

<P>
Amendment No. 15 deals with land covered by water. I am not sure that I agree with what the hon. Gentleman said about that, although I accept that there is a difference between the use of land and the use of water for walking purposes: one needs divine intervention; the other does not. We may need a definition. However, it would worry me if small bodies of water in open land were excluded from the Bill, and that might be a danger if the amendment were accepted in its current form. In the case of rills, tarns and so on, that would be completely inappropriate and contrary to the Bill's intention.

<P>
I am sure that there is a perfectly easy answer to my next question, which is, where land below the water line drops below the 600 metre level, as it often does in mountain formations, does that excude it from the definition of mountain? I assume that the surface of the water is taken to be the contour. Common sense suggests that, but perhaps the Minister could confirm that interpretation.

<P>
Amendment No. 129 relates to ownership. I understand why the Bill identifies the tenant-otherwise the tenant would be in the impossible position of not having the powers that a tenant farmer should have. I also understand the point made by the hon. Member for Ashford. His argument concerns the right of exclusion when somebody becomes a trespasser because of inappropriate activities on the land, and moving that person to land that is another tenancy but is contiguous. We must return to that when we consider the application of those provisions, because the so-called 24-hour exclusion simply does not work.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Neither the current wording of clause 2 nor the amendment provide what we should seek in the clause. Both the tenant farmer and the owner should have some control over the land, but I am not sure whether the same right should be extended to anyone with an interest in the land because it could be construed too widely and lead to altercations between conflicting interests on the same land. That would be profoundly unhelpful to the operation of the Bill. Although I accept the sentiment behind what the hon. Member for Ashford said, some of the details must be considered more fully. However, I will not think that the Minister has got it right in the Bill either, unless he can satisfy me that it will deal adequately with those issues.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> First, I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Malins. I have fond memories of our time together on the Select Committee on Home Affairs, and I do not doubt that I will have similar memories of our time in Committee Room 9. Secondly, I apologise for the absence of my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment, who has been called away to the Council of Ministers, leaving me in charge of the shop.

<P>
The amendments mainly concern definitions, which we carefully considered. As the hon. Member for Ashford said, amendment No. 13 would disapply the definitions of various terms outlined in clause 1. That is unnecessary, although we are grateful for the hon. Gentleman's help. The definitions apply wherever the terms that they define are used in part I. Amendment No. 14 would supply definitions identical to those set out in clause 41, and again it is not necessary to repeat them. They are the most fundamental definitions needed to understand part I. All other definitions are set out either in the clauses in which they are needed, or at the end of part I.

<P>
You were not present on Tuesday, Mr. Malins, when the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome became extremely interested in the definition of inner London, in which not much moor, heathland or down-let alone mountains-may be found. I can now clarify that definition for him. Clause 41 defines inner London as including the inner London boroughs, which are those numbered one to 12 in schedule 1 to the London Government Act 1963-he is no doubt familiar with that-and not the Local Government Act 1972, as my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment suggested.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> A U-turn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes. The first U-turn in this Committee.

<P>
My note says that if pressed I can list the 12 relevant boroughs, but I do not believe that I am being pressed.

<P>
Amendment No. 15 would amend the definition of land to exclude land covered by water. It seems that the prohibition on bathing water in schedule 2 does not go far enough for the hon. Member for Ashford. He would like to prevent people from fording mountain streams or torrents or even striding over moorland streams. I do not know how much walking he has done, but I have done some-I am currently in the process of walking from Holy island to the lake district, a distance of about 250 miles-and it would be rather difficult to make much progress if I were not allowed to cross streams. The amendment would confine people to the boundaries set by streams or other waters and would allow them to set foot only beyond the most minor watercouse with the permission of the owner of the land. That would make the access provisions of the Bill unworkable, which I am sure is not his intention.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Under-Secretary is slightly incorrect in saying that the Bill prohibits access to bathing waters. In fact, the Bill prohibits the use of access waters for bathing, which is quite different. The amendment is designed to clarify the use of access waters in respect of other activities such as wading or fishing that could take place on the water or even by falling into it. Can we not exclude still water? The Under-Secretary might consider redrafting the amendment to make it clear that the provision relates to still water, not streams. Can we not find a way of preventing access to still waters, reservoirs, lakes and high ground?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> First, the Bill prohibits fishing. Secondly, we do not expect larger bodies of water to be included in the maps of open country. The hon. Member for Ashford mentioned safety. As the Bill makes clear, walkers must take primary responsibility for their own safety, whether in open countryside or other areas. Amendment No. 15 would render the access provisions of the Bill unworkable, which I am sure is not his intention.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 27, 28 and 85 relate to the definition of the owner of the land. Amendment No. 27 would change the definition so that for the purpose of clause 2 farm tenancies would be excluded. Taken
in conjunction with the relevant part of amendment
 No. 28, under the amendment a trespasser would be prohibited from returning to the land of the person entitled to the rack rent of the land-the freehold owner-rather than the land of the farm tenant. We see no reason why the trespasser would need to be excluded from such a potentially wide area of land and do not believe that such a provision could be enforced. Under the amendment, anyone who strayed on to the wrong part of a tenant farm on, for example, the Duke of Northumberland's estate, would be excluded from 90,000 acres of land, when most people-including, possibly, the Duke of Northumberland himself-do not know where the boundaries are. The Duke of Northumberland is generous in allowing access; I refer to him only to give a ludicrous example of the possible effect of the amendment. Some landowners, unlike the Duke, have been remarkably effective in excluding the public from their land under existing trespass laws, even without such a provision.

<P>
I fail to understand why someone with shooting rights over land should be defined as an owner, as proposed by amendment No. 129. That would introduce unnecessary uncertainty-and, as the hon. Gentleman said, conflict between different interests-into the operation of the provisions relating to trespassers. For example, the effect could be to exclude a walker not only from land over which he has trespassed, but from any other land in which a shooting syndicate happens to have an interest. How a walker is to know where else that syndicate might have an interest is beyond me-telepathy, possibly.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): May I challenge the Minister on that? First, it is wrong to assume that all shooting licensees are syndicates; many individuals or corporate bodies hold shooting licences. Secondly, on much of the land with which the Bill is concerned there may not be a tenant farmer. The land may be used only for sporting purposes, in which case the sporting tenant or shooting licensee will be in exactly the same position as a tenant farmer who might be grazing sheep; however, he would not have the same rights under the Bill as that tenant farmer. The husbandry of game takes just as much account of the future of that land and its management as the husbandry of sheep or cattle.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> If there is no tenant, the freeholder will be the relevant owner, and will have the power that the hon. Member for Ashford wants him to have. However, where there is tenant, it is sensible to give the power to him. On syndicates, I do not see how if people stray-which could happen, let us face it, accidentally-onto land over which a shooting syndicate has some rights for a number of days a year, the simple solution would be politely to point out the situation to them and ask them to leave, which I am sure most would. It is not appropriate to impose a ban-as amendment No. 129 would-that would extend everywhere that the shooting syndicate had rights; that could be on another estate that was miles away. It is all a bit ludicrous, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Frankly, that response is ludicrous. It displays utter ignorance about shooting and grouse moor management. The tenant who may have the shooting rights of a moor, for example, does not go there only occasionally to shoot: he has it for the whole year. He has to manage that land just as much as a sheep farmer, for example, would manage it. To all intents and purposes, companies or individuals that own shooting rights have exactly the same land-management concerns as farm tenants, but they are excluded from the Bill. We are always prepared to accept that our wording may not be exactly right, but I hope that the Under-Secretary will address the distinction between farm tenancy, which is covered by the legislation, and a shooting tenancy, which is not. Yet the two kinds of tenant would essentially have identical involvement with the land.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Under the Bill, the landowner can of course apply for total exclusion for 28 days a year, without having to give a reason-which may be shooting. There is no reason for people to be excluded 365 days a year from the many parts of the country where access if freely available. The right would belong to the freeholder-the person who sold the tenancy to the syndicate. I am advised that the owner, or anyone acting on his behalf, including a shooting syndicate, can already require a trespasser to leave the land. We are making a meal of something insignificant. Amendment No. 129, which I ask to be withdrawn, would introduce unnecessary uncertainty.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): I support my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. The Under-Secretary, who walks the uplands extensively and is aware of many of the difficulties that the landowners face, will know that it simply does not work in the way that he suggests when one politely asks people to leave. They quite often politely say that they will not.

<P>
The points raised by my hon. Friend are not designed to tweak the Government's tail. The amendments make serious points on fundamental complications and seek solely to clarify who is and who is not responsible. Is my hon. Friend aware of the respresentations of the National Gamekeepers' Association, many of whose members deal with the everyday management of the uplands? Absolute clarity is required to enable them to do their job.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, the amendment relates to clause 2(4), which deals with the landholding to which the subsequent exclusion of trespassers applies. It is not about who can require the trespasser to leave. Although the amendment may have a point, on which we shall reflect, the amendment does not achieve the objective that he and his colleagues seek. I must ask for all the amendments to 
 be withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): May I take the Minister back to amendment No. 15 which relates to water? He will know that there have been cases where canoeists' rights have supremacy over those of anglers. Can he confirm that the Bill will confer only a right to cross streams? Will it confer a right to cross streams with canoes and, if so, does it give the right only to cross a stream and not to ride up and down it?

<P>
<B>Mr.Mullin:</B> It is my understanding-I shall have to take further advice-that the Bill applies to walkers, not canoeists.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> So will the Bill confer the right to cross streams with any form of canoe?

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As far as I am aware, it does not. If I receive contrary information, I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall deal briefly with the Minister's variegated response. I was sad to hear him give an answer that boiled down to, ``Because we do not think it is necessary, it is not necessary.'' It is sad to see the once astringent attacker of Whitehall reduced to mouthing one of the great Sir Humphrey phrases.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I reserve my capacity for independent judgment for serious matters.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am glad to hear that and hope that we see evidence of it during our debate. The Minister's response was inadequate in that he did not say why it is unnecessary or undesirable to have all the definitions in one Bill and in one place in that Bill.

<P>
We had a lengthy exchange about what amendments Nos. 85 and 129 would achieve. The most worrying part of the Minister's response was his point that not all landowners are as generous with access as the Duke of Northumberland and that the clause, which removes all rights from landowners, should therefore stand. He will know that the number of bad landowners, in his terms, is very small and that laws that deal with a small minority-and which then have an impact on the large majority of people-are likely to be bad and impractical. That Bill would be such a law.

<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> The Minister was right to describe the Duke of Northumberland as an extremely enlightened landowner. However, not only the landowner, but those acting on behalf of the landowner and the clarity of their right to act lie at the centre of what we are trying to achieve. I know that the hon. Gentleman is genuinely sincere and that the princple of the Bill has been decided peradventure, but we want to improve it and make sure that it works well. We want absolute clarity about who may, and who may not, act on behalf of whom.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The Bill, as drafted, will lead to confusion. Its practical effects will not touch only those who are granted access, but will worsen relations between landlords and tenants.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have now found the appropriate amendment and I think that the Under-Secretary may have misunderstood the position. Is my hon. Friend aware that someone who has a long lease on sporting rights probably has a more valuable interest in the land than the freeholder? That may be why the clause includes agricultural tenants. In many cases, they, too, have a greater interest in the land than the freeholder. Thus, it would be illogical to leave out long leases on sporting rights.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. Even if we accept clause 2(5), the position is illogical in relation to other rights that may inhere in groups or individuals other than the landowner.

<P>
The Under-Secretary made some valid points about water. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire said, there is a difference between the activities that may be appropriate in respect of running water, still water or streams and those in relation to larger areas of water, so I hope that the Government will table appropriate amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Subsequent to the intervention of my 
 hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), I noticed that schedule 2 places a prohibition on the use of a vessel. However, a vessel is not defined. Moreover, paragraph 1(b) to schedule 2 refers to non-tidal water, which leaves open the option of access to tidal water.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point, but I shall not take it further at this stage in our proceedings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It is a pertinent point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is right in that the definition is not clear. The Government may table amendments to deal with the matter, but, sadly, we have seen no sign of a desire on their part to improve the Bill in that way. Issues such as ownership and the confusion that is caused by the Government's current formulation are such that we may return to the issue at a later date. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Member for Ashford said that he had a cluster of amendments; I fear that I have a constellation. I apologise to the Committee for the proliferation of amendments, which is solely due to the wish of the draftsmen to mention the Principality in almost every line. Hon. Members who have examined the amendments will realise that they all give effect to the same principle, encapsulated in new clause 1, which stands in my name and that of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd).

<P>
Our simple proposition is to disapply the provisions in Wales, not because we believe that there should not be provision for public access in Wales, but because we believe that such access should be determined in a place other than Westminster. The words of David Lloyd George-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>no one should be a trespasser in the land of his birth-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
have been frequently referred to in debates on the Bill. The amendments concern that land.

<P>
It is tempting to go into detail about why Wales is different from England. There are sound arguments based on, for instance, the proportion of land under consideration. One third of the new access areas created by the Bill-a substantial number-are in Wales, where there are three national parks, and some of the most beautiful mountain countryside in the United Kingdom.

<P>
Some farming practices are particular to Wales, and we may debate later the coed cae land and the ffridd land, and how that is used in farming. There is a significant amount of common land, and there are important issues involving graziers associations. There is also the enclosed high land, which may be unique to Wales. I have walked in areas such as Plynlimon, and taken great pleasure in that. I believe that it receives the most rainfall of anywhere in the United Kingdom, but it is still a glorious experience to be on top of Plynlimin. It has fences and walls, despite being 3,000 ft high.

<P>
The purpose of the amendments is not to differentiate between the agricultural practices and the nature of the land in Wales, and those elsewhere, but to propose that, following the evolution of the National Assembly for Wales, matters should be dealt with differently. This is quintessentially a matter that affects the fabric of Wales. It is local to its people and their land, so it should be a devolved matter that the Assembly can consider and on which it can introduce regulation. The Countryside Council for Wales would still be the relevant countryside body, as it is in the Bill. We should find the legislative means to achieve that.

<P>
I am sure that the Minister is well briefed on all the deficiencies in the drafting of my amendments, and on why they do not accomplish their task in the way in which constitutional lawyers would wish. I hope that he will not use the Committee's time to go through all those deficiencies, of which I know nothing about the existence of which I have no doubts.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): It is interesting that the Liberal Democrats have not been able to find a Member of Parliament from the land of Lloyd George to discuss the important amendment relating to Wales. Has the hon. Gentleman disregarded the essential principles of the Government of Wales Act 1998, which provide that primary legislative powers for Wales remain in Westminster? His amendment is in danger of confusing the issue greatly.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Although I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention, his first comment was plainly stupid. We have one hon. Member in the Committee; I cannot divide myself. I am a Somerset Member of Parliament and therefore a fellow Celt, which is perhaps sufficient. Had we put a Welsh Member in the Committee, we would have had no English Member. Given that our intention was to remove consideration of Wales, that would have been perverse, so I hope that he will reconsider that foolish comment.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman represents a Welsh constituency and so has an interest in the matter, for which the House did not delegate responsibility when it discussed the 1998 Act. If we want to do so, we must use legislative processes such as new clause 1 to give powers to the National Assembly for Wales. The matter affects Wales and I believe that it should fall within the Assembly's processes of discussion. That is not an especially alarmist position to take.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I would like the hon. Gentleman to clarify something. Is it his understanding that the Bill is in a slightly perverse position, as the power is not only absent from the National Assembly for Wales, but lies with the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, leaving out whole swathes of Welsh administration here and in Wales? The power will therefore be located a long way from anything about which the people of Wales may feel that they have a direct interest.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right in some respects. Some elements of the legislation are reserved to the Assembly, but the essential power resides with the Secretary of State. Those of us who believe in devolution feel that that is inappropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. Does he not accept that the wide drafting of new clause 1 would be sufficient to defeat the Bill's object of giving the general public access? That outcome would be abhorred by many ordinary people in Wales who will benefit from the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> What a lack of confidence the hon. Gentleman has in the National Assembly for Wales. He does not believe that it would use the powers vested in it by new clause 1 to do exactly the job that the House is capable of doing for England. He believes that it would defeat the principle of the Bill. I have confidence that his colleagues in Wales would do the job for which they were elected-which is to legislate properly for Welsh matters. I do not accept his point in any way.

<P>
There is a view prevalent among some hon. Members that we should retain all decision making in the House, despite having undergone devolution. They feel that licence can be granted only to administer, never to form policy and carry it through. That seems perverse and wrong. I do not want to change the tenor of our debate into a long exposition on the virtues or otherwise of devolution, but we must allow the parts of the United Kingdom that enjoy devolved power to make decisions on behalf of the people whom they serve. That is precisely what the amendments, and especially the new clause, would do.

<P>
The amendments do not oppose the principle of the Bill. They would merely provide that the details of public access would be determined by the National Assembly for Wales, which would have the power to make such decisions in the interests of the people whom it serves and the land in which it has an interest, and the Secretary of State would be cut out of the loop. That would be welcomed in Wales. I speak not as a Welshman; as I said, I was born some 25 miles from Cardiff, so I cannot claim to speak for the Principality. However, members of my party and others who have interests in Wales strongly feel that the Bill should devolve such matters to the National Assembly for Wales. I hope that the amendments will find favour with the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Mention has again been made of Lloyd George. Perhaps I should point out that Wales is the land of my birth and that of my father's, so I have some legitimacy in rising. Although I represent a seat in Kent, I was born and brought up in Wales.

<P>
The logic behind the purpose of this constellation of amendments seems impeccable-and I assure the Committee that it is rare for me to say that anything that the Liberal Democrats propose has impeccable logic. However, in this instance I am prepared to make an exception because the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome seems to have a perfectly good point. Indeed, as he said, the Bill contains references throughout to the National Assembly, which has already been given many secondary and defining powers. That seems consistent with the Government's stated view that they want to devolve power. Pro rata, the Bill will have at least as much effect in Wales as in England, and possibly more. Many of the anxieties that we shall express in Committee apply with possibly more force to the Welsh uplands even than to the uplands in England, so it seems entirely proper to pause and have at least one debate on a group of amendments that relate to Wales.

<P>
It seems a compelling argument that the ultimate powers should be given to the National Assembly rather than remain in London. Like the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, I was slightly bemused by the intervention of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas), when he said that new clause 1 would deny the rights of access of the people of Wales. Two points should be made. First, I am sure that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is right that in practice the National Assembly would pass similar legislation and that such legislation should be specially tailored for Welsh circumstances, in which case, given that the National Assembly exists, it is probably the best body to do that.

<P>
Secondly, and even more important as a point of principle, if the Government believe, as they say they do, in devolution and the importance of the Bill, it seems absurd to deny the National Assembly for Wales the right to make up its own mind on the matter, which seems to be the thrust behind what the hon. Member for Clwyd, West said. In other words, the Welsh people are entitled to devolution, but not for matters on which the Labour party in London might disagree with them. That seems consistent with Government practice ever since they set up the National Assembly for Wales-with deleterious effects on their popularity there.

<P>
It seems instructive that this group of amendments has inspired Labour Back Benchers to intervene for the first time in Committee to make the point that they do not want to trust the Assembly to take decisions about access in Wales. The logic behind the amendments, which include new clause 1, seems to be impeccable in the Government's own terms. Therefore, I assume that the Minister will either accept the amendments, or at the very least say that he accepts the principle behind them and will table improved versions of them. If he will not do that, I am happy to assure the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that Conservative Members will support his group of amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> As the only Welsh Member present, I am especially pleased to take part in the debate on an amendment of significance to Wales and the National Assembly for Wales. I speak as somebody with a record of campaigning strongly over many years for the establishment of such an assembly. I welcome the fact that the Government succeeded in the political feat of achieving substantial self-government for Wales. Lloyd George has been mentioned, and he was strongly identified with that campaign in the 19th and 20th centuries.

<P>
The Bill is consistent with the fundamental principles behind the constitutional settlement as it relates to Wales. Primary legislative powers should reside in Westminster, but substantial secondary legislative powers should be accorded to the Assembly, and that directly elected body should be able to formulate policies to fit the needs of Wales, including those of the Welsh countryside, within the framework of legislation passed at Westminster. That was the decision of the Welsh people in the devolution referendum, and we have to respect that.

<P>
The danger with such a broad and misconceived amendment is that it could defeat the purpose of the devolution settlement and, by the back door, enable wreckers, of whom unfortunately there are many in the Assembly, to defeat the primary object of the Bill. It would be a way of giving primary legislative power to the Assembly by the back door. For that reason, the amendment is wrong and I resist it strongly. I believe that many of my constituents and people throughout Wales would share my view.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman care to reflect on his last couple of sentences? He referred to the number of wreckers that there may be in the Welsh National Assembly. As a Welshman, representing a Welsh constituency, is he really saying that an English-dominated Parliament should supersede the decisions of elected representatives of Wales, put in place by the Government to manage affairs in Wales? If they want to wreck the Bill, surely that is their prerogative.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> With great respect, the hon. Gentleman does not understand the significance of what I said. Primary legislative power remains at Westminster and it is right that we respect the devolution settlement. The Bill gives substantial discretion to the Welsh people, through the Countryside Council for Wales, to give a Welsh character to those important provisions. That is consistent with the fundamental principle behind the Bill-that the nuts and bolts of how access will be effected should be left mainly to regional bodies and, for Wales, to the Countryside Council for Wales. There is ample opportunity within the Bill to allow a form of access that reflects the distinctive nature of the Welsh countryside. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, the Welsh countryside is very different. Much of Wales is of high altitude, with its less-favoured areas. Access provisions have differed over the years. The Bill does allow Wales to develop its own forms of access.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
New clause 1 would create enormous practical difficulties, so I resist it strongly. I shall have to quote Lloyd George again. I did not know Lloyd George, Mr. Malins, and my father certainly did not know Lloyd George. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy is not present, but the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and the hon. Gentleman are certainly no successors to Lloyd George. Lloyd George was strongly identified with the cause of giving access to the land to the ordinary people. The Liberal Democrats and the nationalists who portray themselves in Wales as progressive parties are guilty of tremendous hypocrisy. It should be known that the Liberal Democrats and the nationalists, as I understand it, abstained on the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong in respect of all that he has said. We voted for the Bill and, had he taken the trouble to read the Second Reading contributions, he would have realised that. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy is, as a number of hon. Members know, unwell at the moment, and has been advised by his doctor not to attend the Committee this week. I hope the hon. Gentleman will not draw any political inferences from his absence today.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for pointing that out. However, many people who voted for the nationalists and Liberal Democrats in the election for the National Assembly for Wales will be dismayed that those parties are adopting such a reactionary approach to the question of acces. The new clause is fundamentally flawed and I oppose it most strongly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> With your indulgence, Mr. Malins, I shall clarify the point about canoes. I am advised that any walker can carry a canoe if he wishes, but he may not use it. There is nothing in the Bill to entitle him to use it on water to which access is granted. Therefore, the hon. Member for Cotswold is unlikely to come across a lot of walkers carrying canoes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way on that point?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is helpful for the Under-Secretary to have explained the position about canoes, but that is not an opportunity for further interventions. He was just slipping that in.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> You have it in one, Mr. Malins.

<P>
The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome was well dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West. I make it clear that the Bill is drafted entirely in accordance with the principles enshrined in the devolution settlement. Parliament retains responsibility for primary legislation for Wales on the basis that the Assembly will have, were it appropriate, the power to make subordinate legislation under enabling powers. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said that the details should be determined in a place other than Westminster, and they will be under the existing legislation.

<P>
By contrast, the new clause would give the Assembly the right to rewrite the statute book at will. It would go well beyond the powers delegated to the Secretary of State in the Bill. In particular, it would usurp the role of Parliament by leaving to the Assembly the principle of whether there would be a right of access to open countryside. Much of the new clause merely spells out the powers that the Assembly will have under the Bill, including those to make regulations on the mapping and appeal processes and to act in the same way as the Secretary of State in England.

<P>
The Bill spells those powers out as it goes along, and the many amendments in the group would remove references to them. It presents a clearer way of setting out the relevant powers that is less likely to lead to disputes than if it were amended. The Bill leaves so much of the detail and practical application of the access provisions to secondary legislation that the Assembly could, if it so wished, develop a regime for Wales that was different from the English regime.

<P>
Hon. members have argued that access requirements are different in Wales. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) said on Second Reading that the Bill's access provisions were not needed in Wales, and that it was a slight on the Welsh people to assume that they would deny access to anyone. That was an extravagant claim, Mr. Malins. Do you want to comment?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. At no stage did I want to add anything to this most interesting debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am always anxious to accommodate you, Mr. Malins-sometimes over anxious, it would seem.

<P>
I gladly acknowledge the generous spirit that prevails in Wales, but inhospitable landowners are not unknown even in that beautiful country. When rights are not enshrined in law, they can always be taken away. We estimate that the Bill will confer a right of access for more than 500,000 hectares of mountain, moor, heath and down in Wales, a significant part of which is common land. Only 40,000 hectares of that, although possibly more, are estimated to have statutory rights of access at present. That is less than 10 per cent. of the total, so despite some hon. Members' claims, the Bill will confer some worthwhile rights that will be of great interest to many people in Wales.

<P>
It will be for the Assembly to decide whether to make provisions for walkers that are more restrictive than those in England. However, that is not a reason for Wales not having the legislation. The circumstances in Wales and England do not differ so much that different basic legislation could be justified. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> This has been an interesting debate only in that we have heard the authentic voice of reaction coming from the hon. Member for Clwyd, West. He does not believe that Wales should take its own decisions, as he does not trust his colleagues in the Welsh Assembly to take them. He believes that everything must be prescribed from Westminster in detail and handed as a tablet to Cardiff to interpret at the margins.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being unnecessarily kind to Labour Members. He has failed to point out that the largest party in the Assembly is the Wales Labour party, so, as much as anything, the Labour party in London does not trust the Wales Labour party.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right, but there are many Welsh Labour parties, and not all speak with the same voice. Let us not be diverted into a debate on the merits of the Labour party in Wales.

<P>
I am not persuaded by the Under-Secretary's reply. He is the most charming of Ministers, but often even he does not sound persuaded by what he says. I may be misinterpreting him, as he is about to correct me.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am entirely persuaded by the arguments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for clarifying that. I detect the telltale signs of firm support for the words that are put in front of him.

<P>
We have a fundamental difference of opinion. It is wrong to suggest that the amendments in any way reduce the Bill's effectiveness. If they did so I would not have tabled them. I am convinced of the Bill's merits; it is simply that some matters should be devolved to the Assembly. This matter is one that should be dealt with in Wales. Constitutionally, the British Parliament makes primary legislation and if we want the National Assembly for Wales to exercise powers in particular areas, we have to specify that in primary legislation. That is what new clause 1 does. It does not say that public access should not apply in Wales; it says simply that the nature and detail of that access should be determined by the National Assembly for Wales. We therefore would not need the many clauses in part I that closely define public access. The latitude that the Minister says exists for the National Assembly for Wales does not exist to any great extent, and, even if it did, it would not alter my conviction that the matters should be dealt with by the devolved Assembly.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> The point that I was trying to make-it seems that the hon. Gentleman still has not understood it-is that the new clause is sufficiently wide in terms of matters of public access to defeat the Bill's object.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I do not know how often I have to say it: the hon. Gentleman's point demonstrates the extent to which he does not believe that the Assembly wants public access to land in Wales. However, we have created, by Act of Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, which can take such decisions on behalf of the Welsh people. I believe that it would do so properly, would take account of all the factors pertaining to Wales and would produce good legislation for Wales, just as I believe that we can produce good legislation for England.

<P>
I would very much like regional authorities in England to take such decisions at some stage, but I disagree with the hon. Member for Clwyd, West that there is provision in the Bill for regional variations. There are at present no regional bodies to take different decisions. There is the English body, the Countryside Agency, and the equivalent Welsh body. The Secretary of States embodies all that is good and great in England, as does the National Assembly for Wales in regard to Wales. The variations do not exist-but that is a debate for another day and place.

<P>
The amendments deal only with the Principality. The Minister has made clear that the Government do not believe that the matters should be determined in Wales. I will not make progress with that argument today, but it is a matter that is of interest to a sufficiently large number of hon. Members for us to return to it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 2, line 9, at end insert-

</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 97, in schedule 2, page 40, line 6, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) leaves access land by means other than a designated access point,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> This is one of the most important groups of amendments. That is not to denigrate others, but this group is essential to how the operation will work in practice. At the centre of the Bill is the provision of information about what land is available to walk upon and the rights and responsibilities of everyone involved-the owners, the tenants and the walkers. Schedule 2 lists a large number of things that walkers must not do and, as the Minister knows, we would like to add to that list. It is clear that many activities will be prohibited under schedule 2.

<P>
The purpose behind this group of amendments, particularly the first amendment, is to show that people cannot just wander on to the access land at any point and have all the relevant information to hand. There is scope within the Bill and the schedules for information on the variations between different areas of land to be provided, but not all the relevant facts. Not all the information could be provided on a map, or in any other generally available form, because of those variations. The most important of those is the 28-day rule. There has to be a mechanism by which anybody seeking to go on to the land must know whether it is closed or not on a particular day. I put it to the Minister that that is central to the validity of that 28-day exception.

<P>
The Countryside Agency, the local access forum and various other bodies all have information that they wish to communicate to those wishing to go on to the land. Yet under the Bill, if the access land bordered the road, or if there were a footpath from the road to the access land, anyone could walk on to that land at any point. We know that there is mile after mile of moorland road where access land is immediate. There is also the issue of traffic hazard. Anyone who has tried to drive on country roads knows that there is not much space for parking other than in designated places. If people decide to park anywhere in order to walk on a particular bit of land because it looks nice, they will create a traffic hazard.

<P>
The principal purpose of our amendments is to require access points. Because of the way in which the Bill is drafted, people may walk on to the land at any point. They could climb a fence or wall to get on to the land, even if there were a stile or a gate 50 yards up the road. They could access it at any point and that is wrong because, if potential walkers do not have the necessary information, there is potential for disruption to farming activities, sporting activities and all sorts of land management, and the risk of danger to the individual.

<P>
For example, an owner may have decided to close land because red deer are being stalked. High-power rifles are legally and sensibly required to cull deer. If land is closed for a day for that reason and a walker goes on to it, he will be taking his life into his hands and will be at serious risk. If there were designated access points, an owner could display a red flag-not necessarily to show his membership of the Labour party, because after this Bill I suspect that it will not have many members-or, more importantly, the traditional military red flag that shows that live firing is taking place. I jest slightly, but it should be made clear in some way that activities are taking place that could put an individual in danger, so the moor, or whatever, is closed for the day.

<P>
Without going back to the argument about those with interests, we are considering not just the interests of the landowner or the tenant, but the interests of the walkers and how they can be informed about their obligations on certain land and what restrictions exist, and reminded of the legion of prohibited activities that are listed in schedule 2. The amendments are designed to require that people should go on to open land only from designated access points. We have not gone into the detail about how many access points there should be, how regularly spaced and where located, because those are issues that can be addressed later. We are concerned here with the issue of principle concerning whether absolute open access is in the interests of any of the people affected by the Bill. I contend that it is not, and therefore we should require people to access land only via designated access points.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I suspect that my hon. Friend may still be talking when the Committee rises, but an important point of safety arises here, which I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider. If there is unlimited access to moors and mountains, the danger of people getting lost in those areas will increase. None of the rescue authorities will have a clue where people entered the moor or the mountain. Therefore, designated access points would seem to make eminently good sense from a safety point of view and to help the authorities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is right. He illustrates, as I have attempted to do, that it is in the interests of the walkers as much as anybody else that they should have the information with which to enter the land.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): The hon. Gentleman gives the Committee no clue as to how many designated access points might be appropriate. It might be one, or it might be 100,000. What does he think of my suggestion that there should be a designated access point every 10 feet?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I treat that with the contempt that I have for most of the hon. Gentleman's remarks in this place. He has set out to ridicule anything sensible about the Bill. He did it on Second Reading, and he did it with his own private Member's Bill. He is clearly anti-anybody who owns property and illustrates my fundamental objection to this measure, which is that it is anti-property rights. He demonstrates the true left-wing Labour tradition. [

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are in danger of becoming a little noisy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Clearly, the idea of designated access points every 10 feet is as ludicrous as it is possible to be. I specifically said earlier that we have not set out to determine precisely where they should be or how many there should be. The amendments concern the issue of principle that we wish to address. If we can persuade the Under-Secretary to accept the principle-as I hope we can-there will be plenty of opportunities later, both in this House and in the other place, to address the detail of how they should be created and where and how frequently such points should occur.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Even if the Under-Secretary would not permit statutory access points, would it not be possible to have an advisory system whereby walkers could be advised where they should enter the moor or the mountain?

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. I would rather concentrate at this stage on the statutory-
