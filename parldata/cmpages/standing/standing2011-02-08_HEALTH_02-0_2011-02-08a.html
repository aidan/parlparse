be fair I will ask everyone one general question, and then I will back
off and let my colleagues put their questions. The Bill has been
criticised by many as risky. Do you think there are risks associated
with it and with the reorganisation that it attempts to marshal? If so,
what do you see as the main risks? If possible, perhaps you could each
answer that question in turn.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000007">&#160;</a>

Gerada:</strong>
                           </em> I am Clare Gerada from the Royal College of
General Practitioners. First, we welcome putting GPs at the centre of
planning the health service for the local population. We are very keen
on that. However, we have a number of concerns about the Bill. One is
about the duplication of care and fragmentation; we are also concerned
about the under-provision of care once competition starts kicking in,
the pace and extent of change, and the capability capacity and
competence  of GPs across the board to undertake that role. We
are concerned that the Bill risks widening health inequalities and
could lead to worse patient care, and that introducing competition
based on price will reduce quality. We are concerned about the
transaction costs, which will inevitably rise if there is an increased
number of providers. We are also concerned about the split between
choice and competition—we would rather see collaboration,
co-operation, shared care and integration. Those
are—briefly—some of our concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000008">&#160;</a>

finish, we have consulted widely with our members on a number of
occasions, including with stakeholders in a large consultation exercise

of our members who have given answers to
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000009">&#160;</a>

my members. However, we have consulted widely, often and in different

risk is the status quo—looking at what is now called the
Nicholson challenge in the light of the changes we know about and the
pressures on our health service, and asking, “Will we deliver by
trying harder at doing the same thing?”
There is a greater risk in the status quo than in the change. The risk
would be to disenfranchise or not engage clinicians, particularly in
the realignment of their clinical decisions with the financial
accountability that goes with those decisions. Those are completely
disengaged at the moment and that is the biggest risk to the status
quo. On the process, the NAPC has been lobbying for a long time to
return financial accountability to alignment with clinical decision
making.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000014">&#160;</a>

deploys an NHS resource. In the main, it is the referrer and, in the
main, the referrer is the general practitioner. Any clinician, who is a
resource themselves or who commits resources, would need to have that
same alignment. Ultimately, that would be the case within secondary

risk at the moment is the occasional misunderstanding of the intent of
the reforms within the service. Some of the concerns that our members
have—or some of the work I have done in the
Department—relate to clarifying these misunderstandings, where
there are all sorts of extrapolations of what some colleagues think is
going to happen, but which I do not think is necessarily part of the
reforms. For example, we are talking about the position of
AWP—any willing provider—or the process in which
clinicians will get engaged, which is not making them into managers.
Many of my colleagues think that that is moving them into a different
role, as opposed to just doing their job
better.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000017">&#160;</a>

managers and laypeople. Like my two colleagues, the NHS Alliance
supports the move towards clinical commissioning. Yes, we do believe
that there are significant risks associated with the Bill, but that is
true in any major change. Some of those risks are certainly associated
with what has become known as the Nicholson challenge, but I think
about maintaining clear accountability and a grip on public finances.
There is clearly a risk that a major change may not work in the
interests of patients, but the thought that GP commissioning consortia
would be significantly worse than primary care trusts may be without
foundation. There is a risk in the Bill that public accountability will
be compromised, particularly in relation to the make-up of those
consortia. Overall, I agree with James that the greatest risk is to
continue as we are—change is necessary—but there are
certainly risks associated with this and other
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000018">&#160;</a>

this morning to the Health Select Committee and this issue arose. My
organisation believes that there is a need for independent directors of
GP commissioning consortia, not only to strengthen public
accountability—recognising that independent directors per se
will not satisfy that requirement—but for good governance
purposes. One of the difficulties with the Bill is that it does not
preclude independent directors being members of consortia boards; that
is left, as I read the Bill, for the national commissioning board in
receiving applications from intending consortia. That serves as an
example in my mind of a number of risks in the Bill itself, in the
sense that we have not got all the detail coloured in yet. Colleagues
in the room will be far more aware than I of secondary legislation,
regulations and directions. We have not got the complete picture yet.
The Bill has that risk because it is not prescriptive in that
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000020">&#160;</a>

abolition of practice boundaries, presumably within the area of a
consortium, is a good thing; and whether, at the same time and in order
to protect small practices, which often seem to rate highest in public
esteem, should there be some provision for practices to cap list size
or at least say, “I want to remain a small practice and not take
any more patients on to my

single-handed and small practices, and the other is the abolition of
practice boundaries. If I can deal with the first, which is the
single-handed and small practices, the Royal College of GPs values
small practices—they often get the highest patient satisfaction.
If you look at the research evidence and compare like with like, small
practices do as well as large ones if you compare their make-up, but
you have to accept that small practices tend to be in much more
deprived areas, for lots of reasons. That is just one thing about small
practices.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000023">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The abolition
of practice boundaries perturbs us greatly. The cornerstone of the NHS
almost since its inception—in fact, before its inception, with
the panel doctors—has been the registered list: a list with a
geographical boundary around it. The geographical boundary invariably
takes in people close to the GP practice. As I understand the Bill,
patients will be given the choice to register with any GP, irrespective
of whether the practice is within their local population. That will
bring in all sorts of issues, not least continuity of care, the ability
to plan for health services and the confusion of local government, with
its health and well-being boards, being allied to a local population
while the GP consortia are not. It also opens up the question of who is
responsible for the total population. Provision may well be made for
emergency care provision if you fall down in the street, but there will
be nobody responsible

                           </div>for the total population as far as I can see—I have not read the

concerns that unless Parliament puts in some checks and balances, there
will be choice for patients of consortia, but consortia will also be
able to choose patients. I am not sure how the legislation will pan
out, but if Mrs Jones, who has chronic renal failure and who lives in
my area, comes to register, there may well be no one who can mandate me
to take her on as a high-cost patient. There are concerns about the
abolition of practice boundaries. We submitted our consultation
documents to the previous Government and said quite clearly to them
exactly what I just said. We have the same concerns about this Bill and
feel that it will lead to fragmentation of care, worsening of health
inequalities and increased costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000025">&#160;</a>

my organisation’s. I fully support the overall choice and
competition agenda. As a GP, I want to be the best GP I can possibly be
and I want a practice that is, like the Gillette principle, the best a
patient can get. Contrary to the reports about 40% or more of GPs being
in salaried positions, they are not. As Her Majesty’s Revenue
and Customs recognises, 84% of GPs are independent contractors, and of
the 16% who are not, half work with independent contractors. It is
largely an environment of independently contracted, self-employed GPs
who inherently have always wanted to produce a good practice and accept
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is an
issue about supply and demand and the doctor to patient ratio, which is
usually carefully monitored by the practices, but there is also the
principle of choice—allowing patients to go to the service that
they see best fits their needs, set against the reasonable geography in
which they choose. I would not expect anybody from Southampton to want
to register with my practice in Wallasey in the north. There has to be
something that recognises that that would be unreasonable, and
similarly there has to be some fit between the registered list and the
other providers in the area—the secondary care
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
principle of allowing patients to move more freely between practices,
to not accept substandard practice and to move to where their needs
will be met, should be part of the process, and I fully support that.
The competitive aspect of it is sometimes what makes practice great. It
improves the quality of practice, because we learn from
colleagues’ successes and look at other practices in the area
and aspire to achieve what they have, and it moves the agenda forward.
On the principle of allowing greater choice, in our area, lots of
colleagues recognise that the practice boundaries arranged by PCTs were
restrictive, but we always had patients who were moving slightly away
from a practice saying, “Please can I stay?” and GPs
usually allowed them
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000029">&#160;</a>

Gerada 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 47<a class="bkMark" name="Column47">&#160;</a>
                           </div>says about satisfaction and outcomes is true, but what we also have to
do is move away from a single-handed mentality—there is evidence
that on occasions we get single-handed mentality even within larger
practices—to more corporate working within
practices.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000030">&#160;</a>

share Dr Gerada’s view that there should not be cherry picking,
and that neither practices nor consortia should be able to exclude
patients because they are difficult or high cost.
There is an element here of trading off the advantages of choice and
the potential disadvantages. One reason why I think there is merit in
the choice argument is that the arrangement gives patients the
opportunity of choice of commissioner, and that is a choice that none
of us has ever had. I think that there is some international evidence
to suggest that when you have choice of commissioner, as opposed to
choice of provider, you may well leverage quality of

we might simply see changes to the structure and little else, and that
if that were to be the case, it would mirror many NHS changes of the
past. What evidence can we see that this change is not going to be a
change similar to those of the
past?<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000032">&#160;</a>

Sobanja:</strong>
                           </em> It is always difficult to see evidence of
prospective change. What I was trying to get at was that I have worked
in the health service as a manager for more than 30 years. I was chief
executive of a health authority, and I have seen many NHS
restructurings, which are rather akin to someone firing a large gun at
a tree full of blackbirds. All the blackbirds take off and land on
slightly different branches, but they are the same blackbirds, doing
essentially the same job. That is what concerns
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
argue that the health service that I have worked in has essentially
been a centralist, top-down structure. If you look at the Bill,
depending on the behaviour of, for example, the new national
commissioning board, the outcome could be a top-down, centralist
structure. That is why I suggested that we need to change behaviour and
culture. If commissioning consortia are to be successful, this needs to
be led from the front line, by clinicians, and not directed from above.
I do not have any evidence of changes that are yet to come about, but
that is what I had in mind when I wrote that

Kingsland:</strong>
                           </em> There is some evidence. The National
Association of Primary Care evolved from an association of fundholding
practices, and although we fully recognise that this is not a return to
fundholding, the principle, as I said earlier, of aligning clinical
decisions with resource utilisation is part of that behavioural change.
If the Bill is legislating for accountability and outcomes, we see the
accountability right at the interface where patients define quality,
which is between them and their consulting clinician. Behaviour has to
change in that environment—in every consultation and in every
surgery—and there has to be a recognition that a referral and a
prescription do spend taxpayers’ money. The evidence that we
have from fundholding over seven years, which was reported by the
King’s Fund, showed that within fundholding practices there was,
on average, a 4% efficiency gain  in their budgets year on year
for seven years, despite 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>budgets being set on historical outturn. There was ever-increasing
efficiency, and that was achieved by clinicians having some
responsibility and accountability for the budgets they were deploying.
The cultural change needs to happen within every practice. It is the
aggregation of lots of remarkable events in every general practice,
every year, that will go to the quality,
innovation, productivity and prevention challenge, not the supplanting
of PCTs with another large organisation that will, hopefully, do it on
behalf of practices

unseen benefit, perhaps—with fundholding was that patients
started to see that fundholders were able to create new services and
provide better access for some of their patients. The patients would
start to say—this was a failing—“Are you a
fundholding practice or not? I am going to make my choice on practice
on whether or not you are managing a budget.” Fundholding did
show behavioural
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000037">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I have a conflict of interest here. I used to
chair a GP commissioning organisation, which was an umbrella group for
fundholders and non-fundholders, and I chaired a group of 420 GPs in
south London. My practice itself was never a fundholder and we too
brought about change without the flexibilities of fundholding. I
practised in an area of south London where, right up to the end, there
were very small numbers of fundholders.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000038">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To answer
your question, Mr Barron, I think that you get real change when you
have clinician-to-clinician dialogue, where you see problems, where you
have iterative change and where you innovate in order to make a
difference at the provider level to meet the needs of your population.
For example, many services address the big scourges that we currently
have, such as obesity, smoking and alcohol, and address the
hard-to-reach groups. Where this may well change, and where we are
optimistic, is the recognition that GP consortia will have to work with
local government. Integrating local government and public health and
having GP consortia working with local government should, if allowed
to, bring about a change, although there are concerns about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If you ask
me, “In its current form, is anything going to change?”
again I say—rather parochially having been to several of my
local meetings—it looks like the same faces, the same agenda and
the same discussions as were there 10 years ago and as were there under
practice- based commissioning. I also chaired a practice-based
commissioning group in my local area. We are hopeful. The college is
doing everything it can. I agree with Dr Kingsland that good
commissioning is about being a good GP. It is about using resources
appropriately in the consulting room. The college is developing a
curriculum and a training programme so that we can engage GPs in the
consulting room. I am talking about a hearts and minds transformational
change right there. If we do not get it right there, then I suspect
that we will not make any change over the next few years, and that is
what we hope to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000040">&#160;</a>

will be the local authority and the public health service, which we
have not seen much of, that will be responsible for this. If my
interpretation is right, do you think that it is a good idea to take

within the local authority—I am speaking as a GP now, not as
public health clinician; they may have a different view—is a
good idea. Some 60% of what we see in our consulting room cannot be
affected by anything that we can do. It is down to your
genes—who your parents are—your environment, your housing
or your education. Therefore, in my vision for the future, I see GPs
working much more closely with local government, having meaningful
health outcomes that are based not on giving a tablet and lowering your
cholesterol by half a point so that you live for another 10 minutes,
but on children completing education and training and getting elderly
people in social networks. That is what energises me and my

responsibility; it shares responsibility and relocates the public
health function. The NHS locally and nationally and local authorities
must play their part in improving the health of the population. I do
not see anything in the shift of the public health function into local
authorities that should concern us, recognising that we have to learn
to work across boundaries. For instance, if you were to take the
cardiovascular screening and treatment programme, which is clearly an
illness prevention, health promotion service, there would be aspects of
that where the local health service and local government must work
together, as indeed they do now.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000044">&#160;</a>

what you had to say about the public health moving to local authority,

to take the commissioning role. Hearing your earlier evidence, I was
beginning to think that your college was against all the proposals in
the Bill, but it seems not. You expressed concern earlier, though,
about the competition and greater choice aspects. Do you not agree that
the Bill does not rule out collaboration and partnership working? In
fact, it sets out to encourage

developments? Why would competition, added to those other good things,

Gerada:</strong>
                           </em> The college is in favour of commissioning and
putting GPs at the centre of commissioning. The question that was
tossed at me right at the beginning was where our concerns
were.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
equipping our profession to do this. We have absolutely no problem with
competition where competition adds value to existing
services. The problem we have is competition based
on price. All the evidence appears to show that if you base competition
on price you drive down quality. That is what we are concerned about,
that it will be a race to the bottom.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000048">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">You are right
that we are not against integration, though we are minded to see how
this will work in practice, with the separation of the provider and the
commissioner. If you think about integration, most of it will happen at
the local level. It will happen with clinicians talking to clinicians.
The clinicians will inevitably be those sitting on GP commissioning
boards, because we all live and work within communities. It is about
how that is going to be managed. Is it going to be perceived as a
conflict of interest or as anti-competitive? It is measures like that.
We need to have the flexibility to have integrated care and
collaboration and co-operation but we must not be handcuffed by any
legislation that says that that becomes
anti-competitive.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000049">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On the costs side, you mentioned a possible race to
the bottom in terms of price. Effective procurement is based on a
combination of value, price and quality. Why would GP commissioning
groups not want to see it in those terms, bearing it in mind also that
they will be inspected by the Care Quality Commission, which will be
more focused on
quality?<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000050">&#160;</a>

willing provider, which does not require procurement so there is not
the issue. The other is the requirement, if you have service redesign,
to go out to competitive tendering. All I can say is that from my
experience, and from my reading, the tender will no doubt inevitably be
given to those with the lowest price. There are many examples across
the country of that happening. It is inevitable—maybe it is not
inevitable, but one would assume—that when resources are very
tight, one will go for the cheapest option. Maybe that will not happen,
but one would assume that it would.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000051">&#160;</a>

sure that there is any evidence for that, but I understand the element
of concern. It seems to me that people have to be able to use the
leverage in the system and competition to produce the best deal for
patients, which includes elements of integration as well as
competition. In my experience, and I do some work outside the NHS with
commercial organisations, some of the most advanced integration and
working across—to use commercial language—supply chains
actually arises in what is a competitive environment, because people
see the value of that collaboration. Perhaps my concerns are a little
less than Dr Gerada’s on that matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000052">&#160;</a>

                           </div>to have turned into a policy statement. To be very precise, I would like
to see any willing provider operate once the commissioner has pressed
the button and declared a need for a service. If any willing provider
were to operate as a blanket market entry arrangement it could
undermine the local commissioners—the GP
commissioning consortia—and flood the market with providers,
which would not be in the interests of the local population. The Bill
is not specific on that matter, hence my comments before about needing
greater detail about what is to follow as opposed to the Bill
itself.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000053">&#160;</a>

is this. We are for, certainly in our organisation, competition in the
market, and as is, but that does not disallow collaboration with
current NHS providers. Where a provider is able to meet a service
specification that the commissioner has designed, within that market
why would you want to go anywhere else? It is good to have competition
to aid quality, however. If you cannot get a provider to supply against
your commissioning spec you look for competition for the market and any
willing provider should then be an option, to say, “Well, if we
cannot find a current NHS provider against our commissioning spec,
let’s look for somebody who can.” We would support that
as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000054">&#160;</a>

£500,000 to put a service out to tender—I got that figure
from the House of Lords debate—and, clearly, there is an
operational cost in that. It is not money that will go directly into
patient care. In fact, it will be lost completely to patient care. The
rest depends on what the service, specification and requirement are.

analysed the 900 or so freetext comments. One of the most common
freetext comments was about the apparent privatisation of the NHS and
the move of services away from the NHS family. We would need to be very
careful because external organisations can provide and have provided
very good services to the NHS, so it depends on what the service is. I
would like to say that tendering is very expensive and I would want to
see very little of it, because that money is not going directly into
patient care; it is going into the coffers of various
folk—depending on who it goes to.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000063">&#160;</a>

It is, as Dr Gerada says, what is the nature of the service and is a
procurement methodology appropriate? My belief is that within a
framework set at national level, this ought to be a local, not
national, decision. If Monitor, using its powers in the
Bill—subject to its passage through Parliament—declared
that something was anti-competitive, that might also undermine the
local commissioner. Bearing it in mind that the paragraph you quote
says “may” make regulations, my only answer is that we
may have concerns depending on how that power is exercised. That is
part of the problem with seeing how this will be applied in the longer
term as opposed to the specific provision for the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000064">&#160;</a>

trying to reduce through the reform, that will be a major failing of
implementation. I was involved in first describing the AWP process
about six years ago. It is an unfortunate term, because it is sometimes
thought that anyone—any old person—can provide. That is
opposed to the process that says that if you need to increase the
market—produce new for the market—we should reduce the
tendering process. The whole aspect of AWP was to get tendering reduced
to the position where if a necessary monopoly service needed to be
created due to the nature of the service—its
rarity—clearly tendering would be required, but, other than
that, the tendering process should be made to be a rarity in this new
process of AWP.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000065">&#160;</a>

the structure other than consortia, it should be the responsibility of
the national commissioning board. When PCTs were around and we had
primary care groups and so on, one thing that damaged the relationship
within the primary care groups as they shifted to PCTs, was that people
who you expected to work together to commission services in the
interests of the population suddenly found themselves commissioning
their own services as well. You need to separate those. The
responsibility should be with the national commissioning board,
supported by local commissioning consortia, but that responsibility
cannot and should not be delegated.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000067">&#160;</a>

about the contracts for the four primary care contractor services,

some of the quality improvements and incentives that could be delivered

Gerada, I guess. I just want to probe you a little more on the level of
enthusiasm among GPs for this shift to GP-led commissioning consortia.
We had somebody here from the British Medical Association this morning,
and the gist of what he said to us was that a lot of GPs have seen a
lot of changes during the years and frankly they will jump on this one
and go along with it, for fear of being left behind. The GPs that I
know are certainly not passive sheep who just follow on aimlessly.
Given that 55% of the population in England are covered by the GP
pathfinder consortia, what do you think that says about your
members’ enthusiasm for these changes?<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000070">&#160;</a>

PCTs, just to put things into context, as well as being chair of the
Royal College of General Practitioners and as well as having spoken to
hundreds of GPs. I think what it says for my colleagues is actually,
“Pat them on the back”. They are rolling their sleeves up
and they are doing this because they know they have to do it and they
want to make it safe for patients and the NHS. So they are getting in
there and they are getting stuck in. My work partner spent the whole of
Sunday reading documents to prepare himself and to skill himself
up.  If you translate that into, “We’re really
enthusiastic  about it”, then I think that the answer to
that is, “No”. It is not, “Great, yet another
reorganisation. Great, we can sit at some more meetings on a cold
Thursday evening”,
etc.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000071">&#160;</a>

have to do this. PCTs at the moment are losing staff in quite
considerable droves. PCTs themselves are the main vehicle for getting
pathfinders together and setting up the infrastructure, and the local

process that has to happen, it is going to happen and therefore we have
to get involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000072">&#160;</a>

about three or four years’ time. But we will get on with it,

of this not being provided with a service. We cannot have GP consortia
being set up without responsible officers, accountable officers,

organisational change, which those of my generation and younger have
been through before. We have seen it and done it. The real excitement
is in actually making a difference—working with our local
government, looking at the big issues around public health and
designing services that meet that need. Commissioning? I think that
James Kingsland is very excited about commissioning. But in terms of
planning services, I think that there is not that much enthusiasm, to

that, at present, OSCs operate in local authority areas—in my
area, in Hampshire and Surrey. There is a reason why I mention both,
and I will give it later. They are democratically
accountable—that is, the people on the OSCs are
elected—and they bring in co-opted people as well. They have a
work programme, and they call people in and so on. There is some
element of democracy and governance there
already.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000092">&#160;</a>

health and well-being boards, there is a view that they are welcome in
relation to the added position that they will bring to the governance
procedure but that, nevertheless, there is a need for a
strengthening of that governance procedure. That could be done in a
number of ways, particularly with regard to GP
commissioning.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000093">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a need to have a look at how GP commissioning has
evolved—whether it evolves on a sub-regional basis, and whether
there is coterminosity with local authorities or first-tier
authorities. I am a district councillor on Rushmoor borough
council—this is my 35th consecutive year—in what is a
very tough town, for those who know it from Aldershot. I have been a
senior member of Hampshire county council for 16 years as well, so I
know what it is like on a two-tier authority. I shall come to the
difficulties in a sub-regional area later. There is a need to have a
look at what we can do to strengthen those particular

that is what they are under the existing model and they will be even
more so under the future model—there is a need for openness,
transparency and democracy, and that democracy needs to be part of the

that Mr Cozens is aware that Richard Jones, the chair of the
Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, says that between
35% and 40% of hospital admissions into acute beds are
avoidable, and that, of that group, 70% stay longer than they need to.
It is, therefore, to the advantage of those who go into hospital but
need not, and to all of us as taxpayers, that there should be more
working together at social care and health care. Do you feel that there
is anything in particular in the Bill that may help the integration of
social and health care? If not, what else ought to be in

Local Government Association for adult social care and health. That
explains my credentials. On the previous point, which I think is linked
to this, the key phrase of the Bill is “have regard to”.
The commissioning plans of consortia need to have regard to
the joint strategies of the health and well-being boards. Of course,
“have regard to” can be placed on various extremes on a
continuum, from, “We’ve read it,” all the way
through to, “We’ve altered what we intended to do as a
result of it,” or, “We have been very actively part of
that.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000105">&#160;</a>

have an immediate short-term concern about integration. The proposals
to cluster PCTs must not disrupt the existing integrated arrangements,
where local authorities and PCTs are already working closely together.
The reason why most of those authorities and PCTs have come together is
that they recognise the point you make about the pathways across health
and social care. There is a short-term risk of dismantling in order to
deal with the need to have effective clusters of PCTs affecting the
future integration arrangements—so you are disintegrating in
order to reintegrate later.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000106">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is
enormous potential in the idea of the duty to co-operate in both an
assessment and a health and well-being strategy, to look at the pathway
of people across health and social care and to develop joint solutions
to the exact problems you described—the interdependency of
health and social care—provided that consortia co-operate on the
boundaries of the local authority where those services have a strong
pathway across into local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000107">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have particular concerns from a social care point of view about those
populations that do not naturally fall into a practice population.
There are also groups of services that require strong co-operation, not
just with social care but with other parts of the council—those
dealing with mental health or learning disabilities, for example. We
are also concerned about services for homelessness, HIV/AIDS, drugs and
alcohol, as well as things such as dementia and carers, where we would
argue that we need a whole population strategy, not just a practices
strategy.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000108">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
key issues is the effectiveness of the relationship between consortia
and health and well-being boards in shaping a more coherent approach.
We feel that the Bill is not specific enough about those sorts of
issues, and it is silent in a couple of particular areas that are
important for the integration of health and social care. One of those
areas is safeguarding, and the other is arrangements for free nursing
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000109">&#160;</a>

local authority and the consortia; the relationship is between the
consortia and the national commissioning board, and the mandating
arrangements and signing off the financial plans. As I
understand it, there is a shared responsibility on
consortia and councils to have regard to the strategy, and a duty on
both to consider how best to use flexibilities and pool budgets. That
is the limitation of the constraints.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000118">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Many of us in local government—as I
said, I have been in local government since 1976, at two levels, in one
form or another—have always looked on the relationship with
public health as something that local government should have been doing
during all that time. In fact, as most of you who have been in local
authorities will know, local authorities did cover that particular
role. So I think there is a manifest need for public health to come
back to where its real focus, of local need and priority, is
based.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000127">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The biggest
problem that we have with public health, of course, is that we are
still awaiting clarity as regards the detail. More important is the
relationship between public health in England, where we have had no
detail whatever as regards its functions, role, coverage and, more
importantly, the funding, because I think that some view has been
expressed that we are only talking about £4 billion going
possibly to local government or wherever. Some estimate that the amount
of money that may filter down directly to local government may be only
20% of that. We need to have that clarified.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000128">&#160;</a>

at the moment, we cannot look to moving our consideration

                           </em> One of the key issues is the disaggregation
of public health function—the different elements and where they
are going to go, as Councillor Roberts said. It is unclear how much the
joint relationship between the Secretary of State, Public Health
England and local government, in relation to health outcomes, needs to
be clarified. It remains uncertain.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000130">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What we
welcome and have very substantial evidence of is the contribution that
local government can make to the health of the public, which I think is
distinct from the public health functions, some of which are quite
technical and are best organised at a national level. Local government
invests considerably in those services, both directly and
indirectly.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000131">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One of our
early concerns, although it was somewhat assuaged, was that the public
health funding transfer and the responsibilities would be in some sort
of bubble within local government—that local government would
have less scope for influence than we would like in order to make the
broader connection to the other things that local government does. We
feel that the greatest impact will come when health and well-being
boards are able to demonstrate the wider health outcomes that they are
trying to achieve for the whole population, and their accountability
for that. We see considerable scope. As Councillor Roberts said, there
is potentially a “bricks without straw” problem. If the
transfer is very small—and, indeed, if it is partly taken up
with the commitment to fund health visitors, for example—there
could be very little other than the staff transfer to get our teeth
into.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000132">&#160;</a>

gets done. If that was to happen under the Bill, would you agree that,
to begin with, you would need the support of the GP consortia that

much stronger role for primary care in reconfigurations than is
currently the case. That is obviously not the same as local
government’s, but it is a very strong role. It is unclear about
the role of health and well-being boards in relation to reconfiguration
if that reconfiguration is sub-regional or
regional, in which case there will be multiple

argued and encouraged the pathfinders to think about flexing up and
down in terms of health and well-being boards, and where, for example,
a number of unitaries in a county are affected by a reconfiguration
proposal, to work together on that. The reforms are intended to create
a greater consensus about the case for change that involves local
government in those decisions, so it is less a question of presenting a
fait accompli to local government, scrutinising it and then the
scrutiny not liking it and referring it to the Secretary of State,
which is the worst-case scenario now.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000145">&#160;</a>

situations, the case for change can be debated much more transparently
through the health and well-being boards, with more people involved in
those situations. I think the tension for health and well-being boards

health service and seeing the case for a sub-regional centre or a
national pathway. Which is better for clinical outcomes? GPs explaining

wider issues which we cannot neglect, and I will try to expand on them.
There are particular reconfiguration issues in areas in
Hampshire—Salisbury, Andover, Chichester, Bournemouth, Havant
and so on—as well in my own area. We need to understand the
nature of the situation on the ground and the architecture. I forgot to
mention that we also have the Ministry of Defence involved, at one of
the biggest centres for health in the whole of Europe, in Aldershot.
There are some very difficult challenges in relation to sorting out the
architecture. At the moment, I have not seen that coming
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000148">&#160;</a>

of next year, local authorities will be responsible for local health
improvement and illness prevention, including health promotion. If my
memory serves me well, you said—and rightly so—that
public health was a matter for local authorities prior to 1974.
Sanitation, clean water supplies and environmental health are big
issues and housing is still an issue in terms of public health, I am
sure. But one of the major issues that threatens the public health of
the 21st century is lifestyle—what you eat, what you drink,
whether you take exercise, whether you drink too much alcohol or you
smoke. Do you think that local authorities are going to be comfortable
telling their population that they have got to take action around those
areas of
lifestyle?<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000159">&#160;</a>

think that doctors have very recently said that obesity is a big
problem. I have heard it said that if you weigh all the obese people in
the country, we are carrying around something like 4 million extra
tonnes. There are particular issues that need to be grasped. The best
way of dealing with that is surely from a local point of view, because
you know the people, you know your area and you are best set to engage
with them to try to get those

that they recognise that, for a lot of people who want to change their

that councils can do and have done to encourage exercise and better
lifestyles. In my experience as an officer, I have seen that one of the
strengths of the local councillor role is that they see how things join
up in a way that we sometimes do not when we have responsibilities for
different bits of service. Councillors and public health workers have
real alignments here. We certainly found that that was the case in our

Cozens:</strong>
                           </em> The architecture is novel and the duties are
not that different in some respects. I have been reflecting on this
recently, and I think the closest direct parallels are the joint
consultative committees and the joint care planning teams in the early
’80s, where after local government lost responsibility for all
sorts of NHS functions, there was a deliberate attempt to create a new
forum to bring together health and social care and to find common cause
and work on joint things. In those days, the issue was particularly the
closure of long-stay hospitals and the impact on local government of
changes to the health service and changes to the pattern of activity.
Joint consultative committees were statutory. There was a similar duty
on both parties to co-operate. There was a requirement to produce
plans, and there was joint finance to facilitate working together. My
summary would be that it created a strong bridge between one part of
the health service and local government, but not the health service as
a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is the opportunity in this legislation to bring all this together in
the health and well-being boards’ interest—the strategic
needs assessment—in a sense to give greater weight to those in
terms of shaping better health outcomes for the population but also
better services. There are 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 64<a class="bkMark" name="Column64">&#160;</a>
                           </div>quite a lot of incentives, if consortia choose to take them up, to
design new sorts of services that straddle health and social care,
building new services around primary care or in local government that
deal with the crisis that the NHS faces: an ageing population and too
much use of emergency health care. So the thing that binds consortia
and local government is the need to develop services outside hospitals,
because otherwise the whole system could well be unaffordable, and the
same situation faces social care, which has to work on early
intervention, re-ablement, prevention, different sorts of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000168">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
potential is there. What we are looking for that is different this time
is what the incentives are to co-operate in the difficult areas between
health and social care, rather than in the broader pattern of health
services for the population. We would be very disappointed if the
lessons already learnt from integrated services—in those places
where the local authority and the PCTs merged, there are care trusts,
or other sorts of arrangements—are forgotten and if those
arrangements are accidentally broken up in the creation of PCT
clusters. Building on the experience of the things they have been able
to do without this architecture, and the opportunities they now see
with the new architecture, gives us the best hope of understanding how
some of this might work to best
advantage.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000169">&#160;</a>

local government, because much of it is about the internal processes of
the NHS itself and the relationship between the regulatory system, the
inspection system and the role of monitoring in relation to foundation
trusts. There are a whole host of issues related to that. Councillor
Roberts may have his own view on this, but the one of the key tests of
this is the extent to which a concerned individual, picking up issues
about their own care or that of a relative, has immediate and
constructive access to the system through, initially, the advocacy role
that is proposed for local healthwatch, the rights of access and
challenge that local healthwatch has and the escalation of that into an
inquiry by the overview and scrutiny committee. In parallel to that, it
will depend on what the relationship is between local healthwatch, the
Care Quality Commission monitor, national HealthWatch and then,
ultimately, the national commissioning
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000171">&#160;</a>

me, one of the key issues is the escalation process for concerns. I
must say that this is not unique to the health service; the debate is
exactly the same for a self-funder in a residential nursing home, which
is social care-related. There are exactly parallel issues. The role of
the GP in this situation is also key. In the design of the
arrangements, as well as the constructive opportunities, the extent to
which there is safeguarding more broadly

			Column number: 66<a class="bkMark" name="Column66">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and that is particularly the reconcilability of greater competition and

highlighted two aspects of our concerns, and I wonder if you could
elucidate on those. The first is about where pieces of care pathways
are being commissioned under the new provisions by both the national

second is, essentially, about competition being kept out of the system,
because you think it will inhibit integration and cause problems in

Edwards:</strong>
                           </em> It is possible to create integrated systems
using competition, by having competition for the market at the time.
Asking people to come forward with bids to produce an integrated care
programme, for example, has to be done through some form of competitive
tender, and there are a variety of ways to do that. A problem has been
that the NHS has tended to have a purist approach to how it has handled
procurement. It has been a gold-plated approach—or perhaps I
should answer the question by putting it this way: it has either
completely ignored the competition rules, or it has taken a gold-plated
approach. There is a limit to what you can do in legislation. A lot of
this comes down to how people will behave, but there are mechanisms
through which competition can be used to create integrated systems. We
just have to make it clear to people that it is permissible to talk to
their potential suppliers, and for clinicians from different
organisations to talk to each other, which is common practice outside
the NHS. However, the new ways of behaving are such a big culture
change for people to get used to that they tend to rush to one
polarity, which is to believe that none of this is allowed.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000185">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
your first point, that is a difficulty. One could imagine a situation
in which a pathway involving a pharmacy, a general practice, and a
local acute hospital and its specialist service is commissioned by a
variety of different organisations. A way to do that—and indeed,
to get better integration—is to ask one organisation to take
delegated responsibility from others. We are back, again, to levels of
trust and how people behave in this system, which is not something that
one can necessarily legislate for.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000186">&#160;</a>

time frame, or choreography, of all these very complicated changes. In
your evidence, you seemed to suggest that perhaps there ought to be

ground. Do you think the Government are being hasty and that the

the argument, or the analogy, rather, is that once the trains had
started rolling in the first world war, it was too late to stop. It is
not the happiest analogy, but this will not be over by
Christmas—that is for sure. We are at a point where going
slower, even if you wanted to, is probably not an option. However, a
large set of new behaviours, techniques, ways of thinking and ways of
behaving will need to be developed. As is being done

competition, particularly, is an area where caution is necessary
because, as Clare Gerada said in a previous session, it is very
difficult to measure outcomes. There is massive overestimation of how
easy it is to measure outcomes reliably in health care. We cannot even
agree on a methodology for measuring hospital standardised death rates,
and you would have thought whether a patient is dead or alive is one of
the easier outcomes to estimate. There are problems here, because even
in areas where it is easy to measure quality, if you add price
competition there is the prospect of cross-subsidisation from the areas
where you cannot. That would be an area where one would probably want
to take it in a more measured way and build in a lot of evaluation and
opportunities for learning while you do it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000189">&#160;</a>

service, which is commissioned by some 30 PCTs, it provides a range of
different home care. One of the bits of ambulance services that is
extremely important going forward is their ability to use emergency
care practitioners to care directly for people in their own home, to
run out-of-hours services or to be add-ons to the wider emergency care
system. London ambulance service provides different bespoke service to
different PCTs in London. Obviously, there are transaction costs for
doing that, but I see no reason why there should not be the ability to
customise services.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000197">&#160;</a>

for blue light services and the like, which we assume they must, one
runs into the difficulty that, at the moment, the ambulance services
bill people on historic business, as it were—I hate to use that
word. There will be no historic business for GP consortia, because they
will exist in different frames and different time scales. The ambulance
services currently bill by postcode, rather than by doctor, do they
not?<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a general point about moving to a system in which you pay providers
to a tariff. It is fair to say that we are some way off having a good
enough tariff for ambulance services, community services and most
mental health services to be able to make our competitive market system
operate with sufficient delicacy and power to produce the results that
we want. If you particularly want to move from the ambulance provision
model of picking people up from off the street and taking them to
hospital to something that looks more like a modern ambulance service
and is better able to care for people in different ways, you need to
develop clever pricing systems. One of the observations I would make is
that, historically, the Department of Health, when compared with other
health care systems that operate such tariffs, has woefully
underinvested in people who do such work. By factors of many multiples
of 10, it has far too few people. So, when you start new services, how
you pay for them is often a problem. Ambulance services are just one
example of where that is going to be an
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000201">&#160;</a>

                           </em> One of the interesting paradoxes in the
White Paper is the proposal to put patients at the centre and to
empower them while giving the power to GPs. It carries an implicit
assumption that there is not a principal agent problem, as health
economists call it. In other words, that there is an alignment between
the interests of the GP and the interests of the patient, which is not
necessarily the case for good and legitimate reasons. There is also an
issue which is that the sum of lots of individual patient consultations
does not constitute a population health view. There is a load of rather
clever economics that I do not understand, but basically, you cannot
sum lots of individual preferences and determine a societal or global
preference for population. You need other tools and they are
classically held by epidemiologists and public health doctors. There is
a need to bring that in. In terms of the patient voice in this, I tend
to concur with the views that were expressed

                           </em> One element of these reforms that has not
received a huge amount of attention, but is enormously powerful and
influential, is the role played by Monitor, both in terms of price
setting and of market studies and other decisions that it makes that
have the potential to shape local systems. There is an issue there.
Secondly, we recognise that some steps have been taken to deal with
this, but the embedding of the national HealthWatch in CQC raises some
interesting issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Anecdotally,
and this requires some further research, GPs themselves have not
generally recognised the need for additional patient representation in
the types of mechanisms that they have set up. Some of the better
pathfinder consortia seem to be doing that but there is a sort of gap
there. There is no direct patient representation on the decision-making
bodies of the consortia. They have a requirement to have an annual
general meeting and produce a report, but beyond that—it is very
complex keeping all of these hundreds of pages in your mind—I do
not think they have any other obligations to meet in public or to be
otherwise visible. So that would be a small selection of some of the
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of configuration, I have listened to the conversation here and it
is worth pointing out that there has been a presumption that
reconfiguration will be commissioner driven. You may want to think
about that. First, there is a sort of implication in the White Paper
and the Bill that a lot of GP commissioning is lots of individual
decisions, which may not drive configuration choices. At some point
someone needs to take planning decisions. For things like cancer
services, vascular surgery and trauma, they either need to get together
into large groups to make those decisions, or you may find, because of
some of the drivers of decision making on configuration are to do with
work force Royal College accreditation, that increasingly providers
make decisions about change.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Here is an
interesting point. If the services are not designated, my reading of
this is that the current regulations on consultation apply. So if I am
the chief executive of a hospital and I want to close the maternity
unit at one of my sites because I feel it is unsafe, first I might just
close it because I have emergency powers. If it is not a designated
service I can just close it. I then have to go through the normal
statutory consultation and I am not under any particular obligation to
involve anyone in making that decision up to that point. I would just
say that a lot of commissioner-driven reconfiguration over the last few
years has done an awful lot of work in involving the patients and GPs.
Some of the conversation here suggested that that was not the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000208">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
you are creating a highly dynamic, regulated market that depends for
its dynamism on the mechanism of creative destruction and exit and
entry into the market, then one of the corollaries is that agile
providers need to be agile. They will leave if they need to. So you may
need to think about the possible implications of
that.

                           </div>Of course, a level playing field in this would mean that anyone who
wants to leave, whether NHS provider or independent provider, should
leave. The patient voice in that may be very limited. I make no

ambulance service network of the NHS Confederation for a couple of
years before I became a Member of Parliament. You have already said
that you think some of the accountability on the commissioning side is
very weak, because the consortia only have to produce an annual report,
they are not required to meet in public and they do not have to have
members of the public or patients on their boards. I wanted to talk
about the accountability on the provider side, as it is something that
we discussed with David Nicholson this morning, and it is an issue that
I know the hon. Member for Stafford is very interested in.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000210">&#160;</a>

has led up to it, is that it is based on the not unreasonable
presumption that if you remove the net underneath someone who is
walking the tightrope, their tightrope-walking will improve. The idea
is that increased autonomy and the removal of some of those mechanisms
will concentrate the mind and improve the quality of governance. If I

is: who is holding the ring on quality and safety and performance? My
reading is that there is a minimum standards regulator. The lesson of
mid-Staffordshire, of Buckinghamshire hospitals and previous problems,
is that the only custodian of quality has to be the professionals at
the front line and the board of the organisation. Regulation can only
ever be a backstop. Inspection-based regulation, particularly, for a
whole number of reasons, is periodic. You can teach to the test if you
are being inspected, and you have to have the good fortune to visit the
one or two wards where there is a very serious problem. You cannot
fully rely on regulation. We are left with the board, which then raises
the question of the competence of governors. Looking internationally at
similar types of models, there are risks involved in that. There is a
deliberate trade-off; there is no right answer. You are saying that we
think that continued oversight—and the confusing lines that that
creates in the current system—has to some extent removed
responsibility and reduced people’s willingness to step up and
take

interests of that entity. What do you think that

There is a responsibility to manage an organisation properly

a balancing act between the requirements of different stakeholders. I

fabric of the NHS. We are removing from the NHS the very structures
that make it a cohesive, comprehensive service, based on solidarity. I
think that the legislation will introduce greater litigation,
particularly from private contractors, two-tierism in standards of care
and access

                           </div>to care, and opportunities in the long term for other systems of
payment, such as top-up or insurance-based payments. Eventually, I
think that we will see a rump service delivered by the public sector,
and the private sector entering at a greater pace and introducing
competition, which will introduce insecurities in the services being
provided. I think that we will also see greater weaknesses around
competition and contestability, GPs contracting out the commissioning
services to private contractors and, increasingly, the inadequacies of
that system in terms of knowing what the needs of local communities
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000228">&#160;</a>

trade union. In response to your question, I think that Karen has made
a very good opening. The reality is that all the workers have worked so
hard to build the NHS up into what it is today, which is something to
be really proud of, and my concern is that the risk attached to the
Bill is that a lot of the NHS workers unfortunately will get
sidetracked in terms of what will happen to their jobs, when what they
have been doing fantastically is caring for the patients. That is one
of the biggest risks that I feel is attached to the Bill. In the short
term, in terms of how we can engage in ensuring that the concerns are
raised effectively, that has been quite tight in most cases, since the
Bill was launched. For us, the risk is that we might lose a lot of NHS
workers, because they are not quite sure what is going to happen to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000231">&#160;</a>

specialist for Unite, which represents 100,000 health sector workers. I
echo the comments that both other witnesses have made. We feel that
there are risks to the quality, range and cohesion of services. The
Bill certainly puts at risk the terms and conditions that we need to
retain good staff to deliver health care out in the community and on
the ground. We believe that, ultimately, it will also lead to higher
costs, more bureaucracy, and public assets in private hands, and that
in turn means that there is a risk to democracy itself in the running
of the national health service. I would add that I believe that it will
lead to large-scale closure of services, but in terms of the
Government’s policy, that will be taken as a sign not of failure
or risk, but of success—a sign that the medicine, if you like,
is
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000232">&#160;</a>

issues at all the different levels at which the Bill works. There are
issues about whether consortiums will have lay or elected
representation, how accountable they will be, and whether transparency
and the application

			Column number: 73<a class="bkMark" name="Column73">&#160;</a>

than just members and employees of consortiums. There are also issues
around the involvement of local government. There is no guarantee of
trade union representation, and only one elected councillor is
guaranteed on the boards that are being created, but, ultimately, there
is also the issue of how the Government envisage the free market
working. They are quite clear that it means that you cannot have
democratic pressure over local health services. They made it absolutely
clear throughout the impact assessments that if you let democracy
intervene in the market, the market cannot deliver the benefits that
they anticipate from everything else that is in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000234">&#160;</a>

partnership forum, have all agreed that we need to look at productivity
and improving efficiency. The circumstances that we are in at the
moment are that there will have to be £20 billion of savings
made because of the budget that was given to the NHS; in other words,
it is not keeping pace with inflation. On that basis, there will have
to be cuts in the

Government believe that there are too many managers in the

therefore are committed to a 45% cut in managers. They have also been
very disparaging about the role of managers. Over-bureaucratic,
over-inflated, inefficient, very weak on commissioning—the
literature is littered with negative stereotyping of managers. What I
would say to you is that there is potentially scope for reconfiguring
and slimming down, but what is happening at the moment is a very
unpleasant and deeply offensive process. It is going over the top, in
terms of the amount of cuts that need to take

You are now in the position of defending a massive increase in
bureaucracy in the primary care trusts, for example, yet you do not
think that there is room to make cuts there, or that you should
actually welcome the cuts, however painful they may be, as a way of
reducing the imbalance and over-management. Is that correct? You are

consortia that will themselves proliferate management costs, because
the market brings with it a bureaucracy. We do not know yet what that
will look like, but I suggest to you that this exercise is unnecessary

particularly those in strategic health authorities and PCTs, feel
extremely vulnerable at the moment, because there is very little detail
on what the function and form of the new set-up will be. In other
words, if you have valuable staff, you have no way of knowing whether
you will be able to transfer across under the TUPE regulations, because
the new system is so ill-defined, and staff therefore feel extremely
insecure.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000258">&#160;</a>

GMB’s experience, as a general union, of where workers have been
outsourced to different providers. In our experience, there has always
been a race to the bottom. Although under TUPE regulations terms and
conditions are protected, that is only for a foreseeable amount of
time. In our experience, the new provider tends to issue a notification
and start reducing terms and conditions. Unfortunately, we have not had
many experiences where our members have been transferred to another

question of what happens to NHS organisations that fail and get taken

precious little detail about the future education and training of

is a real worry about the projection of what the future staffing

area to grapple with, and it has been thrown up in the air. In itself,
that will create huge difficulties for the future training of doctors,

where the future work force is at risk, particularly with the
demographics. The average health worker is something like 45 to 50
years of age. If we are not looking at future work force planning, we

                           </em> I would love to answer that
question—perhaps we can all come in on it. If you look at where
the NHS was in 1997, it was on its knees. Major shortages of staff
required us to recruit internationally in a profound way. We were at
the bottom of the European measurements, in terms of our outcomes. We
implemented, during that decade, an equal pay system for 1.4 million
staff. It was the most momentous piece of work; it ended pay
discrimination against the majority of the work force, who were women.
That also included a framework for education and training. It was
recognised that the human resource element of the NHS is about
education and training, and about modernising the work force.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000266">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Health is a
service that is continuously modernising, with new technology and new
pharmacology, and you have to take your staff with you. In the last
decade or so, that was recognised and the investment was put in. There
has been a huge amount of negative stereotyping about where we are, in
terms of the European average. We have one of the best primary health
care services in the world. Our health care on cancer, our coronary
care and a whole range of care has come up from being well down in the
league to well up in the league. You have to look at where you start
from. It is a remarkable service working in a collective way. The World
Health Organisation said that the NHS was best placed to fight a flu
pandemic. I do not think that it could say that this time round,
because it was not in anyone’s mind last winter. We have an

what is happening now. Around the country, primary care trust senior
managers are walking out the door, sometimes with
six-figure redundancy payments, and then the following week, they are
walking straight back in through the door of the new GP consortia, with
a similar amount as a golden hello. I think hundreds of millions of
pounds will end up being spent that will not go on front-line care. It
was completely needless, not only in terms of the change, but in terms
of how it was done. For me, the question is not so much what happened

opinion than mine: that of Professor Ian Kirkpatrick of the Leeds

pointed out that the total administrative and management staff of the
NHS in 2009 were 13%, yet in the average business in the UK, the figure
is 16%. The total, therefore, is somewhat lower. He also points out
that the overall administrative costs in the NHS as a proportion of the
total is, at 5%, around the lowest in the developed world.

issues, perhaps you can elaborate on those for the benefit of the

                           </div>relation to public assets coming into private hands, a failure regime is
envisaged in the Bill—this is for a foundation NHS trust. Could
you say a little bit about the asset lock and tell us what the
consequences will be, as set out in the Bill, of lifting the private
income cap for NHS foundation trusts? If you have time, could you also
say a little bit about corporate subsidies—that  is in
paragraph 55 of the comprehensive spending assessment—in
relation to private sector providers being 14% more expensive than
in-house NHS
services?<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000279">&#160;</a>

Parrott:</strong>
                           </em> First, on the public assets, there are quite
a few potential mechanisms in the Bill whereby assets that are
currently publicly owned may end up in private hands. I have already
mentioned the provision in the schedules for the Secretary of State to
simply transfer the existing assets of primary care trusts and
strategic health authorities to any provider of NHS services, as well
as to the consortia.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is one
matter. The other is that the Bill is extremely light on what kind of
corporate form the consortia themselves might take. Some of them are
already forming as limited companies, so that they would literally be a
limited company themselves and, by definition, all the assets they take
over will be in private hands. In the secondary sector, you also have
to look at the removal of the asset lock that was originally in the
legislation under which Labour created foundation hospitals. In that
legislation, certain property would be designated as necessary for the
provision of health care for the public good. That could not then be
sold for the commercial ends of the foundation trust without approval
from the regulator on the grounds of health rather than economics. The
Bill will remove that provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is also
the potential for them to borrow using public assets as collateral.
That comes back to the point you raised about the failure regime. There
are two possibilities for a foundation trust and its services.
They—or the commissioners of that service—may apply for
what is called designation. That means that the regulator will
determine whether those services are completely essential to maintain
health care in the area. The impact assessments suggest that that would
be quite a strict test. Particularly in large urban areas, they
certainly do not seem to envisage that every A and E and maternity unit
hospital will be designated. At any rate, although there can be some
public input on the decision on whether to apply for designation, the
decision on whether the service will be designated has to be taken by
the unelected regulator, who does not have a mandate to be concerned
with the kind of issues that your constituents might be.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000282">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If they are
not designated, it is pretty simple. The normal provisions of
insolvency law will apply, so they simply go bust and the creditors
take over the assets. If they are designated, a special health
administrator will be appointed. The impact assessments suggest that
that will not be a health professional; it will be a qualified finance
professional. They will have a duty either to find another trust that
is willing to take it over—of course, if the trust has failed
the first time around, other trusts may be somewhat unlikely to take on
a potentially difficult service—or they may ultimately try to
rescue the service. Obviously that seems to imply that the
administrator will be able to turn around a service  in double
quick time, when the original governance  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 79<a class="bkMark" name="Column79">&#160;</a>
                           </div>arrangements were not able to do so. If none of those things happen,
they simply tender on the open market and a private provider may take
over.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000283">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On reading
the Bill, I am still slightly unclear about what happens to the
ownership of the assets—the physical hospital. At the moment,
the legal position seems to be that a foundation hospital is owned by
its members—the staff, the patients and the
public. If they have, by definition, failed, it
seems that the ownership of that hospital would be in the hands of
whatever private provider won the competitive tender to take it over.
So you may find your local hospital is being run by BUPA or Serco, or
whatever. There is a variety of different ways in which public assets
may end up in private hands, but that was certainly never the intention
of Labour’s legislation. Even now, the Social Enterprise
Coalition is particularly concerned about this because, where there is
a community interest company or some other kind of social enterprise,
that is not allowed to happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000284">&#160;</a>

points.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000285">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">You raised a
point about higher costs in relation to distortions, where the public
sector is favoured. In other words, out of every £100 the
private sector has to pay an additional £14 because of pension
costs and so on and so forth. We talked about bureaucracy earlier, and
this is an example of where the private sector is going to tie us up in
all sorts of litigation; it is quite clear that if there is not a level
playing field it is going to sue our arms off. It is going to cost us a
lot of money in terms  of lawyers and court hearings, and
goodness knows what else.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000286">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I suggest
that the private sector will be looking for distortions, and it will be
suggesting that staffing costs such as pensions are creating those
distortions. However, they will not be looking at the distortions on
the other side—for example, the cost of educating and training
staff, which the public sector does at the moment. There are all sorts
of ways of evening out that playing field.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000287">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The other
issue that you asked about was the private patient cap, and I would
like to give some evidence on that. Unison has long campaigned on that.
When the foundation trust was first introduced we tried to prevent it,
and we were very concerned about the patient income cap because there
is no transparency of accounting, and certainly no level playing field.
The public service has to have open books, but in the private sector
accounting is secretive. Its business interests are over and above the
public interest. So within one trust, you have two separate forms of
accounting.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We would be
at pains to make sure that the cap was not lifted; we would be very
concerned, where there were tight constraints in the public sector,
that trusts would need to continue to generate private income to keep
going and would therefore invest in the private sector. Certainly, in
all the foundation trust hospitals that have a private patient income
cap, all the services that have been invested in have been private, and
not returned to the public sector. At the very minimum, we would want
to see open, transparent and separate accounts for those two separate
entities within the trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am very
concerned about failure regime. Last year, or was it the year before
last, the Labour Government introduced legislation that enabled
foundation trusts to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 80<a class="bkMark" name="Column80">&#160;</a>
                           </div>come back into the public sector, were they to fail. This Government
want to repeal that. That is deeply unfortunate, because what will
happen to a local community when a foundation trust fails? We need the
safety net that was spoken about earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000290">&#160;</a>

goes bankrupt—the Bill says that the usual insolvency
legislation will apply—that trust is then moved to the private
sector. Certainly my experience is that when  the insolvency
agents come in, it is a case of paying off the various creditors. When
you look at the stress of getting that sorted, what happens to the
patients? What happens to patient care? You will have a trust going to
the private sector—or whoever is going to buy it; there would
have to be that kind of discussion—but my concern is what
happens to our members who deliver that service? I can give you
numerous examples where the administrators have gone in and we are not
quite sure what will happen tomorrow. In the NHS, that is almost a
suicidal way of doing things, because at the end of the day people
still need looking after. How do you do that? Perhaps the scrutiny
Committee can look at the introduction of insolvency and what that
might mean to the NHS in the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000291">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Well, I know who did not win it. I have a question
for Miss Jennings. Miss Jennings, you said that there is “scope
for reconfiguring/slimming down”. In my area of Winchester, the
Royal Hampshire County hospital—the Winchester and Eastleigh NHS
Healthcare Trust—is merging with the Basingstoke  and
North Hampshire Foundation Trust to create a new foundation trust,
which will serve north Eastleigh, Winchester and the
Andover-Basingstoke area. In our area, Unison is being remarkably
sensible and helpful, and understanding of the fact that to safeguard
the jobs

necessary, to put that hospital on a sustainable long-term
footing.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
reconfiguration that has the support of  the local MP, and I
think it will have the support of the people whom I represent, and the
support of the people in the other constituencies nearby. Is that a
good thing or a bad thing? I ask because if that reconfiguration does
not happen, Winchester’s hospital will undoubtedly close and
then everybody at the hospital will lose their jobs—the people
you represent. So is that reconfiguration —that slimming
down—a good thing or a bad thing?<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000299">&#160;</a>

to reconfigurations, the NHS is an organic body that changes and
reconfigures. I do not know the particular circumstances that you
mentioned, but I know that we have remarkable structures in place:
national social partnership forums; regional social partnership forums,

have a respect for each other’s side, they come together and
they look for solutions to issues, problems and reconfiguring. We have

not want to see the public service ethos of the NHS diminished. Do you
fear that that will be a by-product of moving to a more disaggregated
system and in particular a system where terms and conditions for the
staff, who are the guardians of that public service ethos, are being
radically changed? Will staff feel any longer that they are part of a

the ethos of the NHS changing in the not-very-distant future. I think
that currently the staff are immensely proud of being part of the NHS.
They have made the NHS and that ethos—they and the patients, who
appreciate what they do. National bargaining is all part of that,
because the equal pay system is about ensuring that there is fairness
across the public service—fairness where it is hard to recruit
and fairness where there is a glut of staff. The NHS is about a
collective and the big fear is that this market, which will enhance the
European directive on marketisation, will enable more and more private
sector companies to come in, greater diversity and a greater threat to
any sense of collectivism.<a class="bkMark" name="11020881000315">&#160;</a>
