								Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): This morning we
discussed whether there is a hidden and perhaps unrecognised demand for
parish councils in London. I maintain that there is no evidence of
that: there has been nothing on it from any of the representative
bodies, nor from any of the major academic commentators such as Tony
Travers, nor from the representatives of London&#146;s civic,
residents and amenities societies. None of them has suggested that
there is a hidden demand that is not being picked up on.</div>
					<a name="07022262000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question is not just one of
demand&#151;there are also some practical issues on how parish
councils will work in a city where there is no tradition of them. The
report of the Commission on London Governance drew attention to
concerns that are not unique to the Opposition: how parish councils
will interface in practice with ward councillors and with existing
devolved structures in London, and how duplication and confusion of
roles can be
avoided.</div>
					<a name="07022262000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer to
the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate. I
recognise that, particularly in London, there are still villages and
communities that have strong senses of identity. I know that as well as
anyone, because my own constituency is full of such
communities&#151;Hayes, Bickley, Chislehurst and so on. The borough
of Bromley as a whole is like that too&#151;there are some 80
residents associations in the borough, all of which are active and
which push for their area. But they work satisfactorily in co-operation
with their ward councillors, and not one has ever said that there was a
need for a parish council to advance its
interests.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07022262000470"></a>
							<b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman is saying that
the power to opt for creation of parish councils in urban areas should
not apply to London, because there is no experience of such councils in
recent decades. However, that logic applies to all urban areas that
have not had any such recent tradition. Logically, his position should
not be restricted to London but should apply to all urban areas, which
would deny people everywhere the power to opt in. Why does not the hon.
Gentleman push that logic?</div>

								Robert
Neill:
						</b> With respect, the hon. Gentleman puts it the wrong
way round. The status quo is that London is in a different situation
from the rest of the country. The Government are proposing to change
it, but I am old-fashioned enough to think that the onus is always on
those who propose to change the status quo to show a good and
compelling reason for change. There is no evidence of such a
reason.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07022262000472"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): It occurs to me
that if the Government&#146;s intentions are fulfilled, empowerment
may increase and flourish as a result of the Bill, in which case there
would not necessarily be a need for parish
councils.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000473"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I think and hope that my hon. Friendis
right. I am much in favour of neighbourhood empowerment. London
boroughs, in different ways to suit their own circumstances, have done
a great deal to produce empowerment at the sub-borough level, to use an
ugly but convenient phrase. We should do more to encourage
that.</div>
					<a name="07022262000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I have always
been a strong advocate of ward councillors being given an enhanced role
as champions of their communities. That was said by the Government to
be explicit in the settlement of the Local Government Act 2000, when
executives were created. The idea was that ward councillors were to be
champions, and to fight for their communities. I would prefer more to
be done to enhance that concept, with more powers for ward councillors
to fulfil that role, which would enable them to fight for particular
community concerns without the need to create an additional tier of
bureaucracy. Unless it is carefully handled, the creation of parishes
might create duplication and confusion as to the roles of the parish
and of parish councillors compared with the role of ward councillors,
particularly in London, where the communities that we are discussing
are often not geographically discrete, in disparate areas, but overlap
and are dense and highly urbanised, with a mobile and diverse
population.</div>
					<a name="07022262000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Some
local authorities give a devolved budget to their ward councillors to
spend in their ward in the public realm, or on other works. That is
true in my wife&#146;s ward outside London, and it is a good idea. It
empowers people who have a legitimate, democratic electoral mandate.
Schemes run through various types of area committee and forum can also
work well and I do not rule out that. London boroughs are doing a range
of things. For example, Newham has an influential councillor scheme.
There is a raft of mechanisms for dealing with the issues that my hon.
Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate legitimately and properly
raised, without the need for the creation of parishes. Such legitimate
demand as there is for engagement can be met by other means, without
legislative change.</div>
					<a name="07022262000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">That leads us to some of the
specific concerns raised by London Councils, which has not been
entirely negative. It commissioned Alan Pike to write a useful
discussion paper, &#147;London: any place for parish
councils?&#148;, which is appended to its submissions to the
Committee, I believe. The paper sets out the fact that there are
arguments for greater community engagement and that in some parts of
the country parishes work well, which is something I do not dispute.
However, the paper also sets out in some considerable
detail&#151;more than we have time for today&#151;the way in which
London 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 332</div>boroughs, in disparate ways to suit their own needs, fulfil much the
same roles without the need further legislative provisions.</div>
					<a name="07022262000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The majority of boroughs have
some form of area, neighbourhood, or community council structure, and
many have been commended for it. Waltham Forest has a community
champion in its cabinet for each of its areas. In addition, Kingston
upon Thames, a place known to Liberal Democrat Members, has a
long-established neighbourhood structure. Havering, which was mentioned
earlier, has worked for some time with a series of area committees. The
point is that things can be done by other routes, without the need for
the legislative change.</div>
					<a name="07022262000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The matter is
summed up, it seems to me, in the Government&#146;s discussion
document titled, &#147;Citizen Engagement and Public Services: Why
Neighbourhoods Matter&#148;. It states:</div>
					<a name="07022262000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It should be
democratically elected local councillors who are advocates for their
communities and represent the views of the public about the services
they receive. Clearly giving councillors this role of neighbourhood
leadership should strengthen local
democracy.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022262000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
absolutely right, and I take it on board. The Commission on London
Governance also took it on board very strongly when creating its
report, which advocated the enhancement of the local champion role of
the councillor. It is about enhancing the mandate of the existing ward
councillor. I would rather have that than run the risk of the confusion
that a parish-based system might
create.</div>
					<a name="07022262000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Citizen
Engagement and Public Services: Why Neighbourhoods Matter&#148;
observes and acknowledges
that</div>
					<a name="07022262000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unduly extensive
devolution to the most local level is unlikely to be effective or
efficient&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07022262000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
useful phrase. The two passages that I have quoted, put together,
provide a sensible warning. Mr. Pike&#146;s consultation
document states
that</div>
					<a name="07022262000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this is an area
where the Government has recognised the need for a cautious
approach.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022262000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are urging
the Government to be more cautious in the absence of compelling
evidence of demand.</div>
					<a name="07022262000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final observation is that
London Councils has flagged up some specific practical matters relating
to how parishes might work in London, as well as other broad concerns.
What if parishes, which might cover large estates, want to take on
service delivery powers? How could that be set against a local
authority&#146;s existing arrangements? Apparently, parishes will
have the power to raise a precept. What are the costs likely to be?
What capital and revenue estimates have been made regarding setting up
and administering parish councils? How would we deal with a situation
in which a neighbourhood area that might be logical for a parish does
not conform to the boundaries of wards, area committees, or local area
agreements? How could all of those things be put together? There ought
to be greater clarity on those matters before we proceed.</div>
					<a name="07022262000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a nutshell, our contention
is that the case has manifestly not been made. The onus rests upon
those who propose change. We hope to amend the Bill so that we do not
create an unnecessary, if well-intentioned, disturbance to the
governance structures of London boroughs.</div>

							<b class="B">Andrew
Stunell</b> (Hazel Grove) (LD): I listened carefully to what
the hon. Gentleman said. In his own words, superficially it sounded of
interest. It must be right to give local government and communities
all the available, feasible options. Given our view of the
matter, it follows that we shall not support the amendment. Options are
good, prescription is bad. If Conservative Members used that as their
guiding light when considering the Bill, they would see that the
amendment does not conform to that approach.</div>
					<a name="07022262000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Gentleman said that there are places in London with neighbourhood
councils, residents associations, area committees and community
associations, as though we do not have such things outside London. We
do, and we also have the option of parish councils. He is right that
the vast majority of parish councils are in rural areas, or at least in
areas that were rural when the councils were established; however, many
are not. Reference has been made to the largest parish council in
England, in Weston-super-Mare, which is quite definitely not in a rural
area, and there are other substantial urban parish councils.</div>
					<a name="07022262000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to suggest that
many substantial parish councils will be set up in London; on the
contrary, I suspect that many of them will be small&#151;probably
smaller than wards. I would like to draw the Committee&#146;s
attention to the only parish council in Stockport, which was created as
a result of the Local Government Act 2000. It was one of the urban
parishes that the Deputy Prime Minister, who was then running the
Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, was keen to see established, and
was it petitioned for by local residents on a housing estate. It
comprises about a third of one ward, out of 21 wards in Stockport
borough. It is in my constituency and is now the parish council of
Offerton Park. The Secretary of State saw fit to grant permission for
it to be set up and it is now approaching its next round of
elections.</div>
					<a name="07022262000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is right in one regard: parish councils can be an irritant in
the system. Those people in the room who have parish councils are
nodding and smiling, because they know that that is true, but that does
not make the parish council a bad
institution.</div>

							<b class="B">Alistair

helpful to refer to my parish councils as the grit in the oyster,
rather than an irritant. I think that that conveys the impression that

					<a name="07022262000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">My predecessor as Liberal
Democrat spokesman tabled amendments to the Bill that became the Local
Government Act 2000 to permit the creation of parishes. The relevant
Minister said in Committee that our amendment was defective in about 19
different ways, but when it came to the House of Lords, the Government
introduced proposals to allow urban parishes, which we were pleased to
see. We also tabled amendments to introduce parishing in London, but
unfortunately the Minister of the day did not see fit to extend the
parish proposals to London. Naturally, I am pleased that seven years
later, such a provision is coming forward.</div>

got there. That is fine&#151;it is good to
see.</div>
					<a name="07022262000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">To ensure that
there is maximum choice for local democracy, and because we thought of
it first, we strongly support the clause. We believe that the
Government have got it right and that it is appropriate for it to be
taken forward. I say to the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst
that turkeys do not vote for Christmas and boroughs do not vote for
parishes. They know that they are inconvenient and troublesome, which
is why it is right that there should be the requirement of a review and
the possibility of communities putting proposals to their boroughs for
serious consideration rather than having to rely on the initiative and
good will of local councils seeing fit to develop parishes. The
provisions of the clause are substantially
right.</div>
					<a name="07022262000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
wish to finish by saying something about the size and scale of
communities. The definition of a community tends to depend on who is
giving it. MPs tend to believe that a constituency is a community.
Councillors tend to believe that a ward is a community and leaders of
councils tend to think that council areas are communities. The
real-life situation is that communities are much smaller than that. In
the ward in which I live I can recognise four or five separate
communities, although it appears to the outsider to be a continuous
carpet of suburban development. There are different communities with
different understandings of their position. I hope that when we
consider parish proposals in the future we will recognise that and not
make parishes fit a straitjacket of existing administrative boundaries
simply because that is how people in the town hall or we in Parliament
see the boundaries. That ability to tailor the lowest level of
democratic representation to real communities is the valuable addition
made by the clause.</div>
					<a name="07022262000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst presses the amendment we
shall vote against it. I hope that the Government will stand firm and
continue with this sensible
provision.</div>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Angela E. Smith):
						</b> I have enjoyed the
wide-ranging discussion on the amendment. I always enjoy contributions
from the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, if only because he
mentions Essex several times, not Bedfordshire, which gives us a
balance in the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07022262000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s arguments interesting. London is the only part
of the country that does not have parishes and parish councils.
Communities anywhere else in England have the opportunity, if they so
wish, to create a parish council in appropriate circumstances. There is
an anomaly, and I cannot see any reason for it to continue. I listened
carefully to his arguments, and he said that London is different as it
has no recent history of parishes. He was sort of saying, &#147;Well,
if you haven&#146;t had this in the past, you can&#146;t have it in
the future,&#148; but history and tradition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 335</div>have to have a starting point. He said that the character of London is
different as it does not have parish councils. I wonder why he seeks to
deny the residents of Badgers Mount or Pratts Bottom, in his
constituency, the opportunity to have their own parish
councils.</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> I thought that the champagne moment was the talk
about oysters, but as the hon. Gentleman seems to be in the chair, as
we say in Essex, we look forward to the end of the Committee when he
will be buying the
champagne.</div>
					<a name="07022262000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">There does
seem to be an anomaly, and we see no reason why it should continue. It
is only fair that Londoners should have the same right as anyone in the
rest of the country to be represented by a parish council. We are not
trying to impose this; the Government are not saying, &#147;You must
have a parish council in your area.&#148; We are opening up choice to
a community. Parish councils would be established in London only if
there were wide-ranging support and local people genuinely wanted them.
There would be the same opportunity in London as elsewhere to style a
council and better reflect the urban area of a
&#147;community&#148; or a &#147;neighbourhood&#148;. It would
up to the area to do so. Experience in other parts of the UK does not
give credibility to the argument that urban areas do not suit parish
councils, or somehow cannot have parish councils. Councils can give a
stronger voice to communities, helping to shape public services, and in
some cases, to deliver public services in the areas in which they
live.</div>
					<a name="07022262000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
issues genuinely raised by hon. Members during the debate&#151;the
debate has been ongoing, and it arose during the evidence sessions as
well&#151;was the possibility of extremists or other groups using a
parish council to isolate a community in an attempt to further their
cause. The assurances that I have given so far to the Committee on the
guidance to ensure that community cohesion should be taken into account
should satisfy hon. Members on that point.</div>
					<a name="07022262000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There are
parish councils in other urban areas of the country, for example, New
Frankley in Birmingham, and Blakelaw and North Fenham in
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. There is a commonality of issues for people who
live in urban areas, just as there is for people who live in rural
areas, who say that they would want to be represented by a parish
council. We must also be sure that the opportunity is there for the
principal council to refuse a permission for a parish council if it
thinks that that is in the interests of the community&#151;that a
parish council would be damaging to community relations or community
cohesion. If there are arrangements in a local area, such as community
forums or neighbourhood committees, that the council feels give an
adequate voice to those in the area, it might take that into account in
deciding whether to grant or refuse permission for a parish 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 336</div>council. It must clearly be a decision for the principal council to
take, not for the Secretary of State as is the case now.</div>
					<a name="07022262000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We must
ensure that parish councils do not become destabilising influences
within the community. Under the requirements of the Bill, councils must
have regard to the identities and interests of communities in their
area. We will issue the statutory guidance that I mentioned, which
includes the need for councils to have regard to community cohesion
when making a decision about creating a parish. I cannot, however, give
a guarantee to the Committee or anybody else that an election to any
official body would not result in the election of councillors who hold
extreme or unpleasant views, or that they could not form a majority on
a parish council. All of us on the Committee recognise that we cannot
dictate the outcome of elections, much as many of us would like to in
our constituencies.</div>
					<a name="07022262000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Councillor Kemp of the Local
Government Association made comments in the evidence session with which
most people would agree. He said that if there were a rise in extremism
at parish council level, that would be as much the fault of the
political parties collectively rather than of a particular local
government system. It would not be a failure of structures or systems,
but a political failure.</div>
					<a name="07022262000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the White Paper, we
said:</div>
					<a name="07022262000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Uniquely
communities in London are denied the option to form parishes. We intend
to give them the same rights to have a parish council as the rest of
the country. As with all other parts of the country, local authorities
will need to consider the impact of community cohesion when deciding
whether to create a parish in
London.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022262000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Bromley and Chislehurst asked who supports that idea. Where has it
come from? Who supports it? I always like to be helpful. The National
Association of Local Councils supports the
proposals.</div>

								Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman intervenes from a sedentary
position. The answer is &#147;None, but they would like them.&#148;
That is the key; the legislation has not allowed London to have parish
councils so far. The hon. Gentleman is getting cynical in his old age.
London Councils, formerly the Association of London Government,
supports the current proposal, although it has concerns. I listened
carefully to the extracts from Mr. Pipe&#146;s report,
which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I have read the report, and I
wondered whether he wrote that prior to the publication of the Bill and
prior to the evidence sessions. We have dealt with a lot of the
concerns that he raised, and assurances about the guidance and the
points that were raised were
given.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000486"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving
way. I shall do my best to forgive her for the unkindest cut of
referring to my age. Does she accept that, yes, the Pipe report was
written in advance and that the comments on community cohesion pick up
on one of the concerns highlighted in the report? Will the Government,
in issuing the guidance, also consider the other concerns? Those are:
the impact upon other community engagement mechanisms, how parish
councils are to be funded and how there should be linkages between any
development of service delivery powers in the parishes as opposed to
the boroughs.</div>

							<a name="07022262000487"></a>
								Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> I will come on to those points. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s first point was about the services to be provided.
As now, that will be a matter of agreement with the principal council.
Swanley town council, which is not too far from me, has, like a number
of councils, a very impressive arrangement for leisure facilities that
it provides in its area. There is an issue around service agreements
between town or parish councils and the principal
council.</div>
					<a name="07022262000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman then asked who supports the proposed approach. London
Councils supports it. Its current concern is to ensure that legislation
effectively allows a London borough to refuse the creation of a parish
on the grounds of community cohesion. We have addressed that. The
Association of London Government, now London Councils, took part in the
technical working group that we established in 2005 and which looked
into the existing legislation. We will ensure that London Councils is
afforded the opportunity to contribute to the guidance on the
development of
parishes.</div>
					<a name="07022262000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked, who pays? Under previous clauses, we talked about the
issue of precepts. It is open, and parish councils have precept-raising
powers. The Government have no capping powers, and no intention to take
them, unless widespread demand becomes evident. We would then, of
course, reconsider the
issue.</div>
					<a name="07022262000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the hon.
Gentleman was speaking about the Pipe report, he used a phrase that I
find most puzzling, &#147;unduly extensive devolution&#148;. What
is that? If a local parish council wished to be created and the
principal council decided it was in the interests of the community to
do so, that would not be &#147;unduly extensive&#148;. Rather, to
use a phrase of my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government, it
would be common
sense.</div>

						</b> The Under-Secretary has a good case, but she is
going a little over the top here. Only on Tuesday, her fellow Minister
referred to &#147;irresponsible&#148; devolution, which came in for
the same sort of criticism. Perhaps she could help us by saying what is
the difference between &#147;unduly extensive&#148; and
&#147;irresponsible&#148;
devolution.</div>

						The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s substantive point was a serious one. I addressed two
of his questions. His third was about how a new parish can co-exist or
deal with neighbourhood committees or existing parish forums. That will
be a matter for the principal council. If the principal council was of
the view that the area was adequately served in terms of governance by
existing local forums, that would be part of the decision-making
process. That is not prescriptive from the Government; it is being
devolutionary and the principal council could decide whether to take
that into consideration.</div>
					<a name="07022262000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman also asked
where the demand from London for parish councils was. I do not know
where the demand will be, but we are giving away the powers of
decision. Decisions will rest with the London boroughs. It will be open
to them to apply to have a parish council. I do not know what the
demand will be, but the right has to be there for those in London to
have the same rights as those in other parts of the
country.</div>

again. She says that the Government do not know what the demand will be
but that the opportunity ought to be there. I remind her about the
strong feelings of this Committee in relation to the committee
structure on governance, about which exactly the same argument was
made. It is convenient for her to use that argument now, but it was not
convenient for Ministers to use it a little

decide.</div>

						This
chapter places duties on the authorities that are being defined to

and community strategies, to prepare for those local area agreements
and co-operate with the partner authorities when determining the
targets within the local area agreement. We believe that this makes a
significant change in the statutory framework and statutory climate in

are designated as upper-tier authorities as well. Hon. Members from

						Government
policy, which I hope is clear, is that it is critical that districts
and counties together agree their priorities for the locality that they
cover to avoid obvious inefficiencies and overlapping or contradictory
targets for the same area. In the local area agreement framework that
is already in place, the districts are named among the partner
authorities in clause 79. Every local authority area will have a local
area agreement by 31 March. I hope that no one believes, inadvertently,
that we are not paying attention to districts. They will be responsible
for agreeing targets on the same basis as the counties and other local
service providers. The clause, and other policy measures, are a crucial

							<a name="07022262000506"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair,
Mr. Benton. We now come to the meat of part 5, which will
allow local councils to deliver the strong and prosperous communities
that the Government, the official Opposition and my party want to see.
Local area agreements and the extent to which they can bind in and
integrate the activities of partners will ensure delivery. We support
fully the concept of local area agreements and allowing local
authorities working with their partners to set priorities for an
area.</div>
					<a name="07022262000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not,
however, use the phrase &#147;place shape&#148;. It is something
that I cannot stomach; it is far too new Labour for me. It is also a
phrase that the public may not necessarily understand. Setting
priorities is what the provision and local area agreements are about.
That will be achieved by local improvement targets which, for the
purposes of this afternoon, I shall abbreviate to LIT&#151;not to be
confused with local income tax, a very good alternative to the council
tax 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 342</div>system. However, although I might be tempted to engage the Government in
a long debate about that alternative form of paying for local services,
I understand that here is neither the time nor the place to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07022262000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
local improvement targets under the Bill is to improve economic, social
or environmental well-being in a particular area. That will be
achievable only when local authorities can undertake that role
effectively, working with relevant partners. That is where the Bill is
defective. It is appropriate to highlight some of the partners who will
be missing from the table, unless the Government change the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07022262000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings me
to amendment No. 49 and NHS or foundation trusts. I accept the
arguments put forward by the NHS Confederation that primary care trusts
commission health services from NHS acute or foundation trusts, and
that it will be the body that will hold those trusts to account for the
services that they deliver. I disagree with the confederation&#146;s
view that, by including NHS or foundation trusts as a partner, it will
create partnerships with no purpose. The confederation says that the
key is to get the right people in the
room.</div>
					<a name="07022262000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
occasions when those from NHS and foundation trusts are the right
people to get in the room. I am sorry to say that often the NHS
partners are the most reluctant to get into the room. In the past few
months, I have been conducting research among local authorities and
know that one of the impacts of the financial pressures on NHS trusts
means that they are scaling back their involvement and partnerships.
They are not putting in the resources or the time to get people round
the table, so it is a serious omission that NHS and foundation trusts
are not included in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07022262000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Clearly,
the PCTs can use their contracts and will do so to ensure that the NHS
and foundation trusts deliver in respect of health, but what about
other matters in which the local authority might want to engage a local
NHS trust&#151;a large employer and generator of traffic&#151;as a
partner around the table? Let us consider traffic congestion. St.
Helier hospital in my constituency is a large employer; it generates
lots of vehicle movement. The local authority has an interesting scheme
under way at present to reduce people&#146;s use of private cars and
make them aware of public transport alternatives. To what extent will a
primary care trust be able to negotiate with an acute trust about
engaging it in the process of reducing traffic congestion in and around
the borough? The answer is not at
all.</div>
					<a name="07022262000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">All members of
the Committee can think of other cases&#151;whether skills or
employment&#151;when we might want to involve partners directly and
for them to include NHS and foundation trusts. I shall listen with
great interest to the reasons why such a provision has been omitted
from the list, but it will require a convincing explanation for us not
to pursue the matter if not today through a Division, but at a later
stage.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07022262000434"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
					<a name="07022262000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
88, tabled by the official Opposition, is in the same ballpark in what
it seeks to achieve&#151;more effective engagement with NHS partners
than currently exists. Amendment No. 65 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 343</div>touches on the NHS, but it also includes the Mayor and Transport for
London.</div>
					<a name="07022262000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 117, I am sure that the Minister agrees with the LGA that the
success of local area agreements, as well as depending on partners such
as the NHS whose engagement we want, depends on central
Government&#146;s willingness to play a full role. Surely central
Government&#146;s role should not be simply to approve LAAs, but to
engage heavily in the process and to show that they are a willing
partner. For instance, if a local improvement target will address
social disorder and antisocial behaviour in an area, there are clearly
circumstances in which the local authority will want the Home Office to
be engaged in the process. A local authority seeking with its partners
to introduce targets on climate change, particularly a local authority
in a coastal area, will want to engage the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs in the process. For that reason, we have
suggested in amendment No. 117 additional partners whom we believe
should be around the table to discuss local area agreements and targets
with local authorities and other
partners.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000507"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> The list goes on and on, but I should like to ask
the hon. Gentleman, and perhaps the Government, why educational
establishments&#151;for example, local schools and sixth-form
colleges&#151;have not been included, because they have an important
impact on the nature of any
area.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000508"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has made a valid point. If I
concede one flaw in our amendments, and only one, it is that the moment
a list is deployed, it is easy to identify other things that should
have been included. He has a strong case, and he may want to consider
tabling his own amendment to ensure that educational bodies are
represented as partners, just as we are seeking to ensure that DEFRA,
the Home Office and so on are included. The Government, Departments and
regional offices need to be engaged in the process, which is what we
want amendment No. 117 to achieve.</div>
					<a name="07022262000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 136 could perhaps
have been incorporated with No. 117. I am afraid that it is a further
list of additional organisations that could be sought as partners
around a table. I am not suggesting that all the partners should be
present at each and every single meeting to define the local area
agreement&#151;this Room would not be sufficient for all of them, and
I am sure that local council offices would struggle to provide the
necessary tea and biscuits&#151;but there will be cases in which they
should be engaged.</div>
					<a name="07022262000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall give a couple more examples in relation to amendment No. 136. I
suspect that every hon. Member here who has part of the rail network
running through their constituency has at some point torn out their
hair about Network Rail&#146;s lack of involvement in problems there.
I shall draw attention to one particular issue. Let us take the London
borough of Sutton as an example, and let us say that it launched an
initiative to tidy up Wallington town centre. At the very heart of
Wallington is Wallington station. Every single person who arrives in
Wallington by train and who walks into the town centre, and every
person who leaves the town centre to catch a train, must walk under a
bridge 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 344</div>maintained by Network Rail. What they will see if they follow that
particular route&#151;many of my constituents, particularly those
with children, now avoid it&#151;is a large number of dead pigeons
caught in a wire mesh. Many of my constituents will not walk that route
with their children, because their children do not want to see dead
pigeons, or pigeons on their way out, caught by the wire
mesh.</div>
					<a name="07022262000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Has it been
possible to get Network Rail engaged in sorting out that problem over
the past five years? Certainly not. The problem has nothing to do with
Network Rail. It is Network Rail&#146;s bridge, but it is not its
problem. I do not know whose problem it is, but it is certainly not
Network Rail&#146;s. Clearly, we need the organisation to be engaged
in the process. We will not improve our town centre&#151;I think that
this will be true of many town centres&#151;until that particular
problem is sorted out. I want to see Network Rail as a partner in this
process.</div>
					<a name="07022262000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Probation
trusts, which the Government will introduce in the Offender Management
Bill, appear to be another serious omission from the list. As the hon.
Member for Bedford has said, there is a problem with identifying a
whole series of organisations that one would seek to involve as
partners, but there are some significant omissions that the Government
should consider incorporating in the Bill. That opportunity does not
come up very frequently. Therefore, rather than waiting for the
Government to realise that the omission was more serious than they had
anticipated, I hope that members of the Committee will agree that now
is the right time to address the issue. That would give us a situation
in which local authorities can deliver real local area agreements with
real power and work effectively with all of the partners that need to
be engaged in the process to make a real change to a local
community&#151;I am not going to use the phrase &#147;place
shape&#148;&#151;and to improve an area in a way in which local
residents want. I will listen carefully to the Minister&#146;s
response. I hope that she can give a convincing explanation why so many
significant partners have been omitted from the
list.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07022262000509"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): I agree with much of what the
hon. Gentleman has said. In my experience, local government and other
organisations are always full of lawyers. Looking at the list, which is
growing, one can see a lot more work for lawyers coming out of the
Bill. Amendment No. 88 is in line with what the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington has said about the national health service.
It might be appropriate for primary care trusts to be listed, but there
are some very big hospitals in boroughs and council areas that also
have a big impact. Even if one is not talking specifically about health
issues, there is a load of related issues that might exercise a local
council&#151;for example, thousands of people working in a hospital
might need housing and car-parking arrangements. Also, local buses are
routed and timed to deal with patients and those who work in hospitals.
Therefore, a whole range of issues could impact very heavily on the
community. We feel that there should be a mechanism allowing
authorities and boroughs to have more of an agreement and dialogue with
those particular
organisations.</div>
					<a name="07022262000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington has discussed Network
Rail&#151;I have some sympathy for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 345</div>anyone who has Network Rail going through their constituency&#151;I
wondered about airports and ports. I have a port in my constituency in
Poole. Heathrow has a pretty big impact on west London. The issues
there include the possibility of extra terminals, where the traffic
goes, who is travelling there and what impact that has. Some
organisations on the list have less of an impact than very large
airports, even small airports in rural areas can have a
disproportionate effect on a particular
community.</div>
					<a name="07022262000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want the
Minister to justify why the organisations listed under paragraphs (a)
to (i) are necessary, why other organisations are excluded and whether
or not the Government are happy that the drafting of the Bill is right.
It seems to me that we have a very extensive list, but there are some
very big gaps that will make governance at a local level rather more
difficult because the list excludes some very big players in local
communities.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07022262000510"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): First, I support the comments
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole on clause 49. To give the
Under-Secretary an illustration why &#147;Primary Care Trust&#148;
might be an insufficiently broad descriptor of what she is trying to
get at, in my constituency we are debating a situation where the
primary provider of community health care is likely to become a
not-for-profit trust, which will be outside the primary care
trust&#146;s direct management and control. If we are looking to
involve the providers of medical services, the Liberal Democrat
amendment helps to capture the thrust of what the Government are
getting at, as does our
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07022262000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
picking up on the comments made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington on transport authorities, he may have a problem with dead
pigeons in an urban area, but in a rural area we have problems with
other forms of wildlife that affect the transport thoroughfares,
particularly dead badgers, which may be receptacles for bovine
tuberculosis.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000511"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> In urban areas, there is a problem with pheasants
jamming the brakes on trains, so even in such areas wildlife is a big
issue.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000512"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I fully accept that wildlife affects urban areas as
much as rural areas. Of course, the fox springs to mind as being as
much of a pest in urban areas&#151;often more so&#151;than in rural
areas, where it now lives free of its
predator.</div>
					<a name="07022262000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Highways
Agency should be included in the list, but it has not been mentioned
yet in any amendment. If the Bill is trying to get to transport
providers, will the Under-Secretary consider including the Highways
Agency as well as Network
Rail?</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07022262000513"></a>
							<b class="B">Andrew
Gwynne</b> (Denton and Reddish) (Lab): I want to go into a bit
more depth on a number of matters that have been touched on. I have
much sympathy with adding to the list of partner authorities, because
there is a danger that if we do not do so we will lose accountability
and lose the involvement of some of the partners, not necessarily
including the national organisations and quangos as part of the local
area agreement. However, there is a danger of producing an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 346</div>
						almost endless list. If it is not going to be done
in that way, we need a mechanism in place to bring other organisations
and bodies formally into the
process.</div>
					<a name="07022262000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over the past
few decades, a plethora of organisations, although not necessarily the
national organisations and quangos, have been involved at the local
level. Thinking locally, many local authorities have moved towards care
home trusts, sports trusts and housing action trusts&#151;building
companies that have taken over the responsibilities of the former
direct service organisations&#151;and so on. The list is almost as
endless as the one in respect of the other suggestions. There is a
danger that if we do not involve more formally some of those
organisations, we will end up with a loophole further down the
line.</div>
					<a name="07022262000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bodies that
I have referred to are often solely funded by local authorities and
often provide a service solely on behalf of the local
authority&#151;quite frequently in buildings still owned by
it&#151;yet legally and constitutionally they are completely separate
from local authorities and are not, for example, covered by a range of
regulations that would apply to them were the relevant services still
offered in-house. We will possibly debate that in more detail when
discussing chapter 2 and the enhanced scrutiny and the access to
information from partner authorities. Chapter 2 and clause 49 are
linked, because the former states that the partner authorities that are
listed have to provide the information. If those organisations are not
listed, a mechanism is needed to include them somewhere else. I have a
number of concerns, and I will go into more detail when we debate the
clause on access to
information.</div>
					<a name="07022262000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there
is a breakdown in the relationship between the local authority and the
arm&#146;s length organisation&#151;or, in many cases, the
completely independent organisation&#151;the local area agreement is
not well served and there needs to be a formal mechanism that brings
the parties together to talk. I am thinking in particular of
housing.</div>

					<a name="07022262000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fortunate
that there is a good housing trust in my constituency&#151;New
Charter Housing Trust in Tameside&#151;as well as an arm&#146;s
length management organisation in Stockport, both of which work well.
However, now that the council has a statutory responsibility for
housing without necessarily having the housing stock, there is the
danger of a serious breakdown.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000514"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is already
evidence of a breakdown in the relationship between local authorities
and the NHS, because the NHS is under financial pressure? We need to
ensure through this Bill that such financial pressures do not lead to
the breakdown in relationships that he seeks to
prevent.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000515"></a>Andrew
Gwynne:
						</b> I absolutely agree. It is the case not just for
the NHS and for housing trusts but potentially for all organisations
that are arm&#146;s length, quasi-independent of the local
authorities or totally independent of local authorities. That is why we
need to tighten up this part of the Bill. I hope that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 347</div>Minister can assure us that there will be local mechanisms to bring in
those other organisations.</div>
					<a name="07022262000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that those
relationships will remain strong in Tameside, an authority with four
stars, in the top category and showing strong improvement. It is the
only such authority in Greater Manchester or in the north-west&#151;I
wish that my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan were here to listen to
this. However, we need to legislate for areas that do not show the same
responsibility in keeping partners
together.</div>

						<a name="07022262000516"></a>
							<b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): I will be brief, and
will focus on whether housing associations should be involved in local
area agreements. We have heard all the arguments. There is a strong
case for social landlords to be included. I cannot vote for amendment
No. 136, because I am not sure what is meant by the duty on the Housing
Corporation, and whether that is the right wording. Housing
associations play an increasingly important role in our communities.
They are not just providers of what was, in some cases, council-managed
property, but they are also partners in the delivery of a range of
services, most of which are in the public sector and are mentioned in
the Bill. They are essential partners in tackling antisocial behaviour
and their lettings policies can be crucial to community cohesion. It
therefore does not make sense not to allow them to be party to, or to
scrutinise, LAAs&#151;not least because the Government&#146;s
clearly stated position on the housing role of local authorities is
that they should operate strategically. This is a missed opportunity
and I find the two positions a little illogical.</div>
					<a name="07022262000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard a lot of good
examples, and I shall not go into them further. My hon. Friend the
Member for Denton and Reddish, for instance, spoke strongly here and on
Second Reading about sports trusts. I hope that the Minister will
consider the suggested additions, particularly on the role of
registered social landlords and NHS foundation hospital
trusts.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000517"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> I just want to reinforce the point that I made in an
intervention about the list going on and on. If we are to think
carefully about the organisations that, at their best, make a positive
contribution to community life, then schools, colleges and universities
must be included. The best of them do not live in ivory towers
operating in isolation; they are engaged in the life of their area. The
university of Bedfordshire has taken very positive initiatives in
relation to the economic development of the county as well as of the
town. Wherever there are such organisations and institutions, there is
a need to welcome the work that they already do and to engage them in
the formal process.</div>
					<a name="07022262000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, I cannot see in the Bill
a reference to what we debated this morning, which was town and parish
councils. Indeed, I mentioned urban community councils as well. Not to
include those organisations formally would send a negative signal.
These are organisations in which people have usually been elected, and
even if people have been co-opted or appointed, at least they are
showing that they wish to be engaged in improving community life. To
exclude them would be a mistake, so I hope that my hon. Friend the
Minister will consider the matter.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to hon. Members who have, on the
whole, spoken about their desire to extend the number of
bodies&#151;public and, in some cases, non-public
bodies&#151;rather than question the premise of the policy, which is
to include a duty to co-operate across the partners as defined. That
shows me that there is a consensus for this approach; it is nice to be
discussing just the boundaries of the approach. We can take some
comfort from that.</div>
					<a name="07022262000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said before, the clause sets out the list of public bodies and
persons that will be partner authorities for the purposes of this
chapter. The list will ensure that all the relevant public bodies
involved in delivering services in a particular area will be committed
to co-operating with the previously mentioned responsible authorities,
as defined in clause 78, and also with each other in determining
targets when local area agreements and the community
strategies&#151;the formal documents adopted by local
authorities&#151;are being prepared.</div>
					<a name="07022262000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The list of partner authorities
includes bodies that deliver services at the local level. To give some
obvious examples, they include the police authority, the primary care
trust and the jobcentre. There are also overarching
bodies&#151;commonly national bodies with regional
structures&#151;such as Sport England, which is very important in
many community strategies, and the Health and Safety Executive. Those
organisations have a regional or local presence and are able to engage
in the setting of targets and the shaping of wider
priorities.</div>
					<a name="07022262000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, this list of bodies is not immune to change. Other bodies whose
functions are relevant to the clauses in this chapter may come into
existence, so it may become necessary to change the list from time to
time. To that end, there is included&#151;as Members will have
noted&#151;an order-making power that provides that the Secretary of
State may amend the list of bodies and persons after consulting the
appropriate representatives of local government. That is in clause
79(6). The Secretary of State would have to consult Parliament with
regard to making any such additions to the
list.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000519"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> Is not one of the great problems with the clause
that although the Minister is constantly reminding the Committee of the
Government&#146;s desire to devolve decisions down to local
authorities, on an issue about which each local authority is best
placed to determine who it should consult in order to engage in a local
area agreement, the Secretary of State will determine which are the
right parties, and a laborious procedure will have to be gone through
by each participating principal council to secure such consent from the
Secretary of State? Surely, that is the wrong way
round.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000520"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The Government&#146;s policy and intention is to
meet the point that the hon. Gentleman makes. The power that the
Secretary of State will have to add bodies to the list will be a power
to enable devolution, so that local government can work with those
partner bodies in the local area in the consultation over the local
area agreement, the setting of targets and the delivery of services.
What I am simply saying is that there may be bodies that do not exist
at the moment, or that may carry out functions that are not being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 349</div>undertaken by existing bodies, whose inclusion would make the list more
relevant. Therefore, the idea of giving to the Secretary of State the
power to extend the list meets the objective that the hon. Gentleman
has described.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000521"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I understand the Minister when he discusses the
intentions that we all agree on. Would it not be better, however, to
have a wider definition of partner authorities, rather than having to
find office holders and then laboriously extend the provisions? For
example, it might be appropriate in principle for members of the
voluntary sector, which has not been mentioned, to be included in
partnership authorities. Will the Minister confirm
that?</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000522"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I shall respond to the specifics of the speech
made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington and then come to
the point made by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate. In general,
one is talking about public bodies, not about private companies or
voluntary sector bodies, although they have important roles,
particularly in contracting and commissioning, where they are very
relevant. Later in the Bill, of course, we will come to the workings of
local strategic partnerships.</div>
					<a name="07022262000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the efforts that the
Government and the Local Government Association made to build a
consensus on this approach, I am very encouraged by the fact that we
are debating the number of bodies that should be included. I have a wry
smile at the irony of hon. Members calling for private companies and
voluntary bodies to be included in the plans. One cannot be too
dictatorial about such matters. However, as Lady Thatcher once said,
&#147;It&#146;s a funny old
world.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022262000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
respond&#151;sometimes positively&#151;to points made by hon.
Members. Adding schools to the list of partner authorities would compel
the responsible local authority to co-operate with all the schools in
its area when preparing or revising the draft local area agreement or
community strategy. I suppose that co-operation works both ways, but I
remind hon. Members that, as they will know from their constituencies,
some local authorities have well over 300 schools operating in their
area, many of which are small primary schools with limited capacity to
contribute meaningfully to strategic objectives. To place all of them
under a duty to co-operate would add significantly to the bureaucracy
in the schools and local
authorities.</div>

							<a name="07022262000524"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I shall not give way yet because I suspect that
the hon. Gentleman will like my next
point.</div>
					<a name="07022262000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe also
that the proposal is unnecessary because schools are already covered by
the key partnerships in the local authority target-setting process. The
18 statutory education performance targets, which will form part of
every local area agreement, are built on the statutory targets set each
year by local authority maintained schools. Alongside the 35 or so
suite of packages, on which the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire
has tabled an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 350</div>amendment, there is the 18 or so suite of targets for schools&#146;
educational functions. We believe that that is the best way in which to
address the point that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington
made.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000525"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> That point was not made by me, but by the hon.
Member for Bedford&#151;a Member from the Minister&#146;s own side.
However, is the legislation not defective if the inclusion of schools
in the list would require a local authority to engage each organisation
in discussions, negotiations and consultations? Should that not be
approached on a case-by-case basis, rather than by saying, &#147;If
you have 300 schools, you must consult them
all&#148;?</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000526"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman and to my hon.
Friend the Member for Bedford, who, of course, made the point about
schools. That would be the case if, as in most authorities, including
mine, there was generally a co-operative climate or culture. However,
as ever when legislating, one must try to predict circumstances in
which the norm would not be the case. That is my
concern.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000436"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07022262000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
schools can, and do, engage in local partnership arrangements through
the children&#146;s trusts, which I believe is a proportionate and
sensible approach. The Children Act 2004 set out that procedure. We
want all local authorities to look at the needs and wishes of parents
of pupils in their area and include in their planning the full role of
schools in delivering these objectives.</div>
					<a name="07022262000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">To that end, the children and
young people&#146;s plan provides a single overarching strategic plan
for all services that affect children and young people in the locality.
All local authorities must have such a plan except four-star
authorities such as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and
Reddish. They are excluded from this obligation as part of the
incentivisation to good performance, which is a policy that has been
generally welcomed. Section 38 of the Education and Inspections Act
2006, which hon. Members will remember voting for, places a duty on
school governing bodies to have regard to that plan. I am not trying to
create a superstructure with a detailed plan that would be too heavy
and too intrusive, but to provide a strategic framework through
statutory duty within the local area agreement and local strategic
partnership plan.</div>
					<a name="07022262000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, the 2006 Act also
places a duty on schools to promote the well-being of their pupils and
to promote community cohesion, a point that the hon. Member for Bromley
and Chislehurst made earlier. Schools are included within that point
and, goodness knows, that is important. There is no implication that
schools can opt out of any &#147;place-making activities&#148;.
That is what it says in my brief although I rather agree with the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington about that. If he can suggest an
alternative phrase, I should be grateful for a postcard. It was Sir
Michael Lyons who coined the phrase and, as we know, one does not have
to accept all the recommendations from independent
commissions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 351</div>
					<a name="07022262000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be helpful if I briefly
mention universities and further education colleges because
universities could well be very useful partners in local area groups,
particularly in areas where student accommodation is changing the
nature of the community. Hon. Members will know the types of
communities that I am talking about. Further education colleges are
already represented by the inclusion of the Learning and Skills Council
as a statutory partner. The university bodies present a different case
because they are independent bodies established by charter. A better
solution is to encourage responsible local authorities to consult such
other bodies as they consider appropriate when drafting local area
agreements and community strategies. We will seek to indicate through
the statutory guidance that this could and may involve universities
where appropriate. I can think of a number of examples where it would
be
appropriate.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000527"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> Clearly I welcome the fact that he will ensure that
such bodies are consulted. But consulting a university is one thing,
ensuring that it responds in terms of the transport implications and
the impact on housing in an area is a completely different
matter.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000528"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has a point about housing in
particular. I visited Loughborough recently where there was a
conference of local authorities hosted by Nottingham on the whole issue
of housing and students. The obligation on the local authority to
consult the university is important, but there are two points to bear
in mind. First, this is not the be-all and end-all of existing
requirements to involve and consult. This is putting a statutory duty
on specified bodies, and universities present a particular challenge. I
agree with him about housing. There may be local transport implications
if there are large numbers of students, even though, oddly enough, some
of them are now well off enough to have cars. That is why the Bill
provides for universities to have the facility to enter into local area
agreements, rather than compelling them to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07022262000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
argument that has been put to me by vice-chancellors is that
universities in some cases have national and international strategic
objectives. It might be appropriate to cover certain of their
functional areas&#151;the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington
mentioned transport and housing. However, our wider objective is to
deal with those partners that help to deliver local authority services.
It is a point that I have thought long and hard about,
however.</div>
					<a name="07022262000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The issue of
how to involve the voluntary and community sectors, and indeed the
commercial sector, is crucial. Those sectors are not designated partner
authorities, because they are independent, and one cannot responsibly
ask Parliament to bring independent private bodies under the control of
statutory bodies. That would be Stalinist, and it would not work.
Nevertheless, it is important that organisations in each of the
voluntary, community and business sectors are involved in setting
priorities and in the day-to-day working of delivery.</div>
					<a name="07022262000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be impossible to name
each and every relevant body, and it would be inappropriate to impose
the new duties on them. However, the Bill provides for responsible
authorities&#151;&#147;responsible&#148; in the legal sense of
clause 78&#151;to
consult</div>
					<a name="07022262000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such other
persons as appear to it to be appropriate&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 352</div>
					<a name="07022262000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						when preparing the local
area agreements and the community strategies. The Government&#146;s
decision to enter into statutory guidance on the matter reflects the
fact that although such bodies are not statutory or public-sector
bodies, they are important. That has been part of the dialogue between
the Government and the voluntary sector, through the office of the
third sector in the Cabinet Office and through the compact arrangement.
My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak is chair of the Community
Development Foundation and I believe that, among his other activities,
he has been extensively involved with this issue.</div>
					<a name="07022262000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The arguments apply equally to
the business sector. It is crucial that business and commerce are
involved not just in the request for delivery of the desirable goals,
but in the design of those goals, not least because of the other
benefits that can derive from business involvement in shaping
strategies and services. As we ask local authorities to take on more
responsibility for economic regeneration and economic leadership, we
are genuinely trying to create a partnership for each area that
includes those
organisations.</div>
					<a name="07022262000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
statutory guidance that will follow enactment of the Bill will stress
that organisations in each of the voluntary, community and business
sectors must be involved in the process. How that happens it a matter
for the local area. That it should be done will be a matter of
statutory guidance, however. It will also be possible for bodies in
those sectors to agree to help to deliver particular targets on a
voluntary basis. I refer the Committee to subsections (1)(c)
and (3) of clause
80.</div>
					<a name="07022262000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments in
the group have been moved with good intent, within the
framework of the Government&#146;s policy. I am advised that
amendment No. 49 would have the consequence&#151;unintended, I
assume&#151;of removing primary care trusts. I make that observation
for the benefit of the Committee, although it is not my argument
against the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07022262000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the positive side,
amendments Nos. 49 and 65 seek to add NHS trusts and NHS foundation
trusts to the list of partner authorities. The involvement of those
bodies in local area agreement processes is clearly desirable, but it
is made difficult by the fact that some trusts provide regional and
national services. That is the other side of the coin to the point made
by the hon. Member for
Poole.</div>
					<a name="07022262000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me explain
my thinking. Great Ormond Street, for example, delivers specialist
services on a national basis. There could and would be confusion as to
which local authorities and local authority services it should
co-operate with. Great Ormond Street patients come from all over the
country, and I imagine from all over the world, so such an amendment
could mean that it would have to be consulted on and co-operate in the
preparation of local area agreement targets. That is a technical point
and not my main point, but it is important not to impose unduly on such
trusts.</div>
					<a name="07022262000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government, however, recognise the importance of NHS trusts and
foundation trusts and it is our intention, following representations
and comments, to name them in the Bill in such a way as to avoid the
Great Ormond Street problem but to include them as partner authorities.
I hope that the Committee will welcome that commitment. As late as
yesterday, the Association of Directors of Social Services was making 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 353</div>a similar point, given the importance of NHS trusts and foundation
trusts. <i class="I">[</i>

matters relevant to the local
area.</div>
					<a name="07022262000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment
No. 65 would add the Mayor of London and Transport for London to the
list of partner authorities. The Greater London authority is of course
already represented in the list by three of its functional
bodies&#151;the Metropolitan Police, the London Fire and Emergency
Planning Authority and the London Development Agency. I intend to add a
fourth, Transport for London, by amendment following consultations and
representations. It is more appropriate to name the GLA&#146;s
delivery bodies than the Mayor himself, because they can agree and
deliver local area agreement targets, a function that the Mayor does
not have. I hope that hon. Members will accept that the Mayor and his
office are subject to an accountability structure through the London
assembly, as we have heard.</div>
					<a name="07022262000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, there is an argument
against parishes and community councils being added to the list. It
would make the list of partners to be brought around a table very long.
To give one example, North Yorkshire has 588 parish councils and the
constituency of Bassetlaw has 88. That is a pragmatic point, although
we will be signalling in the guidance the importance of involving
parishes. Parish plans, which are important in the delivery of services
to local areas, will of course be linked to local authorities&#146;
community strategies. There are therefore two arguments on parishes:
one pragmatic and the other asking to whom they are accountable.
Ultimately one cannot supplant their accountability to the electorate
with targets, even if they were agreed
on.</div>

88 would add to the list of partner authorities any individuals or

but it appears that it would include general practitioners. It might
also include those providing medical services in acute trusts. To
include such a broad group would make the process unworkable. It makes
more sense to focus on primary care trusts, which commission both
primary services and the hospital-based
NHS.</div>

The argument is similar to the one about registered social landlords,

					<a name="07022262000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment
No. 117 would add to the list of partner authorities the Secretaries of
State for Communities and Local Government, Education and Skills, Trade
and Industry, Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Home
Department. I am compelled to point out that in law there is only one
Secretary of State, so the Bill&#146;s definition of the Secretary of
State includes them all. It is an important point in the policy, and
one that local government fears. It is suspicious or anxious that
somehow the agreement is with my Department and not with central
Government as a whole. Local area agreements are made with central
Government, and indeed signed by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury
and numerous Secretaries of State. I hope that I have answered the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
question.</div>
					<a name="07022262000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 117 would add registered social landlords to the list. Although I
recognise their important role, I do not agree that they should be
added to the list of partner authorities. First, they are not public
bodies. They can be charities, limited companies or industrial and
provident societies. I have sought to avoid naming such organisations
in the clauses for the reasons that I gave to the hon. Member for
Enfield, Southgate. Secondly, it would not be appropriate to place
registered social landlords under the duties, as they are not tied to
any particular geographical area. For example, one RSL is based in
Sheffield yet owns properties all over the country. In such
circumstances, it would be unclear to a local authority which RSL to
consult. I recognise that that is a technical and pragmatic point, but
I shall come to a larger policy point.</div>
					<a name="07022262000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government-commissioned
Cave review, due to report in April, is examining the whole regulatory
framework for social housing, including registered social landlords.
Having discussed the matter across Government, we have decided that it
would be premature to name RSLs in the Bill, as their remit and status
may be subject to change. As we have said, the Bill provides for the
possibility of adding to the list of partner authorities, and we might
be able to do so later. I emphasise that there is no intention one way
or the other at this stage; I mention it merely as a possibility. Also,
the Government have recently merged the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 355</div>Housing Corporation with English Partnerships, which is covered in the
list of bodies.</div>
					<a name="07022262000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members asked about the Highways Agency. I point the Committee to
clause 79(3)(g)(ii) and (iii), which deal with the Secretary of
State&#146;s exercise of the functions. The Highways Agency does not
operate legally as a separate entity. Its duties are performed on
behalf of the Secretary of State, so it is included in the list of
partner authorities. I think that constituency Members of Parliament,

that.</div>

target-setting framework. He might argue that it should not be a
private limited company, but that issue is not within the scope of the
Bill and I shall not be drawn on it. I am sure that you would not allow
us to discuss that anyway, Mr.
Benton.</div>
					<a name="07022262000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Network Rail
is subject to a licence that is enforced by the Office of Rail
Regulation, which sets the targets for Network Rail. The ORR is an
independent regulator and Network Rail would therefore be unable to
fulfil a duty of co-operation to agree to targets in a local area
agreement. Transport functions that are carried out by responsible
authorities, whether passenger transport authorities or the transport
authority functions within local councils, would be subject to that
duty of co-operation. The Bill is intended to define the boundaries
between national and local in the way that the Sustainable Communities
Bill is intended to, but I believe that this Bill does so more
successfully. I hope that that answers that question about this
important
clause.</div>

						</b> It is rare at the Committee stage for Opposition
Members to feel that the Government have made a significant concession.
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), who speaks for the
official Opposition on housing matters, bemoaned the fact that, as a
Member of Parliament, he could not show his mother any achievements of
changing the Government&#146;s legislation. I think that people will
feel envious that today, the official Opposition and the Liberal
Democrats have secured from the Minister an important undertaking in
relation to NHS trusts, which is extremely welcome.</div>
					<a name="07022262000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure that the Minister
has convinced Members on either side of the Committee about his reasons
for opting for a list approach to identify partners, rather than a much
more flexible approach. In years to come, we will visit the Secretary
of State many times to add names to or remove names from that
list.</div>

approach is to empower local authorities. I want the list on the face
of the Bill so that it is known that the public authorities concerned
have a duty to co-operate in the meeting of targets in their areas. I
would rather have a debate between central and local government about
who should be on or off that list than about whether there should be a
list. There is an alternative option, as the hon. Gentleman explained,
but I think that my approach is more likely to help local authorities
succeed in fulfilling the
aim.</div>

								Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I wish to say a few words about the clause and
the direction of travel. It is entitled &#147;Application of Chapter:
partner authorities&#148;, and I wish to draw to the
Committee&#146;s attention what is self-evident: that by far and away
the most significant and biggest partner of local government is
national Government. The Secretary of State&#151;I am sorry, I mean
the Minister; I got a little ahead of his promotion schedule
there&#151;referred to Secretaries of State and said that, of course,
there is only one Secretary of State. I guess the collective noun for
Secretaries of State is Government. That emphasises the point that it
is a relationship&#151;hopefully a partnership&#151;between central
Government and local government that is at the core of delivering
services and ensuring that democracy works well. It is certainly the
Liberal Democrats&#146; view that that partnership should be seen to
be and should actually be a partnership of equals, where there are
clear boundaries on the responsibilities and the rights to interfere,
to directand to innovate, and where both local government and
national Government are seen as having a separate and legitimate
constitutional existence.</div>
					<a name="07022262000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the Minister&#146;s
attention to the European charter of local self-government, which sets
out some of the constraints that a national Government should have in
mind when they are in, or developing, a partnership with local
government. Is the Minister satisfied that, in the light of the clause
in particular and the Bill as a whole, he will be in a position to say
that the Government are compliant with that charter? If so, will he
move towards seeing the UK ratify that
charter?</div>
					<a name="07022262000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">My colleagues
and I attempted to table a new clause that would have made more
explicit the need for that partnership arrangement to be formal, and to
establish a concordat between national and local government. We were
unable to do that because it was outside the scope of the Bill.
However, I would like to hear from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 357</div>the Minister whether, on behalf of the Secretary of State, he would
undertake to initiate a dialogue with local government, so that we
could lead a move towards a situation where that ratification could
take place and we could see in place a concordat that clearly sets out
the relevant powers and responsibilities of the two tiers of
government, local and national.</div>
					<a name="07022262000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Underlying many of the debates
that we have had so far&#151;and many of the debates that lie ahead
on the Bill&#151;are the problems, the difficulties, the suspicion
and the mistrust between the two layers. The Government do not trust
local government and, let us be blunt, local government often does not
trust national Government. Perhaps both have some right on their side,
but surely we should be working to draw together a stronger partnership
of equals. I hope that the Minister can respond positively to
developing that over the coming
years.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000542"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Perhaps I should respond in some more detail
outside the Committee to the important point that the hon. Gentleman
makes. Perhaps he could table a written question in order to give the
Government the opportunity to answer. It is relevant to the Committee
that we have that dialogue, as he will know, with the Local Government
Association through various structures, and the UK representatives of
local government in that dialogue tend, in my experience, genuinely to
act in the country&#146;s interest rather than in a partisan way.
That is to be welcomed.</div>
					<a name="07022262000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that, notwithstanding
the point that the hon. Gentleman has just made, that I have convinced
the Committee that the intention behind the clause is precisely to
achieve the sort of co-operation that we need. I do not agree with the
hon. Gentleman that central Government do not trust local government,
and local government does not trust central Government. That is the
impression that is given sometimes, but on the whole local government
is a partner in the governance of the country and we need it to be
so.</div>

						</b> The amendment gives us an opportunity to talk about
the importance of the voluntary sector and the involvement of
non-statutory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 358</div>partners. The voluntary and independent sectors are important in the
future of local
government.</div>
					<a name="07022262000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have the
honour to sit with the hon. Member for High Peak on the Commission on
the Future of Volunteering, which was set up last year by Volunteering
England, under the leadership of Baroness Neuberger. We are conducting
a review of what is currently happening in volunteering around the
country and hope to make recommendations in future about how
volunteering can be spread even further throughout society and be made
most effective.</div>
					<a name="07022262000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
talking to groups that involve volunteers, one cannot doubt that their
engagement as service providers throughout the community and the
increasing reliance of local authorities and other statutory
authorities on volunteers is a key issue for them. Most volunteers, who
come into organisations to be useful and to provide something for
society, are only too pleased to work hand in hand with the statutory
authorities that need them. Equally, however, they do not want that
enthusiasm to be drowned out in the process of making contracts and
find their determination to work being channelled in such a way that
they are not necessarily volunteering on their own behalf, but feel
more that they are being asked to follow somebody else&#146;s agenda,
which detracts from the spirit that brought them into volunteering. I
say that simply to illustrate how important their commitment and
involvement is. The amendments are designed to give them statutory
recognition in a way that the clause does not quite
do.</div>
					<a name="07022262000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
permissive. It allows, in subsection (2)(a)(ii), for the responsible
local authority to
consult</div>
					<a name="07022262000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such other
persons as appear to it to be
appropriate&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07022262000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">as opposed
to &#147;each partner authority&#148;, with which it must consult.
That provision would cover bringing on board those in voluntary
organisations and others. However, the amendment states that where such
people have been engaged as partners, they should have a status beyond
that of any others and should not be brought along as an
afterthought.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000546"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Is the hon. Gentleman talking about individual
voluntary sector organisations, umbrella associations of voluntary
organisations, or
both?</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000547"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I am talking specifically about those who have been
engaged as partners within an area agreement, so that will vary
according to what the agreement is. I am trying to ensure that, when
consultation is taking place, the involvement of those people will not
simply depend on whether the authority considers them to be
&#147;appropriate&#148;, but will be mandatory because of what they
are doing and how they are working with a local
authority.</div>
					<a name="07022262000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
expand on the role of the voluntary sector, because it is important to
put in on the record. I thank the National Council for Voluntary
Organisations for the briefing that it provided for Committee members,
to which I am referring. In its main briefing, when referring to the
whole background to the Bill, it states:
</div>
					<a name="07022262000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The future of
local government is a key issue for the voluntary and community sector.
The sector is particularly keen 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 359</div>to see modernisation and change in partnership working, scrutiny and
accountability, best value, community governance and capacity building
support for the VCS...Voluntary and community organisations interact
with local authorities and other statutory organisations in numerous
ways and at numerous levels, playing three very important
roles...they provide information and give advice to individuals or
communities; they enable people&#146;s voices to be heard, by
supporting and encouraging people and communities or by acting as
advocates (very often for marginalised groups who may not have any
other way of being heard) and they provide activities and
services.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022262000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
particularly concerned with that third
element.</div>
					<a name="07022262000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
appropriate for the Government to recognise the involvement of the
sector in providing services by following it through under the
amendment. Voluntary and community organisations need to be involved in
the local area agreement process from the outset and enabled to engage
fully with the agreement process, setting targets and discussing
funding. It is important to recognise that, for many voluntary and
community organisations, risks are inherent in the LAA approach.
Whereas good local authorities will make use of the freedoms and
flexibilities to determine their own priorities in partnership with a
broad range of local stakeholders, others will take the opportunity to
pull back all control to themselves. If local partnerships are to be
benefit from the sector&#146;s expertise and insight into such
issues, there must be support, including some financial support, to
facilitate the sector&#146;s
engagement.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000548"></a>Alison
Seabeck:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points&#151;indeed, I made some of them myself on Second Reading.
However, the voluntary sector is a complex beast. Some voluntary sector
organisations are engaged in partnerships and deliver services, while
others work within the community but none the less regard themselves as
partners. I am not sure how the amendment can differentiate clearly or
whether the requirement should be in the Bill or be covered by
guidance.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000549"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I appreciate the hon. Lady&#146;s point. When
voluntary organisations are involved formally in partnerships, they
ought to be statutory consultees. When they are not formally involved
and are fulfilling the role that she mentioned, they are properly
covered by subsection
(2)(a)(ii).</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000550"></a>Alison
Seabeck:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware from his
experience that voluntary organisations move in and out of
partnerships, according to what is available and other factors. Is
there enough flexibility to accommodate that
movement?</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000551"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> Again, I am grateful to the hon. Lady for making a
fair point. The problems of voluntary organisations and their
contractual arrangements, and how difficult it sometimes is,
particularly as they come to an end of a contract, to know whether it
will continue and whether they will survive, are a wholly different
debate.</div>
					<a name="07022262000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I maintain
that the position is clear. When voluntary organisations are involved
in a partnership, they should have the opportunity statutorily to be
joined with other partner authorities and be a key part of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 360</div>consultation process. I appreciate that they are included elsewhere in
the Bill, but I want to put on record their opportunity to take that
chance and be consulted in a particular
way.</div>
					<a name="07022262000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have explained
the purpose of the amendment, but I think that all of us would pay
tribute to the work done by voluntary organisations and their
tremendous provision of services. If those reading and following the
proceedings of the Committee wish to give evidence to the Commission on
the Future of Volunteering, I ask them please to take the opportunity
to go to the appropriate website. The commission offers them a
tremendous chance to get on the record their views on where they think
volunteering is going and to talk about some of the difficulties they
encounter. The intention behind the commission is that it should
benefit everyone by creating better and stronger partnerships in the
future. I should be grateful if the Minister would recognise the
strength of the amendments and give them a fair
wind.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000552"></a>Tom
Levitt:
						</b> It is indeed a pleasure to follow my fellow member
of the Commission on the Future of Volunteering. I am happy to endorse
in principle pretty well everything that he said, especially asking
people not only to visit the website, but the consultation events, some
of which both he and I will be chairing throughout the country during
the next few
months.</div>
					<a name="07022262000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
being chairman of the Community Development Foundation, which is a
Government appointment, I chair the all-party parliamentary group on
the community and voluntary sector, the administration of which is
provided by the NCVO, which provided us with the briefing on the
amendment. The NCVO also provided a rather excellent gala dinner last
night, which is perhaps why I was a little subdued this
morning.</div>
					<a name="07022262000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NCVO
strongly supports the thrust of the amendment, and quite rightly so. I
am very sympathetic myself. I hope that the Ministers will go away and
think about the implications of the amendment and some of the strong
points that the hon. Gentleman has just made, and then come back with
an amendment that encapsulates rather better the arrangements for those
voluntary sector organisations that are partners in the delivery of
services and in local agreements of one form or another. I believe that
local strategic partnerships and local area agreements are going to
become very much more important, with an ever greater role for the
voluntary sector as formal members of those
organisations.</div>
					<a name="07022262000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Healthy
communities, which is what the Bill is all about, are those where the
third sector is active and involved. It is involved in three ways:
delivering services; representing people through processes of
consultation; and, on a 24-hour-a-day basis, serving the communities in
other ways. Communities themselves often give birth to those
organisations, particularly in what we now call the community sector,
as opposed to the more vertical silos of the old idea of the voluntary
sector. In my constituency there are some smashing examples of
voluntary sector organisations engaging with the formal partners in
service delivery in many different ways.</div>
					<a name="07022262000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The community in Gamesley,
which is among the 10 per cent. most deprived wards in the
country, has a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 361</div>wonderful infrastructure, with public and voluntary sector partners
operating in many different ways. I was very pleased when
&#163;250,000 of lottery money for community development was awarded
to the ward just before Christmas. High Peak Community Housing is the
arm&#146;s length management organisation serving the Gamesley
community; the ALMO management board, which in effect consists of
volunteers, is chaired by the former chair of the Gamesley residents
association. I was very impressed when High Peak Community Housing was
represented at a local voluntary sector forum, which I organised with
my hon. Friend the Minister for the Third Sector in my constituency
just a couple of weeks
ago.</div>
					<a name="07022262000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I contrast that
with what I overhead at a conference on local strategic partnerships
about 18 months ago. Two councillors, who did not know each other
previously, were talking. One said to the other, &#147;I don&#146;t
know who these voluntary sector people think they are. Don&#146;t
they realise that we are the elected people around here? It is our
responsibility to deliver services.&#148; The other replied,
&#147;We don&#146;t have that problem with voluntary sector people
on our LSP. We don&#146;t have voluntary sector people on our
LSP.&#148; Both those attitudes and experiences will, I hope, be
things of the past, because of the extra qualities and value that can
be obtained for services through working in partnership with the
community and voluntary
sector.</div>
					<a name="07022262000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						High
Peak borough council is acknowledged as a beacon council for
partnership working and, in that sense, the league tables published by
the Audit Commission, which have already been mentioned a couple of
times today, are perhaps a little remiss. Although they look at a
number of important ways of assessing the performance of local
councils, they do not take partnership working into account. I hope
that we can add the way in which councils engage with partners to those
league tables of achievements. Indeed, my local strategic partnership
has for much of its life been chaired by a voluntary sector
representative, partly because there are two local
authorities&#151;district councils&#151;involved. Therefore, the
voluntary sector representative held the balance, rather than one or
other of the local authorities taking
control.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07022262000439"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

					<a name="07022262000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good councils
and good councillors see a strong voluntary sector, and a strong
community sector, as an opportunity and not as a threat. That concept
is shared across the House&#151;I am sure that the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire would agree with it. That is why he feels that
the amendment is necessary, and it is a matter on which I agree in
principle.</div>
					<a name="07022262000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
strategic partnerships have got to include the third sector. It is now,
and will be in the future, an essential dimension for them to have, not
least because the voluntary sector will be a key provider of services,
and that will present challenges to the sector and to partners. I
digress by saying that there are issues about local area agreements
that will have to be addressed&#151;perhaps in the Bill or in other
legislation. There are fears in the sector that smaller providers of
services will get pushed out of the procurement process by the bigger
boys&#151;those who can perhaps deliver a county-wide service. There
may be an organisation that delivers a county-wide service in the next
county.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 362</div>
					<a name="07022262000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has to be a continuing
role for local service delivery and local partners. That is why I hope
that the Minister will give some consideration to making local area
agreements the norm for the contractual basis of service delivery by
partners such as those in the voluntary sector. Putting local area
agreements on to a stronger statutory basis, as is called for in the
LGA&#146;s briefing, would be valuable and is well worth considering.
The way in which local area agreements and local strategic partnerships
function should be subject to the local authority scrutiny process more
formally than perhaps they are.</div>
					<a name="07022262000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I am speaking to
amendment No. 126, I will draw to the attention of the Minister the
briefing given by the English National Parks Authorities Association.
The matter is not related to the discussion about the voluntary sector,
and perhaps discussion of it might more properly belong in a clause
stand part debate, but national parks authorities could well be covered
by the text of the amendment. I hope that, if necessary, we can build
in to the provisions the idea of ensuring that the development and
management plans drawn up by national park authorities are not
challenged or undermined by decisions taken in the consultation
processes. There are national parks in both the Minister&#146;s
constituency and in mine, and he will recognise that nothing in the
Bill should undermine how national parks principles are
adopted.</div>
					<a name="07022262000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
questions to put to the Minister. Will he ensure that national park
management plans are fully respected and not undermined by the process?
Will he put consultation with the community and voluntary sector on
some form or other of a statutory basis, although not necessarily
conforming to the wording of the amendment? Will he look at the issue
of whether LSPs and LAAs are included in scrutiny procedures? Will he
look at the pros and cons of having LAAs as the basic unit of delivery,
and therefore of procurement?</div>
					<a name="07022262000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are yet to see what guidance
comes out in relation to clause 81, and what regulations are presented
in respect of it, and we will not see them in Committee. Nevertheless,
the Minister&#146;s words will be in <i class="I">Hansard </i>and I hope that
the powerful words spoken by the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire, and my own modest contribution, will enable the Minister

hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment in favour of finding
something about which we can all agree.</div>

							<a name="07022262000553"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Let me try to explain to the Committee the
Government&#146;s routeway of meeting the objectives that my hon.
Friend the Member for High Peak and the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire have set. There are three main problems in addressing the
issue. First, the voluntary and community sector, and the business
sector, are not statutory bodies, so one has to take a different
approach to them. Secondly, as constituency Members of Parliament know,
the size and scope of voluntary bodies vary enormously, ranging from
one or two people undertaking worthwhile causes in localised
geographical areas to big organisations such as Age Concern, which in
my constituency delivers more than half the social services for the
elderly on behalf of the public.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 363</div>
					<a name="07022262000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The third
problem can be summed up as, &#147;You can lead a horse to water but
you can&#146;t make it drink.&#148; Some local authorities
unfortunately display the attitude that my hon. Friend the Member for
High Peak outlined: they see the voluntary and community sector and the
business sector as a nuisance or a fly in the ointment, because they
believe that they are not accountable as councils are and that they are
sometimes the awkward squad. Sometimes organisations in those sectors
are the awkward squad because the voluntary, charitable sector has an
advocacy role, as well as that of service delivery. Hon. Members will
recall that the Charities Act 2006 grappled with that
problem.</div>
					<a name="07022262000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
Mr. Chope were here, I am sure that he would back me up when
I say that Local Government Ministers spend half their time listening
to the voluntary sector&#146;s complaints about councils and the
other half listening to the councils&#146; complaints about the
voluntary sector. That is the negative side.</div>
					<a name="07022262000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The positive side is that we
cannot deliver our agenda in local communities without the voluntary
sector. We cannot involve people, or consult them, or reconnect people
with policy, let alone politics, without the voluntary sector. We
cannot get the innovation, the focus, the flexibility or, crucially,
the trust of the public without the voluntary sector facilitating the
relationship.</div>
					<a name="07022262000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is
the Government&#146;s routeway through the Bill? I refer hon. Members
to the clauses on local area agreements and to future clauses on
overview and scrutiny, on best value and on the duty to involve and
consult, which is directly relevant outside the framework of the duty
to co-operate with
partners.</div>
					<a name="07022262000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would require the local authority when it is preparing its
local area agreement or a revision to consult non-statutory local area
agreement partners. Clauses 81 and 86 provide for the local authority
to consult</div>
					<a name="07022262000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such other
persons as appear to it to be
appropriate&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022262000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">when
preparing a draft local area agreement or a revision proposal. Using
those provisions, we would expect local authorities to consult relevant
non-statutory organisations and persons. In other words, that part of
the Bill puts the onus on the local authority, or gives it the option,
to consult, in a way that it sees fit, the non-statutory sector; but
that does not satisfy the demand of the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire who wants to be able to say that it should have to do so.
I believe my routeway does what he wants while avoiding the pitfalls
that relate to the fact that these are non-statutory
bodies.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000554"></a>Tom
Levitt:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
clarification and for referring the Committee to clause 86.
Will there be a mechanism by which a voluntary sector organisation that
believes that it is an appropriate consultee can insist on, or at least
appeal against, a decision that is taken not to include it in the
consultation?</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000555"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The problem with having experts on Committees is
that they ask expert questions. My answer is that I think such an
organisation can already do so, but I will check on it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 364</div>
					<a name="07022262000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will finish my point, which I
hope will satisfy my hon. Friend. What is different, and what is
changing&#151;I completely agree with the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire&#151;is that the voluntary and community sector should
be part of the LSP. Indeed, it must be part of the LSP under the
guidance that results from this Bill. That is an important policy
development, which the Government have discussed with colleagues in the
Cabinet Office and the third sector. The LSP is subject to overview and
scrutiny, and the LSP consultation that we held earlier this year and
last year welcomed the proposal. There was strong support for the idea
that the voluntary and community sector should be part of the
LSP&#151;it was stronger than I expected, given my scepticism, which
I indicated to the Committee before.</div>
					<a name="07022262000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might benefit the Committee
if I report that independent evaluation of existing LAAs shows that the
voluntary and community sector&#146;s role in an LAA is increasing.
That is to be welcomed, and we need to build on it. What will that mean
for partners who are not named as service providers and community
representatives? The answer is that the LSP must represent the full
range of service providers as well as the local community. It is
critical that non-statutory organisations, including voluntary
community groups and businesses, are part of the LSP and, consequently,
part of the process for determining targets&#151;either as members of
the LSP or of its thematic partnerships, or engaging by other
routes.</div>
					<a name="07022262000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
important point, which, I am pleased to tell my hon. Friend the Member
for High Peak, confirms that my guesstimate was correct, is that if the
body were relevant to the local authority, the local authority would
have to consult or risk the consultation being invalid. In other words,
it must act reasonably. If the body were to say that it had a right to
be consulted and had not been&#151;that is, to show that the local
authority had acted unreasonably&#151;it could challenge
it.</div>
					<a name="07022262000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can go further;
that is why I asked the question of the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire. In practice, it is often the case that the VCS is
understandably and rightly represented by an association of voluntary
bodies within the local area, an umbrella group that acts as a service
provider to the voluntary sector and as an advocate for it&#151;a
channel. We have to ask, therefore, whether we could establish a
process for duly constituted and recognised associations to be included
as statutory partners. We would still have the problem that they would
not be statutory bodies. Therefore, my intention is that such bodies
should be included within the statutory guidelines. Indeed&#151;if
you will allow me to stray from the amendment just on this point,
Mr. Benton&#151;as part of the Government&#146;s wider
community cohesion strategy, which is outlined in chapter 6 of the
local government White Paper, we state our intention to build the
capacity of the VCS in each area through such a provision.</div>
					<a name="07022262000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">By including the necessity in
the LSP, by including the overall duty to consult and involve, and by
including in the statutory guidance the role that the VCS should play,
we believe that we can build on what is already happening, and I can
avoid the problems that I would have had in this Committee had I named
the VCS and the business sector as statutory bodies. I note 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 365</div>that my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South, who is a former
council leader, and others here who have experience were nodding in
recognition of that point.</div>
					<a name="07022262000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that addresses the
issue that the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire raises in his
amendment, but I accept that the full picture will not be clear until
we have debated further clauses, so I ask for his indulgence in that
regard.</div>

point in my efforts to explain the voluntary and community sector
issue. He and I share a boundary and share a national park and he knows
of the importance of this issue. The national parks are named; they are
a statutory body; they are a partner in this process that we have
described; and they are local authorities. So the answer to the
question is yes.</div>

Syms:
						</b> These amendments pick up the theme of proper
consultation. The reference to the director of public health and the
chief medical officer could be described as the dead turkey part of the
Bill. I should be interested to learn why these amendments are totally
misguided. Perhaps the Minister will give us the benefit of his
advice.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000562"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The effect of amendment No. 89 would be that the
local authority would have to have regard to the interests of the
commissioners of general medical services, to any guidance issued by
the director of public health and to any guidance issued by the chief
medical officer when it is preparing its local area agreement. The
effect of amendment No. 90 would be that the Secretary of State, before
issuing his guidance, would have to consult the director of public
health and the chief medical officer rather than just</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 366</div>
					<a name="07022262000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such representatives of local
government (including representatives of partner authorities) and such
other persons (if any) as he considers
appropriate.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022262000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is already a link in this Bill between the persons named in the
amendment and the process of negotiating local area agreements. Primary
care trusts are commissioners of general medical services and they must
themselves have regard to guidance issued by the director of public
health and the chief medical officer. Primary care trusts are included
in the list of partner authorities in clause 79(2)(i), and clause
81(2)(b) states that a responsible local authority must co-operate with
each partner authority.</div>
					<a name="07022262000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will therefore be through
the primary care trust, as the commissioner of general medical
services, and its negotiations with responsible local authorities and
other partners, that any guidance issued by the directors of public
health and the chief medical officer will be taken into account when
targets relating to health matters are being negotiated. That model
fits in with our devolutionary approach because it works through the
PCTs.</div>
					<a name="07022262000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The serious
point is that the goals and the targets of the general medical services
and the director of public health are very important to local
authorities in working for their communities. We are talking here about
longevity, heart and lung disease and ensuring that all the partners
move towards promoting good health. It strikes at the heart of why
partnership is important. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford
pointed out, the activities of a school through the provision of meals,
fruit, exercise and sports can have a huge impact. It can have a bigger
impact on public health in the long run than the direct work of the
acute services in the hospital, for example.</div>
					<a name="07022262000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Poole makes
a valid point, but we believe that we can cover it through the primary
care trust, which now has 80 per cent. coterminosity in this country
due to the sensible reorganisation of the health services that we
undertook in consultation with the Department of Health before the
framework was put into place. That is the answer to the
question.</div>

comprehensive area assessment which shall be phased in to coincide with
the commencement date for Chapter 1 of this
Act&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07022262000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment takes us in a slightly different direction. It deals with the
comprehensive area assessment, its timing and the need to phase it in
as soon as possible. With the transition in local area agreements
expected to begin in April 2008, it is most disappointing that the
supporting comprehensive area assessment system for measuring progress
is not due to be introduced until April 2009.</div>
					<a name="07022262000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">To deliver, the local area
agreement must be, as promised, streamlined and less bureaucratic. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 367</div>believe that running an old-style, heavy-handed performance framework
alongside the new approach will be cumbersome and could inhibit
success. We therefore agree with the LGA that there would be a
significant advantage to introducing the mutually reinforcing elements
of the new framework at the same time. The LGA is happy to work with
Government and the regulators to ensure that time scales are met, and
hopes that the Ministers will reconsider the
measures.</div>
					<a name="07022262000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
spoke today to Steve Bundred of the Audit Commission. He is not
particularly keen on the amendment, as he believes that there is a good
reason for the separation of the two elements. I am not
convinced&#151;I think that the LGA makes a reasonable
case&#151;but it is an area of dispute, and I put it on record to be
fair. It was good to meet Steve Bundred to discuss
it.</div>
					<a name="07022262000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LGA&#146;s
point is straightforward. It is always difficult to operate two
systems. It believes that there would be an advantage in bringing the
date forward, and I tabled the amendment to test the Minister&#146;s
thinking. Does he think that further negotiations on the matter might
be the way forward, rather than drawing a line under it
now?</div>

						</b> I rise briefly to say that I think that the
amendment is sensible if there is an opportunity to synchronise the two
elements. As the LGA, the representative body of the councils
responsible for delivering it, supports the amendment, I shall listen
carefully to the Minister. If he does not believe that it is a sensible
way forward, what explanation can he
give?</div>

								Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire for moving the amendment, because it gives me the
opportunity to do exactly what he invited me to do. The
Government&#146;s attitude is that if we could do what he wants, we
would. Our reasoning is that 1 April 2008 is an important beginning
point for local government in the new framework that the Bill will
introduce if it is agreed by Parliament. It will be the beginning of
the three-year financial settlement and of the new, so-called refreshed
local area agreements, and will herald the beginning of the new
performance assessment framework, to which we shall come.</div>
					<a name="07022262000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment&#146;s effect
of bringing the date forward would mean that a comprehensive area
assessment would have to be phased to coincide with the coming into
force of the local area agreement clauses, which is fixed in clause 175
for two months after Royal Assent. The Audit Commission will be working
with other inspectorates in the next two years to develop a detailed
methodology for the comprehensive area assessment so that it can be
introduced by 2009. The comprehensive area assessment is a crucial
piece of local evidence&#151;we shall come to debate that matter. In
essence, it will judge the whole place&#151;the whole town, city or
county&#151;as well as the institution. It will consider the range of
partners and service delivery and the outcome from the citizen&#146;s
point of view, and will make for interesting reading when it is
published.</div>
					<a name="07022262000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Gentleman accepts the Audit Commission&#146;s robustness and
independence. He does not need to say so; I know that he does. The
commission was established in 1981 as part of the package to bear down
on local government&#146;s alleged profligacy with public money. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 368</div>am keen to ensure that its core function is re-emphasised. Its main job
is to keep the books balanced, and to ensure that expenditure is
controlled properly and value for money is delivered. That will work
towards the introduction of the new regime. I have stated that it would
be better if we could have started the data collection from 1 April
2008, but I am advised that that is not possible, and it would be wrong
to force such a change. Having said that, I believe that I have
honestly and fairly answered the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question about
our
attitude.</div>

						</b> We now come on to targets. I think that we all
welcome the approach of reducing the number of targets that local
government must meet. In the past, central Government have always
expected far too much from local government and, indeed, added a lot of
costs to it by imposing
targets.</div>
					<a name="07022262000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know
that in politics it is terribly easy to keep adding targets&#151;to
have a degree of target inflation. By limiting them to a specific
number, the Government would have to knock a target out when they want
to add another one. A core number of targets would therefore be
maintained, which would set a higher and tougher test for those faced
by local government and mean that we do not get a drift of more and
more targets adding more and more bureaucracy. If the thrust of the
Bill is devolutionary, we need to limit the burden on local government.
Amendment No. 109 would help by insisting on a limit to the number of
targets approved in the Government&#146;s proposed arrangements. I
could go on for a lot longer, but the hour is late, and I would be
interested to hear the Government&#146;s response to my
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000577"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has raised an important
issue&#151;one that the Local Government Association has raised with
the Government. I cannot remember whether it did so in the
evidence-gathering session, but it certainly did so before
that.</div>
					<a name="07022262000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Government&#146;s intention is that there should be some 200 common
measurements&#151;national indicators, in the jargon. I shall not
mention the 18 education targets that were mentioned by the hon. Member
for Bedford. Of the 200, there should be some 35 that are agreed by the
local authority, its partners, and the Government. The 35 could be
different in different areas, of course. That is the important point.
It is the way to meet the paradox, faced by all Governments, of equity
and a postcode lottery on the one hand and devolution on the other,
while maintaining the right of an elected Government, and
indeed&#151;I would argue&#151;the right of Parliament, to outline
the minimum goals.</div>
					<a name="07022262000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
not include particular targets explicitly in the Bill? I want to try to
convince the hon. Member for Poole of the Government&#146;s rationale
for not doing so. The Government do not apologise for the number of
targets that local government faces. The figure of between 600 and
1,200 sounds huge, although it is less so when one considers the vast
range of services that local authorities provide. Nevertheless, it is a
huge number, and local authorities report that it is
over-burdensome.</div>
					<a name="07022262000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
find it ironic that hon. Members&#151;from both sides of the House,
but especially from the Opposition side&#151;pray in evidence the
comprehensive performance assessment star rating, given that is
produced by the very performance review that is sometimes criticised.
Such is the way of the world, however. I shall not go into detail about
the own local authority, but it is doing
well.</div>
					<a name="07022262000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that
a figure of approximately 35 is sensible for the number of shared
targets. That figure has not been plucked out of the air; it has been
taken from a consideration of the nature of the indicators, and from
discussion. The figure is better dealt with in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 370</div>guidance, however. To set the upper limit at 35 would not take account
of the 18 statutory early years and educational attainment targets to
which the Government are committed. In the White Paper, we stated that
LAAs would need to contain those targets in addition to the
approximately 35 nationally negotiated targets.</div>
					<a name="07022262000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 81 provides that
responsible authorities should agree the local improvement targets in
co-operation with partner authorities. The amendment would make the
same provision. The targets will then be submitted for approval by the
Secretary of State. Thereafter, if individual targets are of key
national interest, they will be designated as provided for in clause
84. The effect of designation would be that such targets could not be
altered without the approval of the Secretary of State, given that they
are of key national interest.</div>
					<a name="07022262000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">To set out the definition of a
designated target in regulations would substantially reduce the level
of discretion for agreement of targets that would be available to
responsible authorities and their partners. If we used regulations to
define such targets&#151;an area economic well-being target for
reduction of unemployment, for example&#151;those targets would then
be designated in all local area agreements for England. However, it
might not be appropriate for such a target to be so designated; there
might be more important targets in a particular
area.</div>
					<a name="07022262000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The alternative
would be that the Secretary of State would have to define from the
outset, in regulations, exactly the sort of targets that would be
designated in each area. That would be unworkable, and would lead to
prescription from the centre. The regulations would inevitably be
unable to cover every target that would be likely to be designated for
a certain area. That would lead in turn to a real risk of the Secretary
of State being unable, because it was not in the regulations, to
designate a target that appeared in the LAA&#151;despite he or she
otherwise wishing to designate it. Incidentally, it is on that point
that I think that the Sustainable Communities Bill gets things
absolutely the wrong way round; unintentionally, it gives power of veto
to the Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="07022262000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consequence of all that is
that putting into the Bill the figure of 35 would jeopardise a local
authority&#146;s ability to have the flexibility to set targets that
were suitable for its area. I use the example of unemployment
deliberately. If one were to say that Surrey, for example, should have
to focus on an unemployment target and that Easington should not, most
Members would reasonably say that that should not be the priority;
there may also be examples the other way round. The effect of the
amendment would be to take away that
flexibility.</div>
					<a name="07022262000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Putting a
number in the Bill in the way that the hon. Gentleman described would
be giving in to a temptation to obtain temporary reassurance. This
legislation should be sustainable and long-lasting, and it may be that
there is reason why one would want to have a different figure or
figures, which were higher or lower.</div>
					<a name="07022262000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I am not one of
those Ministers who says, &#147;Trust me and trust my
successors,&#148; because we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 371</div>will be putting into guidance the objective of setting out the number of
targets that we wish to see achieved. In truth, because we are working
on the 200 indicators, it is premature to specify a figure, which is
why the Secretary of State and I say about 35, because, in all honesty,
we do not know as yet whether it will be
35.</div>

					<a name="07022262000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the Minister&#146;s
continual protestations that this is a mass devolutionary Bill, the
equivalent of the tennis court oath for his Government, we remain
concerned that there is some resistance outside. I would like to quote
from a commentary that I found from Pinsent Masons, the
solicitors&#146; firm that produced a comprehensive note on the Bill,
which it entitled &#147;Local Government Bill - A Night At The Local
Government Opera&#148;. It is written in a jaunty style throughout,
and the fact that anyone can make fun of these provisions shows a
degree of imagination not normally associated with property
lawyers.</div>
					<a name="07022262000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
the contribution of the author, Mr. Nicholas Dobson, who is
the national head of local government law at Pinsent Masons. I have
read his submission carefully and he makes some cogent arguments about
a variety of amendments, some of which we have incorporated into our
thinking. His style is to be commended, but in relation to these
targets and agreements, I merely quote his conclusion:</div>
					<a name="07022262000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When the Bill was

LGC&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07022262000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">the <i class="I">Local

					<a name="07022262000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;do

					<a name="07022262000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would simply
submit that, in relation to targets and everything to do with them,
that argument is reinforced, hence our interest in removing the powers
of Government to add extra targets and to try to get more leeway in the
Bill to remove targets.</div>
					<a name="07022262000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had that discussion and
remain of the view that there is too much central control and too many
centralising targets. Until we actually see how area agreements operate
and whether the Secretary of State continues to seek to impose her will
on local authorities by having too much control over local targets with
a national flavour, we will not be sure whether the Minister&#146;s
rhetoric is being delivered on the ground. We wait to see.</div>
					<a name="07022262000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Sustainable Communities
Bill the Minister wants the veto power of the Secretary of State
removed. I am sure that I could have a word with my hon. Friend the
Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd), who is promoting
that Bill, and ask him whether that power can be taken away. Perhaps
the Minister&#146;s concerns about this Bill doing things the other
way around will then be assuaged, further encouraging him to accept our
suggestion. That is all that I wish to say on the amendments, as they
follow the debate that we have just
had.</div>
					
					<a name="07022262000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022262000582"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Were the hon. Gentleman to do that regarding the
private Member&#146;s Bill, that would take away one of my concerns.
I do not want the Committee to think that the removal of that single
concern would be the only change necessary. The direction of travel of
that Bill, of course, is in line with this
one.</div>
					<a name="07022262000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light of the
manner and tone in which the amendment was moved, perhaps I should
emphasis that the Government have not stated that every area must have
the same number of targets. They might be different in different areas.
We envisage that examples of targets being changed by revision, using
the powers that we are asking for in the Bill, will be exceptional. For
example, if there were a national terrorist alert the Secretary of
State might choose to direct a responsible local authority to prepare
and submit a revision proposal, and he might issue guidance on the type
of new targets to be included in it. One can imagine that that might
well be the case for some of our major local authorities. Once the
Secretary of State had approved that proposal, he or she would be able
to designate any new target relating to security. By contrast, if local
targets were added simply by agreement between the parties under
subsection (6), they could not be designated in that manner. It would
not be appropriate in the circumstances in my example for a national
priority target to be treated as a purely local one.</div>
					<a name="07022262000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that difference between
local targets and those that could be designated, when hon. Members
think the process through they will find that their anxieties cannot be
realised. The process has yet to be tested and there will be a learning
curve for local authorities and Government offices and Ministers, but
the amendment would change the process substantially, to the detriment
of the flexibility of local targets. That is why it says on my piece of
paper here, &#147;Resist.&#148;</div>

							<a name="07022262000585"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for City of
Durham for raising this important matter. The role of Members of
Parliament in this process has been debated and is rising up the policy
agenda. Indeed, two local strategic partnerships in England are chaired
by MPs and many others involve their MPs, formally and informally.
However, as my hon. Friend recognised, MPs fall into a unique position.
I always believe that, outside this place, we have influence but not
power and that, inside it, we have one 650th of power, although
somebody once said that there is a first among equals&#151;but I am
not going there.</div>
					<a name="07022262000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
unique status as legislators and MPs bears on the attitude to the
amendment. Members of Parliament have experience both of the issues
faced by local people and an understanding of the key national
priorities. The Bill does not preclude any involvement for hon. Members
in their localities&#146; local area agreement. I expect that MPs
will have a significant influence in the establishment of the 35 or so
targets for their areas. Members of Parliament are, perhaps, unique in
having an overview of the whole place, not of an individual
institution, which is the important thing that we bring to the
table.</div>
					<a name="07022262000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would introduce a formal role, laid in statute, for MPs in the LAA
process with the effect that, when a responsible authority prepared a
revision proposal, it would have to consult the MPs for the area
covered by the LAA, as well as consulting each partner authority and
such other persons as appear to it to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 374</div>
						appropriate. We should not accept hon. Members being
placed in a position where they must be consulted by their local
authorities every time a revision proposal is being prepared. That is
not in the spirit of the Bill. The decision about whether to consult
MPs should be left, at that level of the process, to the discretion of
the responsible authority and its elected members. It would not always
be practical for MPs to be consulted, because MPs and their local
elected members may not take the same position on local and national
issues.</div>
					<a name="07022262000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can give
some backing to my hon. Friend on the revision proposals, which require
the approval of the Secretary of State, thereby ensuring that a
mechanism is already in place to ensure that the national perspective
is represented. In addition, the Secretary of State is accountable to
Parliament through the processes available to MPs, including the normal
questioning, tabling motions and the rights and privileges that we
have. That power
exists.</div>
					<a name="07022262000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">The decision
about whether to place the MP in a formal consultation role would
change the relationship between the statutory bodies and ourselves.
People in future might wish to go that way. The process that the Bill
sets in place gives greater strategic powers to local authorities and
their areas and, inevitably, challenges the roles of the MP, the
back-bench councillor and the executive member. To include a Member of
Parliament in a statutory consultation at this stage would create not
just policy difficulties, but legal difficulties, given that we are the
legislators that ultimately hold to account the local area agreements.
My hon. Friend might find herself inadvertently in a worse position
than she intended.</div>
					<a name="07022262000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The policy of
the Government and my Department is that, irrespective of party
political persuasions, Members of Parliament should be involved, both
formally and informally, with local authorities and other statutory
bodies. That is part of our democracy. Most authorities and statutory
bodies accept that that is quite right and proper. Indeed, good
authorities welcome such involvement and recognise that, even when the
relationship between the Member of Parliament and the local authority
is fraught, it is part and parcel of our democracy, and that we should
approach that fairly. I take very seriously indeed&#151;as does the
Secretary of State&#151;any example of a local authority that does
not facilitate the full involvement of its Member of Parliament in
policy decisions. That is not a partisan point, but a point made on
behalf of
Parliament.</div>

in relation to other issues&#151;and we do not see the logic in that.
Very frequently, the sort of issues that are likely to be raised with
councillors at the moment and that give rise to community calls for
action will overlap between the two schemes. It is not very easy or
practical to say that this is a crime and disorder issue and this, for
example, is an environment or transport issue&#151;frequently, the
two will overlap.</div>
					<a name="07022262000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I give a simple example from my own constituency that applies
elsewhere, including across outer London? There is regrettably a
problem with youth disorder on buses in London. That can often spill
over into bus stops and the surrounding areas. One can readily conceive
of scenarios in which people who face that problem in a particular
locality might wish to invoke a community call for action. Although
that is an issue of disorder, it is also one that involves transport
and possibly graffiti, vandalism and damage to the environment as
well.</div>
					<a name="07022262000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not very
sensible therefore to require councils to go through two processes to
achieve the desired result. If they use the proposals in the Bill, I
suppose it could be ruled out of order on the grounds that it is
essentially a policing issue. However, if the criminal justice
procedures are used, the matter could be related to disorder on buses
or damage to buses, and then one may ask where does it stand together?
That is a pretty obvious example that many of us would
encounter.</div>
					<a name="07022262000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also
seems anomalous, if one looks at the very helpful briefing that has
been prepared by the Local Government Association, that not only would
there be two schemes, but some slightly different criteria in section
19 of the Police and Justice Act 2001 from those outlined in the Bill.
There are different criteria for what the issue applies to, who can
raise it, and what the powers are. Most particularly, there is no power
under the Police and Justice Act for councillors to use any delegated
power to try to resolve the issue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 376</div>themselves. That seems surprising, given the desire to resolve as much
as we can locally and to enhance the role of the local
councillor.</div>
					<a name="07022262000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
also odd that the Police and Justice Act scheme does not apply to
county councils. What is the logic of that? When we think that through,
we realise that issues could arise in which it would be appropriate for
a county council to get involved. That might not be the most obvious
case; probably the district or borough council is the usual first port
of call, but I am not sure about what the logical distinction is. In a
nutshell, it would be sensible to bring this together.</div>
					<a name="07022262000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another sensible point made by
the LGA is that, as well as encouraging the local resolution of issues,
the Police and Justice Act provisions allow an appeal tothe
council executive if the council declines to refer the issue to
overview in the scrutiny committee. That does not seem to apply in the
Bill, so why should it be different from any logical point of
view?</div>
					<a name="07022262000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						One could
argue that the PJA provisions potentially give too wide a scope for the
vexatious and the frivolous appeal. We all have people in our
constituencies who are never going to be satisfied with anything. Do we
really want to put council officers, perhaps council executives, in the
position of having to do an awful lot of work to protect the scrutiny
committee from being burdened with that? That is not perhaps a crucial
matter, but the distinction does not seem logical, whatever the
justification for the appeal process.</div>
					<a name="07022262000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the Government to resolve
those anomalies, and it seems to us on balance that the scheme proposed
in the Bill would be better applied across the piece. That would
certainly be a lot easier, because residents themselves would have a
one-stop scheme for initiating a period of call for action. I should
have thought that sensible and in the interests of what the Government
want to
achieve.</div>

							<a name="07022262000592"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> I welcome the comments made by the hon. Member
for Bromley and Chislehurst. I understand his desire to have some of
what he calls logic in the process. Perhaps when I have spoken and
explained the process superficially&#151;to use the word of the
day&#151;it will be logical, and there are good reasons why there
will be two different processes.</div>
					<a name="07022262000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman has already
explained that taking amendment No. 139 with new clause 10 would have
the effect of bringing in community calls for action under the crime
and disorder matters, in line with local government matters. There are
important differences between the two, for good reasons. In the
former&#151;the crime and disorder matters&#151;any person who
lives or works in the area can initiate the process known as a
community call for action. All that they need to do is ask the
councillor who represents them to consider it a crime and disorder
matter. The councillor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 377</div>is then under a duty to respond to that matter, and can refer it to one
of the committees that he thinks appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07022262000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Crime and
disorder and transport are the two examples that the hon. Gentleman
gave, so the matter could be addressed by different committees. The
councillor&#146;s duty is to respond to the member of the
ward&#151;his or her constituent&#151;to say what action the
councillor is going to take. It is not just a matter of being able to
refer to one committee. The councillor has the power to refer to the
crime and disorder committee, but he or she could go to the transport
committee and look at both issues at the same time.</div>
					<a name="07022262000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if no one has asked them
to do so, councillors can refer matters to a crime and disorder
committee by virtue of the fact that they have perceived a problem in
that area. If a councillor declines to defer the matter, the individual
who has raised it can, under the local authority operating set of
arrangements, refer it to the executive of the authority, which places
the person under a similar duty to consider the issue and gives him the
option to refer the matter to the crime and disorder
committee.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07022262000443"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07022262000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The local
government matter is more simple. The only person with power to refer
it is the councillor. That puts an onus on the councillor. In our
evidence-based sittings, the hon. Gentleman must have heard the concern
that was expressed about frivolous or vexatious matters. The councillor
and the scrutiny committee are the backstops on such matters. It is a
power for the front-line
councillor.</div>
					<a name="07022262000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman referred to the LGA. When it gave evidence to the Committee,
it said that it would like the two matters aligned. There is a
difference between a councillor who is directly elected to a body and a
councillor who is not directly elected. The hon. Gentleman is right in
that the local government proposals that we are putting forward mean
that a councillor at any level, including a county councillor, can
refer the matter. It is important that the councillor has other means
by which to deal with the matter under the usual council process, other
than by referring it to overview and
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07022262000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns, I shall resist his
proposals. The Police and Justice Act 2006 received Royal Assent on 8
November 2006. Its provisions have not even come into force. Parliament
decided recently that it wanted community calls for action under the
Act to be dealt with in such a way, so there would have to be
extraordinarily good reasons to wipe it away and change the process
before it has even started to take place. Parliament is not really keen
to undo what it has only just
done.</div>
					<a name="07022262000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
positive argument centres on the nature of the problems that the Police
and Justice Act is intended to address, such as community safety.
Whether to align the two matters was considered; on balance, it is
reasonable to have a more stringent process in place in respect of
crime and disorder, in particular to enable individual citizens to
force the pace of change if they need to do so or to force the issue
when community safety and crime and disorder are at stake. I hope that,
in light of my explanation, the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 378</div>Gentleman will understand why I am not minded to change matters at this
stage. He is smiling at me benignly, so I think that that means he is
in
agreement.</div>

will be included. Yes, anything that affects the service to the citizen
from local government will be raised with the citizen&#146;s
councillor, in the same way that people currently raise similar issues
with their councillor. That gives the councillor the opportunity to
raise the matter with the overview and scrutiny committee, if the
councillor thinks that that is appropriate. In terms of issues that can
be ruled out of order, it would be for the councillor and the overview
and scrutiny committee to make a decision, as elected representatives,
about whether it is appropriate to pass the matter to the overview and
scrutiny committee and for that committee to decide how much time it
will give to examining the

						Last
year, Stockport metropolitan borough council and Stockport Sports Trust
decided to close Reddish baths. Those swimming baths were crucial to
the health and recreational needs of many of my constituents in that
part of Stockport. The sports trust was set up by Stockport council
several years ago to manage and run all its leisure facilities and get
around a range of restrictions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 380</div>put in the council&#146;s way. Unfortunately, in the good old days of
the committee system&#151;to contradict everything I said
earlier&#151;any decisions taken by Stockport council leisure
services committee would have been under the Local Government Act 1972
and access to information regulations, unless they were commercially
sensitive decisions. All the background information would have been in
the public
domain.</div>
					<a name="07022262000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
that is no longer the case for some of these organisations. I have been
told by Baroness Andrews that</div>
					<a name="07022262000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Stockport Sports Trust
is a company limited by guarantee and is not owned in any way by the
council; it is a separate legal identity... there is nothing to
prevent a local authority or public body, which enters into an
arrangement with an external entity to have services delivered, from
making it a condition of any contract or agreement that certain
information is passed to the local authority or public body and into
the public domain... However, as this has not been agreed with
Stockport MBC, the trust is not obliged to share this
information.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07022262000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
bring this matter to the Committee&#146;s attention because it was
not just me as the Member of Parliament for Denton and Reddish who
asked for background information on how those bodies came to the
decisions to close Reddish baths, but the locally elected councillors
in Reddish. They were told in no uncertain terms that they could have
no access to any of the background reports or to any information to
which counter-proposals could be made with the Friends of Reddish Baths
to try to run it as community management organisation.</div>
					<a name="07022262000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, after I raised the
issue at Department for Culture, Media and Sport questions, I received
the following letter from John Howarth, the general manager of
Stockport Sports Trust, in which he
says:</div>
					<a name="07022262000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am at
a loss to understand the length which you and your colleagues are
prepared to go to deal with this matter. I feel that no matter what I

correspondence what is now clearly an issue of national
importance.&#148;</div>

go. But that crystallises what happens when a partnership breaks down

creation. </div>

think that the amendment goes far enough. I wish that it went further.
I hope that the Minister takes on board the points that I have raised
about Stockport Sports Trust. I hope that it makes him realise and
understand why all these trusts, bodies and organisations need to have
some control over the access to information. If that does not happen,
all the wonderful work that we are going to do to improve scrutiny will
be a waste of time, because scrutiny needs access to that
information.</div>

							<a name="07022262000602"></a>Alison
Seabeck:
						</b> There are genuine concerns that relate
specifically to amendment No. 119. Although this is a devolutionary
Bill, which seeks to increase local autonomy, it still leaves gaps in
scrutiny and the accountability of the services offered and contracted
on behalf of local citizens. The Minister will know that, in addition
to the quasi-public or formerly public bodies that perform functions of
a public nature, many organisations provide services on contract to
local authorities. The voluntary sector provides a steadily increasing
volume of services on behalf of local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 381</div>authorities, especially in social care. There are also private sector
organisations that carry out a wide variety of work on contract to
local authorities.</div>
					<a name="07022262000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am worried that voluntary sector organisations that perform functions
of a public nature as drawn by legislation may not therefore be added
to the list of authorities that have to respond to overview and
scrutiny. A specific case can be used to highlight the nature of the
problem. In R <i class="I">v</i>. the Leonard Cheshire Foundation it was held
that a care home providing accommodation for elderly residents,
pursuant to arrangements made with the local authority, was not itself
exercising functions of a public nature for the purposes of the Human
Rights Act.</div>
					<a name="07022262000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
been lobbied by a number of organisations, including Sense, the Royal
National Institute for Deaf People, the Royal National Institute of the
Blind and Scope, which believe strongly that any organisation providing
social care on behalf of a local authority should be subject to
overview and scrutiny. Those bodies are seeking to subject themselves
to even greater accountability. I therefore ask my hon. Friend, when
responding to the amendment, to consider how to ensure flexibility in
the Bill to allow the widest possible scrutiny of the services supplied
under contract to residents of a local
authority.</div>

E. Smith:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I thank my hon. Friends and the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington for their contributions. The
Government are seeking to extend and strengthen overview and scrutiny.
We want local authorities to act as leaders in their communities,
engaging local people about their priorities and working with partners
to deliver better services. Questions have been raised about services
not provided directly by the council or its partners. How can those
organisations be called to account? We have given the amendment serious
consideration, but it seems unnecessary and potentially bureaucratic.
We are concerned that it could undermine
accountability.</div>
					<a name="07022262000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Our
regulations will place the requirement to provide information squarely
on the shoulders of the partner authorities that have entered into
local area agreements. Certain authorities&#146; overview and
scrutiny committees will be able to acquire from partner authorities
only information relating to their respective local improvement
targets. We fully recognise that, in securing cost-effective and
high-quality services, partner authorities may contract out service
provision, but it is partner authorities holding agreements with the
council that will be accountable to the overview and scrutiny committee
for the services for which they are responsible, including the services
that they in turn commission.</div>
					<a name="07022262000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could be confusing and
dilute accountability if contractors were required to provide
information to overview and scrutiny committees. It could inadvertently
encourage a culture in which partner authorities could shift
responsibility away from the organisation holding the agreement with
the council and on to the contractor. That is a grave concern, which is
why we have addressed it in such a
way.</div>
					<a name="07022262000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could also be
an unreasonable bureaucratic burden on contractors to have to respond
to requests for information from overview and scrutiny committees. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 382</div>do not think that the amendment of the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington would require contractors commissioned by local authorities
to respond to overview and scrutiny committees&#151;there is a
gap&#151;so I do not see why we should require partner
authorities&#146; contractors to do so. I have also heard my hon.
Friends&#146; concerns that organisations one step removed from local
authorities will not have such an obligation. It is a bit of a repeat
of our earlier debate about
LAAs.</div>
					<a name="07022262000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
must be careful not to think that the list of organisations is
exclusive and contains the only people who can be called to account by
the overview and scrutiny committees. The committees will be able to
investigate any issue, decide for themselves which inquiries they want
to hold and ask anybody to attend. The Centre for Public Scrutiny gave
an example in its evidence to the House of a scrutiny committee that
acted innovatively to encourage a reluctant private-sector company to
appear before it to give evidence. The committee was holding an inquiry
into a service failure by one of the water companies that caused houses
to experience a lack in their water supply for an unacceptable time.
The committee found that the water company refused to attend its
proceedings to put things right.</div>
					<a name="07022262000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members might recall that
when my hon. Friend in another place, Lord Hattersley, refused an
invitation to appear on &#147;Have I Got News For You&#148;, he was
replaced by a tub of lard. In this case, the water company was replaced
by a leaky, rusty bucket with its name across the front. It received
considerable press interest. At the scrutiny committee&#146;s second
meeting, representatives from the water company turned up demanding to
put the case before the committee so that they could have the right of
response.</div>

organisations will not necessarily be required to attend&#151;only a
limited number will be&#151;overview and scrutiny committees will be
free to invite anybody they wish. However, there is a danger that we
could dilute the very accountability that we are seeking if we allow
those with an agreement with the council to pass it on to contractors.
It could have unintended
consequences.</div>

						</b> I fully understand the point that the onus is on
the local authority to find ways and means&#151;and, if necessary, to
embarrass, as in the case that the Minister cited. I must say that I
was the person who rang up to give apologies for Roy Hattersley for not
appearing on the show, as I was working for him at the time. None the
less, the Government must therefore instil that sense in local
authorities, give them the best practice and disseminate information
about how they can get such people to give evidence. It will not always
be a bucket. There is a worry that the best will comply, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 383</div>but the vast majority will not, and that things will therefore slip
through the
net.</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> I understand my hon. Friend and she makes a very
powerful point. However, it is not only the best authorities that will
use innovative means. We have put in place a process by which certain
organisations will be required to give evidence. In response to the
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, I should say that those
organisations can give oral or written evidence&#151;it is the choice
of the party or organisation being called to scrutiny. However, the
process could be extended wider to organisations other than those
required by the provisions. An overview and scrutiny committee, with
the powers given to it in the Bill, will fairly soon want to extend its
role beyond the services provided by the council to any services that
its constituents receive. I would welcome that.</div>
					<a name="07022262000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take my hon. Friend&#146;s
point that it may take a short while for members of overview and
scrutiny committees to recognise their new powers, strength and
authority. However, I am confident that, by placing a requirement on
partners, and by making it binding on those that have services
arrangements with councils to give information by appearing before, or
by giving written evidence to, overview and scrutiny committees, we
have addressed the issue of the powers that the committees should have.
We are confident that the increased powers will be welcomed by overview
and scrutiny committees and that they will be used well. I therefore
hope that the hon. Gentleman withdraws his
amendment.</div>
