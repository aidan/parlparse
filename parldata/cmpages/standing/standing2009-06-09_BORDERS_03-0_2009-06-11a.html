Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): I welcome all members of
the Committee who have managed to get here this morning. Is the
Government Whip concerned about the numbers behind
him?</div><a name="09061150000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000211"></a>The
Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury (Steve
McCabe):</b> I can talk all
day.</div><a name="09061150000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000212"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> I am glad to hear
that.</div><a name="09061150000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the things that make the Minister such an attractive personality in
our politics is his ability to explain things in simple,
straightforward, layman terms when they might otherwise be presented in
the complicated language beloved of bureaucrats and legislators. It is
on such a matter that I would like him to assist us on clause 32. I am
not entirely sure what the clause proposes, and why it does so, so I
have a few questions. It is a sensible principle that a Committee
should have a collective idea of what legislation involves before it is
passed.</div><a name="09061150000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
what is drawback? Secondly, clause 32(4) provides for commissioners to
make payments to the director or the Secretary of State, while the main
provision of the clause is to arrange for the director of border
revenue to pay money to the commissioners. Under what circumstances is
it anticipated that the commissioners will have to start making
payments to the director or the Secretary of State? Thirdly, why is
there a requirement for subsection (5), which states that subsection
(4)
applies</div><a name="09061150000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether
or not the reason for a deficiency is or may be that an amount has been
paid or retained on the basis of an estimate that has proved or may
prove to be
inaccurate&#148;?</div><a name="09061150000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not understand why such clarification is needed, so I would be
grateful for an explanation. Finally, when is a payment to be treated
as a
repayment?</div><a name="09061150000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000213"></a>The
Minister for Borders and Immigration (Mr. Phil
Woolas):</b> Good morning, Miss Begg. I am grateful to the
hon. Gentleman for his kind words; I shall take them as a compliment,
even if they were not intended as such. The answer to his questions is
the all-powerful Treasury, and I will explain why. Clause 32 deals with

<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>the payment of revenue to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs
commissioners, and sets out provisions on the accounting of revenue
collected by our officials in the UK Border Agency. That revenue
includes duties and taxes that may be paid on goods by passengers who
go through the red channel at an airport, a ferry terminal and so on.
The second issue is the post. A significant amount of excise and duties
work is carried out on goods that come through the post, most of which
are legal, although some are
not.</div><a name="09061150000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause requires the director of border revenue&#151;the chief
executive of UKBA&#151;and the Secretary of State to pay any money by
way of revenue, or security for revenue, to HMRC in accordance with
Treasury directions. In other words, it is the Treasury&#146;s money,
not mine&#151;I just collect it. The intention is that moneys will be
paid directly into HMRC bank accounts, as now, so we are the agent
passing the money on. The hon. Gentleman was quite right to pick out
subsections (4) and (5).</div>
<a name="09061150000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
also provides for HMRC to make funds available to ukba if we need to
pay any money back. A ship or a container may drop some of its goods in
the UK and then move on. We may charge duty on all of it, but the
company will then point out what the manifest shows. There are
occasions when we need to pay money back, so the provision authorises
HMRC to give us money to do so. It is anticipated that the repayments
will be made directly by HMRC, but there might be occasions where it
needs to come through
us.</div><a name="09061150000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Revenue
is defined in the clause as including all duties and taxes. It also
includes penalties. Your constituents, Miss Begg, might have had their
cars impounded at Dover or at other ferry ports, but they are clearly
very honest. Some of mine might have come a cropper in that regard and
paid penalties. The clause covers those amounts and also the proceeds
of forfeiture. If someone has brought something into the country on
which they have not paid duty and there is forfeiture, there is revenue
from that. The clause is designed to oil the wheels. The reason, to
answer the hon. Gentleman directly, is that the Treasury holds the
purse strings.</div>
<a name="09061150000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000214"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> Will the Minister assist us on some of the detailed
questions about drawback? Why does subsection (5) need to be
included? I think I have understood what the repayments will be, but I
do not entirely understand why a payment can be treated as repayment,
under subsection
(7)(b)(ii).</div><a name="09061150000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000215"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I apologise. I did not answer the question about
drawback. Drawback is described as a method for repaying excise duty on
goods that have not been, and will not be, consumed in the United
Kingdom&#151;the goods coming in and going out. Subsection (5)
provides that subsection (4) will apply whether or not the reason for
the deficiency is, or might be, that an amount has been paid or
retained on the basis of an estimate that has proved, or might prove,
to be inaccurate. Again, if it is estimated from a ship&#146;s
manifest that four containers have been dropped off at Harwich and it
turns out that it was only three because the order was changed, the
clause allows us to reflect that. I am advised that the clause mirrors
provisions in the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005. If it
were not included, it could be argued that we could not cover such a
deficiency. I hope that I have provided the explanation that the hon.
Gentleman seeks.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div><a name="09061150000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000216"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> When is a payment a
repayment?</div><a name="09061150000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000217"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> A company might have made a payment to us in lieu
of any excise or duty, but the way in which accounts work over a
passage of time means that we can identify how much duty was required
only retrospectively. The company may bring in a tonne of goods every
month, but that is on average over the year&#151;it could be two
tonnes in January and half a tonne in February. The repayment in that
regard is the refund for the company that paid the duty. I hope that I
have explained the situation in clear English&#151;I think that I
have.</div><a name="09061150000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000218"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> I am extremely grateful for the Minister&#146;s
explanation. He has entirely justified the encomium I gave him at the

to require payment into the Consolidated
Fund</div><a name="09061150000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div><a name="09061150000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000219"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> I have a question about clause 33, although I was
so overwhelmed by the Minister&#146;s ability to turn these matters
into English that I nearly missed the opportunity to ask
it.</div><a name="09061150000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2)
states:</div><a name="09061150000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
order under this section may amend or repeal section
32&#148;.</div><a name="09061150000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
looks as though the Government intend to move to the scheme set out in
clause 33, rather than that in clause 32, which looks to be a temporary
arrangement. Will the Minister enlighten the Committee on whether that
is the Government&#146;s intention and give a sense of the time scale
in which it might be
achieved?</div><a name="09061150000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000220"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The short answer is to do with the all-powerful
Treasury. The power to require payment into the Consolidated Fund set
out in clause 33 provides the flexibility needed to meet any future
changes in the revenue accounting arrangements set out in clause 32,
which provides for revenue collected by the UK Border Agency to be paid
to HMRC. In that sense, there is no
timetable.</div><a name="09061150000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should
circumstances change, clause 33 will enable the Treasury to require the
Secretary of State and the director of border revenue to pay the
revenue they collect into the Consolidated Fund. That might be
necessary if there is a change in the accounting arrangements by HMRC
and/or the UK Border Agency, or if there is a significant improvement
in the amount of revenue we collect. We are currently responsible for
5 per cent. of Treasury take through tax and duty. That will
change significantly, for example when the Government&#146;s
successful economic policy increases trade with the rest of the world.
It would also change if, God forbid, with the advent of a Conservative
Government, our manufacturing suffered such a collapse that we had to
import everything, because duties would then go up.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div><a name="09061150000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will now
stop trying to buy time with hypothetical circumstances and read this
note. This clause allows flexibility should the amount of revenue
change. It mirrors the arrangements in the Revenue and Customs laws;
there is nothing new about it. It is there just in case, rather than
just in
time.</div><a name="09061150000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061150000221"></a><b class="B">Damian
Green</b> (Ashford) (Con): May I clear up a procedural point?
The Minister is one of the Treasury&#146;s representatives on
Earth&#151;I understand that he is a Treasury Minister as well as a
Home Office Minister. He says that this is to do with the all-powerful
Treasury. Presuming the Bill becomes law, does that mean that one Home
Office Minister must necessarily also be a Treasury Minister? Is that a
permanent feature of the arrangements that link HMRC and
ukba?</div><a name="09061150000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000222"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> That is not something of which I remind the Home
Secretary often, but it is helpful. The answer is yes, because the
director of border revenue, who is the chief executive of ukba, is
equivalent to a commissioner for Revenue and Customs in being the
accounting officer who is responsible for revenue. The Minister with
responsibility for Customs will shadow and oversee the director, just
as a Treasury Minister shadows and oversees commissioners. That will be
the case for as long as the Customs function remains within the Home
Office. In practice, for the enlightenment of the Committee, I am told
that I have a private secretary in an office in the Treasury, but I
have yet to get across there to find it&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>
No, not two salaries. On a serious note, this means that the
arrangements for and the relationship between duty levels&#151;and
VAT levels, in some respects, given the importance of customs to the
Revenue&#151;is set out in consultation with the Treasury and as part
of Budget preparations. I hope that that explains the
situation.</div><a name="09061150000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): I would like the Minister to
clarify a few points about the clause, which amends section 21 of the
UK Borders Act 2007 and extends to a larger number of officials the
duty of care regarding children in clause 57. Obviously, that applies
to those transferring over from the Customs function, but I have looked
at the impact statement and I could not see a specific listing about
this, although I may have missed something. More than 3,000 staff will
be transferring to the Borders Agency; what additional training on
child protection issues will they get and where has that been costed? I
cannot see that in the impact statement. Given recent concerns in the
press about particular people, it is important that the duty of care is
reinforced, and that we have evidence that those staff will get the
training that they need to deal with
minors.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div><a name="09061150000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000224"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on spotting an
important point. This is slightly confusing, but it is because of our
good intent, not because of any desire to hide anything. We think that
this is a positive part of the Bill&#151;as indeed are all the other
parts. The measures in part 1 are intended to come into force on Royal
Assent, but clause 57, which relates to the duty regarding children,
will not because we are publishing a consultation on how the new
guidelines will work so that the House and wider interest groups will
have the opportunity to influence them. Given the importance of this
issue, I did not want to bring those new guidelines in on Royal Assent
without first having given people the opportunity to consider them.
Similarly, I did not want the guidelines to be wrong or deficient in
any way because we had rushed them out, or to have unintended
consequences. That is what I am trying to
do.</div><a name="09061150000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about training. I have already discussed the
overall strategy for training, but he is right to ask for assurances
regarding transferring officers who have not had that training but will
have related issues in their job descriptions. As he knows, not all the
people he mentioned will be engaged in this area, but many will, and we
will include in the code of practice the obligations that officials
have regarding the care of children and keeping them safe from harm.
Indeed, one area covered by the code is staff training.</div>
<a name="09061150000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Keeping
children safe is what we refer to in management speak as a three-tier
learning and development programme designed to ensure that staff have
the knowledge to safeguard children. Tier 1 is an electronic package
designed to raise awareness of the issues around children, and is
compulsory for all UK Border Agency staff, regardless of grade or
department. Tier 2 is a classroom-based course where staff will have
regular contact with children or children&#146;s issues, or conduct
substantive interviews with them. Tier 3 involves job-specific training
for
officers.</div><a name="09061150000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is an important point, given that children do come into our care. As
ever, it is not the child&#146;s fault, whatever the state or the
parents have done. That is why the clause is important. I hope that
that reassures the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09061150000052"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000225"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I want to follow up on that briefly. As the
Minister rightly said in response to the important point raised by the
hon. Member for Rochdale, it is not the child&#146;s fault. Clearly,
under the Bill and the general provisions, we would not want children
themselves to suffer in any way. Would he take this opportunity to let
us know the state of play with funding for local authorities that are
particularly affected by being in charge of unaccompanied minors who
find themselves in this
country?</div><a name="09061150000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will be aware that responsibility falls disproportionately on
a small number of local authorities, notably Kent and Hillingdon but
others as well. He will also be aware, as I am, that, to put it
crudely, they thought that a settlement had been reached about a year
ago but it seems to be not quite falling apart but fragile at best.
This might be an opportune moment for him to reassure the Committee
and, through the Committee, the local authorities concerned about the
state of
play.</div><a name="09061150000054"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000231"></a>Damian
Green:</b> We now move on to a different and&#151;as I am
sure the Minister and the Committee accept&#151;much more contentious
part of the Bill, within which this is probably the most contentious
clause. I know that it is always a crude measure of how dangerous and
damaging a piece of legislation is, but judging by the letters and
e-mails that I and other colleagues on the Committee have received over
the past couple of days, this is certainly one of the most difficult
parts of the Bill. Indeed, that is partly because we owe the existence
of the clause to the debates and votes in another place.</div>
<a name="09061150000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause as
it stands, of course, does not reflect what the Government want to
happen. The Government have been resisting any kind of protection
against the retrospective application of their new proposals on
citizenship; indeed, they have tabled an amendment that would delete
the clause. I understand that that amendment has not been selected for
procedural reasons. At the moment, I assume that the Government still
do not want the clause to survive and that they are seeking to return
the position to what it was when the original Bill was introduced in
the House of Lords. I assume that the Minister will speak to his
amendments.</div><a name="09061150000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000232"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> It would help the Committee in its proceedings if
I indicated that although it is our intent to remove the existing
clause 39, it is also our intent to meet the argument that has been
advanced at a later stage in the proceedings on the Bill. I will go on
to explain our thinking in relation to that at the
appropriate
time.</div><a name="09061150000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000233"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for making that clear
at this stage. He will be aware of the controversy to which I have just
referred and that many people observing the debate will have had some
hope restored. It goes without saying, of course, that we have not yet
seen the details of the Government&#146;s proposals. Clearly,
everyone involved will reserve their position until they know what the
Government are proposing. I am grateful that he has accepted the logic
of his own position. I confess that I was slightly bemused when I saw
that the Government&#146;s amendment had been tabled, because on
Second Reading he
said:</div><a name="09061150000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
hon. Member for Ashford fairly raised a point relating to the highly
skilled migrants scheme; I concede that point, the court has ruled, and

heard those welcome words on Second Reading, as I say, I was surprised
that the Minister had taken the action he
had.</div><a name="09061150000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000234"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman is accurately reflecting the
position. It might help the Committee and the debate if I were to say
that, on advice from my lawyers, the existing wording of clause 39 does
not do what was intended. The Government would have tried to change the
clause in any event, but in light of the position that he has just
outlined, I wish to come back the
matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000235"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I am grateful for that. This will, in some ways, be
a procedurally difficult debate because it would clearly be sensible
for the Minister to make a speech, to which I could then respond. The
procedures, within which we have to operate, mean that I shall make a
speech first and then the Minister will respond, despite the fact that
he clearly has things to say that would set the rest of the debate in
context. However, off the top of my head, I am not conscious of the
procedural device that we could use&#151;other than the
world&#146;s longest ever intervention&#151;to conduct the debate
more rationally.</div>
<a name="09061150000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000236"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I could speak in support of your
amendment.</div><a name="09061150000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000237"></a>Damian
Green:</b> Whatever. In a sense, I am, unusually, more
interested to hear what the Minister has to say than what I have to
say. I hope that he does not take that as a
precedent.</div><a name="09061150000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government will introduce some new proposals and I am obviously not
aware of the level of detail they will contain, although I do not
suppose that the Minister will lay out a new clause. Nevertheless, it
is worth the Committee considering why the issue has raised such heat
and why it is so important. The root of the Government&#146;s
worry&#151;and something that infuses the whole of this part of the
Bill&#151;is that grants of citizenship are at an all-time high in
this country. The number of people granted British citizenship in the
UK increased by 7 per cent. in 2007 to 164,635, which is
straightforwardly the highest ever number in our country&#146;s
history. To put that in some kind of perspective, 10 years earlier, in
1997, only 37,010 people were granted citizenship. That is a
significant quantum of
increase.</div><a name="09061150000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister himself, last December, announced one of his various
crackdowns. He said that migrants would have to earn the right to
benefits under new citizenship rules. That was the first time the
Government had floated the idea, which we will come to in later
clauses, of probationary citizenship before earning a British passport.
My understanding of the context of the clause is that we are moving
away from the current three-stage naturalisation process. That process
comprises a period of temporary leave with restricted access to
benefits and services, then a definite leave to remain, during which
that access is no longer restricted, and finally British citizenship.
That has been the system for the past few decades. I understand that
the Government&#146;s proposals are for a new three-stage process,
which will comprise, first, a period of temporary leave much the same
as now, with restricted access to services and benefits. However, there
will then be another period of temporary leave, which the Government
are calling probationary citizenship.</div>
<a name="09061150000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
knows that that nomenclature was a subject of some controversy in the
Lords and beyond. It was felt that the word &#147;probation&#148;
gave the wrong flavour to those who are, by and large, working hard and
contributing to our society. At some stage somebody might come up with
a better name. Finally, after that probationary citizenship period,
there is, again, the granting of British citizenship, which gives
permanent residence and the access to services and benefits that we all
enjoy as British citizens.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div><a name="09061150000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
figures I have mentioned, I can see why the Government seek to change
the procedure and, in some ways, make it more difficult. A new British
passport is granted every five minutes, and I share the
Minister&#146;s concern that everyone who wants to settle here should
be enjoined to play a positive role in the life of this country. The
elaborate new procedure that the clause helps to set up might not be
the ideal way of doing that. There is a great danger of introducing new
layers of bureaucracy. I agree with the Minister that British
citizenship is a privilege and not necessarily a right, but significant
changes could be made that would more effectively achieve what he
wants.</div>
<a name="09061150000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
citizenship test is clearly inadequate for the Minister&#146;s
purpose. It is not a real test of knowledge or of commitment to this
country. Being able to take the test again and again until you pass it,
does not necessarily achieve a great purpose. I suspect that the
Minister shares my view of how we need to tighten up marriage
loopholes. To some extent, that frames the debate. It is why successive
Ministers who have held his position have wanted to put up hurdles to
make it more difficult to progress to citizenship. As a result, the
House of Lords took out the Government&#146;s original proposal, and
it now seems that the Minister will remove its clause and put in a new
and better one. At some stage soon we will hear what he has to
say.</div><a name="09061150000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of our amendments 43 and 44 is to narrow the debate slightly to
those areas where the Government have been embarrassed in the courts:
they have been taken to court and have lost. We would all agree that
this country benefits from highly skilled migrants, and the amendments
are specifically about such migrants. The root of our objections to the
Government&#146;s original proposal&#151;objections that were
carried through the Lords by my noble Friend Baroness Hanham&#151;was
that highly skilled people who had been here a number of years and
wanted to stay, and who were working towards citizenship, found the
rules changed from under them, retrospectively, in their view. The
rules were changed halfway through the game, which they thought unfair,
and I agree with them. I feel particularly strongly for those who have
come to the end of the process. It is not as though they have just
arrived in this country. As a society, we still have to decide on
them.</div><a name="09061150000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of the people most hurt by the original proposal have been in this
country for a number of years and have been contributing both to our
economy and our society. Changing the rules to make life more difficult
for them seems perverse as well as unfair. In many ways, they are
precisely the people we should be encouraging to come to this country,
although, as the Minister will be aware, Conservative Members believe
that the sheer numbers and the scale of change induced in our country
by immigration over the past 10 years have been too great and have
caused unnecessary stresses and strains. I am conscious that the
Minister himself sympathises with that view, which is why he says and
does lots of the things that he says and does in his current
post.</div><a name="09061150000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
in the modern world there is clearly a need for any advanced economy
that wants to stay an advanced economy to attract not just its fair
share of the brightest and the best from around the world but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>more than its fair share. We can use the many attractions that there are
in coming to this country to attract highly skilled migrants who will
help us to create the wealth of the future. As a result of that view,
which I cannot believe the Minister disagrees with, we have on
principle consistently opposed the retrospective elements of the
changes to the rules affecting highly skilled migrants to
Britain.</div>
<a name="09061150000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact, as
long ago as 2007, I was one of those delivering a petition with 4,000
signatures to the then Prime Minister. The petition opposed the
Government&#146;s original proposals to increase the qualifying
period for indefinite leave to remain from four to five years for
highly skilled migrants. As the Minister will be painfully aware, that
was a cause that did not restrict itself simply to handing in a
petition to Downing street or engaging Opposition parties. The
campaigners took the Government to court and won.</div>
<a name="09061150000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill in
its original form sought to do exactly that&#151;make changes to
indefinite leave to remain. A previous Bill sought to do similar things
with those who are close to completing their path to citizenship.
People who have made a commitment to the country are having that
commitment flung back in their faces. There is a moral aspect, but also
a practical aspect, because that sends a signal around the world. If
the highly skilled people around the world believe that this is not a
country that welcomes them, they will stop coming here. The more highly
skilled one is, the more marketable one is in an international context,
and the more choice one has about where to live for large parts of
one&#146;s working
life.</div><a name="09061150000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman will be aware that, in such terms, we are competing not
just with other European economies, but particularly with other
English-speaking countries. Many of those people will have English as a
second, if not a first, language. Therefore, they can look to Britain,
Australia or America&#151;to lots of prosperous, attractive countries
where they might want to live out their working lives. That is why we
tabled the amendment in the Lords. Our amendments seek to refine that
proposal to make it clear that we are talking about highly skilled
migrants.</div><a name="09061150000087"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000238"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman explain the difference of
approach between the amendment tabled by the Conservative spokesman in
the other place, and passed, and this one? The one in the House of
Lords applied to all migrants with limited leave to remain. The
amendment before us is highly specific, in that it deals with the
highly skilled migrant. Indeed, it does not even cover all the
categories that were entitled to coverage according to the judicial
review.</div>
<a name="09061150000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000239"></a>Damian
Green:</b> That is a fair point. There are two separate points
in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention, the first being why we are
amending our own amendment. That is precisely the point that I have
been seeking to make. It is hugely important for the future prosperity
of the country that we continue to attract, as I said, not just our
fair share, but more than our fair share, of highly skilled
migrants.</div><a name="09061150000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point, as the hon. Gentleman knows, is that it was the highly
skilled migrants forum that took the case to court. The further
refining of the amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>that we moved successfully in the Lords should help to focus the
Committee&#146;s attention on the most damaging effects of the policy
that the Government have been consistently adopting for several years
now, and from which I hope the Minister will tell us that he is about
to retreat. Now I have forgotten what the second half of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point
was.</div><a name="09061150000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000240"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> The second point is why the amendment does not
cover the length of time that highly skilled migrants were given to
apply for permanent leave to
remain.</div><a name="09061150000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000241"></a>Damian
Green:</b> That is a fair point. The answer involves those who
have got to the stage of having been in this country for a number of
years and who are therefore looking to the next stage of their lives.
They may have already taken the decision to apply for citizenship,
which I take as an indication that they want to reside here
permanently, conceivably for the rest of their lives, and never return
to their original homeland. Those people will feel particularly let
down and that what has been happening is unfair. It is specifically
that group that we sought to help with our amendment in the Lords and
our amendment
here.</div><a name="09061150000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Committee will accept the logic of what I am saying,
which is widely supported by a number of Committees in the House as
well as by the many thousands of people who are living in and
contributing to this country and who are obviously very concerned about
this. As far back as 2007, the Joint Committee on Human Rights
said:</div><a name="09061150000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
expressed our concern about the injustice done by retrospective changes
to rules which affect migrants&#146; eligibility to settle in the
UK&#148;.</div><a name="09061150000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee, chaired by a distinguished Labour Member of
Parliament, also
said:</div><a name="09061150000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
urge the Government not to repeat the unedifying spectacle of riding
roughshod over migrants&#146; legitimate expectations of settlement,
which undermined many migrants&#146; faith in the UK&#146;s
commitment to basic fairness...We recommend that clear
transitional provisions are made which meet the legitimate expectations
of those already in the
system.&#148;</div><a name="09061150000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems quite a good summary of the test that the Minister&#146;s new
proposals will have to meet, if we are to avoid returning to the issue
in
future.</div><a name="09061150000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
noble Friend Baroness Hanham said that those
who</div><a name="09061150000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have
faithfully adhered to the current rules and thought that they were
firmly established on the road to citizenship should not now have the
rug pulled from beneath their feet. They have an expectation of a
timescale in which their naturalisation will be
fulfilled.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I"> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 25
March 2009; Vol. 709, c.
705.]</div><a name="09061150000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is

test.</div><a name="09061150000187"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000242"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I am listening carefully to the arguments and agree
entirely with what Baroness Hanham said. Will the hon. Gentleman tell
us how people who came to this country on a work permit rather than on
a highly skilled migrant programme visa will be affected? My
understanding is that the amendment does not cover
them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div><a name="09061150000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000243"></a>Damian
Green:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. I do not want to weary
the Committee by repeating my explanation, but I want to focus on the
most highly skilled, because they are the most valuable resource to
this country. I have been getting similar e-mails in which people say
that, once someone is here on a work permit, they should have a glide
path to citizenship. It has been expressed to me that, if someone is in
this country with a work permit, it is a right to have British
citizenship. I do not agree. British citizenship is a privilege and not
a right to anyone who happens to work in this country. I do not
completely agree with those who think that, once people are here, they
should automatically be granted citizenship. There needs to be some
kind of commitment to this country and, if we can reach that stage, the
immigration system will be much more healthily balanced than it has
been in the past few
years.</div><a name="09061150000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am conscious that the hon. Gentleman is being entirely consistent with
what his party has believed for a long time, which is that our
immigration laws are much too tough. His party would like much more lax
immigration laws and to make it much easier for people who come here,
including those who come here illegally, to be given an amnesty so that
they can stay, and that all those groups of people should automatically
be given British citizenship. I just happen to
disagree.</div><a name="09061150000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000244"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I will not
bother explaining our policy to him, which is not as he has described
it. The judicial review touched on the fact that, under current
practice, there is an existing path to citizenship, which includes
people who have been here for a certain number of years on work visas.
Does the hon. Gentleman not accept the logic that, if clause 39 is
rejected and nothing is put in its place, the Government will be faced
with the present position, because it is existing practice, not what is
fairer or whatever? The judges will rule whether it is fair or right.
One consequence of his amendment will be a flurry of court cases and
judgments that will cost the Government, who will end up conceding
anyway.</div><a name="09061150000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000245"></a>Damian
Green:</b> That may or may not be the case. To clarify matters
for the Committee, the hon. Gentleman seemed to argue that the judicial
review case applied to everyone. On 8 April 2009, Mrs.
Justice Cox decided:</div>
<a name="09061150000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
respect of all persons admitted to the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme
as at 7 November 2006, those individuals are entitled to the benefits
of the scheme (including settlement) according to the terms (including
as to qualifying period) which applied on the date when they
joined.&#148;</div><a name="09061150000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the hon. Gentleman believes that the judgment applied to anyone,
whether they were on the highly skilled migrant programme or just had a
normal work permit, he is wrong. He can argue the case that it should
apply, but that is not what the judge
said.</div><a name="09061150000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000246"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> May I also read into the record for the benefit of
clarity the fact that the judgment to which the hon. Gentleman is
referring said nothing about citizenship? It dealt with promises made
about indefinite leave to remain, which might help his point of
view.</div>
<a name="09061150000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000247"></a>Damian
Green:</b> It is a separate
point.</div><a name="09061150000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000248"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Legally, it is a very important
point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div><a name="09061150000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000249"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I know, but it is a separate point. I know from the
debate on Second Reading that the Minister would prefer those who have
decided to settle here permanently to become citizens. I can see the
logic of that position. I take his point about the hugely important
legal issues, but I think we agree that, if somebody wants to commit
themselves to this country, then in most circumstances we would prefer
them to become a British citizen and make that commitment. Factually,
about 60 per cent. of them do. We are already at that
stage.</div><a name="09061150000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
could easily imagine circumstances in which somebody&#151;an American
citizen perhaps&#151;would not want to give up their home
citizenship. They may spend most of their working life in this country
but actually retire to their own country. In fiscal terms, I suspect
that that is the best deal that a British taxpayer could get out of
someone: their entire working life in this country&#151;creating
wealth, paying taxes and so on&#151;and then retiring to their own
country. That is not a debate for
now.</div><a name="09061150000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is interesting and heartening to hear the Minister say what he has
already said. The intervention by the hon. Member for Rochdale would
have more validity if the Minister had not already said what he has
said. It is clear that the Government want to remove clause 39 and
replace it with something else. We can have a substantive debate on the
Government&#146;s proposal when the Minister comes back with it. We
may well share views about whether that is likely to be satisfactory or
not; no doubt we can all look forward to another bombardment of e-mails
and letters, when the detail is produced. I recommend that we watch
this
space.</div><a name="09061150000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have been grappling with the issue. Lord Brett indicated in
a letter dated 19 March 2009 that some transitional measures were being
considered for those who already have ILR or limited leave to enter or
remain in the UK but that they would not be finalised until the summer
of this year at the earliest. One might have thought that with
legislation passing through the House the Government would have
finalised that rather important issue first, but that is in
parenthesis. He went through various categories of applicant who would
benefit from transitional arrangements of one sort or
another.</div>
<a name="09061150000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The letter is
extremely important not only for this debate but for all future debates
on the subject. Lord Brett
said:</div><a name="09061150000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
application for naturalisation which is received by UKBA before the
earned citizenship clauses are commenced but which remains undecided,
will be considered under existing section 6 and Schedule 1 of the
British Nationality Act 1981, i.e. the application will not be affected
by the earned citizenship
proposals.&#148;</div><a name="09061150000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to
say:</div><a name="09061150000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
migrant who has ILR in the UK will be deemed to have permanent
residence leave for the purposes of the earned citizenship clauses.
They will not need to make an application to be recognised as a
permanent resident, or pay any sort of fee and they will continue to
have full access to benefits and services, subject to the general
eligibility
criteria.&#148;</div><a name="09061150000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
also
said:</div><a name="09061150000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Migrants
with ILR when the earned citizenship clauses in the Bill are commenced
will be able to apply to naturalise under existing section 6 and
Schedule 1 of the British Nationality Act 1981 provided they apply
within a set period after the clauses have been commenced. Although we
have not yet confirmed this period, it is likely to be for between
18-24 months after the clauses 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>are commenced. We think a period such as this would be fair given that
the aim behind our proposals is that we want to encourage more people
to become British
citizens.&#148;</div><a name="09061150000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">His
final point
was:</div><a name="09061150000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Migrants
who are currently in the UK and have existing limited leave to enter or
remain which is regarded, under the new earned citizenship system, to
be a qualifying immigration status, will be able to count that time
towards the qualifying period for naturalisation as a British citizen.
For example a person here under Tier 2 of the Points-Based System
before the earned citizenship clauses in the Bill are commenced will be
able to count that time as a type of qualifying temporary residence
leave, and therefore count this towards the revised qualifying periods
for
naturalisation.&#148;</div><a name="09061150000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise for reading all that in detail. It is important, because it
indicates the Government&#146;s willingness to help. The Government
are inching towards some kind of sanity in this regard.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Some kind of
sanity.</div><a name="09061150000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
the detail is very important. Offering qualifying periods to people
with limited leave to remain, which can count towards their qualifying
period for citizenship, is a step forward. The jump that the Government
have to make&#151;the steps that they have not yet followed&#151;is
what they are going to do to people who are already here, which is
clearly the point at issue. The Minister will be aware that the
concessions offered by Lord Brett in another place were simply regarded
as inadequate. They did not satisfy the House of Lords, and I suspect
that they would not satisfy this House, too.</div>
<a name="09061150000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
every time the Government have put this matter either to a court or to
a House full of people who are not necessarily under the lash of the
Whips, they have lost the argument. If the Minister is saying that he
accepts that they have lost the argument and he will come back with
something that we can all find satisfactory, then I would welcome it. I
have quoted the Joint Committee on Human Rights, but the Minister will
be aware that other groups, such as the Migrants&#146; Rights
Network, have opposed the Government&#146;s proposals on the matter.
Moreover, the Home Affairs Committee has looked fairly quizzically at
this part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09061150000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
the Minister has an enormously widespread coalition assembled against
him. If I can give him some comfort, we on the Conservative Benches do
not go all the way with those who are saying&#151;as I think that the
Liberal Democrats are&#151;that everyone who is here should not have
any of the new citizenship tests applied to them. That would be a step
too far. A balance needs to be struck and, so far, the Government have
struck it wrongly on one side and the Liberal Democrats are striking it
wrongly on the other. However, we seem to be moving slowly towards
sanity.</div><a name="09061150000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000250"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I am puzzled by the position of the Conservatives.
Again, I shall quote the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key), who
said during the Second Reading of the
Bill:</div><a name="09061150000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Will
he also fight hard to retain clause 39, which was put into the Bill in
the other place with the support of our noble
Friends?&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 2 June 2009; Vol. 493,

the hon. Gentleman do that, and if not, why

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000251"></a>Damian
Green:</b><b class="B"> </b>I happily assure the hon. Gentleman that if
the Minister were to propose the deletion of clause 39, we would oppose
him. However, we already know that the Minister has said that he will
not do that. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is asking me a retrospective hypothetical
question, which is fascinating but not desperately relevant. The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000253"></a>Damian
Green:</b> The Minister should listen to the Immigration Law
Practitioners Association, which has said that the Minister&#146;s
statements are not clear. It is referring here to Lord Brett and not
the Minister before us today. Although I do not always agree with ILPA,
this is a reasonable piece of
analysis:</div><a name="09061150000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
appears the Government's position is that some element of transitional
protection should extend beyond merely those on the
HSMP.&#148;</div><a name="09061150000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure whether the Minister wishes to comment on that. The ILPA
wishes to see greater clarity from the Government</div>
<a name="09061150000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as to the
commitment intended to be given&#151;which from Lord Brett&#146;s
statement appears to be that anyone on ILR at the commencement of the
new path to citizenship will be able to continue to citizenship under
existing provisions, anyone who has made an ILR application at that
time will also be able to continue under existing provisions and that
those with outstanding human rights, humanitarian protection and asylum
claims at that time will be able to continue under existing
provisions.&#148;</div><a name="09061150000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister were to confirm that that is true, it would be an
interesting and significant shift in Government policy.</div>
<a name="09061150000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
illustrating the importance of highly skilled migrants&#151;a point
that divides me from the hon. Member for Rochdale. I will quote from
one of the dozens of e-mails on that topic. Mr. Matt Garner
of West Sussex writes:</div>
<a name="09061150000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
I moved here, my US-based start-up company was acquired by a
London-based company who was subsequently awarded a Queens Award for
Innovation the following year. My wife has just been notified that she
will shortly be profiled as the &#145;Innovator of the Month&#146;
in the UK&#146;s national Nursing Times industry paper. We&#146;re
active in our communities and have leadership positions in our local
church. We&#146;re exceptionally good at what we do. We have job
offers on the table from all around the world. We&#146;ve never
broken any laws or been in any trouble. As we no longer feel welcome in
the United Kingdom, we are taking our skills, our talents and our
economic contributions with us to a country that will nurture us, or at
least, not mislead or impede us. What&#146;s especially appealing is
a country that will give us the right to stay, without indefinitely
reserving the right to boot us out at short notice depending on the
prevailing political or economic
conditions.&#148;</div><a name="09061150000188"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09061150000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Minister will agree that if such people feel rejected
by the Government&#146;s proposals thus far, something is going
seriously wrong. I will not bore the Committee by reading out other
e-mails, but the hon. Gentleman will be aware that many people in this
country are having similar thoughts. Such feelings spread quickly
because, inevitably, ex-pats tend to live in their own communities to
some extent and talk to each other. In a world where I can receive an
e-mail from West Sussex that can go around the world at the same speed,
a country&#146;s image can change rapidly.</div>
<a name="09061150000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final plea
to the Minister is that when he reveals the details of his

Woolas:</b> That will not do much for the country&#146;s
image around the world.</div>
<a name="09061150000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000255"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I want a cap just as the Americans and the
Australians have a cap. They are two of the most attractive immigrant
destinations for highly skilled people anywhere in the world. It does
not make a country unattractive. A Government who keep fiddling with
and changing the rules and treating people unfairly make a country
unattractive to highly skilled migrants. That is the charge laid upon
the Minister&#146;s Government over the past few years. A clear and
consistent policy that says that we need a limit on the number of
people who come here, that those who come are welcome and that we will
not mess them around by changing the rules every five minutes makes a
country more welcoming than the system of the past 10 years. There has
been unlimited migration and people have found their position being
changed by successive legislation; that is particularly true for the
highly skilled. Every year we have had an immigration Bill that has
changed the rules for many
people.</div><a name="09061150000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister need not be indignant. He knows about the current situation,
and I hope that he is about to reveal something to address this
problem, which many thousands of people accept is serious. It has been
one small-scale disaster of the many disasters in the
Government&#146;s immigration policy.</div>
<a name="09061150000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000256"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> This is probably one of the most important parts of
the Bill. Part 2 deals with a new Government policy, and we are
generally supportive of the thrust of the measures. We have concerns
about the details&#151;how it will work and, more importantly, the
transitional arrangements. Given that the Bill has had pre-legislative
scrutiny, gone through the House of Lords and had an amendment on
transitional arrangements, it is unedifying that the Government and the
main Opposition do not have well-thought-out policies on such
arrangements. In a sense, that is at the nub of clause 39. It is about
dealing with those who have limited, not indefinite, leave to remain.
The hon. Member for Ashford, in his amendment, is totally inconsistent
with what his noble Friend said in the other place. He is inconsistent
even in the category that he is dealing with, in terms of the judgment.
His clause would reduce the amount of time that people on the highly
skilled migrant programme have to apply for
citizenship.</div><a name="09061150000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s position, given that they are the Government, is
equally deplorable. I will read the part of the Joint Committee on
Human Rights report that the hon. Member for Ashford did not read,
because it does not apply just to the highly skilled migrant
programme:</div><a name="09061150000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bill does not make clear what the effect of the new provisions will be
on those whose applications for citizenship are pending on the date at
which the Act comes into force, or on others further down the path to
citizenship, such as those with limited leave to remain who have not
yet qualified for indefinite leave to remain. There are no transitional
arrangements.&#148;</div><a name="09061150000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
paragraph refers to all those who have come into this country and been
granted limited leave to remain, and who expect, under the current
policy&#151;the path to citizenship that we now operate is nowhere
near as well defined as the Bill seeks to make it&#151;that a few
years down the line they will be able to apply for British
citizenship.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div><a name="09061150000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will quote
from an e-mail of a kind that many of us have received, because it
shows how much inconsistency there is, and how clauses 43 and 44 will
not work in regard to those who came into this country with a work
permit. It says that</div>
<a name="09061150000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;my wife and I
are highly skilled individuals who have lawfully been here on a work
permit (rather than the HSMP visa) for 4 years and are on
the cusp of applying for ILR early next year. When we migrated to the
UK in 2005, there was no difference in the time period to qualify for
ILR or citizenship irrespective of whether one chose the work-permit
route or the HSMP route. Indeed, even today, the UK Border agency
aggregates the time one has spent on work-permit and HSMP routes (in
the event an individual switched from one route to the other during his
stay in the
UK)&#148;.</div><a name="09061150000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000257"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument is
well-researched and coherent, and I respect the point that he is
making, but does that not come to the nub of it? The alleged
inconsistencies that he is highlighting between the different routes
are based on the premise&#151;and the intention, according to the
e-mail that he just read&#151;that a grant for temporary leave for a
specific purpose, in this case work, would lead both to indefinite
leave to remain and to citizenship. That is the intent of the person
whose e-mail he just read. The granting of temporary leave carries no
intent that it should lead automatically to indefinite leave or
citizenship. Is not that the point that we are
debating?</div><a name="09061150000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000258"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> The Minister makes an interesting point that I feel
will ultimately be tested in the courts. Mrs. Justice Cox
commented on a case on 6 April. Admittedly, it involved the highly
skilled migrant programme, but her point, in my view, applies equally
to other people. She said that there
was</div><a name="09061150000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
substantive, legitimate expectation that the terms on which you joined
the HSMP would be the terms on which you qualified for
settlement&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061150000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment, the
grant of a place on the HSMP in itself does not guarantee indefinite
leave to remain. The point that she is making is that there is a
substantive and legitimate expectation that it would lead to
settlement.</div>
<a name="09061150000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was why Baroness Hanham moved the amendment in the House of Lords and
we are now dealing with clause 39. In my view, she got to the nub of
the problem:</div>
<a name="09061150000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
people who have faithfully adhered to the current rules and thought
that they were firmly established on the road to citizenship should not
now have the rug pulled from beneath their feet. They have an
expectation of a timescale in which their naturalisation will be
fulfilled...The Government have already changed the highly skilled
migrant programme and applied that
retrospectively&#148;.</div><a name="09061150000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
also said
that</div><a name="09061150000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is inherently unfair to people who have started on a process to change
it suddenly
midway&#148;.</div><a name="09061150000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#151;[<i class="I">Official

39 seeks to provide a transitional period.</div>
<a name="09061150000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000259"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving
way. He is arguing his point very clearly. The case and ruling that he
refers to deal with, of course, the highly skilled migrant route, as
distinct from other grants of temporary leave. I accept the judgment,
politically and morally, but the difference is that we, as a country, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>have encouraged highly skilled migrants to come here in the first place.
The hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point is that the principle should
apply to the other route, and he says that the matter will go to
court&#151;it has already been to court. The ruling in the Ooi case
was that in the work permit area, there was no promise that the rules
would not be changed or that ILR would be granted when the application
was made. I accept the point in relation to highly skilled migrants,
but I do not accept it in the other areas. However, I do, as I will
come on to explain, accept the need for a transitional arrangement in
those cases.</div>
<a name="09061150000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000260"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that
and I would like to give another example of the sort of case that he
and I deal with on a fairly regular basis. It has to do with someone
who comes into this country as a spouse of a British citizen, is
granted the two years&#146; temporary leave to remain and then, after
two years, applies for the permanent leave to remain. As the rules
stand now, that period is to be extended. Mrs. Justice
Cox&#146;s point was that when the person comes into this country,
they have a &#147;substantive and legitimate expectation&#148;. In
my role as Member of Parliament for Rochdale over the last four years,
I could quote scores of examples of people who have come into the UK
with a spouse and now have indefinite leave to remain. There is an
expectation in such circumstances.</div>
<a name="09061150000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
clause 39 may not have been properly worded. The noble Lords wanted to
do something that the Government had patently failed to do during the
Bill&#146;s pre-legislative period and during debates in the House of
Lords&#151;come up with clear, and fair transitional rules. They have
inserted a measure that provides a period during which people who are
on that route can legitimately apply without having to go on to the new
system. I hope that when we have the debate, the Minister&#146;s
promises will apply not just to the highly skilled migrant programme,
but to a much wider range of individuals who have come into this
country as migrants, with a legitimate and substantive expectation that
they are on a route towards British citizenship and being able
permanently to remain here.</div>
<a name="09061150000189"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="09061150000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regards to the Conservative policy, I find an overwhelming difference
between what Baroness Hanham said and what the hon. Member for Ashford
is now saying. I cannot understand what his policy is. It is
inconsistent. I quote the hon. Member for Salisbury, because, as
someone who deals with this matter, he made the position very
clear:</div>
<a name="09061150000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;British
immigration policy must be tough, but it must also be fair. Clause 39
refers to exceptions to the application of part 2, which deals with
citizenship. In my constituency, there are about 40 families from the
Malayali community in southern India. Those people have perfectly
respectable jobs as doctors, computer engineers and so on. They have
broken not a single rule and are not a burden on the state. They have
been working here and they will shortly qualify for citizenship of this
country. Under the Bill, unless we keep the amendment that was made in
another place, they will not qualify for citizenship because the period
of grace will disappear.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Commons,</i> 2 June 2009; Vol. 493, c.
175.]</div><a name="09061150000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Member for Ashford will not press his amendments
because they do not deal with the people whom his own colleagues have
said will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>supported, and they do not provide a proper, fair, earned route to
citizenship. The shadow Home Secretary
said:</div><a name="09061150000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000261"></a>Damian

decide what to do. That seems a rational
approach.</div><a name="09061150000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to be clear about the Liberal Democrat position. The hon. Member
for Rochdale appears to be arguing eloquently and coherently that
anyone who is here on a work permit should have the automatic right to
move towards citizenship. Is that his
position?</div><a name="09061150000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061150000262"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> No. We want to see what clause 39 attempted to do,
which is to provide a framework from which people can apply. That does
not mean that it applies to every category of migrant. It needs
amplification, and I accept that the Government should bring out
detailed policies setting out how that will be done. The test should be
the &#147;legitimate and fair&#148; one applied by Mrs.
Justice Cox. I accept the Minister&#146;s point that everyone coming
to this country on a work permit does not have an automatic right to
move towards citizenship. I also make the point many people who have
come to this country have gone on to that system because they have been
advised that there is no difference in what they have to do compared to
the HSM programme. There will have to be a judgment, and the situation
will have to be looked at individually. Those who come here on a spouse
visa, and have a legitimate right to complete their passage within a
certain period, do not have that protection in the Bill. That is
completely wrong.</div>
<a name="09061150000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will clarify at this late stage&#151;it is very
late&#151;that we will get fair and clear guidance from the
Department that ensures there is a proper transitional period for all
those people who have started their journey. That is all that we seek.
These are people who have come to this country and started a journey
towards citizenship, but the rules as they are framed at the moment are
virtually being rewritten. If we started playing a football game, and
the rules were changed suddenly halfway through, disallowing certain
goals or whatever, we would be crying foul.</div>
<a name="09061150000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">These people
have come into this country legitimately. They have gone through a
process by which they thought they would get permanent leave to remain,
leading to British citizenship. In my view, they have a legitimate
right to have their passage accepted. I fear that if the Government do
not come up with fair rules, we will end up with a situation, as with
the HSMP, where the programme will be devalued and Britain&#146;s
reputation will be damaged because we have not been fair. I look
forward to the Minister tabling amendments.</div>

Prosser</b> (Dover) (Lab): I share the discomfort of the hon.
Member for Ashford, in that we are attempting to respond to measures
that we have no real knowledge about. I also share many of the views of
the hon. Member for Rochdale and his bemusement at the sudden change in
the Conservative party&#146;s attitude to these matters.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div><a name="09061150000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Back in 1999,
shortly after I came into this place, we had our first immigration and
asylum Bill and, in my naivety, I thought that that was going to sort
everything out and there would not be another Bill for the next
10 years. Yet here we are, on our eighth or ninth, and there
is another one in the pipeline. The basis of that&#151;I had the
privilege to be on the special Committee that looked into all these
issues&#151;was the overall balance of firmness and but
fairness.</div>
<a name="09061150000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my own dealings in Dover during those times when immigration, including
illegal immigration, and asylum were top of the agenda&#151;they
dominated all of my correspondence and all of my surgeries to a huge
extent&#151;I tried to apply that same rule. I supported quite firm,
and some would say draconian, measures that my own Government were
taking to crack down on illegal immigration, dealing rationally with
asylum seekers, but balancing that, in my own mind at least, by helping
and supporting legitimate immigrants and asylum seekers, as I saw them,
to see that they got a fair crack of the whip, that their case was
heard and that justice was seen to be done.</div>
<a name="09061150000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this
matter, unless we are going to hear something very refreshing and
surprising from the Minister, I do not think we have got that balance
of fairness and firmness. We are now talking about toughness and
fairness, and I could live with that as well, so long as there was that
important
balance.</div><a name="09061150000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Home Affairs Committee looked at this matter in pre-legislative
scrutiny, but at the time the draft Bill was not complete. There was
nothing in the Bill about transitional arrangements, but we wholly
expected&#151;and the report shows this&#151;that there would be
transitional arrangements in place to deal with people already in the
pipeline&#151;people who had come into the country properly and
legitimately and had a legitimate and substantive expectation that they
would eventually get indefinite leave to remain and/or citizenship. Had
there been anything about that in the Bill, I am confident that we
would have made a firm recommendation that transitional arrangements,
in accordance with clause 39, should be made. We have heard what the
Joint Committee on Human Rights has said, and I wholly endorse all
those statements&#151;I will not go through them again. My view is
that even if clause 39 is technically wrong, its spirit should survive
in the eventual
Act.</div><a name="09061150000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of Members have talked about the tests they would use. I have a
much simpler test. My test is sitting in my surgery in Dover, meeting
someone in the system who brings out their work permit&#151;I am not
narrowing this to highly skilled workers&#151;and says,
&#147;Mr. Prosser, it says here that, after four
years&#148;&#151;or five years, or whatever it is
now&#151;&#147;I can legitimately expect to move from limited leave
to remain to indefinite leave to remain, and to citizenship, and now
your Government have reneged on that.&#148; They might use the word
&#147;promise&#148;, but certainly, there is a commitment. The
text, in black and white, gives them expectations that they can remain.
If I cannot look my constituent in the face and find a rational, just
and fair response, then I think the test has
failed.</div><a name="09061150000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061150000264"></a><b class="B">Mr.
