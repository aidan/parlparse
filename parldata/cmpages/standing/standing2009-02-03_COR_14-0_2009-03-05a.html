<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000449"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Maria
Eagle):</b> Good afternoon, Mr Cook, and members of the
Committee. At our previous sitting, I was just coming to the end of my
remarks to persuade the Committee that it is not necessary, as the
amendments seek, to extend the provisions for witness anonymity to the
coronial system. I had made most of my arguments, and it is not
necessary to repeat
them.</div><a name="09030565000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
members of the Committee involved in the Criminal Evidence (Witness
Anonymity) Act 2008 will recall that the legislation was brought
forward to deal with a problem arising from the House of Lords judgment
in the case of Davis. It was not enacted, because we sought to replace
common-law rules on witness anonymity with statutory rules. Our hand
was made to move, as a consequence of that judgment. That did not
relate to anything other than common law, and it was clear that the
coronial system was perfectly able to cope as it currently works. On
that basis, we do not accept amendments that would extend the breach of
the statutory provisions to the coronial system. I hope that my
explanation has satisfied those who spoke in the debate and that the
hon. and learned Gentleman will be able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09030565000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09030565000450"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): I will withdraw my
amendment, but I want to make some closing remarks. We all know what
the House of Lords decided in the case of Davis, and it is fair to say
that, if we follow the judgments from the first instance decision 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column541" />Column number: 541</div>through to the House of Lords, no central reference was made to the
coroners&#146; courts system. The decision concerned a double
shooting that involved a defendant who had fled abroad and who was
brought back to the United Kingdom and tried. The trial judge made an
order that the House of Lords decided was outside the ambit of the
common law, and that the common law could no longer be extended in the
way in which the judge had
sought.</div><a name="09030565000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
House of Lords said that Parliament should make up its mind how best to
deal with the matter, and we dealt with it in an emergency sitting last
July. At least on the evidence that we have received so far, that
system has worked reasonably well, despite the many concerns that
others who share my views about anonymity and I expressed at the time.
However, nowhere were similar proceedings or procedures for coronial
courts excluded, either expressly or by implication. Despite what the
Minister has said, I disagree with her reasoning, but I shall not push
the matter further. I will invite my noble Friends in another place to
consider the matter at greater leisure than we have at the moment. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09030565000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn</i>.</div><a name="09030565000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000451"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I beg to move amendment 196, in
clause 70, page 41, line 16, after
second &#145;court&#146;, insert &#145;in
writing&#146;.</div><a name="09030565000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000452"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 202, in
clause 70, page 41, line 23, after
&#145;court&#146;, insert &#145;in
writing&#146;.</div><a name="09030565000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000453"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I have two short points, which need not detain
the Committee too long. Clause 70 deals with applications for witness
anonymity orders. Subsection (2) includes a requirement
that, if the prosecutor is making the application, he should inform the
court of the identity of the witness. Subsection (3) deals with the
mirror procedure for a defendant&#146;s application; they, too, must
inform the court, and the prosecutor, of the identity of the witness.
On subsection (2), we are simply suggesting that the information from
the prosecutor to the court should be in writing. A defendant&#146;s
application, too, must be made in writing to the court&#151;I have
deliberately not suggested that it should be in writing to the
prosecutor.</div><a name="09030565000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say that from personal experience. Far too often in the Crown court,
applications seem to bounce up and down without anyone really being
prepared for them, partly because people do not communicate with each
other sufficiently&#151;the Crown Prosecution Service does not talk
to the police, the police do not talk to the CPS, no one talks to
witnesses and everyone turns up in court, almost by chance, on the same
day to deal with the same issues, although sometimes they do not. The
amendments are a plea for the Government to urge those who administer
the prosecution system to talk to each other through a system that does
not lead to confusion by communicating in
writing.</div><a name="09030565000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be suggested that my proposal is too inflexible&#151;I
appreciate that sometimes applications have to be made quickly or in
unforeseen circumstances. I am not pressing the Committee to vote on
the issue; I am simply urging the Government to encourage those engaged
in such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column542" />Column number: 542</div>activity to speak to each other, to communicate and to prevent
unnecessary and foreseeable delays in the administration of particular
trials.</div><a name="09030565000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09030565000454"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Briefly, I endorse the
comments of my hon. and learned Friend, who has much more court
experience than almost anyone in the Room&#151;I do not claim to have
that.</div><a name="09030565000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am interested in the audit trail of such proceedings. If nothing is
said in writing, the basis of what is being done is not at all clear. I
presume it would be possible to go back into the CPS file and see what
the deliberation was, and it is important that the court should have
some tidiness in the matter. I understand the need for urgency and that
circumstances might arise at short notice, but the question arising is
whether, if not in writing, there should be some record, such as an
e-mail, that would be as acceptable as writing. However, a hasty phone
call, in which details such as the first name are mistranscribed, is
not
sufficient.</div><a name="09030565000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000455"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> The amendments would require the prosecutor or
defence to inform the court of the witness&#146;s true identity in
writing when making an application for witness anonymity. I understand
the points of the hon. and learned Gentleman and of the hon. Member for
Daventry, but, when the prosecutor or defence is making a witness
anonymity application, amendments 196 and 202 go too far, because it is
not normal or usual for a statute to lay down precise procedures that
the court should adopt. Clause 72 already makes it clear that the court
must be informed of the witness&#146;s identity unless, in the case
of a prosecutor, the court directs otherwise, but the usual way of
making sure that the procedures used are correct is for them to be set
out either in a judicial practice direction or, more usually, in the
rules of the
court.</div><a name="09030565000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will recall that the provision was in emergency legislation
in its first incarnation, and a judicial practice direction was issued,
which has been governing how the courts do what the Act gives them
power to do. That is how it has been done since the passage of the
emergency legislation. The court determines the application in
accordance with the requirements and tests set out.</div>
<a name="09030565000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The criminal
procedure rule committee chaired by the Lord Chief Justice is
considering draft rules on witness anonymity applications, which are
intended to replace the practice directive once the witness anonymity
provisions are re-enacted&#151;provided, of course, that they are.
The rules will take account of the experience of practitioners when
operating the current procedures, and I am sure that the committee will
consider such matters as those raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman
and any that arise during parliamentary debate. On that basis, I hope
that he agrees that such detailed matters of procedure are best left,
and can be safely left, to the criminal procedure rule committee, which
is the appropriate place for them. Under those circumstances, I hope
that he will be happy to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000459"></a>David
Howarth:</b> We come to some unfinished business on the debate
about the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008, the emergency
legislation to which the Minister has referred. One notable omission
from the 2008 Act was any explicit provision for the appointment of
independent or special counsel to assist the court in deciding whether
there should be an anonymity order. The template for last year&#146;s
legislation was, roughly, an Act from New Zealand, the Evidence Act
2006, which allowed and, indeed, encouraged the court to appoint
independent counsel to assist it in coming to its decision. In New
Zealand, the independent counsel is appointed, undertakes
investigations and reports to the court, about both the necessity for
anonymity and the credibility of the witness.</div>
<a name="09030565000373"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Last
year, many of us thought that we should make similar provision in this
country for two reasons&#151;for the purposes of the defence,
normally, but for the purposes of the prosecution, too. From the point
of view of the defence, there will be cases in which there is doubt
about whether the credibility of the witness really is an issue. The
prosecution might think that there is no particular problem with the
witness&#146;s credibility, because, in the prosecution&#146;s
view, the witness was a bystander who simply saw an event. The question
is whether they recall accurately what they saw, as opposed to being a
witness who might be hostile to the defendant because of some other
relationship.</div><a name="09030565000416"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="09030565000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cases
will occur when it is not clear in advance whether the credibility of
the witness is an issue. The hon. and learned Member for Medway
(Mr. Marshall-Andrews) made that point vividly in our
debates on the Floor of the House last year. In such cases, independent
counsel should be able to carry out an investigation on behalf of the
court, so that they know the nature of the case before deciding whether
to grant an order. The independent counsel would not decide the matter,
but they would be able to investigate in a way that would not be
possible if the case were to proceed simply on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 544</div>basis of what the prosecution said. Obviously, the defence cannot play
an active role, which they can only do if they know who the witness
is.</div><a name="09030565000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other side, independent counsel could be a safeguard for the
prosecution in cases when a court is uncertain whether it should grant
an order and does not have enough evidence before it to do so. In such
cases, independent counsel could come in and help the court to decide
in favour of an order. There are some cases&#151;not all&#151;in
which independent counsel would make the process fairer for both
sides.</div><a name="09030565000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
year, the Government resisted all attempts to put a power to appoint
independent counsel in statute. Ministers argued that independent
counsel were appointed in the Davis case, which the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough has mentioned, but made no difference to the
outcome or fairness of the proceedings. As we have discovered, the
trouble with that argument is that independent counsel were appointed
only at Court of Appeal stage&#151;there was no independent counsel
at the original trial stage&#151;so the example was not relevant or
important.</div><a name="09030565000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate continued vociferously, especially in the House of Lords and, in
the end, the Secretary of State for Justice undertook to give
&#147;active and urgent consideration&#148; to providing an
explicit power to appoint independent counsel before publishing the
permanent replacement Bill, which we are discussing. At that time,
Ministers also claimed that the courts already had an inherent power to
appoint special counsel, but that turned out to be a power to ask the
Attorney-General to do so, which was slightly less direct than a court
appointing counsel. Nevertheless, Ministers undertook to remind the
judges of the possibility, which they
did.</div><a name="09030565000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Attorney-General has issued guidelines on the prosecutor&#146;s role
in applications for witness anonymity orders under the Criminal
Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008 that refer to the possibility of
independent counsel. However, the guidelines are quite disappointing.
They maintain the line that the appointment of special counsel should
be exceptional. I am not sure whether &#147;exceptional&#148; is
the right test. The test is taken from public interest immunity law,
which involves a very different set of circumstances. In PII cases,
witness credibility is less important, and it is rarely an issue at
all. Frustratingly, the guidelines also assume that, in PII cases,
independent counsel somehow represents the defendant. That was never
the intention of those of us who proposed independent counsel. The
Government claimed that there was some confusion in the proposals, but
there never was. We always wanted to follow the New Zealand proposal
that the independent counsel should assist the court. That is similar
to the situation in a coroner&#146;s court, which we have spent a
long time discussing. The counsel is to the court rather than to the
defendant, and amendment 100 addresses that
problem.</div><a name="09030565000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a question whether there should be a test for the appointment of
special counsel. I originally took the view that there should not be,
and that such appointments should be completely at the discretion of
the court&#151;there is a Conservative amendment to that effect.
However, in the spirit of compromise, I am offering a slightly more
restricted test, namely that when an order is applied for,</div>
<a name="09030565000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the court must
consider whether the appointment of special counsel to assist the court
in deciding whether to grant the order would contribute significantly
to the fairness of the proceedings&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column545" />Column number: 545</div><a name="09030565000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has to consider
whether independent counsel would</div>
<a name="09030565000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;contribute
significantly to the fairness of the proceedings.&#148;</div>
<a name="09030565000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Its only duty is to
consider that question and then to give reasons, if it thinks that it
is not a case where counsel should be appointed.</div>
<a name="09030565000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
compromise proposal involving a more restrictive set of circumstances.
The words are deliberately taken from the judgment of Lord Chief
Justice Judge in the Mayers Court of Appeal case, which is, I believe,
the only Court of Appeal case that has considered the provisions of the
2008 Act in detail. He said that there are cases where independent
counsel would contribute significantly to the fairness of proceedings,
and that there other cases where the appointment
of independent counsel would not contribute in any important
way.</div><a name="09030565000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
make no apologies for returning to the issue. I ask the Government to
say why they have not taken the issue forward as a result of their
deliberations and offer them a third way
forward.</div><a name="09030565000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000460"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The hon. Gentleman has no need to
apologise&#151;that is a perfectly legitimate argument.
There is an overhanging controversy from last July which
needs to be resolved, and he and I are entirely right to
press the matter.</div>
<a name="09030565000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
semantic difference between his amendment 100 and amendment
379, which was tabled by me and my hon. Friend the Member for
North-West Norfolk. As the hon. Gentleman has correctly pointed out, we
expressly used the word
&#147;discretion&#148;:</div><a name="09030565000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
court may in its discretion appoint counsel to assist it when
considering an application for permission to make an application for a
witness anonymity order or an application for a witness anonymity
order.&#148;</div><a name="09030565000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
aside, we are broadly pushing at the same door and we want the
Government to open
it.</div><a name="09030565000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman also said, there is only one Court of Appeal case so far
where the 2008 legislation has been considered. However, similar issues
in relation to the appointment, or otherwise, of special advocates have
been considered by the House of Lords, although not in relation to
anonymity orders, because the statutory regime did not exist until last
summer. There is some guidance, however, that is worth considering when
looking at the question of the appointment of special advocates in
criminal cases.</div>
<a name="09030565000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">That learning
is not novel to the editors of &#147;Archbold&#148;, but it is
novel to me, and it may be entirely novel to others who have not
studied the question quite so closely as the editors of
&#147;Archbold&#148;. In the case of Regina <i class="I">v.</i> H, a House of
Lords decision of 2004, which concerned article 6 of the European
convention on human rights in relation to public interest immunity and
the absence of someone to speak for the defendant, there is some
helpful guidance to be
found.</div><a name="09030565000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
appointment of a special advocate in appropriate cases may be necessary
to ensure that the contentions of the prosecution are attested and that
the interests of the defendant are protected. In cases of
exceptional difficulty, the court may require the appointment of
special counsel to ensure correct answers to questions, such
as:</div><a name="09030565000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What
is the material which the prosecution seek to withhold? This must be
considered by the court in detail.&#148;</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column546" />Column number: 546</div><a name="09030565000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Or</div><a name="09030565000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Is
the material such as may weaken the prosecution case or strengthen that
of the defence? If No, disclosure should not be ordered. If Yes, full
disclosure
should&#148;,</div><a name="09030565000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">subject
to other matters, &#147;be
ordered&#148;.</div><a name="09030565000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that we are dealing with public interest immunity
applications, but the hiding or revealing of certain information at the
hands of the prosecution is a hugely important question that the court
may, in more difficult cases, need assistance with. They will not get
it from the defendant&#146;s counsel, because they do not know, and
the prosecuting counsel will have a different interest, so independent
counsel acting for the court as opposed to the parties can sometimes be
of assistance.</div>
<a name="09030565000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The judgment
in R <i class="I">v</i>. H said that to contend on the basis of some earlier
cases</div><a name="09030565000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
it is automatically incompatible with Article 6...for a judge to
rule on a claim to public interest immunity in the absence of
adversarial argument on behalf of the accused where the material which
the prosecution is seeking to withhold is, or may be, relevant to a
disputed issue of fact which the judge has to decide in order to rule
on an application which will effectively determine the outcome of the
proceedings, was to seek to place the trial judge in a straitjacket;
the consistent practice of the European Court, in this and other
fields, has been to declare principles, and apply those principles on a
case-by-case basis according to the particular facts of the case before
it, and to avoid laying down rigid or inflexible
rules.&#148;</div><a name="09030565000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why we built in to our amendment an express reference to
discretion.</div>
<a name="09030565000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
overriding requirement was that the guiding principles should be
respected and observed, in the infinitely diverse situations with which
trial judges have to deal, in all of which the touchstone was to
ascertain what justice requires in the circumstances of the particular
case. Cases would arise in which the appointment of an approved
advocate as special counsel was necessary, but such an appointment
should be exceptional, never automatic, and not ordered unless the
judge is satisfied that no other courts will adequately meet the
overriding requirement of fairness to the defendant. Where the
disclosure test...is faithfully applied, the occasions on which a
judge will be obliged to recuse himself because he has been privately
shown material damning to the defendant will be
rare.&#148;</div><a name="09030565000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
editors of &#147;Archbold&#148;, in dealing with the case and the
speeches of H, then go into more detail in relation to PII, but the
overall principles&#151;a need to ensure fairness and that
prosecution propositions are properly tested, particularly where they
cannot be tested by defence counsel, and a need to protect the
interests of the defendant and to ensure the overall interests of
justice&#151;are just as key in anonymity applications under these
clauses as they are in PII matters. It seems, therefore&#151;I hope
that I have not misinterpreted what the hon. Member for Cambridge has
said&#151;that this is not just an interesting academic discussion.
It is a matter of real procedural practicality, and it is necessary to
ensure that justice is done in what I fully accept are very difficult
cases.</div><a name="09030565000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Davis
threw up a very difficult challenge to Parliament. I think that we met
it reasonably well, but we missed out on the special advocate point,
which I think needs to be resolved. If the Minister can persuade me
that there is sufficient discretion within the system already, under
the inherent jurisdiction, to allow the appointment of special
advocates, I would be interested to hear
it.</div><a name="09030565000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Greater
comfort would be given to those of us who share the arguments that have
been put forward so far if something expressly appeared in the Bill,
because it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column547" />Column number: 547</div>something that the public need to be assured about, criminal law
practitioners need to be clear about and judges would welcome guidance
on. Yes, judges have guidance from the higher courts, but if Parliament
expressly answered the question put to it by the Law Lords in the case
of Davis&#151;that is to say, it is up to Parliament to sort it
out&#151;the whole criminal justice system would be
advantaged.</div><a name="09030565000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000461"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I am happy to try to deal with the points raised by
hon. Members. The matter was discussed at some length&#151;to the
extent that &#147;length&#148; is a word that can be applied to the
proceedings on the emergency legislation&#151;last year. In relative
terms, it was discussed at some length and was clearly a point at issue
in both the Commons and in the other
place.</div><a name="09030565000374"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
hon. and learned Gentleman has quoted extensively from
&#147;Archbold&#148;, which has taken quite a time to make its
debut in Committee. However, the matter will not cause a dispute,
because the current practice direction that was issued following the
passage of the emergency legislation last year, which is the basis on
which the court must currently deal with the orders, quotes from R and
H and uses the very wording of the case in &#147;Archbold&#148;
that he has referred
to.</div><a name="09030565000417"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="09030565000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000462"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Will the Minister tell the Committee how many
cases have arisen since that
judgment?</div><a name="09030565000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000463"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> There have been two applications to the
Attorney-General for special counsel to assist with an anonymity
application. They have both been granted.</div>
<a name="09030565000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following the
implementation of the emergency legislation, the practice direction set
out by the then president of the Queen&#146;s bench division quoted
some of the same words that the hon. and learned Gentleman has just
quoted from R and H. The practice direction said that the court may ask
the Attorney-General to appoint special counsel to assist, but that it
must be kept in mind that such an appointment will always be
exceptional, never automatic, and a course of last and never first
resort. In addition, such an appointment should not be ordered unless
and until the trial judge is satisfied. No other course will adequately
meet the overriding requirement of fairness to the
defendant.</div><a name="09030565000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has also been some reference to R <i class="I">v</i><i class="I">.</i> Mayers, which to my
knowledge is the only case&#151;there were a number of cases attached
to it&#151;within which these matters have been considered by the
Court of Appeal since the passage of the emergency legislation last
year. That case sets out an authoritative summary of the law relating
to special counsel and the hon. Member for Cambridge made some
reference to it. Nothing in the legislation says that the judgment in
R<i class="I"> v</i><i class="I">.</i><i class="I"> </i>Mayers is the lead judgment, and we can see
no justification for any blanket rules about special counsel, one way
or the other. Sometimes special counsel might contribute significantly
to the fairness of the process, and sometimes not. Furthermore, the
judgment went on to say that if a judge entertains reservations about
the good faith of the efforts made by the prosecution investigation
into any relevant consideration bearing on the question of witness
anonymity, an application for witness anonymity will be met with a
point blank refusal.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column548" />Column number: 548</div><a name="09030565000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the services of special counsel may enable the judge to ensure that any
investigative steps specific to the case, and not perhaps otherwise
apparent, have been taken. Our approach to this issue enables us to
highlight that the obligation to the prosecution in the context of a
witness anonymity application goes much further than the ordinary
duties of disclosure. On that basis, the court was saying that the
current arrangements are about right; it was not saying that there
needs to be a provision that enables&#151;and in the case of
amendment 100, requires&#151;a court to consider whether
special counsel is appropriate in every single case.</div>
<a name="09030565000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
passage of the legislation, my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary
clearly undertook to consider this matter in detail. We have done so.
On 3 December, my right hon. Friend wrote a letter to Front Benchers. I
hope that the hon. Member for Cambridge received that letter, because
he did not refer to it in his remarks. The letter set out our reasons
for deciding not to include the measure. Having given the matter
consideration, we do not agree with the suggestion in the amendments
that provision for special counsel should be put in the Bill in respect
of every application&#151;or that it should, at least, be considered
in respect of every application. We believe that the current
arrangements appear to be working well. If special counsel has been
requested of the Attorney-General, those requests have been
granted.</div><a name="09030565000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
100 tabled by the hon. Member for Cambridge would require a court,
before determining all witness anonymity applications, to consider
whether the appointment of special counsel would contribute
significantly to the fairness of proceedings and if it decides not to
appoint special counsel it would be required to give its reasons.
Conservative amendment 379 provides, more simply, for the
court to appoint special counsel at its discretion. There are problems
with both amendments. Courts may already ask the Attorney-General, if
they feel that it would be helpful in the circumstances, and there does
not seem to be any problem with that. So far, where a special counsel
has been requested that request has been
granted.</div><a name="09030565000103"></a>

because the latter case talks about &#147;exceptional&#148; and is
generally talking about some advantages and disadvantages, whereas

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000469"></a>The

clause 37&#151;<i class="I">Prosecution not to disclose identity of witness to
other
defendants</i><i class="I">&#151;</i></div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;Notwithstanding
anything in the Criminal Proceedings and Investigations Act 1996 or any
other rule of law about disclosure of material by a prosecutor to the
defence, where an order is made following an application under section
70(3) in a case in which there is more than one defendant, the
prosecutor shall not disclose to the other defendants the identity of
the witness covered by the order or any information that might enable
the witness to be
identified.&#146;.</div><a name="09030565000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000470"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The new clause, which is in my name and that of
my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central, relates to a technical
matter and refers back to another discussion that occurred during the
short debates on the 2008 Act. It starts with the issue of the
inequality between a prosecutor applying for an anonymity order for one
of the prosecution&#146;s witnesses and the defence applying for an
anonymity order on behalf of one of the defence witnesses. The
inequality, which was created by the 2008 Act, is still present in
clause 70. When the prosecutor applies for an order, they must inform
the court, but no one else, of the identity of the proposed anonymous
witness. On the other hand, when the defence applies for such an order
for a defence witness, they must inform not just the court but the
prosecutor of the identity of the witness.</div>
<a name="09030565000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to go through the debate that we had last time. Arguments that did not
stand up were made for the inequality, but one argument in its favour
seemed to have at least some merit. The right hon. and learned Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) put forward the
justification that in cases involving 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column550" />Column number: 550</div>multiple defendants, the prosecution has a duty to disclose relevant
matters if information comes to their attention that would tend to
exonerate the other defendants. Without knowing the identity of the
anonymous witness, the prosecution would not be in a position to fulfil
that
duty.</div><a name="09030565000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with that argument, however, is that it does not cover all the
circumstances that might arise under the orders. Clause 70 says that
the defence does not have to disclose the identity of its anonymous
witness directly to the other defendants in a multiple-defendant case.
The reason is quite clear. Often, in multiple-defendant cases, the
problem of witness intimidation is much more likely to come from the
associates of the other defendants than it is from the prosecution or
the police. That is the central point.</div>
<a name="09030565000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 70, as
it stands, attempts to keep the identity of the anonymous witness away
from the other defendants in the normal course of events, but it does
not prevent that identity from getting to the other defendants via the
prosecution and its obligation to disclose that identity under the
normal rules of disclosure in the Criminal Proceedings and
Investigations Act 1996. The question, then, is how the clause&#146;s
policy, which is that the identity of the anonymous witness should not
go to the other defendants, fits with the policy of the 1996 Act, which
favours disclosure. The Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon.
Member for Liverpool, Garston said previously that it was possible
under the 1996 Act for the prosecution to apply for an exemption, on
the grounds of public interest, in relation to disclosing the identity
of the anonymous witness. However, the trouble with that is that it is
only a power to apply.</div>
<a name="09030565000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000471"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that there is
also some distinction between the public interest on the one hand and
the defendant&#146;s interest on the other, which is what is supposed
to be being
addressed?</div><a name="09030565000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000472"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Yes, that is a point. The decision whether to
allow the information to be withheld might take both into account in
different ways. There is only a power to apply, and the application
might be refused. What was said previously is some comfort in that sort
of case, but it does not quite work: it does not prevent the identity
of the anonymous witness from getting to the other defendants via the
prosecution. In such cases, the new clause is simple designed to
prevent the identity of the anonymous witness reaching the other
defendants through an indirect route. The new clause is fully in line
with the policy of clause 70, and it is a loophole that I hoped that
the Government had found a way of filling&#151;but unfortunately, at
the current stage, they have not. I admit that my way of grasping the
new clause may not be perfect, but there is a problem that must be
solved.</div><a name="09030565000418"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000473"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling the
new clause. The fact that I cannot accept it&#151;for reasons that I
will explain&#151;gives me an opportunity to set out our views. It is
an important technical issue, and I assure him that since he raised it,
we have not been twiddling our thumbs and not bothering to think about
it, even though we have not tabled any amendments to the
Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column551" />Column number: 551</div><a name="09030565000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee will be aware, the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act
1996 requires the prosecutor to disclose to defendants, including every
defendant in a multi-handed case, any material that might reasonably be
considered capable of undermining the prosecution or assisting the
defence. In principle, therefore, the identity of a witness can be
disclosed under those rules on occasion in the same way as any other
material, depending on the circumstances of the case. The issue that
the new clause invites us to address is the extent to which the
anonymity order trumps the CPIA disclosure duty&#151;that is a crude
way of putting it, but I think that that is issue that the hon.
Gentleman
raised.</div><a name="09030565000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2008 Act did not explicitly attempt to combine the anonymity and
disclosure laws&#151;it stands alongside the CPIA in the same way in
which the common law anonymity rules did before that legislation. The
Bill does the same, but not because we have not been thinking about the
issue since. As a matter of practice, the prosecutor, in addition to
making an application for an anonymity order&#151;I said this last
time&#151;may sometimes also decide to make an application to the
court to be allowed not to disclose the witness&#146;s identity to
one or more defendants on public interest immunity grounds, which
involves the multi-handed cases that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned.
As I explained to him when he raised the subject in the House, it does
not seem sensible to have two different processes trying to cover the
same piece of information and have it kept quiet using two different
procedures. We have, however, since the 2008 legislation was enacted,
looked carefully at the relationship between the anonymity legislation
and the
CPIA.</div><a name="09030565000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
strict conditions for making an anonymity order will encompass the
criteria that the court applies before ordering a non-disclosure of
prosecution material on the grounds of public interest immunity. Under
those circumstances, having two applications does not make sense and
will waste the time of the court and the resources of the prosecution
and the defence. Our policy is to see that there is no need for
unnecessary duplication, and we consider that both the 2008 Act and the
Bill achieve
that.</div><a name="09030565000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Measures
directed as part of a witness anonymity order, which provide for the
non-disclosure or redaction from materials of identifying details of a
witness, will operate to qualify a duty that would otherwise operate
under the CPIA. That does not mean that we completely disregard the
rules under the CPIA in respect of other kinds of material; we do so
only to the extent that the court, on the witness anonymity order
application, considers it necessary to do so. That is consistent with
the wide discretion available to the court on the directions that it
makes in a witness anonymity
order.</div><a name="09030565000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have considered placing explicit provisions to that effect on the Bill,
which is in effect what the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause would
do, or amending the CPIA accordingly. But we reached a conclusion that
it is unnecessary to do so. In our view, no sensible court&#151;they
are all sensible&#151;would conclude that if an anonymity order were
made with directions to the protection and non-disclosure of the
witness&#146;s identity, that identity should either be passed
through to another defendant under the CPIA rules, or it might be
necessary to go 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column552" />Column number: 552</div>through an identical process in determining whether that disclosure
should happen. The terms of the witness anonymity order will operate to
limit the obligations of the CPIA, although I accept that the hon.
Member for Cambridge has spotted an overlap.</div>
<a name="09030565000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will move
on to the detail of the new clause. We are concerned about the use of
the wording &#147;the other defendant&#148;, as that might be taken
to imply that an anonymity order is necessarily made in respect of a
particular defendant&#151;it is not. Neither is it made only in
respect of a defendant in whose case the anonymous witness gives
evidence. An anonymity order is made in respect of a witness and may
apply to all defendants in the case. When the court considers the grant
of an anonymity order, it must have regard to the impact on all
defendants, and &#147;the defendant&#148; in clause 71(4) is to be
construed accordingly. That is why clause 70(6) requires the court to
hear representations from all parties following the 2008 legislation.
That is reinforced in clause 69 by reference to withholding the
identity
from</div><a name="09030565000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;materials
disclosed to any party to the
proceedings.&#148;</div><a name="09030565000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will hear in a moment whether that satisfies the hon. Gentleman and
whether he moves his new clause. However, on that basis, we do not
believe it to be necessary.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000476"></a>David
Howarth:</b> We now come to a series of difficulties with the
existing legislation that the Bill does not resolve or change in any
significant way. I shall talk first about amendments 451 and 452, then
amendment 454 and finally amendment 453. Amendments 451 and 452 are
about the extent to which threats to property could be sufficient to
justify an anonymity order. Members of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column553" />Column number: 553</div>the Committee might remember that a number of hon.
Members felt that in principle threats to property would be
insufficient to justify anonymity, if they are not accompanied by a
threat to a human being. A further point was raised by the Joint
Committee on Human Rights, which doubted whether the property
justification was consistent with the European convention on human
rights. It cited an opinion given by the Attorney-General of New
Zealand to the effect that the equivalent provision in New Zealand
statute was highly likely to be in breach of the European convention on
human rights standard. The Government at the time insisted that in
their view the use of property damage to justify these orders continued
to be compliant with human rights requirements.</div>
<a name="09030565000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The central
question is not whether a threat of property damage that also threatens
people would be sufficient for an order, as that is obvious. A threat
to burn down someone&#146;s house is a threat to the people who live
in that house. We are not talking about threats to humans that are
carried out through a threat to property&#151;such a case is not
difficult and is clear justification for an
order.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000477"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b><b class="B"> </b>What about a situation in which the threat
is to the person&#146;s business? It might not involve their factory
being burned down with them in it, but it might involve their factory
being burned down in a way that will destroy their livelihood and
materially damage their way of life, without necessarily threatening
their physical safety? Is not that a difficult
borderline?</div><a name="09030565000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000478"></a>David
Howarth:</b> It is difficult to burn down a factory without
threatening someone&#146;s life or limb. The situation that we are
worrying about will arise only in very special circumstances, such as
if someone threatens to burn down a lock-up shop at night when no one
is
there.</div><a name="09030565000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000479"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Suppose that the threat is to disable repeatedly or
to destroy someone&#146;s motor vehicle, which they use to get to
work. Many poor people cannot afford to replace tyres, windscreens and
wing mirrors repeatedly. The vehicle might be parked on the street
overnight, and it might have been clear that no one was in it when it
was being damaged, but any of us might find it difficult to cope with
our car being damaged repeatedly one night after another. That would
destroy some people&#146;s
lives.</div><a name="09030565000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000480"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am glad that the Minister used the phrase
&#147;destroy people&#146;s lives&#148;, because she has talked
about situations in which the threat to property would leave the family
destitute, which would probably be sufficiently serious. That is why we
have moved amendment 452, which would introduce the
destitution test, following the Minister&#146;s suggestion. There is
also a destitution test under human rights law for another obligation
of the state&#151;that the state should not leave people in
destitution.</div><a name="09030565000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s example is an extreme case, and I am willing to
accept that it is a justifying one, but the problem is whether the
measure would apply in less serious cases in which the witness would
not be left in a state of destitution, but would be left worse off. No
one could deny that that might make them less willing to give evidence,
but is that sufficient to anonymise the witness, which we have all
agreed is an inherent threat to the fairness of a trial? The Joint
Committee on Human Rights has raised that point, and it is still an
issue now.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column554" />Column number: 554</div><a name="09030565000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09030565000481"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Howarth</b> (Knowsley, North and Sefton, East) (Lab): I
think that it is naive to say that the examples that my hon. Friend the
Minister has given are so rare. In parts of my constituency, people are
regularly targeted as &#147;grasses&#148;, and their lives are made
intolerable. I am sure that is not unique to my constituency. Would not
the hon. Gentleman consider that to be a case in point that ought to be
addressed?</div><a name="09030565000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000482"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The question is where we should draw the line.
The Bill mentions &#147;serious damage to property&#148;, but how
will seriousness be judged? I am perfectly happy to discuss the
seriousness of the examples that have been mentioned. If the hon.
Gentleman is saying that seriousness is not about the value of the
property, but about the degree of disruption to the relevant
person&#146;s life, he might have a point, but the existing
legislation and the clause do not make that clear. The measure could
mean simply that a threat to a valuable vehicle belonging to a rich
person would be considered to be serious damage, whereas a threat to a
vehicle with a low market value belonging to someone on a lower income,
which might be more important to them than the other car to the other
person, would not count as a serious threat. I am not being
absolutist&#151;I accept that threats to property can disrupt
lives&#151;but we have to decide where to draw the line, and the
clause does not do that. How serious a disruption to someone&#146;s
life should justify the use of anonymous evidence? We all admit that
anonymous evidence may lead to injustice or the risk of
injustice.</div><a name="09030565000419"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): The hon.
Gentleman is making a serious point constructively, but did he not
provide the answer when he talked about judgment? Is it not a matter of
fact that a judgment must be made? He gave a couple of examples of a
judgment having to be made according to principles of where it is
appropriate. The seriousness of a low-value vehicle in a community
where intimidation such as my right hon. Friend the Member for
Knowsley, North and Sefton, East described a few moments ago occurs is
what &#147;seriousness&#148; is supposed to imply, but we cannot
get away from the fact that if we had such an absolute definition in
the law we would unintentionally exclude some examples of places where
the right judgment should be made in the public
interest.</div><a name="09030565000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000484"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is right, but we should not allow a
provision to go through unchallenged, if it could be interpreted in a
completely different way from the one that the right hon. Gentleman has
mentioned, and in a way that would not help people in that condition,
but might help much better-off
people.</div><a name="09030565000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09030565000485"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that the neatest way of dealing with the problem that
he has identified, and taking account of the points made by Labour
Members, is &#147;to prevent any damage to property with serious
consequences to the
witness&#148;?</div><a name="09030565000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000486"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I will have to think about that, because it might
be a way through the problem. The present drafting is not adequate or
satisfactory, even from the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column555" />Column number: 555</div>point of view of those who are willing to go further than I would down
the line of allowing property damage to count in the first
place.</div><a name="09030565000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000487"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> At some risk of turning this into a drafting
committee rather than a Public Bill Committee, may I offer a separate
point for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s consideration? It is not merely
the seriousness, but often the serial nature of the attacks that is
relevant. If someone says that they are going to slash someone&#146;s
tyres every weekend, that is an aggravated
threat.</div><a name="09030565000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000488"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Yes. I think that that is the point that the
Minister and the right hon. Gentleman were making, but the clause, as
drafted, does not cover it, because each individual instance may not be
serious. I do not want to say more about this topic, because I think
that we have demonstrated that there is a difficulty in how the law is
drafted at the
moment.</div><a name="09030565000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to amendment 454, I think there is a serious problem, which goes back
to the origins of the original 1988 legislation. The Government never
seem to be entirely sure whether the test for granting an order is
based objectively on the safety of the witness&#151;how safe are
they?&#151;or on the fear that they may experience subjectively. We
have a very untidy compromise whereby both seem to be relevant, but it
is not clear which takes precedence. I tabled the amendment simply to
make that point. It is a probing amendment that would take out the last
part of the clause and the fear element, while leaving the safety
element.</div><a name="09030565000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that a witness can be perfectly safe, but have subjective
fear. At the same time, someone may not have fear and may not be
afraid, but may objectively be very unsafe. Which of the
two&#151;safety or fear&#151;will be the real test whether
anonymous witness orders should be
made.</div><a name="09030565000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000489"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> In fairness, the clause as drafted refers to
&#147;reasonable fear&#148;, and the hon. Gentleman is better
placed than me to define what that reasonableness might
be.</div><a name="09030565000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000490"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Unfortunately, we had an uncomfortable five
minutes in the debate last time and came to the conclusion that we did
not know what a reasonable fear would be. This is a halfway house, but
it is still a reasonable fear rather than
safety.</div><a name="09030565000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000491"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Is a reasonable fear different from, as, for
example, with asylum legislation, a well-founded
fear?</div><a name="09030565000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000492"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is an interesting technical question that I
would have to think about further, but it still gets us no further down
the line of deciding a serious policy question. Is the purpose of the
anonymity order to protect people who lack safety in their lives and
who are objectively under threat, or is it to help people who are
subjectively in fear? The obvious starting point is fear, because that
is what stops people coming forward, but the clause is drafted in terms
not of fear but of safety. The Government need to be clearer on that
point than they have been so far.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column556" />Column number: 556</div><a name="09030565000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point
is about the possibility of obtaining an order to prevent real harm to
the public interest, which seems a very broad category. When challenged
last time, the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member
for Liverpool, Garston said
that</div><a name="09030565000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
purpose of the wording is to capture circumstances in which the
intelligence agencies, or, for example, the police or the Serious
Organised Crime Agency, are doing their
job.&#148;</div><a name="09030565000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members were discussing an undercover operation, which would be
compromised by allowing the identity of the witness&#151;the
agent&#151;to be known. However, the wording of the clause goes way
beyond the specific circumstances, talking about real harm at large.
So, the Minister went
on:</div><a name="09030565000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
it helps Members...those are the only circumstances intended; I am

<a name="09030565000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The policy of the

not been taken to change the words, so that the words in the Bill
reflect the policy. I am disappointed by that, which is why I have
tabled amendment
453.</div><a name="09030565000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
radically, one conclusion that I have come to on the problem of what
one might call official anonymous witnesses, as opposed to civilian
anonymous witnesses, is that such cases are rather different from what
we have been discussing, namely the case of the intimidated witness.
Perhaps it would be better to devise a separate scheme of anonymity for
such
witnesses.</div><a name="09030565000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those

I would like to kill two birds with one stone. A point about gangs and
gang culture that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough raised

context.</div><a name="09030565000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000495"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> In fact, it was in the neighbouring
constituency of Liverpool, West Derby, although some of the events that
took place afterwards happened in my constituency. The person who has
now been convicted of the shooting of Rhys Jones drew on the support of
members of the so-called Norris Green gang to help him cover up the
crime. I do not intend to go into detail, because it is on the public
record. The presence of those people in the gang were sufficient for
the person to be able to evade arrest for many months, even though the
police were well aware who he was.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column557" />Column number: 557</div><a name="09030565000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason why
the person&#146;s connection to the gang could create a climate in
which he was not arrested and the police did not have sufficient
information was that people were literally terrified of the gang. They
knew its members and were afraid to come forward. Moreover, they were
afraid that the police would not be able to protect their anonymity if
they gave information in a subsequent trial. It therefore took many
months for the police to effect an arrest and make prosecutions. In the
end, the police did an effective job and the young man was convicted,
as were several other members of the gang who contributed to his
evading arrest for so
long.</div><a name="09030565000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am putting the argument into context for the hon. Member for Cambridge.
A person who lives in a community does not have to sit down and work
out matters for themselves. It is obvious that some
people&#151;always a minority&#151;are prepared to use any means
necessary to prevent a prosecution from taking place. That is up to and
including the intimidation of witnesses. If people know that that might
happen, they do not want to engage in the process of
law.</div><a name="09030565000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">About
three years ago in my constituency, a family were branded by one of the
local gangs as &#147;grasses&#148;. Halloween is a peculiar new
concept that we seem to have imported into our culture. It never used
to be here when I was a child. It is an American import, and not one of
the better ones. The cover of Halloween and the chaos that some people
promoted on that evening was used to drive the family out of their
home. They left their home on the advice of the police, because the
pressure that was being put on them was so great. I do not know whether
they were witnesses to a case, but the perception was that they were
providing information to the police, and that was enough for them to be
driven out of their home. They then had to be rehoused in another part
of the area. Everyone understood that it was for the family&#146;s
protection.</div><a name="09030565000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
issues were not in the family&#146;s imagination. Real events were
happening. Lots of people know what is going on in certain areas, and
they fear that, if they co-operate with the police to the extent that
they become witnesses and have their names identified, their lives
would not be worth living&#151;to use the phrase of the
Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for
Liverpool,
Garston.</div><a name="09030565000375"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000496"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> My right hon. Friend&#146;s argument is
extremely telling. He is right, but will he accept that some cases are
dramatic and in which the police are involved, as in his first example,
but that there are also situations when intimidation may be going on
over a long period at a low level, of which perhaps the police and
other authorities are not aware? That is difficult to deal with
adequately, but it is important that people have the confidence to come
forward as
witnesses.</div><a name="09030565000420"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000497"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> My right hon. Friend makes a strong point.
He is right. In an intervention this morning, I mentioned a case
involving a constituent with whom I had a conversation on Monday
morning. I was urging her to go to the police about the intimidation
that her family is experiencing. I will not go into a lot of detail,
but the woman concerned has a daughter of 16 who, because of
intimidation by gangs of young men, comes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column558" />Column number: 558</div>home from school and does not go out of the door until she is taken to
school by car the following morning. Her daughter is a studious young
woman who does not drink or hang around on the street. Those who do
those things have decided to target
her.</div><a name="09030565000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Her
mother&#146;s solution is to move. I can fully understand that. She
thinks that there is no way out of it for her other than by getting out
of that house to somewhere where the gangs will not target her
daughter. I was trying to persuade her that she ought to go to the
police and tell them what is going on&#151;I said that I would go
with her&#151;and try to get the police to take more seriously the
problem that she was experiencing. &#147;No&#148;, she said,
&#147;if I do that they&#146;ll find out I&#146;ve done it and my
life will be even worse than it is now. More particularly, my
daughter&#146;s life will be even worse than it is now.&#148; That
is the reality of the lives that some people are living. That case fits
into the category that my right hon. Friend
mentioned.</div><a name="09030565000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
often than not, those problems are resolved not through the criminal
justice system but through the housing transfer system. That ought not
to be so. We ought not to find it acceptable that people&#146;s fear
of co-operation in a prosecution or with the police is so great that
rather than even engage with it they will move house. That is the
reality of what we are up
against.</div><a name="09030565000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have one point to make to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough,
which has some bearing on this matter. In most of the cases involved,
we are essentially talking about street gangs: groups of
youngsters&#151;perhaps up to 50 or 100 of them&#151;who hang
around on the street and are intimidating, although they do not
necessarily do anything illegal. Within that gang will be some
hard-core criminals. The police will know who they are, and teachers,
social workers and anyone who has regular dealings with young people
will be able to say who they are from when they are as young as seven,
eight or nine. They will know about that because it is pretty
predictable that a certain kid will go through a process and will end
up probably as a criminal. That is the case with street
gangs.</div><a name="09030565000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some anecdotal evidence, because I have seen things with my own
eyes. The leaders of the criminal gangs&#151;the ones who deliver
drugs in the area and control that, for example&#151;are almost
grooming the street gangs. For example, I was asked by a
residents&#146; group to chair a public meeting in a school hall in
an area experiencing antisocial behaviour. I had invited someone from
the Crown Prosecution Service, the area commander, who is a chief
superintendent, and other police officers. That was an opportunity for
that group of residents to express their concerns to the people who
could perhaps do something about them. I also invited people from the
magistrates courts. I wish that I shared the great confidence in the
magistrates system of the hon. Member for Daventry. Quite often,
frankly, the community that I represent considers the local magistrate
with
contempt.</div><a name="09030565000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the meeting, a minibus rolled up driven by one of the local drug
barons, who, I am glad to say, is currently detained at Her
Majesty&#146;s pleasure, and out poured a gang of the youngsters who
were causing all the problems. One is a criminal gang, the other is a
street gang, but where was the drug baron&#146;s interest in that?
Why was he ferrying them to a meeting to discuss antisocial behaviour?
This was five or six weeks ago, and, interestingly, one of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column559" />Column number: 559</div>the most outspoken youngsters there went on to a criminal career. Most
recently, he was arrested for offences involving firearms, so we can
see the process that takes place.</div>
<a name="09030565000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am straying
from the amendments and the clause, but it is important to tell the
hon. Member for Cambridge that that is the context in which such
protections for potential witnesses are necessary. There are many
places&#151;not just in my constituency&#151;where such activities
take place.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000498"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The right hon. Gentleman has explained why I,
unlike many people involved in the law, accept the need for anonymous
witness orders. There is an absolutist view, which I do not accept,
whereby any anonymity will automatically cause an unfair trial. It is
unrealistic to think that the police and the authorities can protect
people in the situation that the right hon. Gentleman describes. Some
people think that they could, but, in reality, they cannot. That is why
the orders must exist, and I fully accept them. However, we must be
careful that we do not go too far, producing miscarriages of justice,
as we might do, and providing malicious people with opportunities to
use the law to take revenge on other
people.</div>
<a name="09030565000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000499"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a couple of
scenarios that, if we wanted to exercise our imaginations, could flow
from the proposal. However, I shall conclude merely by saying that
those may be risks that are worth taking if we are to protect people
properly from the problems that I have described. Many of my
constituents, who have to put up with such problems day in, day out,
are not as tolerant as the hon. Gentleman, and for good
reason.</div>

enjoyable occasions, namely to Aintree race course, and I recommend
regular visits to it.</div>

many sides to all our constituencies, and, although the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s description of the contextual material is highly
valuable to us, I should not want the world to think that his
constituency was a place of complete and utter misery, because it quite
clearly is not.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column560" />Column number: 560</div><a name="09030565000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not
found it at all difficult to agree with the hon. Member for Cambridge
on some issues, but he made it quite difficult for me to stay with him
when he discussed his amendments on serious damage to property. He
redeemed himself in my eyes, however, when he said that he is not an
absolutist and is looking for somewhere to draw the line. He needs to,
because, in any event, but especially having heard what the right hon.
Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East said a moment ago, I think
that damage to property is clearly the key to this matter&#151;in
addition to damage to individuals. It is a matter of fact and degree.
There will be cases where the damage is
trivial&#151;</div><a name="09030565000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000505"></a>Mr.

way?</div><a name="09030565000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000506"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I will just get to the end of the sentence, if my
hon. Friend does not mind.</div>
<a name="09030565000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
71(3)(a) mentions &#147;serious damage to property&#148;, and
trivial damage would clearly not come within its
ambit.</div>
<a name="09030565000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000507"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I thank my hon. and learned Friend for giving
way; in no sense was I seeking to derail what he wanted to say. When
looking at the clause, should not the test at the back of our minds be
that of needing to serve the cause of justice? That will be inhibited
by a climate of fear, which could be transmitted either by threats to
physical safety or life-damaging property damage. I agree with the
remarks of the right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East
that it is impossible to draw a literal-minded barrier around threats
of physical violence.</div>
<a name="09030565000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000508"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> That is a perfectly fair point.</div>
<a name="09030565000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
conclude my remarks in relation to the amendments that deal with damage
to property. There is arson, and there is arson with intent to endanger
life. Both are serious offences and both warrant life imprisonment in
some circumstances. It would be a mistake to remove reference to
property in the witness anonymity orders. I accept that we need a
connection between property that is threatened with damage&#151;or
that has been damaged&#151;and the witness or someone close to them.
I do not need to take that point further as it is self-evident. I am
sure that the hon. Member for Cambridge will accept that.</div>
<a name="09030565000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">One further
point occurs to me. The damage to property should not necessarily be
measured in financial terms in relation to the property. We are talking
about the impact, the ripple effect. I could disable a computer;
actually, I could not&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am
sure that I have disabled many computers, but entirely by mistake.
However, within the financial services, for example, computers are
vital for the management of the stock exchange and the banking
system&#151;in so far as we have one. It does not take much to
disable a computer system, but it could have a massive economic effect.
It might be a small piece of damage such as removing a fuse, but the
real damage is the loss of the business&#146;s ability to function.
That is an example of where serious damage needs to be construed in a
reasonably wide form. Tighter or more careful drafting of
subsection (3)(a) might get those points across, but the
policy behind it is clear.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column561" />Column number: 561</div><a name="09030565000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points on subsection
(6), amendment 199 seeks to deal with the same problem in a slightly
different way. We are concerned about a proportionate response to a
perceived fear. I could have a subjectively reasonable fear that if I
do something, something terrible will happen to me. However, when that
subjective fear is analysed, it is possible to reach the conclusion
that, objectively, it should not impinge on an application for an
anonymity order. I could subjectively reach the conclusion that if I
carry on speaking until 6 pm, the hon. Member for Wrexham&#151;he is
leaving the room, so my objective fear is going with him&#151;could
introduce me to Stalin and Hitler, which might have adverse
consequences for
me.</div>
<a name="09030565000421"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="09030565000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
may genuinely think that, or fear it, but an objective analyst would
say, &#147;That is impossible. It may be something you fear, but it
is unreasonable and not something that should affect condition A, your
safety.&#148; Even though I think that, in fact, my safety will not
be affected by giving evidence in those circumstances. I am not going
to be threatened; I am not going to meet Hitler or Stalin. That is a
rather laboured way to explain the difference between a subjective fear
and its objective assessment by someone else. We have to do that in all
sorts of cases. A state of mind is a fact, it has to be
established&#151;to the satisfaction of the court, I would
suggest&#151;and the court has to ensure the overall interests of
justice, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said a moment ago.
Courts do that, more or less day in, day out.</div>
<a name="09030565000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that quite so much needs to be made of subsection (6), albeit
that expressions such as &#147;in particular&#148; need to be used
clearly. Does it mean in particular but exclusively, or in particular
but not limited to? The Minister understands the various options that
could occur to an inventive construer of subsection (6). I shall leave
amendment 199 there for illustrative purposes, so that the Minister can
tell us what the Government mean by subsection
(6).</div><a name="09030565000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a deeper and more serious question to be answered in relation to
subsection (3)(b), which deals with the public interest point, which
has already been discussed. Our amendments 197 and 198 deal with
deleting paragraph (b) and the &#147;or otherwise&#148; at the end.
Personally&#151;I do not know what my hon. Friends think&#151;I do
not find the Liberal Democrats&#146; proposals particularly
attractive, albeit that I entirely understand what they are about. The
Government may have written more into paragraph (b) than is necessary:
it is vague, wide and open to mischievous interpretation, and they need
to edit it somewhat to be tighter. On that basis I am content to listen
to what the Minister has to
say.</div><a name="09030565000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000509"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> We have had an interesting discussion about the
purpose and context in which the provisions of clause 71, which deals
with conditions for making witness anonymity orders, operate in the
real world. I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North
and Sefton, East for that and others for the remarks that they made in
his support. It is important that the Committee remembers that that is
what the provisions are largely
about.</div><a name="09030565000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also important to remember that the hand of Government was moved.
The provision was not something that we sought to put into statute, as
opposed to it being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column562" />Column number: 562</div>in the common law. However, when it became clear that the common law was
not as it had been thought to be and would not remain fit for the
purposes for which it had developed, as we all thought it had before
the Davis case, neither we nor the rest of the parties in Parliament
then felt able to restrain ourselves. There was general agreement that
the emergency legislation passed last year was necessary. It was
enacted swiftly and had support in all parts of the
House.</div><a name="09030565000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
did not seek to set out precisely in statute the circumstances in which
such things ought to be allowed, but now we are in that position. I
venture to say, as the hon. and learned Member for Harborough said
earlier, that things seem to be working quite well, owing in large part
to the common-sense interpretation applied by the judiciary. My right
hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East understands
and many of us know from our constituency experience what the
provisions are all about and why they are necessary. Although we can
have an academic debate, we must always bear in mind the fact that
these provisions have a utility that we do not want to move away
from.</div>
<a name="09030565000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
the amendments, I begin with amendment 451 and 452, to which
the hon. Member for Cambridge spoke. We debated briefly the purpose and
usefulness of including the property limb of the test in
subsection (3)(a). It has been useful to bat around those
questions about what serious damage to property means. We think that
the wording works, although some interesting points have been made
about serial, more minor, damage. We must always remember the context,
however: to a person who has very little, whose car is the only way
they can get to work and who will lose their house if they do not have
a job, minor damage to their property would be serious. Any
common-sense interpretation of the wording would agree with
that.</div>
<a name="09030565000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I do
not believe that we need to change the wording, I am happy to reflect
on what has been said, to make sure that by the time we come back on
Report, we are clear that we have the best formulation. I think that we
probably have and there is a disadvantage to over-complicating the
tests. If common sense can apply and if things seem to be working,
there is an argument for not interfering too much. I do not want to
accept any of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments at
present&#151;they are probably probing amendments, in any
event.</div>
<a name="09030565000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
197 and 198 would alter another of the three conditions for making the
order. The second limb of condition A specifies that the order must be
necessary</div>
<a name="09030565000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to prevent real
harm to the public
interest&#148;.</div><a name="09030565000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have debated the meaning of that phrase before and it has not changed
between last year and this. I made some overt remarks on the record in
case anyone ever wished under the Pepper <i class="I">v.</i> Hart procedure to be
clear about what Ministers intended. There is no change in the
intention, but there is clearly some purpose in enabling those who are
undercover to continue to work in that way and not to lose the capacity
to do so because they cannot have an anonymity order because their
circumstances do not come under any of the limbs of the
test.</div>
<a name="09030565000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000510"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Does the Minister agree that the requirements
should not be used lightly and that there is always a judgment that has
to be made&#151;it cannot be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column563" />Column number: 563</div>escaped by going to the letter of actual requirements? The intention
reflected in the drafting is to make sure that that judgment can be
exercised in appropriate cases, without unintended constraints being
placed, which would leave people vulnerable in the way that both my
right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East and I
have outlined in some of our examples.</div>
<a name="09030565000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000511"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I certainly agree with my right hon. Friend that
anonymity orders should not become routine instead of exceptional. That
was quite clearly said during the passage of the emergency legislation
and I will not repeat it now. Common sense should be applied, and the
fact that all sides appear to accept that the provisions are working
indicates that it is being applied.</div>
<a name="09030565000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
probably said what I need to about harm to the public interest in
relation to amendments 197 and 198. Amendment 453 would change the
wording of the second limb of condition A so that it explicitly and
exclusively referred to preventing</div>
<a name="09030565000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;serious harm to
the functioning of a properly authorised undercover
operation.&#148;</div><a name="09030565000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not think that the amendment is necessary, simply on the ground that
we have made explicit what the current wording means and changing it
might present us with more of a problem in statutory interpretation
than leaving it as it is and reiterating why it was put there in the
first place.</div>
<a name="09030565000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 454
would remove the court&#146;s duty to take the witness&#146;s fear
into account when considering whether the order was necessary to
safeguard the safety of the witness or another person. I realise that
the amendment is a way into a discussion about whether we are looking
at some kind of reasonable fear for one&#146;s safety, but fear is a
subjective thing, and if we are talking about trying to protect
somebody and enable them to give evidence, it is the subjective fear
that one ought to consider. My right hon. Friend the Member for
Knowsley, North and Sefton, East will confirm from his experience that,
quite often, it is stress and lack of sleep rather than fear that leads
a person to a much more fragile mental state than one might expect,
after a series of intimidatory activities that provide the final straw.
It is not necessarily fear as much as stress&#151;and just being
completely fed up of being treated badly and threatened the whole
time&#151;that finally leads people to flee or refuse to come forward
with their
evidence.</div><a name="09030565000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
any event, as I have said, the current wording appears to work. The
court will still be able to have regard to the question of fear as a
matter of discretion. It is unclear what benefit there would be in
removing it&#151;I know that it is a probing amendment to get us into
the discussion that the hon. Members for Cambridge and for Daventry
were having.</div>
<a name="09030565000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Member for Cambridge will withdraw his amendment on the
grounds that we have had a good debate and that the present provisions
appear to work. It is not sensible to interfere with
them.</div><a name="09030565000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000512"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and
Sefton, East said that I was tolerant of the sort of conditions that he
talked about, but I certainly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column564" />Column number: 564</div>am not. If he knew where I was brought up and where my parents still
live, he would understand why that is the case. All I am asking is that
we are at least reasonably clear about what we are not tolerant
of.</div>
<a name="09030565000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way that
the clause is written at the moment does not get at what we are talking
about, which is the impact of the intimidating and threatening
practices&#151;almost ways of life on some estates&#151;on the
people whom we are trying to protect. It is not about discrete
incidents; the idea that has come out of the debate quite clearly is
that we are talking about discrete or one-off threats or one-off
incidents to do with some bit of property, but that is not what it is
about at all. It is the about cumulative impact on the potential
witnesses of those threats and acts of intimidation happening day after
day&#151;that is what we want to stop. We are certainly are not
tolerant of
that.</div><a name="09030565000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
it is not a good way to write a statute, there is a phrase that many
Members have used to express what we are trying to get at, which is: if
it is the kind of thing that makes people want to move, it is
intolerable. The right hon. Gentleman and the Minister described it as
the state when someone says, &#147;I think I should leave and take my
family with me because I do not feel protected by the police, and those
people are just getting at me.&#148; That is almost exactly what we
should try to stop&#151;the test should be that no reasonable person
should be put in that position. I am far from clear that what we have
now expresses that problem.</div>
<a name="09030565000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am
grateful for the Minister&#146;s offer to think again. I suppose that
chances are that she will come back and say that what we already have
is the best that we can do and what I have just said is what the
Government mean, but it has been useful to discuss what the word
&#147;serious&#148; means in such circumstances. It does not refer
only to how expensive the property was; it encompasses the sort of
things that we have been talking about.</div>
<a name="09030565000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question of fear for one&#146;s safety, we are all trying to move in
the same direction. But it strikes me that the clause is the wrong way
round: safety is the main thing, and then it takes fear into account in
judging safety&#151;whatever that means&#151;rather than fear being
the main thing, and an objective safety element being a backstop to
ensure that we are not going too far along the lines of simply
accepting what a timid person might say about their state of fear. I
ask the Minister to look at that
again.</div><a name="09030565000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
on the issue of real harm to the public interest, perhaps the Minister
is right that the best thing that she could have done today is what she
has done, which is to reiterate that what the provision meant last time
is what it means this time. I think that we are all now absolutely
clear what it means and we are at least in the position that we were
before. With that, Mr. Cook, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="09030565000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000515"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> It may be that the purpose of the amendments has
fallen away owing to amendments that were not accepted earlier when I
invited the Committee to accept a similar system for the coroners
courts as we have for the criminal courts. Amendment 399 adds two
categories of Appeal Court to subsection (6). I want to add High Court,
Queen&#146;s bench division. That would deal with appeals from the
Crown court or magistrates court and from the coroners, dealing with
matters equivalent to the divisional court&#151;I think it is now
called the administrative court, but that does not matter. It may well
be that since all that does not come into the Bill, my use of the High
Court, Queen&#146;s bench division, as an appeal court may have lost
its relevance.</div>
<a name="09030565000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 200
would include the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords and the
Supreme Court. If the Government have their way, the Judicial Committee
will turn into the Supreme Court and leave this building. It will be a
huge white elephant across the road, established at vast
expense&#151;a total waste of money&#151;but it appears that the
Judicial Committee will translate itself into the Supreme Court unless
we can do something about it. In any event, appeals might go from the
Court of Appeal to the House of Lords with either the leave of the
Court of Appeal or of the House of Lords. It is interesting that we do
not appear to have legislated for that possibility.</div>
<a name="09030565000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
think the purpose of amendment 375 has probably fallen away as a result
of this morning&#146;s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000516"></a>Maria

about the amendments that were meant to bring the coroners courts into
the ambit, given that we did not agree earlier that the provisions
ought to extend to the coronial
system.</div><a name="09030565000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
200 would allow the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords and, from
October this year, the Supreme Court to discharge or vary a witness
anonymity order. The Bill specifies the Court of Appeal, the Court of
Appeal in Northern Ireland and the Court Martial Appeal Court being
given power to vary or discharge a trial order in connection with an
appeal by the defendant if they feel that there is a need to do so. We
do not consider that it is necessary to extend such powers to the House
of Lords, which is only ever seized of cases when a point of law of
general public importance is involved. Therefore, it is hard to see
that that court will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column566" />Column number: 566</div>need to deal with an anonymity order, but under a general power in
section 35(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 for the purpose of
disposing of an
appeal,</div><a name="09030565000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
House of Lords may exercise any powers of the Court of Appeal or may
remit the case to the
Court.&#148;</div><a name="09030565000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
should give sufficient power in the rare event that it might ever feel
the need to discharge or vary such an order itself. The amendment is
therefore
unnecessary.</div><a name="09030565000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, the House of Lords can decide points of law or witness
anonymity orders that would then return to the Court of Appeal for it
to deal with as appropriate, following the guidance of the House of
Lords. On that basis, I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will
feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09030565000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000517"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000519"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> The new clause mirrors clause 78 for witness
anonymity orders and has been drafted for reasons of consistency and
clarity. Clause 78 directly re-enacts section 13 of the 2008 Act. To
avoid any possible confusion between the two different areas of law,
the provisions make it clear that the anonymity legislation does not
affect the common law rules under public interest immunity. That is not
to say that a witness anonymity order may not have effect to qualify
the duty to disclose material under the Criminal Procedure and
Investigations Act 1996, which we discussed earlier. A witness
anonymity order that includes provision requiring non-disclosure of
certain identifying information will, of course, do that, as we
discussed.</div><a name="09030565000239"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000521"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I beg to move amendment 449, in
clause 80, page 45, line 34, leave
out &#145;a magistrates&#146; court&#146; and insert</div>
<a name="09030570000007"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;a Youth Court where the case is
one in which, were the defendant an adult, the defendant would have
been tried in the Crown
Court,&#146;.</div><a name="09030565000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is another piece of unfinished business from the 2008 Act, namely
whether witness anonymity orders should be available in a magistrates
court as opposed to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column567" />Column number: 567</div>only in the Crown court. The Government&#146;s argument in relation to
the 2008 Act was that it was simply too complicated to write into the
statute the circumstances in which a magistrates court should or should
not have the power to make the orders and that therefore the power to
grant WAOs should be granted to the magistrates court in general. In
particular, the problem arose&#151;it is genuine&#151;that when
trying youths magistrates courts can be dealing with quite serious, or
very serious, offences. Some of those cases are just as serious as
similar cases tried in the Crown court, and the witness anonymity order
should therefore be available. It is perhaps worth having another go at
defining those circumstances precisely, so that in the general run of
things, the power to use anonymous witnesses is not given to the
magistrates courts in trivial cases.</div>
<a name="09030565000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument
runs as follows. Suppose there is a case that could be tried either in
the magistrates court or the Crown court. If witness intimidation is
going on, that is a good reason to transfer the case to the Crown
court. Therefore, giving the Crown court the sole power would be
sufficient. If a case is triable only by the magistrates courts, it
would be too trivial to allow such a drastic sort of witness anonymity
measure to apply. In any case, it is not entirely clear that the
facilities needed for anonymity exist in a large number of magistrates
courts. That point is worth making.</div>
<a name="09030565000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other
point is this. We have the experience of the 2008 Act, and we have
figures showing that very few witness anonymity orders have been made
in the magistrates court&#151;the figures given by the Minister as
evidence and those given by the DPP were slightly different, although
they were near enough the same. The question is whether it is still
worth continuing with that power.</div>
<a name="09030565000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000522"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Having posed as a friend of the magistracy at an
earlier stage of our considerations, the hon. Member for Cambridge has
now decided that it is not up to the job of dealing with anonymity
orders. Although the figures that we heard from the DPP during the
evidence-taking session indicated that the majority of the orders are
made in the Crown court, three were made in the magistrates court and
one in the youth court. Common law provisions allowed them to be made
anywhere, and our legislation attempted to put the common law position
as it had been understood before Davis back into effect by use of the
emergency statute last year. That seemed to work well, which I think
all members of the Committee accept. Therefore, we do not propose to
make any changes because the current arrangements seem to be
working.</div>
<a name="09030565000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000523"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Does the Minister have any more details of those
three cases in the magistrates court? What were the
charges?</div>
<a name="09030565000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000524"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I cannot relate to the hon. Gentleman precisely
what the charges were in those three cases. The one in the youth court
was a case of attempted burglary, but I hope he will forgive me if I
get back to him by letter about the cases in the magistrates court.
None the less, that does not change my point that the common law
provisions and last year&#146;s legislation appear to be working
well. There does not seem to be a compelling 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column568" />Column number: 568</div>reason to prevent one set of judges or magistrates, or one location,
from dealing with these matters. On that basis, we do not propose to
accept the amendment and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be
gracious enough to withdraw
it.</div>
<a name="09030565000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000525"></a>David
Howarth:</b> This is one of those cases where on one side, the
argument is that we do not know whether the power is appropriate for
the court so we should not have it, while on the other side, it is that
we do not know whether the power is appropriate so we might as well
have it. It comes down to one&#146;s view of on which side the
default option lies. On the basis that the Minister will write to me
about the three cases, I look forward to her letter&#151;it might
lead to further proposals or ideas, either here or in another
place&#151;and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

82 automatically extends eligibility for special measures to witnesses
to certain gun and knife offences listed in schedule 12. Our amendments
remedy an oversight in the drafting of schedule 12. At the moment the
schedule inadvertently neglects to list certain offences that we had
intended to include, such as murder and manslaughter in which a gun or
knife is alleged to have been used or involved, as well as offences of
wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, malicious wounding
and various offences of assault on the same
basis.</div><a name="09030565000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for
Liverpool, Garston Minister has said in previous debates, we are very
committed to tackling gun and knife crime. Witness fear and
intimidation levels are high in such cases, as my right hon. Friend the
Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East has described. We have the
opportunity to provide witnesses to all such offences with early
certainty that they will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column569" />Column number: 569</div>eligible to receive special measures assistance in the court to help
them give the most effective evidence and to encourage more witnesses
to testify. Of course, they will be able to opt out if they do not want
to take up that
assistance.</div><a name="09030565000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Member for Harborough tabled an amendment because he
spotted the oversight, but he only added one of the offences. I hope
that, for the purposes of completeness and because of the seriousness
of the other offences that I mentioned, he will withdraw his amendment
in favour of the Government
amendments.</div><a name="09030565000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000529"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Amendment 203 was a fuse that I
lit under the front door of the Ministry of Justice. It was quietly
making its way under the door&#151;bear in mind that it is amendment
203&#151;when the Minister woke up and realised that schedule 12 was
defective. So, 82 amendments later, she got down to tabling
amendment 285. Well done, I
say.</div><a name="09030565000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000530"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Obviously it is right to add serious and violent
offences, in addition to the offences that were in the clause
originally, although it seems an extraordinary way round for the error
to have been made. One can easily imagine the error being made the
other way around, with the serious offences going in but a lot of less
serious offences that the Government intended to be in being missed
out. We need some explanation as to the order of events, which seems
peculiar.</div><a name="09030565000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, there is a particular aspect of the clause that needs some
comment. Automatic eligibility for special measures is being enacted
for a broad range of offences, without there being any test on the
effect of the measures on the quality of the evidence. Normally, in
this particular area of the law, the test is whether, in various
different ways, the application of the special measures improves the
quality of the evidence. Why is that test being missed out now? That is
especially true given the proper addition of the offences under the
amendments. We are in a position where a large number of offences and
proceedings will automatically attract special measures. The Government
said in the impact assessment&#151;or perhaps somewhere
else&#151;that 24 per cent. of all violent crimes involve the use of
weapons in some way; we are now talking about where weapons are alleged
to have been carried. The question is whether courts are prepared for
the extent of the special measures that the amendments seem to
imply.</div><a name="09030565000266"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000531"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> All that I can say to the hon. Member for
Cambridge is that that was an unfortunate omission to schedule 12 in
the course of putting this particular part of the Bill together.
Clearly, as they are the more serious offences, it is, as he said,
rather unusual that it should
happen.</div><a name="09030565000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is that the Youth
Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 defines intimidated witnesses as
those whom the court judges are likely to have the quality of their
evidence diminished due to fear or distress connected to testifying in
criminal proceedings. To determine whether a witness is intimidated,
the court must take into account factors such as the nature and alleged
circumstances of the case, the age of the witness, the social, cultural
and ethnic background of the witness and any behaviour towards the
witness by the accused or their associates. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column570" />Column number: 570</div>In many cases, it is likely that a witness to certain gun and knife
offences will satisfy those criteria and therefore qualify for special
measures. The amendments to the clause and to schedule 12 will remove
the need for the court to consider whether the witness is
eligible. But the court will still have to agree which particular
special measures, if any, are used in a case when deciding whether they
will improve the witness&#146;s evidence, after taking into account
the witness&#146;s
views.</div><a name="09030565000268"></a>

that it breaks the link between the quality of the evidence given by
the witness in question and the reasons why that witness needs or seeks
special measures. Instead, the clause has a link between the type of
offence and the special measures. I am not clear&#151;I do not think
that the hon. Gentleman is, either&#151;why that is a better link,
unless the Government&#146;s argument is that there is merit in not
permitting a jury to believe that one particular defendant is more
guilty than another, simply because the witnesses against that
defendant are giving evidence with special measures. But if that is the
Government&#146;s argument, why do they not simply argue for special
measures for all witnesses under the age of 18 in all
circumstances?</div><a name="09030565000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000533"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The Bill makes eligibility for special measures
automatic for the specific class of witnesses, and I have listed the
types of things that will be involved. The court will still have
discretion to determine whether a particular special measure will be
available. It will only make the measure available if it is satisfied
that the measure will improve the quality of the evidence of that
particular witness, and whether the measure might inhibit the evidence
being tested effectively. That is why the clause is written in that
way.</div><a name="09030565000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">A</i><i class="I">mendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000536"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> We come to provisions concerning special measures
directions for child witnesses. Amendment 409 provokes a
discussion about those measures. Section 21 of the Youth
Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 is proposed to be
amended by clause 83. Section 21 is a fairly lengthy and
dense provision. We are concentrating on section 21(4), which says that
the primary rule in relation to special provisions relating to child
witnesses is subject to the following
limitations:</div><a name="09030565000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
the requirement contained in subsection (3)(a) or (b) has effect
subject to the availability (within the meaning of section
18(2)) of the special measure in question in relation to the
witness;</div><a name="09030565000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
the requirement contained in subsection (3)(a) also has effect subject
to section 27(2);
and</div><a name="09030565000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
the rule does not apply to the extent that the court is satisfied that
compliance with it would not be likely to maximise the quality of the
witness&#146;s evidence so far as practicable (whether because the
application to that evidence of one or more other special measures
available in relation to the witness would have that result or for any
other
reason).&#148;</div><a name="09030565000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
only would we amend that, but subsection (4) also sends tentacles off
into other parts of the 1999 Act. We are being required to play quite a
complicated game of snakes and
ladders.</div><a name="09030565000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
beginning of amendment 409 seeks to ensure that the special measures
directions for child witnesses provide adequate protection for them.
The way in which section 21 of the 1999 Act is amended is apt to do
what the Government intend. Amendments 409 and 208 concentrate on
proposed new paragraph (ba) to section 21 of the 1999
Act:</div><a name="09030565000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
the witness informs the court of the witness&#146;s wish that the
rule should not apply or should apply only in
part,&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09030565000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
the special measures should be ignored or
limited&#151;</div><a name="09030565000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
rule does not apply to the extent that the court is satisfied that not
complying with the rule would not diminish the quality of the
witness&#146;s
evidence&#148;.</div><a name="09030565000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that that means that if the witness does not want it, they do
not have to have it. It might be more sensible to state that if that is
what the witness wants, the court needs to be satisfied that the
witness understands the consequences of what they are agreeing
to.</div><a name="09030565000424"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="09030565000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
208 deals with that. It
states:</div><a name="09030565000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the

consent or a real understanding of its

do not want auto-suggestive children agreeing to do something because a

person under the age of 18&#151;they understand what they are being
offered, what that means, and what would happen were they to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column573" />Column number: 573</div>refuse it or only accept it in part. We mentioned that earlier in
relation to developmental maturity and
provocation.</div><a name="09030565000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
410 deals with proposed new subsection (4B) to the 1999 Act.
It makes reference to proposed new subsection (4A), which it would be
helpful to read
out:</div><a name="09030565000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where

witness&#146;s evidence or any part of it would fall to be given as

it.&#148;</div><a name="09030565000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
23 of the 1999 Act deals with screening a witness from the accused with
a physical
barrier.</div><a name="09030565000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed

states:</div><a name="09030565000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

is the same point and the same argument; I do not need to repeat
myself. We just need to ensure that the child witness understands the
consequences of not being screened, if that offer is
made.</div><a name="09030565000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
209 deals with a slightly different point. Subsection 83(6)
states:</div><a name="09030565000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;After
subsection (4B) (inserted by subsection

In making a decision under subsection (4)(ba) or (4B)(a), the court
must take into account the following factors (and any others it
considers

must be great fun to draft these provisions. The Government might say
that proposed new paragraph (b) deals with my arguments in
relation to amendments 208 and 410. If they do, I shall be
happy. If they do not, perhaps they will explain how children are to be
protected
adequately.</div><a name="09030565000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
complaint about proposed new section (4B)(b) is that the English it
uses is almost impenetrable, such

requirement does not apply to the extent that the court is satisfied
that making such a provision would not be likely to maximise the

because the application to that evidence of one or more other special
measures available in relation to the witness would have that result or
for any other
reason)&#148;.</div><a name="09030565000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am getting a David Thomas moment. It is well worth your meeting him,
Mr. Cook. If the hon. Member for Cambridge can whip you up
to Cambridge on the train and introduce you to Mr. Thomas,
you will be given a demonstration of poetry in motion. David Thomas
will be wandering around a lecture room, reading out those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column574" />Column number: 574</div>words with a demented look in his eye that he has borrowed&#151;the
demented look, not the eye&#151;for the purposes of destroying
through ridicule the Government&#146;s drafting of legislation in
totally impenetrable English. It is not necessary to draft even the
criminal law in words that are almost impossible to understand, so let
us see if we can do better than the provision. I do not know whether my
reasoning amounts to an argument in favour of an amendment, but it is a
plea.</div><a name="09030565000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
411 would insert at the end of proposed new section (4C)(a), which
deals with the age and maturity of the witness, a provision that deals
with the age and maturity of the defendant. Other provisions in the
canon of the criminal law might protect the defendant&#146;s interest
in such cases, but we are talking about special directions for child
witnesses. If the child witness is to be adequately protected, we also
need to make sure that the child defendant under the age of 18 is aware
of the consequences of the witness deciding either to accept or not to
accept a screening or special
provision.</div><a name="09030565000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
210 would add &#147;sex&#148; after
&#147;witness&#146;s&#148; under proposed section (4C)(d). I want
to add that as another factor in addition
to</div><a name="09030565000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;social
and cultural background and ethnic
origins&#148;.</div><a name="09030565000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that, in these days of equality, such a change might not make
much difference, but it probably would in reality. Young boys and young
girls often react differently to certain circumstances and it is
important that the court takes into account the sex of the witness in
the case of youngsters. Whether they do that in relation to adults is
another matter, but that is not germane to our current
discussions.</div><a name="09030565000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is difficult to create a legislative audit of the origins of clause 83,
which often happens with criminal justice legislation. However, the
Government are not only making a rod for their own back, but providing
an opportunity for law lecturers to earn a lot of money poking fun at
them. I just want clarity.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000537"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The idea of law lecturers making a lot of money
is rather amusing. David Thomas spent a year trying to teach me
criminal law with only limited success. He spent another year teaching
me criminology with more success,
however.</div><a name="09030565000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also having some difficulty in understanding clause 83. I am
grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for tabling some amendments,
in good faith, to clarify the intent. I shall say what I think the
intent is and ask the Government one
question.</div><a name="09030565000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intent seems to go along with the definitive criticism of how the
provisions have worked until now. Bodies such as the National Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Victim Support have said
that there should be some element of choice for the child witness and
that there ought to be a clearer connection between special measures
and the quality of the evidence. I hope that that is what is going on.
If so, it is a good thing and I agree with it, but it throws into
relief what is happening under clause 82, which seems to go in the
opposite direction. In clause 82, the Government seem to be going for
more automatic special measures, but in clause 83 they seem to be
responding to legitimate criticism of the automatic system and moving
towards a more flexible&#151;perhaps better&#151;system. There
seems to be a contradiction between clauses 82 and
83.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column575" />Column number: 575</div><a name="09030565000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000538"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> There is a large measure of agreement throughout
the Committee about the protection of child witnesses and about making
sure that they understand what is happening and are taken through that
in a proper fashion by the
court.</div><a name="09030565000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the amendments tabled by the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough, there are reasons for clause 83 to be written as it
is&#151;apart from proposed new section 4B(b), which he rightly said
makes plain English stand on its head. When special measures were
introduced in the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, it was
thought that all children should be protected from giving evidence in
the courtroom. The present system is for all child witnesses to give
their evidence in chief by a video-recorded statement, if one is made,
with further questioning taking place via live
link.</div><a name="09030565000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
reflection, we feel that that is a rather rigid presumption that
disregards the wishes of the child witness. Those particular measures
have been in force for more than six years, and we have since had the
benefit of independent research, which has involved interviewing young
witnesses. The result was that many young witnesses wanted more choice
in how they gave their evidence. That was supported by a review of
child evidence that led to the public consultation in 2007. In that
consultation paper, we proposed that the legislation should be amended
to give young witnesses more flexibility, subject to suitable
safeguards. As the hon. Member for Cambridge has said, almost all those
who responded were in
favour.</div><a name="09030565000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a result, clause 82 removes the rigid provisions and abolishes the
distinction between child witnesses in sex and violence cases and in
other cases, providing one rule for all. The provisions, however,
retain the existing presumption that the child witness will normally
give their evidence by video-recorded statement and/or live link, but
it allows the flexibility for them to opt out of that presumption, if
the court agrees. The aim is to make sure that accepting the opt-out
will not diminish the quality of the child&#146;s evidence. If that
is agreed and a child will be giving evidence in a courtroom, there is
still a presumption that the child will give evidence from behind a
screen. Again, should the young witness not wish to use the screen,
they will be allowed to opt out, but that too is subject to the
agreement of the
court.</div><a name="09030565000376"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Thus,
there will always be stopping points, at which the court will look
carefully at the young person&#146;s wishes before it decides to
abandon the normal presumption. The court must take a number of
specified factors into account, including the age and maturity of the
witness, which might not always be at the same level. Sometimes, a
14-year-old is more mature than a 16-year-old and so on, and the court
will have to look at that in some
detail.</div>
<a name="09030565000425"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="09030565000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
208, tabled by the hon. and learned Gentleman, says that the court must
be</div>
<a name="09030565000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;satisfied that
the witness&#146;s wish is based on informed consent or a real
understanding of its
consequences,&#148;.</div><a name="09030565000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with that. It is important that a young witness understands the
consequences of opting out in order to give evidence in a courtroom.
However, as he pointed out, we believe that that is covered under
subsection (6) 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column576" />Column number: 576</div>because the court must take into account the ability of the witness to
understand the consequences of the decision when considering the effect
of the request to opt
out.</div><a name="09030565000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
209 amends subsection (6), so that rather than being required to take
the specified factors into account, the court has to &#147;be
satisfied&#148; about them. That would turn the considerations into a
more rigid set of conditions before the opt-out could be approved,
which would probably make it more difficult for approval to be
given.</div>
<a name="09030565000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
suggest that there are other, slightly less important, parts to that
provision that make it unworkable. For example, it is rather odd to
suggest that a court would need to be satisfied about a
witness&#146;s age or ethnic origins, as that ought to be fairly
clear. The policy that we propose tries to meet the needs of the
individual child witness, rather than have a one-size-fits-all
approach. The court needs some flexibility in taking into account the
relevant factors within each case. On the whole, we should be able to
trust a court to exercise its discretion on a case-by-case basis. On
that basis, I am reluctant to accept the amendment.</div>
<a name="09030565000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
really understand the need to add the sex of the witness to the list of
factors that the court must consider. I would be concerned if the court
were to make a decision based purely on that, and there is the
possibility that it might be regarded by some as discriminatory. If the
witness&#146;s sex is relevant, the judge would already be entitled
to take that into account under subsection (6), because he or she can
take into account any other factors that they consider
relevant.</div>
<a name="09030565000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000539"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I suspect that some of the concerns expressed
relate to multiple factors. For example, within some groups of
particular ethnic populations there could be a concern about sex in
conjunction with their ethnicity, and there might be a strong cultural
presumption against giving evidence, or some fear of doing so. Is it
not important to ensure that all those factors are at least available
as part of the court&#146;s
consideration?</div>
<a name="09030565000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000540"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. Gentleman has almost answered that
question by talking about cultural considerations. A court should be
aware that the sex of a witness might have a bearing within those
cultural considerations. That should be taken into account in the
generality of the factors that the court should look
at.</div><a name="09030565000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
409 and 410 reflect a different approach by the hon. and learned
Gentleman to the provisions. They remove the ability of the child
witness to opt out from both the primary rule&#151;giving evidence by
live link and video recorded statement&#151;and from the fall-back
presumption of giving evidence in a courtroom behind a screen. That
would defeat the purpose of the changes that we are making and it would
leave us with the current, rather inflexible, system. I understand the
principle behind the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s
suggestion&#151;he wants to ensure that young witnesses remain
adequately protected&#151;but, as I said, we have consulted young
witnesses, and they do not want the measure. We are fairly confident
that the court will be able to supervise the opt-out arrangements and
will properly safeguard the interests of the young witness. The final
decision remains with the court, not the witness.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column577" />Column number: 577</div><a name="09030565000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should add
that before David Thomas has to go through proposed new section 4B(b),
we will have a look at it, if only to see whether putting in the odd
comma, full-stop, or other punctuation will make it a bit
clearer.</div>
<a name="09030565000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 411 would extend the presumption of evidence by video
statement and live links to all young defendants under 18. I agree that
young defendants need to be properly protected in the court, and that
they need to understand what is happening and why, but section 16 of
the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, which the clause
amends, specifically excludes the defendant as a witness for the
purposes of special
measures.</div><a name="09030565000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Special
measures were introduced to assist vulnerable or intimidated
prosecution and defence witnesses, aside from the defendant, to give
their evidence effectively and to reduce the stress of doing so. Young
defendants are in a different situation. A number of procedures are
already available to assist them. A judicial practice direction sets
out guidelines for the courts on the treatment of vulnerable
defendants, including the young, so that they understand and so that
they can participate properly in their trial. Provisions in the Police
and Justice Act 2006 make live links available to vulnerable
defendants who require assistance when giving evidence. Also, as we
will discuss when we come to clause 87, intermediaries will be
available to assist vulnerable defendants giving
evidence.</div><a name="09030565000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope, on that basis, that the hon. and learned Gentleman will feel able
to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09030565000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000541"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> It is probably unfair to keep bringing David
Thomas into these discussions. He has now retired from giving lectures
at the Judicial Studies Board, and I think John Spencer and Nicola
Padfield are the current victims who have to go through the piles of
Government legislation that spew out from the Home Office and Ministry
of Justice. I am sure that whichever of them is at the next JSB meeting
that I will attend in April will be utterly delighted to learn what the
Minister said about proposed new section 4B(b). Actually, they might
not, because she might deny them an opportunity to poke fun at the
Government&#151;perhaps I can do it for them. If the Government can
come up with something better and less unintelligible, we will have
achieved something.</div>
<a name="09030565000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
it is not necessary for the court to have proved that the factors in
subsection (6) are established to a high standard. However, merely
&#147;taking into account&#148; is a bit vague, especially in
relation to paragraph (b), which
states</div><a name="09030565000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
ability of the witness to understand the consequences before giving
evidence otherwise than in accordance with the
requirements&#148;.</div><a name="09030565000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Magistrates
and judges will take their duties under the new provisions seriously,
and they will not just do so on a whim or take a rush at it. They will
want to be persuaded by evidence of one sort or another, either
informally or formally, that the child in question knows what they are
about, so I will not be so untoward as to press the amendment to a
Division&#151;heaven forfend. However, when we construct legislation,
we should not rush in as the Government have. I ask them to please stop
this constant avalanche of legislation that needs to be amended by them
during our deliberations. I have no doubt that on Report, we will see a
raft of Government amendments. Moreover, as the Bill progresses through

<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 578</div>the other place, I am sure that there will be yet more Government
amendments. That undermines the confidence that I have, let alone the
public, in the Government&#146;s ability to construct legislation.
None the less, I am grateful to the Minister for what she has said, and
beg leave to withdraw my
amendment.</div><a name="09030565000328"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

clause 84, page 48, leave out line
44.</div><a name="09030565000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to delete subsection (2) , which
states:</div><a name="09030565000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
section does not apply if the place of trial is a magistrates&#146;
court.&#148;</div><a name="09030565000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are dealing with special provisions relating to sexual offences. My
simple question about subsection (2) is, why
not?</div><a name="09030565000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000543"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The amendment would extend to the magistrates
court automatic admissibility of video recorded statements as evidence
in chief for the complainants of sex offences. I know that the hon. and
learned Gentleman recognises the need for special measures for
complainants of rape and other sexual offences because of the trauma
involved.</div><a name="09030565000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is right to focus on the serious sex offence cases by giving early
certainty to complainants in offences such as rape about the way in
which they are likely to give their evidence in court. Those offences
are tried in the Crown court, and, on that basis, we have limited the
presumption of admissibility to that court. That does not mean that
video-recorded statements are not admissible in magistrates court. The
legislation simply establishes that the presumption of admissibility is
not
applicable.</div><a name="09030565000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already introduced automatic eligibility for complainants in sex
offence cases for special measures unless they wish to opt out. At
present, such video-recorded statements are admissible if the court
decides that their use will maximise the quality of the
complainant&#146;s evidence. That will remain the position for
magistrates courts. I hope that that gives the hon. and learned
Gentleman some explanation as to why we have not extended the
provisions to magistrates
courts.</div><a name="09030565000336"></a>

whether the Minister has assisted me very much. It may be that I have
not been listening properly. I do not see the point of having a
circular argument about it now, but someone needs to have a think about
it, and that may be me in due course. For the moment, I beg to ask

what we intend by this clause. Who are the people who are likely to be
supporters and what precisely will their role be? Are they there simply
to be passive hand-holders or are they more akin to social workers, who

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000546"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Again, I have a great deal of sympathy with the
spirit of the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s amendment, because it
will be absolutely necessary for the court to have the details of the
supporter before any direction can be made. However, he rightly
anticipated that I will say that this is a role for the rules committee
rather than for primary legislation. As much as anything, that is
because the application procedure for special measures is set out in
criminal procedure rules. As the committee is revising both the rules
of the court relating to special measures and the application form, it
seems to me that it would be more appropriate to leave it to that
committee to consider the point that he
makes.</div><a name="09030565000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Gentleman asked about the type of person who is likely
to be a supporter. Obviously, at present there are supporters
accompanying witnesses in the TV link room, but the process is not
governed by statute. This is a sensitive issue, so it is right that the
courts have the final say. He has given the example of the type of
person who might be a supporter and he is absolutely right; they might
be social workers, possibly teachers, or others, who will be able to
give the witness the confidence that they can present their evidence as
well as possible.</div>
<a name="09030565000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">In both
England and Scotland, when the witness is giving evidence in a link
room guidance issued by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform,
&#147;Achieving Best Evidence in Criminal Proceedings: Guidance on
Interviewing Victims and Witnesses, and Using Special Measures&#148;,
makes clear that the supporter should sit next to the witness in the
link room and in view of the camera. That way, the judge is able to see
both the witness and the supporter, and ensure that there is no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column580" />Column number: 580</div>coaching going on. In fact, judges generally have the ability to see on
their screens all of the room from which the witness is giving their
evidence. So I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will be
reassured on that basis that his amendments are unnecessary in this
case.</div><a name="09030565000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000547"></a>Mr.

213. What we require is that</div>
<a name="09030565000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
specified person must not give evidence on his own

would apply both to clause 85 and, under amendment 215, to
clause
87.</div><a name="09030565000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely
this must be a matter of common sense and it might be thought to be
self-evident. I have absolutely no doubt that the judge, when
introducing the live link witness and the supporter to the court, would
say that it must be borne in mind that the supporter is there to
support and not to give evidence on his or her own account. However, I
think that somebody somewhere needs to bear that in mind. It is
particularly true in big cities such as London, where I have some
experience, as is recorded, that the number of foreign-language
witnesses is growing.</div>
<a name="09030565000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">Quite apart
from the fact that it is increasingly expensive for the Metropolitan
police or whoever must pay for the interpreters, I suspect that a lot
of people giving evidence by live link do not speak English as a first
language. Therefore, people may be doubling up as interpreters and
supporters. I do not know whether that is anticipated or expected, or
whether it would be permissible under the regime. We need to be
careful. I am afraid that I have seen interpreters, no doubt trying to
be helpful, interpreting not just the language but the answers, adding
comments and reinterpreting the questions put to the witness. It
creates a frightful
muddle.</div><a name="09030565000353"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000551"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Is that not evidenced by cases where, even
allowing for the relative prolixity of one language to another, the
text is markedly different in length from the one delivered by the

<a name="09030565000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000552"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> That is one of the great advantages of the
<i class="I">Hansard </i>writers. They cut my speeches down to the most golden
English. However, I do not think that I am the only Member of
Parliament who has been assisted in that regard. My hon. Friend is
quite right. I shall leave it there, as I have made my point and there
is no point going on for too long on a happy Thursday
afternoon.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column581" />Column number: 581</div><a name="09030565000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000553"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> On the basis of the reasoned way in which the
hon. and learned Gentleman has put his case, I hope that I can reassure
him that his amendment is unnecessary. Practice direction explicitly
provides that the supporter should be completely independent of the
witness and his or her family and, indeed, have no previous knowledge
or personal involvement in the case. That is reinforced by criminal
justice system practitioner guidance.</div>
<a name="09030565000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 87, to
which we will come shortly, extends the use of the intermediary to
eligible vulnerable defendants if and when they give oral evidence. I
will not go into that in detail now, as I am sure that we will discuss
it when we reach clause 87, but I can give the hon. and learned
Gentleman the absolute assurance that anyone who is otherwise wanted to
participate in the trial will not be able to act as an intermediary or
supporter.</div><a name="09030565000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course there is concern to ensure that the intermediary does not
distort the evidence of the accused, as in the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s graphic example. The job of the intermediary is to
explain a question or answer; under the criminal justice system
procedural guidance, no other communication between the intermediary
and the defendant is acceptable. It must be open and transparent so
that the rest of the court is aware of what is said and why. I hope
that on that basis, he will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09030565000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000554"></a>Mr.

or social worker, then reminded us of the terms of the practice
direction, which suggests that the supporter must not have any
knowledge of the case. Clearly there will be cases in which a teacher
or social worker will have intimate knowledge of the case and therefore
will not be an appropriate supporter, but I take her general point. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<a name="09030570000019"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;and without the party calling
that witness giving such notice to the other parties in the proceedings
as the court may
direct&#146;.</div><a name="09030565000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is another brief amendment that seeks to firm up the requirement to
give proper notice to those interested in the matter. Clause 86 deals
with video-recorded evidence in chief and supplementary testimony. In
subsection (2), it says:</div>
<a name="09030565000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the witness may
not without the permission of the court give evidence in chief
otherwise than by means of the recording as to any matter which, in the
opinion of the court, is dealt with in the witness&#146;s recorded
testimony.&#148;</div><a name="09030565000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure, but the court may have an inherent power to admit other
relevant evidence. Even when the witness has already given evidence by
a recorded link, or in a recorded form, the court may have the power to
admit further evidence from that same witness. I suggest merely that
that further evidence should not be given without proper notice to
others interested in the proceedings&#151;without
the party calling that witness giving such notice to the other parties
in the proceedings that the court may
direct.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column582" />Column number: 582</div><a name="09030565000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, it
comes back to the court being taken by surprise. Everyone is geared up
for a particular witness to give evidence by a video recording. The
evidence in chief is given, the court proceeds on that basis and then
the party calling that witness says, &#147;Actually, the person who
is here has something further to say.&#148; I suspect that
administratively it would be more sensible to order the giving of such
evidence to be done on notice only. I will not bring the Bill to a halt
over this, but it is something that needs to be thought
about.</div>
<a name="09030565000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000556"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman is trying, and
rightly so, to give the witnesses and the defendant&#151;the court as
a whole&#151;a proper procedure whereby a decision can be arrived at
on the grounds of justice. Clause 86 relaxes part of the previous
restriction on asking further questions of a witness who has used a
video-recorded statement as evidence in chief. In fact, the witness can
be asked additional questions on something that has not been covered in
the video-recorded statement, and also on any matters that are covered
in the statement, provided that the court gives permission.</div>
<a name="09030565000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the case
of a prosecution witness, the defence will have been served with a
witness&#146;s video statement and a verbatim transcript in advance
of the trial. If something arises after that video recording has been
made, the witness will be invited to make either a further
video-recorded or written statement, and either or both of those would
have to be served on the defence. The service of further written
statements by the prosecution would put the defence and the court on
notice that the witness has further evidence to give in addition to
what was on the video, and the prosecutor will wish to conduct
supplementary examination in chief of the witness.</div>
<a name="09030565000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">In cases
where matters arise during the trial, the application to ask
supplementary questions will have to be made then. In practice, the
prosecutor will, at the appropriate stage of the proceedings, verbally
advise the defence and judge. I hope to give the hon. and learned
Gentleman some reassurance. As the rules committee is revising this
area of work at the moment, it would be appropriate for it to consider
whether any further rules and guidance need to be
applied.</div><a name="09030565000368"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030565000557"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> As the Minister was speaking, I discovered that
in January 2002 the Home Office communication directorate published
assistance for those preparing video-recorded interviews for criminal
proceedings and for those dealing with witnesses subject to special
measures. It is called &#147;Achieving Best Evidence in Criminal
Proceedings: Guidance for Vulnerable and Intimidated Witnesses
Including Children,&#148; and the guidance is available from the
Stationery Office and on the Crown Prosecution Service website.
Isn&#146;t that good? It may well be that that guidance is the
relevant place for the Minister to go first. However, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09030565000369"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
