<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> In the absence of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, I shall finish the point that he was making in response to my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang), who asked whether there would be a requirement to continue providing the service free to pilots of small planes.
<P>
No one can guarantee that the arrangement will stay the same for ever, but there are no plans to change and I understand from National Air Traffic Services that a change would in any case almost certainly cost more to administer than it would to collect and so would not be worth while.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): This has been a useful debate. The specified services are important and the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh made a key point about charges to private pilots. Some concern was expressed during consultation and I hope that when the service agreements are set up there will be some means—as I suspect that there is at the moment—for consultation on any proposed alterations to charges to enable people who enjoy flying, particularly amateurs, to avoid being stung.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
 THE CHAIRMAN, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Breach of duties or conditions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Portillo </B>(Kensington and Chelsea): We have alluded previously to the curious way in which the Bill is drafted: the habit of retracting, denying, or qualifying, even in rather general ways, what has been set out in a preceding clause or subsection. That describes clause 9 very well. It affects actions that may or may not be taken in connection with duties imposed in clause 8.
<P>
Clause 8 deals with the most fundamental and important of duties under the Bill. It requires the licensee to provide a safe system, to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the system is efficient and co-ordinated and to make provision to meet present and future demand. Those are core necessities and fundamental duties imposed on the licensee. Imagine our surprise, therefore, when we discover from clause 9 that no action will be taken and there will be no pecuniary redress in respect of a failure by the licence holder to perform a duty imposed by clause 8 or a condition of the licence. The clause then gets even more extraordinary, because the following subsection provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``subsection (1) does not affect . . . a right of action in respect of an act or omission which takes place in the course of the provision of air traffic services.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is slightly puzzling, because clause 8 appears to refer entirely to matters relating to the provision of air traffic services. Neither does the relief from action apply to the power to make an order under sections 15 or 21.
<P>
Previously, I compared the drafting of the Bill to the Charleston dance, in which one takes two steps forward followed by two steps back. However, this clause reminds me more of moonwalking, as practised by Michael Jackson, because it gives the illusion of moving us forward without ever actually leaving the spot and the drafting of the clause is wacky—an adjective that is sometimes applied to Mr. Jackson. Therefore, I would welcome some explanation from the Minister.
<P>
If the Minister can explain the drafting, is he satisfied that it is the simplest and clearest way to achieve whatever he wishes to achieve? After many years of plain English campaigns and many years in which Governments of both parties have committed themselves to making things less opaque, it is extraordinary to see such drafting. I anticipate that the Minister will say that the clause exactly mirrors the drafting of the dog licences Act 1991, which, for all I know, I spoke in favour of at the time. It really is not good enough. We are supposed to make progress over the years and the Government have committed themselves to plain speaking. Some Labour Members even practise plain speaking, although they are generally crushed for doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall do my best to satisfy the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo), but before I do, as this is the first time that I have been on my feet since last Thursday afternoon, I want to draw the Committee's attention to a mistake that occurs in Hansard of last Thursday, where Swanwick is referred to as Shanwick throughout. I would not want anyone who reads the record to think that Ministers do not know the difference. I noticed the mistake in the record of the afternoon's proceedings at columns 92, 93 and 94.
<P>
Clause 9 provides that no proceedings may be brought,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in respect of a failure by a licence holder to perform . . . a duty imposed by section 8''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a condition of a licence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the provision does not affect,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a right of action in respect of an act or omission which takes place in the course of the provision of air traffic services.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Neither does it affect the enforcement mechanisms specifically provided in the Bill. I have some sympathy with the right hon. Gentleman regarding the use of plain English. It has been my habit to speak in plain English and, like him, I am often mystified by the way in which matters are expressed in legislation. However, I can explain. The enforcement of the core duties in clause 8 is a matter for the CAA and the Secretary of State. The purpose of providing that no one else can enforce them is to avoid creating double jeopardy, and to make it clear that the Secretary of State or the CAA is responsible for enforcing the core duties. If an enforcement order is breached, it will be possible for anyone to bring an action for failing to obey an order, but it would not be desirable if any party could take proceedings for a failure of a core duty, because that should be a matter for the Secretary of State or the CAA. The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea rightly guessed that there are precedents for this in other legislation, not only that relating to dog licences, but other legislation relating to utilities and the sale of public assets. I suppose that what was good enough for the Conservative party when it was in Government is probably good enough for us.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> That is a wonderfully broad statement, which I very much welcome.
<P>
Let us suppose that a new airline is set up and has a rocky time financially in its early days. Let us suppose that its performance is substantially affected by the inability of NATS to predict demand, so that its planes are constantly delayed and it loses passengers, which contributes to the airline going bankrupt. Is the Under-Secretary saying that the airline will not be able to bring an action against NATS, even though NATS has failed to fulfil the condition imposed on it by clause 8 and by the licence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, but, hopefully, long before that stage is reached, the deficiencies will have become apparent and the Secretary of State or CAA will have taken appropriate action. Clause 8(b) requires the holder of the licence to,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``take all reasonable steps to secure that the system is . . . efficient and co-ordinated.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is for the Secretary of State or the CAA to enforce that requirement. No doubt, any company that is placed in the situation that the right hon. Gentleman describes would put its case to the Secretary of State or the CAA very quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for what he has said so far. That response did elucidate—for better or for worse—that it is not open to a member of the public or a commercial concern to take action against NATS in respect of a failure to meet the duties set out in clause 8 or in the licence unless it is an action in respect of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an act or omission which takes place in the course of the provision of air traffic services'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or it relates to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an order under section 15 or 21''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary provide an example of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an act or omission which takes place in the course of the provision of air traffic services''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which, by implication, would be the cause of an action between an airline and NATS?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Anything that is not provided for in clause 8, which sets out the core issues. In addition, if the Secretary of State or CAA issues an enforcement order that is not carried out, the airline will have a right to take action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Let us suppose that a serious disaster occurred, with one airliner allowed to crash into another. Would there be no civil liability on the company operating the air traffic control systems if it had been negligent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> There would be. Clause 9(2)(a) relates to the right to take action against the licence holder in respect of service provision—to claim damages, for instance. Matters relating to compliance arising from clause 8 are for the Secretary of State or for the regulator.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I assure the Under-Secretary that I am not trying to be tedious—I am as anxious to make progress as everybody else, but I want an example. An airline could not take action against NATS for the failure to provide enough capacity, unless there had been an order from the Secretary of State regarding such a failure. However, an airline could take action against NATS in respect of other actions or omissions. Might the failure to separate two aircraft, leading to a calamitous accident, be such an act or omission, rendering NATS liable to action?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, it would be.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Modification by agreement</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 157, in page 6, line 13, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and events or circumstances have occurred or come to pass which make the CAA consider that the original conditions of that licence have ceased to be appropriate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have moved to a new element of the Bill dealing with the modification of licences and the question of competition. I propose to leave discussion of competition until we reach the next clause, by which it is officially introduced, and to deal with the subject relatively quickly.
<P>
Clause 10(1) explains that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The CAA may modify the conditions of a licence if its holder consents to the modifications.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My concern is that the power is broad; the amendment would partially circumscribe it, preventing a conspiracy between the CAA and NATS to tidy up the licence for their convenience, without regard to the factors with which they had to deal. The amendment may be read with amendment No. 158, which would omit subsection (4), as we discussed earlier. The Secretary of State requires a veto over modifications under clause 10 to guard against such a conspiracy. The heavy-handed nature of the veto would not be necessary if subsection (1) was properly circumscribed so that only appropriate modifications could be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, we have reached the new subject of the modification of licences. If I give one of the little tours of the horizon that my fellow Under-Secretary is so keen on, it might help the debate and answer a few questions in advance.
<P>
I should remind hon. Members that NATS will, at first, be the only holder of a licence under clause 5 to provide air traffic services in the UK and in the Shanwick oceanic area. The licence to be granted initially by the Secretary of State will consist of two elements. The first is the terms on which the licence is granted—essentially, its duration, the licensed area in respect of which services are authorised to be provided, and the terms on which it can be revoked. The second is the conditions—the corresponding obligations with which the licence holder must be compliant if it is to continue to provide the services. Compliance with the conditions is enforceable by the CAA under the relevant provisions in clauses 21 to 25.
<P>
The elementary features of the licensing regime are broadly in line with the regimes established—here we go again with precedents—for other regulated industries under, for example, sections 12 to 15 of the Telecommunications Act 1984, sections 11 to 14 of the Electricity Act 1989 and sections 12 to 16 of the Railways Act 1993.
<P>
The fundamental rationale for the licence modification process is as follows. By their nature, licence conditions are detailed and prescriptive, laying down requirements for the actions or behaviour of the licence holder. For several reasons, they are intrinsically dynamic, providing for matters to be reviewed or replace—price control is put in place every five years, for example—or for them to be supplemented because of changes in circumstances or technology. There must, therefore, be a modification process, with appropriate checks and balances, by which the detailed licence conditions may be kept current. It is appropriate for the process to be primarily the responsibility of the regulator, with Ministers and the Competition Commission playing a higher-level backstop role. Each judgment calls into play the general duties of the regulator or of the Secretary of State.
<P>
The process places a framework around what is usually a negotiation between the licence holder and the regulator. There will always be discussions between them on the way in which actions or events are to be viewed under the licence, and an accommodation will usually be reached. However, agreement might sometimes not be reached. One or both of the parties might believe the matter to be sufficiently important to warrant being put beyond doubt by a licence modification.
<P>
The licensee may propose licence modifications, although the regulator must make the formal proposition and licence modification. More normally, the regulator will propose them following discussion with the licensee and others involved, such as someone who has complained about the adequacy of the licence control or the licence holder's compliance with it. In the event of disagreement between the licence holder and regulator, with the latter thinking that the public interest is being adversely affected, the matter may be referred to the Competition Commission for investigation and report. The regulator must modify the licence to deal with any adverse effects found. Licences may also be modified following public interest Judgments by the commission as part of a monopoly or merger case referred to it. Clauses 10 to 14 government the process.
<P>
Amendment No. 157 would require a further criterion to be met before the CAA could modify licence conditions with the consent of the licence holder. Licence conditions are detailed and prescriptive, laying down requirements for the actions or behaviour of the licence holder. They are intrinsically dynamic for the reasons that I have given.
<P>
The CAA may already, at any time, propose a licence modification, just as the licence holder may at any time, request a licence modification under the Bill. That means that the licence holder and the regulator can develop an appropriate method of keeping the licence relevant to the changing environment in which the licence is operated. A condition need not necessarily have ceased to be appropriate for the regulator and the licence holder to agree on a modification so as better to meet the duty obligations imposed on them.
<P>
The Secretary of State will retain a power of veto over any proposed modification with which the CAA is bound to comply, thereby safeguarding against regulatory capture, which I think means the outside chance that the regulator will go native. That has not happened in the case of any regulators appointed so far, I am glad to say. In the circumstances, the amendment is unnecessary, and I therefore invite the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) to ask leave to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I guessed that subsection (4) had something to do with regulatory capture, but I could not remember the phrase. If I heard the Minister correctly, the words he used circumscribed and qualified the nature of the modifications; the question is why there is not a general circumscription to confine or limit the power to modify. At present, there is an open door to make any modification, subject to the Secretary of State's veto. The idea seems to be, ``Let's fling it wide open and rely on the Secretary of State to shut the gate.'' I do not understand why such a wide power is necessary.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It is because circumstances can change, which the Bill as drafted allows for. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, his amendment does not add anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I will not go into the ``my client has no legs, so why should you insure my client against losing his legs?'' argument; I have made my point. I am a little confused by the issue, but that could be my problem, not the Minister's. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page 6, line 28, leave out `directs the CAA' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`gives a direction to the CAA requiring it'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 233 to 250.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> These amendments are technical improvements to ensure that there is certainty about the method by which any directions are given under the Bill. The Committee will be aware that clause 86 sets out the manner in which documents are to be served; subsection (7) of that clause states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``references to serving include references to similar expressions (such as giving or sending).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hence, it will cover the giving of directions. It is in the plain English that the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea and I are so keen on.
<P>
There are several references in the Bill to directing a body or a person; the amendments change that to incorporate references to giving a change of direction. Consistency with other directions giving powers is the sole purpose of the amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 10, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>References to Competition Commission</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 253, in page 6, line 33, leave out `may' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall before granting a licence and may at any other time thereafter'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I accept that the drafting of these complex provisions may be seriously lacking in logic, but they are probing amendments, designed to allow the Minister to expand on the meaning of the clause. I confess that I do not fully understand the proposals.
<P>
 The amendment would omit the word ``may''; it suggests that the CAA ``should'' investigate and report before granting a licence. We believe that there should be competition at the outset because NATS is a monopoly. The commission needs to be questioned about the nature of that monopoly, especially as the public-private partnership may itself fall foul of monopoly provisions, there being only one contract to let. To what extent is there a sufficiently competitive tender, based upon normal open-market criteria? Is such a tender based upon non-open-market criteria such as suitability, fit and proper people and so on? The amendment gives the Minister the opportunity to explain what the Competition Commission will be looking for in any reference, and in what circumstances he thinks that such a reference would be made.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 261, which would leave out subsection (6), was tabled to discover what sort of information the CAA would give to the commission. Amendment No. 262 would delete the end of subsection (7) so that it would read—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are considering amendment No. 253. Amendments Nos. 254, 262 and 261 are the next group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I apologise for leaping ahead, such is my enthusiasm for making progress. Will the Minister comment on the points that I have made?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman had us worried for a moment. I accept the spirit in which this probing amendment was tabled. When hon. Members do not have Government lawyers at their disposal, they cannot always be sure that a proposal would achieve the desired goal.
<P>
The effect of the amendment would be to transfer to the Competition Commissioner a job that the Government believe, should remain with the regulator. In its discussions about the licence, the Committee has recognised the need for flexibility in its detail. I do not wish to weary the Committee with excessive repetition, but I remind hon. Members that, by their nature, the licence conditions are detailed and prescriptive, and lay down requirements for the actions or behaviour of the licence holder. They must, therefore, be capable of being modified, either because they provide for matters to be reviewed or replaced—price control, for example—or because the market, the nature of the business, or technology has changed.
<P>
The need to be able to modify licence conditions leads in turn to the need for a modification process, complete with appropriate checks and balances. The Government believe, as did their predecessors, that the licence modification programme should be primarily the responsibility of the regulator, with Ministers, and the Competition Commissioner having a higher, backstop, role.
<P>
The modification process places a framework around what is usually a negotiation between the licence holder and the regulator. There will always be discussions between the licence holder and the regulator about how particular actions or events are to be viewed under the licence, and usually an accommodation will be reached on that matter. Clause 10 recognises that most regulatory discussions will result in a sensible agreement—including, where necessary, to modify the licence—between the licence holder and regulator.
<P>
However, sometimes that agreement cannot be reached, and that is where the role of the Competition Commissioner, reflected in clause 11, becomes important. Any reference to the Competition Commission will be in relation to a licence modification—almost certainly one which the CAA has proposed to a licence holder and which the licence holder has rejected. It would generally be a last resort, to occur only after consultation, discussion and negotiation, either formally or informally, has failed.
<P>
The Competition Commission is the body long established as being best placed to make public interest judgments on sector-specific regulatory matters, as well as on competition matters. The commission's general functions, which are set out in the—I do not know where they are set out because my notes, having started on that sentence, do not take me to the end of it. We will pass over that, Mr. Gale, and move on to my concerns.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> You are on your own now, Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I would not quite say that.
<P>
My concern is that the amendment would alter the Commission's role and constrain it in carrying out its duties.
<P>
The commission does not have, and never has had, a role in granting licences, although its role in the modification of licences is well established in previous utility regulation. Amendment No. 253 would, in my opinion, turn the Competition Commission into a quasi-licensing authority, in that it would invite the commission to ``rubber stamp'' a licence before it was granted. That is not what the Competition Commission is for; its expertise is the public interest, not the detailed workings of a sector of an industry or an individual licensee within that sector: that is what the sector regulator is for.
<P>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> May I ask the Minister to reassure me that the measure is necessary? We start with a licence that is issued to NATS; the contractor who comes in, the strategic partner, is obviously bound by the conditions of that licence. There may be variations in the conditions thereafter, which are agreed between the CAA and NATS, but even in such a case the Secretary of State can veto that agreement in case of regulatory capture. The Minister seems be talking about a middle case, in which the licence holder has proposed an amendment to the licence but the CAA has not accepted it, and that being so, the licence is not altered because the licence can be altered only through the agreement of the two. Not only does the Secretary of State have an explicit veto, but the CAA has, in effect, a primary veto, so why is it necessary to involve the Competition Commission?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It is the opposite way round: intervention by the commission is envisaged in circumstances in which the CAA proposes an amendment to the licence and the licence holder rejects it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I think that I understand. The role of the Competition Commission has little to do with competition and nothing to do with a hypothetical multiplicity of licences or of operators 30 years down the line. It has everything to do with the potential abuse of monopoly position and the public interest. The Under-Secretary has done us a great service. I now understand this clause. We can afford to push on because we will have ample opportunity to tease out other points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I agree that the Under-Secretary has done us a great service. Does my hon. Friend agree that the icing on the cake would be to hear the end of the sentence that terminated in mid-air?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We could play ``Spot the Ball'' and guess the end of the sentence, but I suspect that the Under-Secretary was going to refer to Competition legislation, which I may have in my bag. Perhaps I should have been more helpful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> As you know, Mr. Gale, I was panting to get on to this group of amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 254 would add a new subsection to clause 11. Its purpose is self-evident. It would make public the fact that a reference is being made to the commission. In the normal course of events, I imagine that the CAA would want to regulate its licences publicly. Judging from the stream of press releases that are issued by the rail regulator, it would probably issue a press release, constituting of a report that states what it is up to. However, the Bill should contain an obligation to do that. The CAA should also be obliged to consider representations that are made about the reference, especially as there is a curious procedure that allows the goal posts to be moved, even after a reference has been made. We want to ensure that there is openness and consultation about the nature of the reference.
<P>
Amendment No. 261 would be redundant if the Committee accepted new subsection (1). Rather than the commission putting an obligation on the CAA to give the commission information, the representations that are made to the CAA would be more informative. Amendment No. 262 relates to subsection (7), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In carrying out the investigation concerned the Commission must take account of any information''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would add:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and any representations received by the CAA under subsection (1A)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments would cover the provision of information more comprehensively than the clause. They would also put an obligation on the CAA to consider representations and pass them on to the Competition Commissioner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I hope that I am not doing the hon. Gentleman an injustice in wondering whether he is really seeking an explanation of what is intended by the provisions. The amendments would increase the bureaucracy of the licence modification process and shift the balance in a well established system of checks and balances. I do not think that that is what he intends.
<P>
Amendment No. 254 would require the CAA, before it made a modification reference, to publish a report stating why the reference was being made and to accept representations on whether the reference should go ahead. We are talking about a situation in which the CAA and the licensee disagree about a proposed modification. Clause 11 does not come into effect until there has been a failure under the terms in clause 10, which is entitled ``Modification by agreement.''
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The role of the Competition Commission is to be a longstop. The CAA will make a modification reference only after consultation, discussion and negotiation with the licensee fail to result in agreement. Clause 13(3) requires the CAA to consult on any licence modification that it proposes to make as a consequence of a reference. Much of what the hon. Member for North Essex advocates is possible under proposed arrangements.
<P>
The commission will consult widely when it is dealing with a reference. It can require virtually any information or evidence that will assist in its deliberations to be given in person. No one can be compelled to give evidence or produce a document that he could not be compelled to give or produce in civil proceedings before a court, but that is the only restraint on the commission's information-gathering powers. In dealing with a modification reference, the commission would, as a matter of course, invite the licensee and other interested parties—the licensee's customers being an obvious example—to give evidence or provide information. We can safely assume that the licensee will make representations to the commission without an invitation. It is preferable that the commission receives the views of the interested parties first hand and not through the CAA or another sector regulator, which would be the case if amendment No. 262 were accepted.
<P>
Amendment No. 261 would remove the duty on the CAA to provide the Competition Commission with information relevant to the matters at hand and would substitute, through amendment No. 262, an obligation on the CAA to provide the Competition Commission instead with any representations received under amendment No. 254. In undertaking an investigation, the Competition Commission will have wide-ranging access to information that it thinks it needs to carry out its task. It is duty bound to consider all representations that are made to it. It can, of course, take its own views on the relative value of the information that it receives, and I have no doubt that it is experienced in sniffing out bias. The Bill is not broke and it does not need fixing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to hear the brutal truth. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 255, in page 6, line 42, leave out subsection (2).
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or not to give effect to the variation'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> These are relatively simple amendments. They would remove the right of the CAA to vary the nature of the reference once it has been made to the commission. That threat to move the goal posts is unhelpful and it may not be fair on the licence holder.

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>3.34 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I was saying that I am fully aware that the power to vary a reference to the commission is spelled out in that brilliant piece of legislation, much mimicked by the Government, the Railways Act 1993. Will the Under-Secretary explain how and why variation might be made and say whether there are any circumstances in which such a variation has been made under the 1993 Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's desire to maximise clarity in the licence modification process, but I think that he might have been alarmed unnecessarily by the flexibility that clause 11(2) provides and which amendment No. 255 would remove. I am sorry to keep repeating this, but it is a fact of life to which we must return at regular intervals that the provisions in clause 11(2) are nothing new. Section 13(2) of the Railways Act 1993—a wonderful piece of legislation, although we might have to amend it—and section 13(2) of the Telecommunications Act 1984 are almost identical. They allow the regulator to vary the terms of a reference to the Competition Commission while an investigation is in progress. There are good reasons for that.
<P>
Competition Commission investigations are exhaustive and lengthy. I do not imply any criticism in saying that: the commission is meticulous in gathering and sifting evidence, canvassing opinion, considering representations made to it and reaching and reporting on its conclusions. It is possible that circumstances may change during the course of an investigation, which would be dealt with by varying the terms of the reference. The reference process itself might bring to light issues that make it appropriate to vary the terms. Changes of circumstances outside the original scope of the reference process might make it necessary to do the same. For example, the commission might be asked to consider a new charge cap, on which the regulator and the licensee had failed to agree. If, in the course of that investigation, a complaint was made to the CAA that the licensee was subsidising another of his businesses with revenue from the licensed activities, the CAA might want the commission to look into that as well, not least because of the effect that the alleged cross-subsidy might have on the charge cap on which the commission had been asked to rule in the first place.
<P>
I do not know whether Opposition Members have seen the terms of reference to the commission. Generally speaking, they are comprehensive and specific—and for good reason. Everyone knows what is being considered and what the commission is required to produce definite conclusions about. Therefore, the purpose of the provision is not to allow the regulator to change the rules at will, but to make certain that the purpose of a reference is not frustrated by a change in the circumstances surrounding the reference. There is nothing sinister in the power to vary a reference; it merely allows best and most cost-effective use to be made of the commission's time and expertise. Varying a reference while an investigation is in progress is unlikely to happen in every case.
<P>
In summary, the provision, for which there are many precedents, allows the effective operation of the licence modification process. I am sure that when the hon. Member for North Essex reflects on the logic of the provision, he will want to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his explanation. This is proving to be an education for me, and I am finding it very helpful, as, I am sure, is the Committee. In fact, his explanation gave me more pleasure than he might imagine. He referred to the Telecommunications Act 1984, the drafting of which was supervised by my father—the first of several innovations that have been copied ever since. It is nice to see that something permanent has come from his efforts. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 263, in page 7, line 34, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the duties imposed on the licence holder by section 8'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We return to our dear old friend, clause 8, which imposes duties on the licence holder to do certain things in a certain way. Clause 11(8) provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In deciding under this section whether a matter operates, or may be expected to operate, against the public interest the Commission must have regard to the matters as respects which duties are imposed on the Secretary of State and the CAA by sections 1 and 2.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Surely the duties imposed on licensees are also relevant, because those duties affect their behaviour. They are included in the Bill presumably because they are intended to affect the behaviour of the licensee. Therefore, the commission should have due regard to them. There is no point in the commission reaching a conclusion that requires a modification of the licence if it has neglected to consider section 8 duties. That requires an explanation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> My first thought when looking at the amendment was that it seemed to he a perfectly reasonable proposal and one that I should consider. Then a piece of paper arrived on my desk saying, ``Resist'', so I decided to do some resisting. However, when I considered the amendment, I concluded that it was unnecessary, and I hope that my explanation of why I came to that conclusion will persuade the hon. Member for North Essex to withdraw it.
<P>
Here we go again. Other legislation, in which members of the hon. Gentleman's family might or might not have played a part, including the Electricity Act 1989, the Water Industries Act 1991—I served on the Committee that considered that Bill, and it was a gruelling time—and the Gas Act 1986 are precedents for imposing a statutory duty on licensees. All contain provisions that are virtually identical to subsection (8) and none includes a requirement on the Competition Commission to take account of the licence holder's statutory duties in deciding whether a matter operates against the public interest in the context of a licence modification reference.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex may be about to suggest that, just because a similar provision was contained in legislation passed by the Conservative Government, it must be a good thing and we do not need to add to it, even with the benefit of hindsight, but the mere fact that it was included in previous legislation is insufficient. However, it suggests that the clause has been thought about and that we have some experience of its operation. I fully understand that, for the protection of the licensee, the hon. Gentleman would like the Competition Commission, in considering any licence modification proposition by the regulator, to take account of whether the licensee is constrained by its statutory duty. For example, if the regulator were to propose something that the licensee believed would constrain its ability to comply with its statutory duty, that would be legitimate grounds for refusing to accept the modification.
<P>
I have every sympathy with the hon. Gentleman and reassure him that there is no question of that not constituting a legitimate ground for a licensee to reject a modification, and one that the Competition Commission would be bound to consider in any event. The proposition of a licence amendment that would put the licensee in breach of its statutory duty while the regulator remained compliant with its statutory duties is self-evidently ludicrous. In proposing the licence modification, the Competition Commission is testing whether the regulator is acting in the public interest. That implies that, while the regulator may be acting within his duties, there could be wider reasons why a particular licence modification should or should not be made. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That was not as clear an explanation as the Under-Secretary has given in the past. Unless the clause 8 duties could impose an obligation on the licence holder to do something that is not in the public interest, I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's logic, notwithstanding the parenthood of previous legislation, which was a sweet and harmonious union duly sanctified, whereas the Bill is illegitimate. I fail to understand how there could be a conflict between the clause 8 duties and the duty on the Secretary of State and the CAA, unless there is an inherent deficiency in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I can only repeat what I said. There is no question of that not being a legitimate ground for a licensee to reject a modification, and one that the Competition Commission would be bound to take into account in any event.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If by that the Under-Secretary means that will be implicit in any direction that the Competition Commission makes, because the licensee will be able to reject any such modification that does not comply with its duties, then I accept what he says. It is just a little difficult to understand, as the Under-Secretary found when he first considered the clause. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 264, in page 7, line 37, leave out subsection (9).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 265, in page 7, line 44, leave out subsection (10).
<P>
No. 266, in Clause 12, page 8, line 20, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The amendments give the Under-Secretary an opportunity to explain how the provision connects with previous legislation on competition and the regulation of monopolies. The provisions relate to sections 70 and 85 of the Fair Trading Act 1973, section 24 of the Competition Act 1980, part II of schedule 7 of the Competition Act 1998 and section 82 of the 1973 Act. Will the Under-Secretary explain how the clause connects with those Acts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It would be discourteous of me to speculate that the hon. Member for North Essex might have proposed the amendments because it was not immediately obvious to him what the subsections that he proposed to delete meant. If that is the case, I do not blame him. The provisions are procedural and—here we go again—there are equivalent measures in sections 13 and 14 of the Railways Act 1993, sections 12 and 13 of the Electricity Act 1989, and sections 13 and 14 of the Telecommunications Act 1984, to name but three.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Does the Under-Secretary agree that it would be convenient for the Committee if, in future, when this argument about the existence of similar provisions in previous legislation is to be used, we just call it ``argument a''?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It might be convenient for the Committee, but I do not think it would be convenient for the Official Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I do not agree that it would be convenient for anyone because I rather enjoy drawing attention to past history, but I agree that it does not make the clauses any easier to digest. Therefore, I shall try to explain them.
<P>
The Fair Trading Act 1973 sets down, among other things, the functions of the Competition Commission in relation to merger and monopoly references. The provisions that relate to licence modification references to the commission, in common with the equivalent provisions of other sectoral legislation, set out the process that such references are to follow by incorporating and, where appropriate, amending, relevant provisions of other competition legislation—the Fair Trading Act 1973 and the Competition Acts 1980 and 1998.
<P>
Section 70 of the 1973 Act specifies time limits within which the commission must make a report on a reference. Section 85 gives the commission power to require attendance of witnesses and the production of documents. Section 82 requires the commission, in making a report, to have regard to the need for excluding from reports material that might seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of an individual or of a particular body of persons, corporate or otherwise.
<P>
Section 24 of the Competition Act 1980 gives the Secretary of State powers to modify, by order, part II of schedule 7 of the Competition Act 1998—which, the Committee will recall, sets out how the commission is to perform its functions—so as to improve the commission's performance.
<P>
What does all this mean, I hear the hon. Member for North Essex asking, in the context of the Bill? It means that when undertaking a reference under the relevant clauses of the Bill, the Competition Commission is to behave as it usually does, except when it is specifically instructed otherwise. Every reference under clause 11 is to specify a period of no longer than six months within which a report on the reference is to be made. The commission's report on a reference is not to have effect unless it is made either within the specified period or within an extension of not more than six months, granted by the CAA. The CAA may grant an extension only if the commission requests one and if it is satisfied that there are good reasons for it. The 1973 Act refers to the Secretary of State, rather than the regulator, and the extension may be for no longer than three months.
<P>
The commission may require any person to attend to give evidence, or to give written evidence. That evidence may be taken on oath and it is an offence to refuse to provide it, or to falsify it. The offence can attract a financial penalty or, in the case of falsifying evidence, imprisonment. The investigation required by the reference is to be carried out by a group of at least three persons selected by the chairman of the commission. The Secretary of State—for Trade and Industry, in this instance—can exercise his powers to modify, by order, part II of schedule 7 of the Competition Act 1998, which sets out how the commission is to perform its functions.
<P>
In making reports, the commission is to have regard to the need for excluding from them material that might seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of an individual or a particular body of persons, corporate or otherwise. That is what clause 12(2) is about.
<P>
I hope that what I have said is helpful and has put into plain English what was, I agree, obscure. I hope that it has reassured the hon. Member for North Essex that clauses 11(9), 11(10) and 12(2) have a purpose, which is not, however it may appear, to confuse but to clarify. In the light of that clarification I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I should be interested to know whether that phrase about withdrawing the amendments is in the Under-Secretary's brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The word ``resist'' does feature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I think that we have solved the problem of what was perhaps missing from a previous note of his. I think it was the words ``are set out in part II of schedule 7 of the Competition Act 1998''.
<P>
I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his use of what is perhaps the Committee's equivalent of the West Lothian question—the Islington put-down.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank you for clearing up my confusion, Mr. Gale.
<P>
We are forced to use three amendments to rewrite subsection (5). The finished text that we want is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``But the Secretary of State must receive representations made by the licence holder if they think that the publication of any matter would be against the public interest or any person's commercial interests, and he must before the end of the specified period direct the CAA to exclude the matter from every copy of the report to be published as mentioned above.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would take from the Secretary of State the power to withhold publication of information and place on the CAA or licence holder the burden of making representations on the matter.
<P>
Section 82 of the Fair Trading Act 1973, which is referred to in clause 12, states that in making a report
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Commission shall have regard to the need for excluding . . .<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) any matter which relates to the private affairs of an individual''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(b) any matter which relates specifically to the affairs of a particular body of persons . . . where publication of that matter would or might . . . seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of that body''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The section also provides that the report of the advisory committee or of the commission shall receive absolute privilege with reference to defamation. Thus, when a reference was made, the commission would have to pay regard to certain commercially sensitive matters.
<P>
Clause 5 seems to be a case of double banking, since it would enable the Secretary of State to insist that there was a relevant consideration of public or, more particularly, commercial interest. Why are both provisions included? We think that our wording might improve matters, but I am interested in what the Minister has to say about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We understand the intention behind the amendments and think that they are not unreasonable, even if we cannot yield to them. They appear to be designed to ensure that the licensee's commercial interests, in particular, would not be damaged by the publication of a Competition Commission report.
<P>
When the Competition Commission is undertaking an inquiry it can require virtually any information or evidence that it believes it needs for its deliberations to be given in person. No one may be compelled to give any evidence or produce any document that he could not be compelled to give or produce in civil proceedings before the court, but the commission will gain possession of a great deal of sensitive information.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
After completing its investigation the commission will record its conclusions and the evidence on which they are based in a report, in which it will also make recommendations as to how the relevant matters should be approached. The report, as required by subsection (3), is made to the CAA as sector regulator.
<P>
Subsection (4) imposes on the CAA an obligation to send a copy of the report to the licensee and the Secretary of State. Subsection (6), the Secretary of State would then give the regulator and the licensee, as the parties affected by the report, 14 days to request that parts be deleted, for reasons of confidentiality. The licensee would thus make representations direct to the Secretary of State.
<P>
Information that might arguably be commercially prejudicial would include such matters as information on the terms under which the licensee did business with other entities; a detailed breakdown of the turnover of the licensee's businesses other than the licensed business itself; and details of what the licensee anticipated spending on individual investment projects. The Secretary of State would consider the representations and might direct the CAA to delete from the report any material whose publication he believed would be against the public interest or prejudicial to anyone's commercial interest.
<P>
It is right that the Secretary of State should determine what should be excised and that he should consider representations from the licensee, but without being bound to accept them. The licensee would hold views—as would any commercial entity—on what information about the business should or should not be put in the public domain. The customers would also have views on the matter, and I doubt whether the two would always coincide. The Secretary of State would have to find the balance. That is why the conditionality of subsection (5) is needed.
<P>
The Committee will want to know that it is the Secretary of State's practice to start from the strongest possible presumption that, in the interest of transparency and accountability, a report of the commission must be published in full unless it is clear that a person would suffer real commercial prejudice as a result. Moreover, in long-standing practice in matters of this kind, it is clear from the published report where excisions have been made and to what they relate.
<P>
The process of representations about excisions has been established over many years and, on the whole, has not proved greatly contentious or disadvantageous to the companies affected. Therefore I hope that the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) is reassured that the licensee's interests will be adequately protected and he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

(c) the Secretary of State may by order set aside any modification upon which he has received such an appeal.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Clause 13 relates to the modification of a licence following a report from the commission. It applies if a reference has been made under section 11 and it has been decided that a modification must be made.
<P>
We are testing whether there should a greater obligation to consult. Amendment No. 270 would include new subsection (4A), given in amendment No. 273, by which the licence holder might gain redress against a Competition Commission modification. Such an amendment might not have been required previously, but the handing over to the private sector of the function is exceptional. There is surely good cause, on grounds such as safety, for the licence holder to be able to make an appeal if it had reasonable grounds to believe the modification to be prejudicial to, for instance, its duties under clause 8, which include safety. It should have a backstop by which the Secretary of State might halt the process.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 271 and 272 also relate to the proposed subsection. Subsection (3)(b) requires the CAA to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``publish a notice in such manner as the CAA thinks appropriate for bringing the matters to which it relates to the attention of persons likely to be affected by the making of the modifications''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could be simplified to specify the contents of the Competition Commission's report. Amendment No. 272 is a tidying-up amendment that would omit subsection (4)(b) if amendment No. 273 were accepted. Why has the period of 28 days been specified in the subsection?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I understand the thrust of the amendments, which is to ensure that the CAA provides disclosure to the licence holder before publicising or finalising its proposals, and to allow the licence holder to appeal to the Secretary of State before the final modifications are announced. Should there be further negotiations between the licence holder and the CAA? In short, there should not be. I shall expand on my answer and explain that many opportunities for the licence holder to make representations are already provided.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 270 and 273 relate to clause 13, which sets out the procedure for modifying a licence condition once the Competition Commission has reported. Under clause 12, a matter may be referred to the commission. It might identify effects adverse to the public interest that could be remedied by modifications of licence conditions, which it would specify. Members of the Committee will recall that a reference would have been made to the commission only if, in the initial stage of representation and discussion between the parties, the CAA and the licence holder had been unable to agree on whether a modification proposed by the CAA should be made. The referral is made so that the commission may judge whether modification is in the public interest.
<P>
The clause requires the CAA to make appropriate licence modifications to remedy or to prevent the adverse effects specified in the commission's report, and it sets out the process that it must follow before doing so. Amendments Nos. 270 and 273 would require the CAA to consult with the licence holder before making the modifications required of it under clause 13(2). Further, the licence holder would be allowed to appeal to the Secretary of State regarding the modifications and ask him to order them to be set aside.
<P>
The clause requires the CAA to bring proposed modifications, with their effect and the reasoning behind them, to the attention of affected parties—including the licence holder, obviously—and to consider representation made within a specified period, which may not be less than 28 days. The process will allow the licence holder and other interested parties to address issues arising from the proposals before amendments are made.
<P>
I should digress to discuss amendment No. 272, which would remove the requirement on the CAA to publish a time limit within which representation must be made. A time limit is obviously essential because of the CAA's obligation to consider all representations: not to impose a time limit would make the modification process unworkable. It seems reasonable for representations to be made within 28 days.
<P>
There is no suggestion that the CAA, having received the commission's recommendations, would be free to proceed to make modifications without any regard to others' views. The licence holder should rightly be able to make representations to the CAA if it believes that the proposed modifications will not appropriately remedy the adverse effects identified by the commission. The CAA is not bound to make exactly the modifications recommended by the commission, but subsection 3(a) places a clear duty on it to have regard to them. The requirement, in a notice under subsection (4), to explain its reasons for proposing modifications is a further check on it.
<P>
The commission will have received evidence from the licence holder during its reference investigation and will have reached a conclusion with the benefit of knowing the licence holder's views. Introducing the further hurdle of a possible appeal by the licence holder to the Secretary of State would complicate and prolong unnecessarily an already long and comprehensive process. Further, the amendment does not specify the grounds on which the Secretary of State could set aside a modification, not does it suggest that he should be required to give his reasons for so doing.
<P>
Amendment No. 271 would remove the requirement on the CAA to publish a notice of proposed modifications appropriately and to bring the matters to the attention of persons likely to be affected by them. Publishing a notice so that it did not reach the attention of such persons would defeat the purpose of requiring such a notice to be published at all. The amendment could have only a detrimental effect on the process. I am sure that that was not the hon. Gentleman's intention, so I invite him to withdraw the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 274, in page 9, line 24, leave out paragraph (a).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 275, in page 9, line 26, leave out `first or second'.
<P>
No. 276, in page 9, line 27, leave out subsection (2).

No. 278, in page 9, line 32, leave out from `are' to end of line 33.
<P>
No. 279, in page 9, line 37, leave out paragraph (b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Clause 14 is from a technical portion of the Bill, and it would be useful if the Minister had an opportunity to put an explanation of the provisions on the record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I approach the explanation of the technical and complex clause with trepidation. That is partly because I am unsure whether Opposition Members, or other hon. Members, will relish the required detail. However, it will probably be important to put the explanation on the record and so I fear that I shall have to proceed. I can crave only the indulgence and tolerance of the Committee—I shall attempt the explanation with the greatest possible dispatch.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole proposes several amendments to clause 14 which, among other things—[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Peter Atkinson) should note that I must respond to them as they are on the amendment paper. The amendments are aimed at, among other things, curtailing the Secretary of State's ability to make orders to modify the conditions of a licence, should a monopoly or merger be found to be operating against the public interest and in which the adverse effects identified could be fully or partly remedied by such a modification.
<P>
Although the amendment is a probing amendment, it is detailed; I congratulate the hon. Member for Poole on his ingenuity. Its effect would be to render the clause unworkable and meaningless; I am sure that he did not intend that. As I admitted, the clause is opaque—to understand it one must refer extensively to an Act. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman has tabled the amendments to get clarification.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As with so many other clauses that we have discussed, or that we shall discuss, the provisions of the clause are well precedented in sectoral legislation. [Laughter.] It is the way he tells them. Hon. Members might be familiar with the equivalent provisions in section 15 of the Electricity Act 1989, section 27 of the Gas Act 1986, section 17 of the Water Industries Act 1991 and section 16 of our old friend the Railways Act 1993.
<P>
I should explain in more detail the way in which the clause adds to the existing powers of the Secretary of State. It adds to his ability to execute the commission's recommendations by licence modification, including by order under the Fair Trading Act 1973. One authority—the Secretary of State—may implement all the recommendations. The regulator would otherwise need to undertake a second licence modification process, which might culminate in another reference to the commission.
<P>
We must remember what the powers are and the way in which they fit with the relevant processes under competition legislation. The clause refers to provisions of the 1973 Act to deal with the investigation of, and action on, monopolies and mergers. I apologise if members of the Committee are already familiar with the provisions, but I hope that they will bear with me in the interests of facilitating informed consideration of the amendments.
<P>
Although they appear after the monopoly-related provisions, I shall deal first with the provisions on mergers because the hon. Member for Poole appears not to be seeking the removal of the related provisions. Under the 1973 Act, the Director General of Fair Trading has a duty to monitor business transactions that might result, or that might already have resulted, in the merger of two or more enterprises. He must also recommend to the Secretary of State whether such mergers should be referred to the Competition Commission for further investigation and conclusion on whether the merger operates, or might be expected to operate, against the public interest. ``Public interest'' may include the costs of services, the terms by which they are provided and whether a customer group has been disadvantaged by their provision.
<P>
If, following its investigation, the commission concluded that the merger was, or would be, against the public interest, it would normally recommend in its report action to remedy or to prevent the adverse effects identified. If an adverse effect has been identified, the Secretary of State may make an order under the 1973 Act, which might take several forms. First, it might provide for a proposed merger to be stopped. Secondly, it might require the parties to dispose of shareholdings or interests in shares, or to limit the exercise of voting rights in the shares. Thirdly, it might provide for the break-up of the company by the sale of assets or of a subsidiary. Fourthly, it might control the conduct of the merged company by, for example, prohibiting discrimination or by regulating the company's prices or charges. The reference in clause 14(1)(a) to the Secretary of State by order exercising powers specified in schedule 8 to the 1973 Act is to the making of such an order. If one of the companies that is involved in a completed or anticipated merger provides air traffic services, it is conceivable that modifying its licence—for example, by including a new condition or by modifying the charge control conditions—might prevent the adverse effects of a merger. Clause 14 makes that possible by adding to what an order can be used to do.
<P>
The background to monopoly situations is set out in the framework in the 1973 Act. Monopoly references to the Competition Commission may be made by the Director General of Fair Trading, the Secretary of State and, in some circumstances, utility regulators. The commission must investigate and report on whether—and if so, in whose favour—a monopoly situation exists; whether steps are being taken by the persons involved to exploit or maintain that situation; whether any action or omission by them is attributable to a monopoly situation; and whether any facts found by the commission operate, or may be expected to operate, against the public interest. As in the case of merger references, the commission's report will give definite conclusions on the questions that are asked in the reference.
<P>
If there is an adverse public interest finding, the commission may recommend remedies. Again, the Secretary of State, having considered recommendations made by the commission and advice given by the Director General of Fair Trading, may make an order of a type that I have described to remedy or prevent the adverse effects. Again, the effect of clause 14 is to allow that order to provide for the modification of licence conditions where the monopoly situation identified relates to the provision of air traffic services under a licence, and where some or all of the adverse effects could be remedied by such modification.
<P>
Monopoly references will normally identify several adverse effects and several courses of action to remedy the different effects. Allowing the Secretary of State to modify a licence, which he would do only after consulting the regulator, would be one of them, because it allows all the problems identified to be dealt with in one go.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendments would have the unintentional effect of rendering the clause unworkable. Amendment No. 274 is, I suspect, a simple mistake, because it deletes clause 14(1)(a) which refers to an order under which powers in schedule 8 to the 1973 Act are exercised. However, clause 14(4), which remains untouched, refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The order mentioned in subsection (1)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 274, 275, 276 and 277 would amend the Bill so that the Secretary of State would not be able to use an order following an adverse finding in respect of a monopoly situation relating to the provision of licensed air traffic services That is an odd objective. In contrast, it is reasonable to allow the Secretary of State to have a residual power to act against a monopoly, or a merger that would create a monopoly, which is the purpose of the clause. That said, it is difficult to envisage circumstances in which those provisions might be invoked. It is essentially a backstop provision. I shall gladly go into more detail by giving examples of what happened in the gas industry as a result of similar provisions, but I do not think that that is the Committee's will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The confusion in the Bill arises from the fact that there are two men to do a one-man job—the CAA and the Secretary of State. I appreciate that the licence that is issued to a CAA-owned company would not affect the separation of regulations and operation until the PPP takes place, but what is the rush? Why not have a simple Bill under which the regulator does the regulating and the Secretary of State stays out of it until he is required to intervene on the regulator? The Bill purports to set that out, but the double role confuses matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because he obviates the need for me to go into further detail about the undesirable effect of the amendments. We should be enormously grateful to have a simpler Bill. I must admit to having found it a challenge to grasp the Bill in its entirety. However, to answer the hon. Gentleman's question, this is a novel situation. As there is a powerful public interest in such a major public-private partnership, it is sensible to retain a stake for the Secretary of State as a backstop to preserve and respond to the public interest.

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for his answer. We have shed more light on the matter and, when we read Hansard, it will be even clearer.

<P>
The amendment relates to the copy of the modification that has to be sent to the licence holder and the CAA. It would require the Secretary of State to publish a report giving the reasons for the modification and explaining why it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``beneficial to the public interest.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may be otiose, but will the Under-Secretary enlarge on the sentiments behind the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I do not think that it is otiose. My initial response, in the spirit of our shared passion for open government, was, why not? However, having considered the amendment in more detail, I shall resist it. It would require the Secretary of State to publish a report after modifications have been made explaining why they are beneficial to the public interest. In the absence of adverse findings by the Competition Commission, the Secretary of State would not be able to make an order to modify the licence. The Competition Commission's report must include the reasons for its conclusions. Furthermore, the 1973 Act requires that before making an order, the Secretary of State must publish his intention of doing so, outlining provisions that he proposes to include and soliciting views from anyone who is likely to be affected. In practice—this is hallowed by custom and practice—the Secretary of State can only solicit views effectively if he explains the thinking behind his proposal.
<P>
I hope that my explanation persuades the hon. Member for North Essex that his purpose is achieved. To require further publication at the making of an order would increase bureaucracy and administrative costs, which would have to be borne by the licence holder and its customers. The amendment's objectives are met.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Clause 15 and later clauses refer to the Secretary of State. We have complained that there is no either/or element of Secretary of State or CAA. We are establishing a regime in which the CAA will regulate and enforce the National Air Traffic Services. We do not understand why the Secretary of State should be enshrined in the clause. The amendments would replace the Secretary of State with the CAA. Indeed, it appears that the Government interpret the reference in clauses 16 to 19 as being to the CAA. Why are the clauses so clumsy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I should say something about the general purpose of clauses 15 to 19. They cover enforcement of the licensee's duty under clause 8. Clauses 21 and 25 relate to the enforcement of a condition of a licence. As the Bill is drafted —although who knows what the future may hold—the Secretary of State is to be the enforcing authority for the clause 8 duty.
<P>
Clauses 15 to 19 require the Secretary of State to make orders that will be binding on the licence holder when he is satisfied that the licence holder is contravening or is likely to contravene a duty under clause 8—for example, the duty to secure the provision of a safe system for air traffic services—or when it appears only to him to be a contravention, or a likely contravention, of such a duty. Clauses 21 to 25 make similar provisions that allow the CAA to enforce the condition of a licence. Clause 20 allows the Secretary of State's enforcement functions under clauses 15 to 19 to be carried out by the CAA in relation to specified cases or types of cases when he makes an order to that effect. Enforcement action, whether of a clause 8 duty or of a licence condition, is by means of an enforcement order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am listening to the Minister with care, but I remain confused about the necessity for the Secretary of State to deal with clause 8 duties, whereas the CAA deals with other duties. In explaining clause 20, the Minister implied that it related to specific aspects of the clause 8 duties. Will he explain to which clause 8 duties clause 20 refers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall come to that matter in a moment. If the hon. Gentleman can contain himself, he might find that his confusion dissipates.
<P>
I was speaking about enforcement action. When a clause 8 duty or a licence condition is made by means of an enforcement order containing provisions to secure compliance with a duty or licence condition that is being, or is likely to be, breached, there are two sorts of enforcement orders: final and provisional. Before the enforcement authority makes a final order, it must be satisfied that there is a contravention, or that there is likely to be one. In order so to satisfy itself, the enforcement authority will go through a detailed procedure, including a comprehensive investigation when necessary, which involves the giving of notice and the opportunity to challenge. The procedural requirements are set out in clause 16.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to a section of the explanatory notes which I fear is misleading. Paragraphs 28 and 30 of the notes suggest that the Secretary of State's exercise of his powers under clauses 15 to 20 and the CAA's exercise of its powers under clauses 21 to 24 are discretionary. However, as I said, and as the Bill makes it clear, the enforcement authorities have little discretion. When the enforcement authority is satisfied that a licence holder is contravening, or is likely to contravene, a clause 8 duty to the licence condition, it must make a final order. Clauses 15(1) and 21(1) are explicit. Similarly, when it appears to the enforcement authority that the licence holder is contravening, or is likely to contravene, a clause 8 duty for the licence condition, and that a provisional order is needed, it must make that provisional order.
<P>
I apologise to the Committee if it received the wrong impression from the explanatory notes, but I hope that hon. Members will agree that it is right to require the enforcement authority to enforce and not merely to permit it to do so.

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is the same in the Railways Act 1993.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Touche´!
<P>
Amendments Nos. 187 et al would make the CAA, rather than the Secretary of State, the body responsible for the important duties of the licence holder set out in clause 8. The hon. Member for North Essex makes a valid point. The Government have sought from the outset the separation of regulation from service provision and although we have asked to keep the Government's regulatory role to a minimum, the Secretary of State cannot and should not be removed entirely from the loop. However, it is true that the duties set out in clause 8 can be enforced with equal effectiveness by the CAA and we have considered proposals on those lines with a view to drafting a Government amendment on Report. The hon. Gentleman has saved us the trouble of doing so, as we hope to be able to meet his wishes on the matter. It is our intention to table amendments on Report and I shall ask him to withdraw the amendment on that basis.
<P>
Amendment No. 207 is an exception. The amendment attempts to simplify the important regime by ensuring that the Secretary of State is the only person who can enforce an order made under the clauses through civil proceedings. In that respect, the Bill as drafted provides flexibility. I am happy to consider amendment No. 207 with the others, but it may not help. The hon. Member for North Essex finally has something worthwhile to write home to his mother about. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment for the reason that I have given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I will give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The interesting thing about the Railways Act 1993 is that in section 15(1) the obligation to make modifications is entirely in the hands of the regulator. The words used are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Regulator shall, subject to the following provisions of the section''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder why the Bill is drafted differently. A precedent is not the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I have thought about that for a long time. I may have to give my hon. Friend a letter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman accepts the Under-Secretary's kind and generous invitation to withdraw the amendment, which I hope that he will do, will he accept that it would be helpful for the Minister intervene on the hon. Gentleman in order to re-read the passage of his speech on clause 20? The implication is that he is not going to accept completely the principle that underpins the amendments. Clarification of what the Minister said about clause 20 would be most helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman. If the Minister wishes to intervene on that important matter I am sure that he will do so.
<P>
We are concerned that there was some muddled thinking on the roles of the Secretary of State and the CAA. I am glad that the Minister has given us assurances on the matter and on that basis, I beg to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 10, line 8, after `satisfied', insert `on reasonable grounds'.
<P>

<P>
No. 186, in clause 35, page 23, line 37, after `thinks', insert `on reasonable grounds'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The amendments make a simple drafting point—the kind of textual matter that is drawn to one's attention by helpers. They would strengthen the accountability of the actions taken by the Secretary of State or the CAA and possibly subject them to judicial review if they acted unreasonably. However, the Minister may insist that no one, within his knowledge, would act unreasonably in those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Member for North Essex wants to ensure that the Secretary of State and the CAA behave reasonably in enforcing the provisions of this chapter of the Bill on the licence holder. The Secretary of State or the CAA, as it may turn out to be, is to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the licence holder is in breach of clause 8 duty. The CAA is to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the licence holder is in breach of the licence condition. The Secretary of State may recover reasonable costs of going to court to obtain information and so on.
<P>
It is reasonable for the hon. Gentleman to wish people to act reasonably. I am advised, however, that to put such a requirement in the Bill would add nothing. Administrative law is based on the concept of reasonableness. The making and confirmation of enforcement orders under this chapter are liable to challenges under clauses 17 and 23 in which the test of reasonableness would automatically be applied.
<P>
The effect of that is to require the decision taker, whether the Secretary of State or the CAA, to come to a rational conclusion about the matter in hand—for example, whether an enforcement order is required—on the basis of the evidence before him or it.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is not necessary to say that they must act reasonably, because the law assumes that anyone discharging the function under the statute is under a duty to act reasonably and the courts will tolerate nothing less. For those reasons, not because I have the slightest quarrel with what the hon. Gentleman proposes, I invite him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I beg to move amendment No. 281, in page 10, line 10, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) On making a final order under subsection (1), the CAA shall publish a report giving their reasons for making the order explaining inter alia—
<P>
(a) the extent to which any person is likely to sustain loss or damage as a result of anything likely to be done or omitted in contravention of the section 8 duty unless a provisional order is made, and
<P>
(b) the fact that the only remedy for a contravention of a section 8 duty is under this section and section 18 (unless there is negligence).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The lance-corporal has once again been entrusted by the subaltern with proposing an amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> What of the field marshal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The field marshal, I regret to say, has leave of absence and has gone temporarily to fight other wars. No doubt he will be in his accustomed place on Tuesday morning.
<P>
In some ways, this modest amendment is more important than those in the previous groups because it would tie down the Secretary of State, or the CAA, if the Minister is be taken at his word.
<P>
The amendment presumes that the Minister will accept that the words ``Secretary of State'' in the proposal should be replaced by ``CAA''. The amendment would thus tie the CAA down more than the clause.
<P>
An enforcement order must be issued if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the licence holder is contravening, or is likely to contravene, a clause 8 duty. The amendment seeks to discover on what grounds the provisions of clause 8 will be considered not satisfied and a contravention thus occurs. The amendment moves the provisions of subsection (3) to the beginning of the clause. Subsection (1A) would state that the CAA will publish a report explaining its reasoning, laying out what effects the contravention will have on individuals and reminding people upon whom the order is served that their only remedy is under the clauses 15 and 18. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Secretary of State, or the CAA, does not act wilfully or capriciously, but publishes a report explaining his or its actions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is an end-of-week feel to the Committee. If we are to reach the target stated by the usual channels, we must press on expeditiously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall be as expeditious as usual, Mr. Gale. Amendment No. 281 would require the body enforcing the licensee's duties to publish a report, as the hon. Member for North Wiltshire explained. We need not trouble with the amendment's wording because, as I said earlier, we are likely to table amendments to insert ``CAA'' in addition to ``Secretary of State'' where appropriate.
<P>
The amendment would require the CAA to publish a report following the making of a final order explaining the extent to which any person is likely to sustain loss or damage as a result of the breach of duty concerned, unless a provisional order—I believe that the hon. Gentleman means a final order—is made. The report would also have to explain that the only remedies for a contravention of a clause 8 duty are those set out in the Bill.
<P>
It may help if I explain how clause 16 and the corresponding provisions of clause 22, which deal with breaches of a licence condition, work. Before making a final order, or confirming a provisional order, the Secretary of State must publish a notice containing details of the breach of duty which has occurred and serve on the licence holder a copy of the notice and a copy of the proposed order.
<P>
The notice must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``state that the Secretary of State proposes to make or confirm the order and state its effect''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It must also specify
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``contraventions of the duty, and any other facts which . . . justify the making or confirmation of the order''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``state the period . . . within which representations may be made''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in response to the notice, which must not be of fewer than 21 days from its publication.
<P>
Having considered representations made by the licence holder or by other interested parties, the Secretary of State may proceed to make or confirm an order. If he does so, he must serve a copy on the licence holder. He must also publish it, to bring it to the attention of other people who are likely to be affected. The basis for making or confirming an order will, therefore, already be clear to the licence holder through the consultation process that will have occurred before it was made.
<P>
Once the Secretary of State is satisfied that a breach exists, he will be under a duty to make an order unless he believes that one or more of the conditions specified in clause 15(10) has been fulfilled. The factors dealt with in the amendment will have been considered earlier, when he was preparing the consultation notice. Good administrative practice will require him to set out any further consideration to which he has had regard in making or confirming an order.
<P>
The amendment is not, therefore, strictly necessary, and I would be grateful if the hon. Member for North Wiltshire would ask leave to withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> In the interests of expedition, and in view of the Minister's full explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): I beg to move amendment No. 282, in page 10, line 22, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
The amendment is designed to probe the Government's intentions and to clarify the clause's somewhat opaque drafting. It also represents concerns expressed by Opposition Members about the curious relationship between the Secretary of State and the Civil Aviation Authority.
<P>
The amendment proposes to delete subsection (4), which requires an order issued by the Secretary of State to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``require the licence holder to do or not to do specified things or things of a specified description.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such requirements will be imposed if the Secretary of State thinks that the provider of services is in breach of a duty specified in clause 8. We must ask, however, what the Secretary of State is able and competent to do in relation to such matters. For example, clause 8(1)(c) states that the licence holder
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must take all reasonable steps to secure that the demand for authorised air traffic services in respect of a licensed area is met''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What qualifications would the Secretary of State have to require the licence holder to do or not to do something in relation to such a requirement, which involves commercial and/or technical matters that would be better dealt with by the CAA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The Committee has dealt with the responsibilities placed on the Secretary of State and the CAA, which will be sorted out in due course. Clause 15(4) places an obligation on the enforcing authority to state in a final or provisional order what is being contravened. The order should either specify what the licensee should do to remedy the contravention or merely require him to remedy it. In other words, the provision allows the enforcing authority—the Secretary of State—to specify the remedy but does not require him to do so.
<P>
The Committee will not be surprised to learn that precedents for that approach are to be found in section 28 of the Gas Act 1986 and section 18 of the Water Act 1991, of blessed memory. We believe it important that such a requirement is retained. At its simplest level, the clause ensures that the licensee is made aware of what the enforcing authority is requiring him to rectify. The authority must be specific about the omission or contravention addressed by the order. The clause permits the enforcing authority either merely to require the licensee to remedy the contravention, without telling him how to do so, or to specify what he should do to satisfy the authority that the contravention has been remedied.
<P>
You may wonder, Mr. Gale, as I sometimes do, why two alternative routes are provided. Sometimes it will be plain that a remedy flows entirely from a fault, such as when a systems failure has resulted from maintenance problems. In such cases, the remedy will clearly be to fix those problems. Sometimes, however, a breach will not have an obvious cause or will not be attributable to a single factor. For example, if a systems failure occurs because of many management, operational or engineering factors, a remedy will clearly be needed but it will not necessarily be evident. In such cases, the enforcing authority would require the licensee to take such action as was necessary to effect a remedy. The test of which route to take is the decision about what is proportionate to the problem in question. The removal of subsection (4), as proposed by the amendment, would mean that the enforcing authority would no longer be obliged to placed concrete requirements on the licence holder to secure compliance with his duties. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hexham will agree that the amendment would not be terribly helpful, and I hope that he will ask leave to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for his comments, although I might not have tabled the amendment if I had known that I would receive such a complicated reply. I listened carefully to his remarks, in part, and they were very helpful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 284, in page 11, line 7, leave out paragraph (c).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 285, in page 11, line 8, leave out paragraph (d).
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The amendment is another probing device. It is intended to seek clarification on the insertion into the clause of a curious reference to the Competition Act. Subsection (10) of the clause states that the Secretary of State must not make an order if he thinks that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the most appropriate way of proceeding is under the Competition Act 1998.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The same questions arise yet again: how does that provision affect the clause 8 duties of which the licence holder must be in breach? In what circumstances would the Secretary of State invoke the Competition Act, and what part of it would apply to the four duties set out in clause 8? None of them is anything to do with competition: the duties concern safety, security, efficiency and maintaining systems. As they do not concern competition, why should the Competition Act apply to them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Clause 15 does not give the enforcing authority much discretion in the exercise of his duties. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If Secretary of State is satisfied that a licence holder is contravening or is likely to contravene a section 8 duty he must make a final order''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2) states that if it appears to the Secretary of State that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a licence holder is contravening or is likely to contravene a section 8 duty and that a provisional order is needed, he must make a provisional order''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (9) requires the Secretary of State to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``confirm a provisional order . . . if . . . he is satisfied that the licence holder is contravening or is likely to contravene a section 8 duty''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (10), which the amendment seeks to change, states that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Secretary of State must not make a final order or confirm a provisional order''
<P>
</UL></FONT>if the conditions specified in the paragraphs (a) to (d) of that subsection apply. The amendments would remove two of those conditions. I hope that the Committee will forgive me for stating the obvious, but we should bear in mind the fact that amendment No. 284 would require the Secretary of State to make a final order or confirm a provisional order even if the contravention was trivial. Amendment No. 285 would require him to do so even if the most appropriate way of proceeding would be under the Competition Act.
<P>
The provision on trivial contraventions involves an issue of scale. While we take the duties of the licence holder extremely seriously, we believe that each case must be dealt with on its own merits. I remind the Committee that the Secretary of State must be satisfied—I emphasise the word''satisfied''—that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the contravention or apprehended contraventions are trivial''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
before he would be prevented from making a final order or making or confirming a provisional order. It would be unduly onerous to require the Secretary of State to make an order in each and every case and even on minor and technical matters. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hexham will agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Can the Under-Secretary give us an example of a case that the CAA would consider valid but which the Secretary of State might find trivial?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Off the top of my head, no. I do not think we shall have any difficulty identifying a trivial problem, when one comes along.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> What about the CAA approving it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. We shall sort out the confusion about the Secretary of State and the CAA. We have conceded that we shall consider the array of amendments that have been tabled, which, I hope, will resolve that difficulty. I take the point that the enforcing authority might, in some circumstances, feel that even a trivial breach should be the subject of an order. The Government are prepared to consider the possibility of tabling amendments that would allow the enforcing authority to exercise some discretion in certain circumstances. On that basis, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No. 284.
<P>
The issue relating to amendment No. 285 is very different. Clause 15(10)(d) avoids double jeopardy for the licence holder. We want to resolve issues of enforcement in the way that is most appropriate to the situation, be it through the Bill or through the Competition Act 1998. However, it would be inequitable to allow the enforcing authority to have two bites at the same cherry by pursuing the matter under both Acts—a matter that is dealt with in clause 15(10)(d)—because no one should be tried twice for the same offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, especially as he says that he will further consider amendment No. 284. I listened carefully to what he said, but I did not hear the answer to my question about the link between the four duties and competition. However, I would prefer to leave that matter for another day, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Clause 15 confers wide powers to make or confirm orders for the enforcement of a licence holder's duties. It is unlikely that any order would not be within the powers confirmed, but we believe that it is appropriate to limit the power to the purpose for which it is reasonably intended and to curb its potential abuse. I should be grateful for a short explanation from the Minister.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The amendments would make a subtle change to the powers of the court to quash an enforcement order made by the Secretary of State or the CAA. It might help the Committee if I explain the thinking that underlies clauses 17 and 23.
<P>
The clauses are intended to provide a mechanism for challenging the validity of orders made for the purpose of enforcing either a section 8 duty or a condition of the licence. We intend that the licence holder should have the opportunity to challenge an order if he considers that it lies outside the powers conferred on the Secretary of State or the CAA by the Bill, or if the procedural requirements for the making or confirmation of an order have not been complied with.
<P>
The amendment would provide an additional ground on which a court could quash an order, so that it could be quashed if it did not fulfil the purposes of clauses 15 and 21. Under those clauses, an enforcement order is required to be made only if the enforcing authority is satisfied that there is an actual or likely breach of a duty or licence condition. An order that does not fulfil the purposes of clauses 15 and 21—that is, to enforce clause 8 duties or licence conditions respectively—would not be within the powers conferred by those clauses. Therefore, the amendment adds nothing.
<P>
Clause 17(1)(a) already enables the court to quash an order that is not within the powers conferred by clause 15. Clause 23(1)(a) already enables the court to quash an order that is not within the powers conferred by clause 21. I am sorry if that labours the point somewhat, but having probed, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for that answer. I feel a lot wiser because of it, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
