<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000521"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that with this amendment,
we are considering amendment 254, in clause 54, page 66, line 32, at

my co-Chairman Hugh Bayley no doubt said to the Committee this morning,
may I welcome you back from a short half-term recess? I spent most of
the time in Namibia, which was previously German South-West Africa. It
was a most enjoyable Commonwealth Parliamentary Association visit and I
am reinvigorated to preside over the remaining stages&#151;all except
for one&#151;of this Public Bill Committee. I hope that all members
of the Committee had a very restful and enjoyable recess; I am sure
that Ministers did and I express the same hope for members of the
Opposition
parties.</div><a name="09022525000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
gather that the Minister was responding to a debate on amendment 253
and, according to those who advise me, I believe that he was expressing
the hope that the Opposition spokesman might consider withdrawing his
amendment. Therefore, I ask the Minister of State, Vernon Coaker, to
complete his remarks.</div>
<a name="09022525000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000522"></a>The
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):</b> I have some further
information that may be of benefit to the hon. Members for Oxford, West
and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) and for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire), in
answer to the questions that they put earlier on our debate on
amendment 253.</div>
<a name="09022525000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I want
to thank the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon&#151;no doubt,
he will intervene if I do not fully answer the comments that he
made&#151;for highlighting the error in clause 48(6)(a), which refers
to</div><a name="09022525000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Council Decision on the establishment, operation and use of the second
generation Schengen Information System of 12 December
2006&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div><a name="09022525000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have looked into the
issue and we will amend subsection 6(a), so that it refers to the
Council Decision on the establishment, operation and use of the second
generation Schengen information system of 12 June 2007. That change can
be made by way of printing, so I am advised by parliamentary counsel
that there is no need for an
amendment.</div><a name="09022525000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the end of the previous sitting, I was responding to the hon. Member
for Hornchurch, who raised a particularly important point that we must
clarify; I thank him again for the helpful points that he made. I was
explaining that, where someone has been extradited to an EU member
state before the end of their UK sentence, clause 53 makes it clear
that time spent in custody overseas will only fall to be deducted from
the relevant UK sentence where the person in question has been
extradited to face trial and has then been acquitted of all
charges.</div><a name="09022525000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
where time falls to be deducted from a UK sentence, as the hon. Member
for Hornchurch rightly pointed out, it is possible for someone who was
extradited at a time when they were serving the custodial period of any
sentence to return to the UK after the date on which they would
ordinarily have been released on licence. The reassurance that I think
the hon. Member for Hornchurch is seeking in tabling this amendment is
that, where this situation arises, a person returning to the UK would
not be automatically released into the community without proper
consideration being given to the terms of their release. I am pleased
to be able to reassure him that that certainly will not be the case.
Proposed new section 59(6)(b), which would be inserted into the
Extradition Act 2003 by clause 53, makes it clear that where a person
who has been extradited while in custody returns to the UK and is
entitled to be released on licence, they
are</div><a name="09022525000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;liable
to be detained...by a constable or immigration
officer&#148;</div><a name="09022525000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
that they can then be formally released.</div>
<a name="09022525000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of this limited period of detention is to meet the need that the hon.
Member for Hornchurch has flagged up; that is, to ensure that all the
usual procedures that must be carefully followed before someone is
released on licence are followed where a person who has been extradited
returns to the UK. Crucially, that will allow the authorities to ensure
that the conditions of the licence fit the offender and that all the
relevant bodies charged with dealing with offenders after release are
aware of the situation. While clause 53 would allow someone to be
detained in order for them to be released on licence, detention would
only be for as long as was strictly necessary in order for the person
to be
released.</div><a name="09022525000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was raised by Liberty in the public evidence sessions, and I want to
make it absolutely clear that the purpose of detention here is solely
in order for the person to have their licence imposed or for them to be
released. However, this is an important point and I will consider
whether we need to do something further. Effectively, we are detaining
someone who has come back and who, had they been serving their sentence
in the UK, would already have been released on licence. Clearly,
detaining someone in that situation meets the public policy need of
ensuring that the conditions of a licence are put in place. There is an
issue about making sure that any detention needed to fulfil those
licence conditions is as short as possible. While that is implicit in
the Bill, and I have made it explicit in my remarks in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 511</div>Committee, the question is whether it should be
explicit in the Bill. I think I need to reflect on that further as the
Bill makes progress. I hope those remarks have helped the hon. Member
for Hornchurch and that he will consider withdrawing his
amendment.</div><a name="09022525000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022525000523"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): I thank the Minister for
his helpful response. He has highlighted the application of new section
59(6)(b), and he has made some points which clarify and explain the
intent behind that provision and how it interacts with other
provisions, including the need to consider any public protection issues
and whether a licence is appropriate, and the need to ensure that such
periods of detention are expressly for that purpose.</div>
<a name="09022525000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important clarification and I am grateful to the Minister for putting
that on the record. Equally, it would be helpful to have some express
clarification for a court or anyone else seeking to interpret the Bill,
and I accept what he said about reflecting on that. We look forward to
seeing what appears on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022525000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Coaker:</b> I beg to move amendment 224, in

out &#145;or section 28 of the Crime (Sentences) Act
1997&#146;.</div><a name="09022525000053"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000526"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I shall be brief. Essentially, tackling
international and transnational crime is a key priority for all of us.
One consequence of the increasingly transnational nature of modern
crime is that cases may arise in which an individual whose extradition
is requested by one country is, as we have just discussed, serving a
prison sentence or facing criminal proceedings in the country to which
a request for extradition is made. Situations also arise where a
country will only extradite its own national on the express undertaking
of the UK that the person will be returned to serve any sentence
imposed in the UK in the extraditing
country.</div><a name="09022525000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses
53, 54 and 55 set out an efficient and effective framework for dealing
with cases of this kind. As the Committee will no doubt appreciate, it
is vital that this framework is fully compliant with sentencing
legislation in Scotland and Northern Ireland. To achieve that, these
six amendments introduce two minor changes which are replicated for
each of the three clauses. That will ensure that the provisions are
fully effective in both Scotland and Northern
Ireland.</div><a name="09022525000434"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000529"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am pleased to be able to speak to these
amendments. First, I wish to raise a couple of concerns about the
structure of the extradition clauses, of which clause 55 is, I think,
the most important. I would be grateful if the Minister could give me
some reassurance.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 513</div><a name="09022525000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Extradition Act 2003 was not particularly controversial in the House
but it attracted some controversy at that time, as it was a way of
implementing the European arrest warrant. Part of the basis of that
legislation, and of this Bill, is that there is no need for a UK court,
when it receives notice of a European arrest warrant, to look behind
that application for prima facia evidence or to have regard to the need
for dual criminality. In other words, it is perfectly possible, by
design, that someone should be extradited for an offence under a
European arrest warrant to a country where that offence is not
considered an offence. That produces problems and leads to legal
cases.</div><a name="09022525000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
applications can create problems not only for the individuals concerned
and their human rights, but for our courts. For example, the
application could be vague. There have been examples in the press of
applications for swindling, computer offences and speech offences such
as xenophobia and incitement to hatred. Only incitement to religious
hatred is an offence without intent in this country and there are high
thresholds for other incitement offences. Is the Minister satisfied
that it is reasonable to base a clause on a presumption that all EU
member states that are subject to the European arrest warrant have fair
laws and processes?</div>
<a name="09022525000488"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="09022525000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, we have specifically decided that holocaust denial, however
odious, will not be made a criminal offence, so is it appropriate that
we make it possible for other EU member states to seek to extradite for
such an offence someone who is not a citizen of their country and who
has not published in their country except on the internet? The Minister
will be aware of the controversy over the case of Dr. Toben, in which
the magistrates in Westminster dismissed the application, citing
vagueness, and in the end he was not extradited only because the German
Government decided not to appeal to the High Court. Is it right that we
should have legislation that fails to make it clear that that is not
the sort of case that is appropriate for extradition? Speech offences
are not offences in this country, so there is no dual criminality, and
what about cases in which a country seeks the extradition of a citizen
of another country&#151;potentially a British citizen&#151;for
publishing certain material? I would be grateful if the Minister
clarified that, because otherwise we will have to come back to that
issue at a later stage to debate more specific amendments.</div>
<a name="09022525000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter is
made worse by the fact that under the 2003 Act, as I understand it, the
Home Secretary may by Order in Council extend the provisions to non-EU
countries, such as Azerbaijan, Georgia and the Russian Federation,
which have all benefited from such Orders in Council. There is a
significant human rights concern underlying the whole framework of the
legislation.</div>
<a name="09022525000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will now
turn to amendments 72, 73 and 74, the aims of which will be apparent to
Members, and outline them briefly, because we need to make progress.
They seek to remove the subjective view of the Secretary of State on
the question of whether a return would be incompatible with the meaning
of the Human Rights Act 1998. They would do several things. First, they
would make that decision the result of an objective test 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 514</div>so that the question of whether the Secretary of
State is satisfied is not simply the opinion of the Secretary of
State.</div>
<a name="09022525000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
amendments would give full access to the courts and not simply access
to review that decision by judicial review, which is not the ideal way
in which to raise issues of fact that go behind the decision, although
the Minister might take a different view, as the Government often do,
depending on the case. Indeed, when the Government are defending a
judicial review, they often say that it is a matter of deciding whether
the process is wrong or whether the decision is so unreasonable as to
be an abuse of process. When someone is facing extradition to a country
where we cannot be sure that they will be looked after in compliance
with obligations that we have made, it must be reasonable that facts
should be clearly testable in court.</div>
<a name="09022525000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to provide recognition not only for the European
convention rights, but for other international treaties. An example is
the United Nations convention on refugees, which was established after
the second world war to provide a haven for people who might otherwise
be persecuted, perhaps by prosecution, in another country.</div>
<a name="09022525000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments also include a provision that would require consideration to
be given to the wider interests of justice. I will give two examples in
order to save time. The first example is an undertaking that is given
prior to all the knowledge becoming available. Once a person is in this
country, it may become clear that they have a medical condition, for
example, that makes them particularly vulnerable and would put them at
risk if they were extradited to the country to which the Secretary of
State has given an undertaking to extradite them. A topical example is
the well-known case of Gary McKinnon, who has a mental health disorder
that would make him particularly vulnerable if he were transferred to
an American supermax prison. We need to be capable, within our law, of
giving consideration to that issue, because if someone is made to
suffer on the basis of being extradited to a country or is sent back
having been extradited here, that is not in the interests of justice
and might not be compliant with their human rights. That is not a
direct example and I am not seeking to raise that case
specifically.</div>
<a name="09022525000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000530"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am concerned about our discussing the Gary
McKinnon case, because it is currently before the
courts.</div><a name="09022525000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000531"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> As I understand it, we are discussing legislation.
I am not asking the Minister to give an opinion on that case, but we
are entitled to raise cases under the sub judice
rule.</div><a name="09022525000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000532"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I tell the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon that, as long as he does not make specific reference
to that case, which is before the courts, he is quite in order to raise
the general principle? He must not refer to a specific case in any
detail.</div><a name="09022525000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000533"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful, Sir Nicholas. I hope that I was
careful to state that I was referring to a case such as the one
involving Gary McKinnon. I was not talking about how that particular
case applies, because the facts differ in the clause under discussion;
we are talking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column515" />Column number: 515</div>about someone who is extradited and brought to this country with a
pledge that they will then be returned. I am referring to cases
involving a medical condition, and the Gary McKinnon case is good
example, because it shows how different countries might treat a medical
condition. I will move swiftly on, as long as the Minister understands
that there is nothing in the clause that recognises a change in a
person&#146;s medical condition. Neither does the undertaking to
remove a person to another country make such a change relevant for
consideration.</div><a name="09022525000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second example relates to when conditions in the country to which a
person would be returned have changed since they first came here.
Again, that is not made clear in the clause, and it would not be in the
interests of justice for someone to be sent back to a country where
there has been a substantial change in circumstances and where a fair
trial, the person&#146;s welfare, or, in the case of a UK citizen,
the oversight of their welfare cannot be
guaranteed.</div><a name="09022525000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are the concerns raised by Liberty in relation to the clause.
Furthermore, without being privy to the correspondence of the Joint
Committee on Human Rights&#151;on which I serve with the
Minister&#151;I believe that the clause will exercise that Committee
simply because it allows subjective tests, such as the Secretary of
State being satisfied, and only refers to one of the many treaties to
which we are party. It is appropriate to leave it there, and I am
grateful to the Minister for
listening.</div><a name="09022525000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000534"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon reflect, as he said, Liberty&#146;s
concerns about clause 55. Amendment 72 would replace the
provision that the Secretary of State is not satisfied that the return
is compatible with the European convention on human rights with a
provision that such a return would be incompatible with the convention.
In other words, and as the hon. Gentleman said, Liberty wish to replace
a subjective requirement with an objective test.</div>
<a name="09022525000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I fully
recognise and agree that the provision should be compliant with the
European convention, I question the application of these amendments and
the effect they would have. Even if amendment 72 were made, if power is
vested in the Secretary of State, notwithstanding that the wording
would have changed and it would be compliant with the relevant
convention or treaty rights, on the face of it, the assessment would
potentially still be made by the Secretary of
State.</div><a name="09022525000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will make a further point on that because it is the sort of drafting
issue with which we are concerned. While I fully respect and understand
the intention behind the amendments, legal advice would need to be
provided to an individual at some stage, and a judgment would have to
be made on whether or not it was compliant. Therefore, without seeking
to undermine the intent behind the amendments in any way, I wonder
whether they will have the import that has been suggested. In all
circumstances, legal advice that relies on precedent in case law
provides a judgment or assessment. Therefore, I am not certain how far
the changes take us
forward.</div><a name="09022525000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Justice
made an ancillary point on this
issue:</div><a name="09022525000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is disappointing that despite the aims of the Framework Decision to
abolish extradition between EU Member States and to replace this with a
system of surrender through judicial process, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column516" />Column number: 516</div>the Secretary of State is to be given this power rather than a judge at
a hearing. We consider that the opportunity should be taken to amend
the provisions to allow a hearing before a judge who will consider
whether an undertaking should be given, at which the consent, or at a
minimum the representations of the affected person can be considered.
Without such a measure the scheme is at risk of interfering with the
right to a fair hearing under article 6
ECHR.&#148;</div><a name="09022525000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an issue of practicality and balance. Justice argues that a court
hearing should be appropriate in any event. In other words, it takes
the line of argument that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
has set out from Liberty&#146;s paper to its natural conclusion and
says that the matter should rest with the court rather than with the
Secretary of
State.</div><a name="09022525000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000535"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I saw the Justice briefing. In taking out
&#147;the Secretary of State&#148;, I was not inserting &#147;the
judge&#148;. I believe that that is implicit because without having
to wait for the Secretary of State to announce whether they are
satisfied, the decision can be rolled into the same series of hearings
and deliberations that are held for those contesting their extradition.
That is my understanding, but it needs confirmation as I am not a
lawyer.</div><a name="09022525000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000536"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention is
helpful because it allows us to understand the purpose of his
amendments more clearly. There is a question of balance and
appropriateness in considering the application of these provisions. In
my view, the matter should reside with the Secretary of State rather
than automatically going to a court for determination. It will be
interesting to hear the Minister&#146;s response and his views on
compliance with the relevant convention rights. That will inform the
debate
further.</div><a name="09022525000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000537"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> May I point out something that I might not have
done justice to in my original remarks? Amendment 74 is important and I
would like a specific response from the Minister. Does the hon. Member
for Hornchurch agree that the sort of wording in amendment
74 must be added to proposed new section 153D(1) to ensure that there
is no discretion because of the
words:</div><a name="09022525000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
... requires the return of a
person&#148;?</div><a name="09022525000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the original wording means that the Human Rights Act 1998 is likely to
be breached, the powers will be
nullified.</div><a name="09022525000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000538"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It is interesting to hear what the hon.
Gentleman says. I respect the concern expressed by Liberty on
compliance with convention rights, which he has articulated. It is
important to ensure that there is clarity in the Bill. The current
wording expresses the judgment and the need for compliance with the
Human Rights Act. However, Justice and Liberty have raised interesting
questions and it will be interesting to hear the Minister&#146;s
response and why he believes the provisions are compliant with
convention rules and will not be not subject to
challenge.</div><a name="09022525000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000539"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I thought that those were very good remarks. To do
what the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon suggests would be
illegal. The Secretary of State cannot ignore human rights issues in
making a judgment to send somebody back.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 517</div><a name="09022525000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will start
with amendment 74, which puts us slightly out of kilter, but it is
where the debate finished. That amendment would oblige the Secretary of
State not to issue an undertaking when it is found that a
person&#146;s removal would breach their human rights. Who would
disagree with that? We agree with the purpose of the amendment, but it
is unnecessary to state explicitly that the Secretary of State cannot
extradite or send someone back where their human rights will be
breached, which is what amendment 74 does.</div>
<a name="09022525000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000540"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is not
that.</div><a name="09022525000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000541"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is what amendment 74 does. All I am saying is
that I do not disagree with it, but that it cannot be done because it
is
illegal.</div><a name="09022525000489"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="09022525000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000542"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I probably did not do justice to
amendment 74, so I will be clear about what it seeks to do
in addition to the statement of the obvious that the Minister
has identified. It seeks to ensure that the powers set out in the Bill
that are consequential on the undertaking&#151;for example, the power
to keep a person in custody until return&#151;fall away if the
undertaking cannot be complied with. In other words, they are null and
void. It does not necessarily follow from this framework that those
powers are null and void even if they are not exercised. I think the
amendment is a tidier way than the current wording of making that
clear. It is not because I failed to grasp the
obvious.</div>
<a name="09022525000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000543"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I apologise. I was not trying to be disrespectful
to the hon. Gentleman. I take the point he is trying to make that what
he has pointed out could be consequential to all of this. That does not
alter the fact that it is unnecessary. Nobody disagrees with the point
that has been made.</div>
<a name="09022525000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Nicholas,
if you remember in the evidence sessions, I was delighted with the
inclusion of new section 153D in the Bill. I sometimes go to the Joint
Committee on Human Rights and have a good relationship with it. The
hon. Gentleman knows that I spend a lot of time defending the need for
human rights to be protected in legislation. The Home Office and I have
had many fruitful discussions with the JCHR to try to do better with
respect to human rights compliance. One reason for this provision is
the fact that I&#151;along with the Home Office&#151;am
increasingly determined to ensure that human rights provisions are
contained explicitly within legislation.</div>
<a name="09022525000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman was here this morning when I mentioned that Liberty had said
that though some improvements, debates and discussions might be
needed&#151;which is what we are having&#151;this is not a titanic
battle of principle. This is not necessarily a decision to extradite.
It is to return someone pursuant to an undertaking. Any decision to
extradite&#151;or any of these matters&#151;has to be compliant
with the ECHR and the Human Rights Act. As for the involvement of the
courts&#151;to which the hon. Members for Oxford, West and Abingdon
and for Hornchurch referred&#151;the Secretary of State is
accountable to the courts of the land. Although he or she may make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column518" />Column number: 518</div>the initial judgment, such decisions, as we have seen in the past, can
be judicially reviewed. There has to be an undertaking that everything
done is consistent with that.</div>
<a name="09022525000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">A couple of
other points were made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon. The terms of proposed new section 153D make it clear that a
person cannot be returned pursuant to a temporary surrender undertaken
where to do so would breach the ECHR. It is explicitly there. Whether a
return would breach the ECHR would be considered at the moment of
return. So any matters arising after extradition to the UK, for example
regime change, would be taken into account at that time. Again, some of
the things that the hon. Gentleman is pointing out&#151;such as, what
happens if this happens&#151;are partly what would be used to inform
the decisions made as to whether somebody should be returned. As to the
idea of leaving this to the discretion of the Secretary of State, the
Secretary of State does not have any discretion when it comes to acting
in a way that is ECHR-compliant. She has to act in that way. I became
slightly agitated because it is unlawful to do otherwise. This is the
point that I was emphatically trying to make to the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="09022525000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">As he
mentioned, dual criminality is the principle that the crimes for which
a person is sought must be offences in both countries for extradition
to take place. He will know that there are 32 categories of
offence&#151;the most serious cases&#151;for which dual criminality
is not needed for a European arrest warrant to be issued. He mentioned
the case of Dr. Toben, who was the subject of an EAW request from
Germany for holocaust denial and was arrested at Heathrow in October
2008. Germany sought his extradition under the offences in the EAW for
which dual criminality does not apply: xenophobia, racism and
computer-related crime. The hon. Gentleman will also know that Dr.
Toben was ultimately discharged by the courts. The judicial process
worked.</div>
<a name="09022525000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principle
of mutual recognition underpins law enforcement instruments within the
EU, including the EAW, and key to that is member states&#146; trust
of each others&#146; legal systems. I have said to his hon. Friend
the Member for Chesterfield that if the hon. Gentleman became an EU
Minister, he would have to be very careful about saying that he did not
trust the legal systems of other EU members. One of the conditions of
becoming an EU member is having a legal system based on the principles
that we all expect. None the less, we do not have to return somebody.
The terms of the Extradition Act 2003 make it clear that if there are
concerns about the fairness of a court system in a country, section 20
prohibits surrender to another member state.</div>
<a name="09022525000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Committee to resist amendments 72 and 74. I do not see the need for
them and they are unnecessary as compliance with the ECHR is implicit
in the Bill. To show that I am not only kind to the main Opposition
spokesmen, I will say that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon has a point with amendment 73. I hope that he relays this to
his colleagues on the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The amendment
refers to other international treaties, which should be taken into
account when looking at issues of temporary surrender, extradition and
so on. In my view, the need to take into account other treaty
obligations, for example, the UN refugee convention, is implicit in the
terms of the ECHR. However, I will look at what amendment 73 suggests, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 519</div>which is whether the Bill needs to be more explicit
about the fact that as well as complying with ECHR regulations and
requirements, some other conventions should be adhered to.</div>
<a name="09022525000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
was fairly robust on amendments 72 and 74 and the general points about
compliance with the ECHR, I hope that the esteemed member of the JCHR
will look at what I have said about amendment 73&#151;I am frightened
of the JCHR. I think that the hon. Gentleman has an important point
about what may need to be in the Bill. Human rights considerations are
extremely important to me, which is why the proposed new section is in
the Bill. Everything that he is seeking to achieve through amendments
72 and 74 is already achieved through the provisions in the Bill. With
those remarks, I ask him to consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000544"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Flattery is very helpful with me, but cuts no ice
with the JCHR, so the Minister will still have to face the music there
in due course. Obviously, I welcome what he has just said about
amendment 73 and I will come on to that.</div>
<a name="09022525000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would first
like to make a point regarding his response to my earlier points.
Membership of the EU does not, even in the Liberal Democrats, involve
the suspension of critical faculties; just as other countries, and
indeed the Council of Europe, can be critical of some of our laws, for
example, on terror. Just because we are a member of the Council of
Europe does not mean that, by definition, everything that we do is
acceptable. I do not think therefore&#151;I am not suggesting the
Minister said this in these terms&#151;that simply accepting someone
as a new EU member means that there is no appraisal to be made on an
individual case. I am not saying that he said that there was no
appraisal, but the point is that we need to keep our wits about
us.</div><a name="09022525000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point relates to Dr. Toben as an example of that. Although he
escaped extradition, it was only because the Germans decided not to
press their appeal in the High Court. So, it was not that the court
overruled them on the basis of it not being a good enough charge; nor
was it on the issue of the offence that he was charged with being
extraterritorial because of a website hosted in Australia; it was
because they chose not to, and I fear that there will be other people
who will be caught by that, but I accept that it is not a matter for
today.</div><a name="09022525000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issues raised by the amendments, the Minister has said&#151;three
times now&#151;that he notes that Liberty has said that there is no
titanic battle on this part of the Bill, and I think that is true.
However, I just hope that we come to a time when that will be obvious,
and the Minister is wise to rejoice, or express relief, that he is not
in a pitched battle with human rights organisations over this part of
the Bill. I think that is&#151;I do not want to be too partisan about
this&#151;more a judgment on some of the other legislation where he
has been engaged with them in such a contest, rather than necessarily
saying that everything in the Bill is fine.</div>
<a name="09022525000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000545"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman think that it is
actually because we have included proposed new section 153D on the face
of the Bill? Does he not also think that that is a part of why,
perhaps, compared with some of the battles that have been fought in the
past, they have not been fought as hard on this specific part of the
Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column520" />Column number: 520</div><a name="09022525000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000546"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The Minister is very keen to get recognition for
the inclusion of proposed new section 153D. If it was not there, the
situation would be worse and it is a worthy step forward. I accept that
and I am sure that others will note it too, including in the other
place&#151;of course I accept that.</div>
<a name="09022525000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
the descriptions he has made of the three amendments, I would like to
deal with what the hon. Gentleman said, briefly, on amendment 72. He
says that the Home Secretary has no discretion as to whether to abide
by the convention rights, and of course that is true. However, he still
has to accept a subjective provision here, because the Secretary of
State merely&#151;I use that word appropriately and
deliberately&#151;has to satisfy herself that</div>
<a name="09022525000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the return is
compatible with the convention rights&#148;.</div>
<a name="09022525000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">As soon as she does,
that is it, subject only to judicial review and I do not think he
addressed the point that relying on judicial review of Executive action
or Executive decision-making is not satisfactory. We have just read
about the appalling case of the gay asylum seeker who was sent back as
a result of Executive action. Yes, the courts have intervened
post-facto to argue that that was wrong and have insisted that the Home
Department do what they can to get that person back&#151;we do not
know the name or country for that person&#146;s own
protection&#151;but that is an example of a decision being judicially
reviewable. That can only be done while they are in the country and it
is not an ideal situation. So, although I will not press amendment 72
to a vote, I do not accept that the subjective test is adequate and the
Minister will have to come back with stronger arguments at a later
stage of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09022525000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 74
got some rough treatment from the Minister. I am not offended by that.
I did not make the point clearly enough; that is my fault, not
Liberty&#146;s, and I take responsibility. Liberty&#146;s point is
that the proposed new section 153D
states:</div><a name="09022525000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
in section 153A or 153C requires the return of a
person&#148;</div><a name="09022525000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
these cases. But the question is: what about the powers that have been
taken after an undertaking has been given? It is not absolutely crystal
clear that they become null and void at that point. I am not suggesting
that the Government will return the person, given the provisions in
proposed new section
153D.</div><a name="09022525000490"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="Column"><a name="Column521" />Column number: 521</div><a name="09022525000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
amendment 74, I was again pointing out to the Minister my concern,
which I do not think he has met, that although it is clear that no
return would take place if the Secretary of State were not satisfied
that the return were compatible with convention rights, it is not clear
what happens to the person. Certain things will have flown from the
undertaking, which is now vitiated by the Secretary of State&#146;s
ruling on convention rights, and I ask the Minister to consider
further, perhaps in correspondence and at least before the next stage
of the Bill, whether there is absolute clarity about what happens to
the person left dangling in respect of either proposed new section 153A
or proposed new section 153C. In one of those scenarios it is more
likely that they will already be in prison, serving a sentence here
perhaps.</div><a name="09022525000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
turning to amendment 73, I am grateful to the Minister for recognising
that it might be appropriate to mention the refugee convention in the
Bill, after the Human Rights Act. I will bank that, but it begs the
question: why not the international covenant on civil and political
rights, for example, which covers similar important
rights?</div><a name="09022525000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000549"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I used the refugee convention as an example; I am
not saying that that is the only thing that we should use. I will
consider whether we should put something in the Bill, and it may be
that we will use two things. With respect, I have said to the hon.
Gentleman that the refugee convention strikes me as an example that
should be in the
Bill.</div><a name="09022525000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000550"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful for that clarification and I will
not comment further on the matter. I accept the Minister&#146;s point
that changes in a country will be taken into account because the
decision has to be made before return. However, I will go away and
reflect on the last part of amendment 74, as it still concerns me that
there may be other circumstances that do not go as far as to affect
convention rights or to sufficiently persuade a Home Secretary or this
Home Secretary, but which might still be contrary to the interests of
justice. There can be no harm in the Government giving themselves some
wriggle room here, as long as the Home Secretary does not abuse it. I
cannot conceive of a Home Secretary willingly not wanting to live up to
the undertakings that they have given, which can be important for
diplomatic relations. Having said all that, I want to express again my
gratefulness to the Minister for engaging in the debate and I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments 231 to
238.</div><a name="09022525000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000553"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The amendment deals with provisional arrest. I
should like to make some introductory remarks and then respond to
questions that hon. Members may have. Provisional arrest is an
important tool in the fight against serious and organised crime. There
are cases, although rare, in which the urgency of the situation and the
complexity of the case, lead member states to ask one another to arrest
someone before the full European arrest warrant has been issued. Where
the UK receives such a request, and there are reasonable grounds for
believing that the full European arrest warrant has been or will be
issued, it is open to UK law enforcement officials to arrest the person
in
question.</div><a name="09022525000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
someone is arrested under the provisional arrest powers found in
section 5 of the Extradition Act 2003, section 6 requires that the
person be brought before a court and a full European arrest warrant
provided to the judge within 48 hours of arrest. While in the vast
majority of cases this will prove unproblematic, there are two
scenarios where the right time limits contained in the Act can cause
problems. The first of these is where the 48-hour period runs over a
weekend or a public holiday. In that situation no court would be open
before which the person in question can be brought. This could result
in a serious criminal being able to avoid extradition simply because of
the date on which they were
arrested.</div><a name="09022525000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second problem with the current provisions arises in very complex cases
where the member state seeking extradition is simply unable to get the
formal documents justifying extradition in order within that 48-hour
period. Clause 58, as drafted, sought to address these problems by
allowing an application for an extension of 48 hours to be sought to
both the period within which the full documents must be provided and
the period in which the person must be brought before the
court.</div>
<a name="09022525000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">On reflection
I feel that there is better and fairer solution to these problems which
Government amendment 230 and Government amendments 231 to
238 seek to provide. The first change to note is that it is no longer
open to the requesting state to apply for an extension of the 48-hour
period within which the person in question must be brought before a UK
court as the sole problem we are addressing here is that arising where
the 48-hour period falls over a weekend or a public holiday. I feel
that the better approach is simply to exclude these days from the
calculation of the 48-hour period. We see no reason why the person
arrested should not be brought before a UK court within the original
48-hour period where it does not fall on a weekend or a public holiday.
I hope that that is helpful because I certainly think it is a better
way of doing it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 523</div><a name="09022525000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
change and the terms of the other amendments also mean that it is
absolutely clear that in the very rare cases where there is a need to
apply for an extension of the period for supplying the documents
justifying extradition, such an application will always be made while
the person who is arrested is present in court, whether in person or by
live link, so that they may resist the application and be in a position
to apply for bail. Again, I think that is a significant improvement on
the clause as drafted. I hope that the Committee will feel that these
amendments represent a careful and considered attempt to reduce the
scope of the provisional arrest amendments so as to make absolutely
sure that they strike the right balance between the need to safeguard
the liberty of the subject while ensuring that the UK does everything
possible to fight serious international
crime.</div><a name="09022525000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000554"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister&#146;s comments on the
amendments are helpful. He will know that Liberty expressed concerns
about why the clause was necessary and the proportionality of the
provisions. His suggestion to clarify and restrict the ambit of the
clause is helpful in addressing some of those
issues.</div><a name="09022525000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful for the Minister to address one further point. It is
worth putting the concerns of Justice on the record. It
states:</div><a name="09022525000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
warrant can be transmitted electronically pursuant to section
204, thereby instantaneously and with the introduction of SISII, this
will be the normal means of transmission. We consider it inconceivable
that any scenario could justify an arrest without warrant, on
reasonable belief that a warrant will arrive rather than an offence
having been committed, and remand for 96
hours.&#148;</div><a name="09022525000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Justice
suggests that it should be more instantaneous. The Minister has
explained that circumstances may arise that fall outside
Justice&#146;s concern that the instantaneous electronic transmission
of warrants might lead to situations where documentation is awaited. It
would be helpful to consider that. Any further clarification that the
Minister can provide on Justice&#146;s concerns over the additional
time would be
welcome.</div><a name="09022525000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is an increase in the speed of transmission through the Schengen
information system or other forms of electronic transmission of
appropriate documentation, it would be appropriate to make it clear
that in one way we are moving in one direction and in another way we
are moving in
another.</div><a name="09022525000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000555"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I echo the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view. He
recognises, as do Justice and Liberty, the importance of article 5 of
the European convention on human rights. Even though the Minister gave
a good explanation of where we will be after we accept the amendments,
as I am sure we will, those will also be subject to scrutiny against
article 5. The hon. Member for Hornchurch made a good fist of analysing
the areas that we will have to look at further. That said, I too
welcome the
amendments.</div><a name="09022525000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000556"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I have tried with the amendments to address some
of the points that have been made. Like everybody else, I do not like
the idea of provisional arrests. We all agree that if we are not
careful, such procedures might lead to an unacceptable erosion of
liberty. There is a balance to be struck between the role of the state
in protecting the public and the need for citizens to be protected
against the encroachment of the state.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 524</div><a name="09022525000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to
the hon. Member for Hornchurch, the issue is not the time taken to
transmit the warrant, but the time taken to get the case together to
make the request to the court in the member state. In any case, a UK
court would grant an extension only when the documents could not
reasonably have been provided within the original 48-hour period. If
the requesting state had things sorted they would clearly be able to
get the documents there. I think that I have answered his questions. I
hope that the Committee will support the Government
amendments.</div><a name="09022525000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000557"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> As I understand it from the explanatory notes, the
Government do not believe that article 6 applies to extradition
hearings&#151;that is, the right to a fair trial. Nevertheless, I
still think it is necessary for the Government to provide on the record
some justification of why it wants to move to giving the judge the
power to provide for live-link directions. I question whether the
Government are certain&#151;given everything we have
discussed&#151;that article 6 does not apply to extradition hearings
in respect of the ECHR and to ask in any event what the justifications
are for this. I am sure the Minister has a justification, which he is
ready to
give.</div><a name="09022525000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000558"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Article 6&#151;as the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon knows because he knows the answer to the
question&#151;does not apply to extradition hearings.</div>
<a name="09022525000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 48
and 49 will provide further improvements to the European arrest warrant
mechanism in the UK. It is predicted that access to the SIS II will
enable law enforcement agencies in the UK to make an additional 1,200
arrests per year subject to these warrants, while the improvements to
public safety that these clauses will provide are of great significance
and importance. As the European arrest warrant is subject to judicial
proceedings this will place a greater administrative burden on the
court service. Clause 59 will in part address this problem by enabling
live links to be used in extradition cases.</div>
<a name="09022525000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment to the Extradition Act 2003 will mean that all initial and
remand hearings can, at the direction of the appropriate judge&#151;I
hope that hon. Members heard that&#151;take place via live link. This
will not only provide greater efficiency when dealing with extradition
hearings but also ensure that those subject to EAW and extradition
requests do not need to make potentially lengthy journeys for very
short extradition hearings. It is important to note that the subject of
the request will continue to attend the substantive extradition
hearing.</div>
<a name="09022525000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the clause makes it clear that the judge may not direct that the
hearing take place via live link if he feels that the interests of
justice will not be served. The interest of justice, I know, is
something that the hon. Gentleman often wants read into the record, so
I am doing so. The clause will ensure that the mechanism in place in
the UK to deal with the EAW and extradition requests is both efficient
in dealing with rising numbers of judicial proceedings and will ensure
fairness to the subject of the request. I hope that helps the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09022525000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000559"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for reading in that
issue about the interests of justice. He makes a very important point,
which I will mention en passant as he did, that although article 6 does
not apply and therefore the Human Rights Act does not apply here, there
are interests of justice that might apply and force the court to make a
different decision. That might also apply to the other parts of this
Bill that we have just discussed. I think the Minister has dealt with
the point I raised and I am grateful to
him.</div><a name="09022525000157"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000563"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Welcome back from Namibia, Sir Nicholas. It is a
pleasure to see you looking so refreshed and chairing the Committee
with your usual verve, and indeed with even more verve after your
recuperatory recess
break.</div><a name="09022525000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
60 and the clauses that follow relating to aviation security are
important, but they are not without controversy, for reasons I will
move on to in a moment. Clause 60 provides for the establishment,
crucially, of a risk advisory group and a security executive group at
aerodromes. Risk advisory groups will be required to produce a
comprehensive risk report at the outset that will include analysis of
risks to the aerodrome and make recommendations regarding the actions
necessary to mitigate such risks. The membership of that RAG will
include a representative of the aerodrome manager and a representative
of the chief officer of police in that area as a minimum, and the
manager of the aerodrome will have discretion to appoint such
additional members as he considers necessary.</div>
<a name="09022525000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">A risk report
will be put together by that group, which will then be considered by a
security executive group. The SEG is a different body in the sense that
it has a different membership. It will make judgments on the security
measures to be taken for the aerodrome and decide which party should be
responsible for executing that security measure. Those decisions will
form the content of the aerodrome security plan&#151;ASP&#151;which
will formally document the security measures to be taken. The
SEG&#146;s membership is different from that of the RAG and will
include, as a minimum, a representative of the aerodrome manager,
representatives of the chief officer of police and the police authority
of the relevant area and representatives of airlines operating at the
airport&#151;such people are not within the RAG.</div>
<a name="09022525000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the face
of it, clause 60 looks a little bureaucratic. Why do we need two
groups, often with overlapping membership? My understanding is that the
Minister, in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column527" />Column number: 527</div>drafting this, thought that there might be a
conflict of interest in a body that on the one hand analyses risk and
on the other hand has to pay for the measures that mitigate that risk.
I assume that the reason for having two groups rather than
one&#151;the Minister may correct me if I am wrong&#151;is that the
risk analysis cannot be short-changed by the people making the
decisions downgrading the risk because they do not want to pay for it.
If my understanding is correct, those two groups are separate for that
reason.</div><a name="09022525000168"></a>

Fitzpatrick):</b> May I simplify the situation, at the
invitation of the hon. Gentleman? The reason for the two groups is very
much as he has described it. Previously, we often saw analysis and the
design of a plan that was not put into action. The two separate groups
have separate responsibilities: one designs the plan and the other
implements it. In that instance, there is clear responsibility
attributed to each.</div>
<a name="09022525000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000565"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> That was my understanding, and it is an important
point to make, because members of the industry believe that it is
overly bureaucratic. I can see the rationale, and the Minister has
described it.</div>
<a name="09022525000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important that a plan may specify that security stakeholders make
payments to other security stakeholders in connection with the delivery
of the plan, mitigating the risks that have been identified. That makes
it a controversial clause. As most people do, I always follow the
money. If one does that, one always discovers that people are sometimes
loth to cough up, so there are issues that need to be teased
out.</div><a name="09022525000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes on proposed new section 24AE(5)
state:</div><a name="09022525000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although
the police are not directly specified as a stakeholder to whom payments
may be made, this subsection does not prevent an ASP from specifying
payments to be made in respect of the police&#146;s delivery of a
security measure. However, the expectation is that details of such
payments will be contained within a Police Services Agreement
(PSA).&#148;</div><a name="09022525000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is another agreement to which we will have to be advertent, which, the
notes
explain,</div><a name="09022525000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
an agreement made between an aerodrome manager, the Chief Officer of
police and a representative of the police authority for the relevant
area&#148;.</div><a name="09022525000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
agreement will include the level of policing provided at the aerodrome;
any payments to be made by the aerodrome&#146;s manager; any
accommodation facilities to be provided by the manager and so
on.</div><a name="09022525000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already indicated that the measures are controversial. When the
aviation security provisions were aired back in spring 2008, I think
that it was suggested that they would be part of a transport security
Bill. At that time, the Airport Operators Association&#146;s chief
executive warned that the Government should not expect a blank cheque
from business when many regional airports and low-cost airlines were
struggling with the economic downturn and higher fuel prices. That has
been a recurrent theme in all the representations made to members of
the Committee&#151;certainly on our side&#151;prior to our
sittings.</div><a name="09022525000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
<i class="I">Sheffield Telegraph</i> reported previous difficulties between South
Yorkshire police and Robin Hood airport, where the
airport</div><a name="09022525000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
be forced to foot the bill for its policing under a new law proposed by
the Government.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column528" />Column number: 528</div><a name="09022525000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed changes
are, in effect, the substance of the clause under discussion, and the
<i class="I">Yorkshire Evening Post</i> labelled them&#151;I am not saying that
I agree with this language&#151;&#147;a terror tax&#148;. It
reported:</div><a name="09022525000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Leeds
Bradford Airport will be slapped with a multi-million pound
&#145;terror tax&#146; under a new law proposed by the Government.
</div><a name="09022525000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">Legislation
unveiled in yesterday&#146;s Queen's Speech will see the airport
forced to pay West Yorkshire Police for its growing policing
costs.</div><a name="09022525000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
new law will transfer responsibility for &#145;threat and risk
analysis&#146; at regional airports&#151;and for picking up the
bill&#151;from the local police force to the airport
operator.&#148;</div><a name="09022525000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not continue in such a critical vein, but that gives a sense of
the debate taking place outside the Committee. It is a familiar debate
and one expects such a set of arguments from aerodrome managers and
airline operators who are worried about the transfer of
cost.</div><a name="09022525000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a comprehensive and balanced briefing to the Committee, Manchester
Airports Group indicated three chief concerns with the proposals. One
is cost, the second is value for money, and the third is the balance of
strength in any ensuing negotiations between the two groups covered by
the clause, namely airports and local police services.</div>
<a name="09022525000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">On cost,
under the current regime there are designated airports, such as that in
Manchester, that already face a significant policing bill, first
through business rates and secondly through direct payments to the
police authority. MAG estimates that &#163;9 million is paid to
Greater Manchester police in policing costs, and a
further &#163;13 million in business rates. MAG argues that
consideration should be given to the amount that airports currently
cough up for policing costs at aerodromes, with business rates being an
obvious
example.</div><a name="09022525000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
value for money, MAG makes a crucial point, which is reflected in the
amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch and me.
It
says:</div><a name="09022525000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
police do not provide an adequate breakdown of how the funding is
spent, nor do they fully justify the levels of policing
needed.&#148;</div><a name="09022525000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a reference to the current regime. But following the logic of the
alleged lack of transparency on the part of police forces who are
currently providing policing services, the argument would seem equally
valid to the new regime in the absence of assurances from
the Minister and any changes to the clause. In short, the allegation is
that there is a lack of transparency and accountability in current
legislation, which is arguably not addressed in the
Bill.</div><a name="09022525000493"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="09022525000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third point that Manchester Airports Group makes is on the negotiating
position of the police, which is strong vis- -vis the airports,
and it also relates to the second point about value for money. It
states:</div><a name="09022525000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
the figures are challenged by airports, the police can always cite
&#145;security reasons&#146; or &#145;ACPO guidelines&#146; as
being the rationale behind their demands, without having to fully
explain or justify
these.&#148;</div><a name="09022525000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I come to the amendments, I should like to refer to one other important
point raised by the Airport Operators Association. It challenges the
suggestion that sometimes comes from the Government that a parallel
should operate&#151;an argument by analogy, as it were&#151;between
the policing of private property, such as a football stadium during
football matches, where charges 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column529" />Column number: 529</div>are levied on the football club or its owners to pay for policing costs
on a Saturday afternoon, and the policing of airports. The suggestion
is that the airports should pay just as readily as a football club for
consuming policing
services.</div><a name="09022525000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Airport Operators Association take issue with
that:</div><a name="09022525000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Airports
are different. Larger ones in particular are often referred to as
&#145;iconic targets&#146; and Chief Constables, who have a legal
accountability for policing in their constabulary area, often have
strong views about how airports should be
policed.&#148;</div><a name="09022525000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
idea that airports are different in kind from football stadiums seems a
very good one. The concern expressed by the Airport Operators
Association is shared by, among others, Virgin Atlantic, which makes a
similar
point.</div><a name="09022525000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to amendments 292, 293 and 291. Amendment 292 relates to RAGs,
which include the chief officer of the relevant force. It makes it
clear that it might also be the lead officer in any collaboration
agreement that is delivering policing services to an airport. We had
many debates on collaboration agreements under clause 5. There will be
situations where there will be level 2 and level 3 crime, which is what
aviation security is all about. Policing services might not be
delivered by the police authority in whose boundary the aerodrome is
situated. To take an example, Greater Manchester police deliver the
services in the case of Manchester airport, which may be near your fine
residence, Sir Nicholas.</div>
<a name="09022525000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under a
future Government after the Bill has come into force there might be a
collaboration agreement right across the north-west for delivering
airport aviation security services. It might be, for the sake of
argument, that the Greater Manchester police is not the lead force. The
chief constable who is responsible for making the decisions, who would
be on the RAG under this clause, might be a chief constable in a
neighbouring area. Amendment 292 endeavours to say that the RAG should
also include a chief officer of another force who has lead
responsibility for security or serious organised operations under any
collaboration agreement that might be enforced.</div>
<a name="09022525000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">In short,
that amendment is a technical one for the avoidance of doubt&#151;it
does not challenge the principle of the clause. It is a belt-and-braces
suggestion because a lead force collaboration chief officer would not
be within the ambit of this clause. It is probing and I am sure the
Minister will want to reflect on whether I am right. I drafted it
rather late as it sprang out at me as I was drinking my late-night
cocoa reading the Bill, as one does. I am interested in the
Minister&#146;s comments as to whether that is covered. The same
argument relates to amendment 293&#151;it is the same
point.</div>
<a name="09022525000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 291
relates to a different issue, the SEG. At the moment the drafting
says:</div><a name="09022525000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
manager of the aerodrome must nominate as a member of the group an
individual who appears to the manager to represent the interests of the
operators&#148;.</div><a name="09022525000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
struck me reading this late at night to ask on what basis the manager
can nominate an individual who &#147;appears&#148; to him to
represent the interests of the operator. My amendment seeks to say
&#147;represents&#148; the interests of the operator. Why is it
&#147;appears&#148; to represent? The drafting is a bit loose and
could lead to confusion. It should be perfectly clear who the operators
wish to have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 530</div>as the individual nominated to represent them. I was
completely mystified. I do not think the current drafting adds
anything. Why can it not be cleaner with a straightforward
&#147;represents&#148;? It is on that basis of a technical probing
amendment that I will terminate my
remarks.</div><a name="09022525000191"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000566"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I welcome you back to the Committee, Sir
Nicholas. It is good to hear you in better voice than when we broke and
it is nice to see that you have recovered.</div>
<a name="09022525000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
pleased to make my contribution on aviation security and offer brief
respite to my ministerial colleagues from the scrutiny they have been
receiving from all parts of the
House.</div><a name="09022525000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
discussing amendments 292 and 293, I will try to explain the background
as the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds has invited me to and then
reinforce some points in response to issues he has raised and, I hope,
reassure him as to the drafting of the Bill. These amendments seek to
amend the provisions in such a way as to allow chief officers of forces
other than the local airport police force to play a role in the
delivery of airport security. Amendment 291 seeks to amend the
provisions relating to the representation of airlines on security
executive groups, as questioned by the hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="09022525000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will turn
first to amendments 292 and 293. The proposed revisions to new sections
24AB and 24AE in clause 60 seek to enable the chief officer of another
police force who, working in collaboration with the local police force,
has lead responsibility for the security of the airport to be
represented on the risk assessment group and to be responsible for
delivering security measures in the airport security plan. We
understand that the intention behind the amendment is essentially to
allow airports to put out a contract for dedicated policing services to
competitive tender, attracting bids from forces around the country.
Although we agree that the requirements should provide sufficient
flexibility to allow local decisions to be made about who can most
effectively deliver security measures, we do not consider that that
should extend to allowing any police force to deliver those
measures.</div><a name="09022525000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an important security point to consider here. Whether one is
thinking of airport policing in terms of terrorism, serious and
organised crime or simply low-level crime, local community intelligence
is key to delivering effective policing. Creating a situation in which
one force polices the local community, while another polices the
airport runs the risk of disrupting the policing links between airport
and community, and that is not something that we consider advisable. In
any event, at a practical level there are real issues with the concept
of competitive tendering for airport policing. The chief officer of
police is responsible for policing within that force area, and any
policing undertaken by representatives of another force could take
place only with his or her consent. Whether such consent is issued
would be a matter for the chief officer of police concerned and there
is no guarantee that such consent would be
provided.</div><a name="09022525000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ruling
out competitive tendering for airport policing does not mean, however,
that we are placing airport operators in a position where they cannot
negotiate effective and efficient ways of meeting their security
obligations. The provisions in the Bill do not allow the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column531" />Column number: 531</div>police simply to impose the terms of airport security plans and police
services agreements upon an unsuspecting and vulnerable
operator&#151;not that I have met such an animal. We expect
stakeholders to think creatively about efficient and effective ways of
delivering security. Dedicated policing is only one way to mitigate a
threat. Employing an alternative approach may of course be entirely
acceptable. Ultimately, if a matter came to dispute, the Secretary of
State would issue a determination, based on the evidence presented, on
the most effective way to mitigate the threat. At times, that may mean
policing and at other times it may mean alternative
measures.</div><a name="09022525000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government agree with the concern behind amendment 291, namely that
subjectivity might result in airlines not being fairly represented on
the security executive group. In circumstances in which there is
disagreement about who is best placed to represent airlines on the SEG,
the airport manager may use his general power of appointment in
proposed new section 24AG(5) to appoint more than one airline
representative to the group. The airport manager is required to act
reasonably in his use of powers of appointment, so, where there is
clearly an airline interest that is not being adequately represented at
SEG level, the airport manager would be obliged to make any necessary
appointment. In any event, in circumstances in which there was any
doubt about whether an airline was being adequately represented, it
would also be open to the Secretary of State to consider making his own
nomination.</div><a name="09022525000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
light of that, there is little to be achieved from the airport manager
being compelled to go through a formal exercise to establish who is
best placed to be appointed first. That could generate a great deal of
work for the manager, as well as an unnecessary liability burden on the
aerodrome manager to prove that the airline appointee truly speaks for
all airlines at the airport. If it is unclear, the aerodrome manager
will simply appoint an additional airline representative. The aviation
industry has, rightly, pressed strongly for the process not to create
any unnecessary bureaucratic burden and we are keen that any such
burden should be avoided wherever
possible.</div><a name="09022525000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 299 is a minor amendment that will ensure that provisions
relating to the Secretary of State&#146;s power to appoint observers
to the SEG are consistent with the Secretary of State&#146;s other
powers of appointment contained within clause 60. The amendment will
ensure that express provision is made to permit the Secretary of State
to revoke his nomination of observers to the
SEG.</div><a name="09022525000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the points that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds made, it takes 15
months to do an assessment, for the SEG to prepare the airport security
plan and for the police services agreement to be put in place. At the
quickest, it would be at least 15 months after the Bill is enacted
before airports begin to put their arrangements in place, which gives
them time to plan. On value for money and a breakdown of costs, we
fully agree that there must be transparency, so we would expect clear
invoices and clarity in the PSA before payment. The hon. Gentleman
correctly draws attention to the fact that that does not exist
currently.</div><a name="09022525000494"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="09022525000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parts
of the critical national infrastructure, primarily power stations and
railway stations as well as the football stadiums that the hon.
Gentleman mentions and nuclear 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column532" />Column number: 532</div>power stations, pay for the police they require so
that they can operate in a safe and secure environment. We therefore
see no inconsistency in airports operating in the same way. Finally, at
many airports, an airline operators committee already exists, and it is
likely that that its principal representative will simply be asked to
attend the SEG as well although, as I have outlined, if there is a
requirement for additional airline representation the situation is open
to a secondary appointment. I hope that in light of my reassurances the
hon. Gentleman will not press amendments 292, 293 and
291.</div><a name="09022525000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000567"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The Minister has given us some useful assurances,
for which I am grateful, but I wish to press him further. He started by
saying that the first amendment in this group was about competitive
tendering. It might be, but you will notice, Sir Nicholas, being an
eagle-eyed Chairman, that there is no reference to competitive
tendering and if I had meant that to be the main thrust of the
amendment, being a plain-speaking Englishman I would have used the
words &#147;competitive tendering&#148;. The amendment does not
imply that from where I sit, and it is quite a weak amendment,
according to the following argument. We would not suggest that
competitive tendering for Manchester airport, for example, be a
national tender that would allow Kent and Essex, for instance, to come
up with a great bid and start policing the airport. Instead, where
there is a geographically local collaboration agreement to deliver
level 2 services&#151;it might be to do with serious organised crime,
or drug or people trafficking and aviation security&#151;that might
be an up-and-running collaboration agreement including a force that has
the airport in its geographical boundary. That has nothing to do with,
and does not imply, a competitive tendering arrangement. It might just
be that the services are delivered across three, four or five forces in
the collaboration agreement and that the lead chief officer is from a
nearby force but is operationally, and in terms of the governance
structure of the collaboration agreement, the person who makes the
judgment call about security at Manchester
airport.</div><a name="09022525000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
urge the Minister to reflect on the fact that the only person who can
serve on that group is the chief officer of the force in the area where
the airport is located. He might want to reflect on that with his hon.
Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and
Policing. I would understand if he were concerned about competitive
tendering, but this is a technical point about collaboration agreements
operating locally and about who the chief officer should be for the
purposes of the group set up under the
clause.</div><a name="09022525000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000568"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I tried to respond to that point earlier.
Manchester is not alone; Gatwick also straddles two constabularies and
Heathrow straddles three. Our point is that somebody has to be
responsible. The main constabulary should provide the appropriate
responsible person, because the links with the local community and the
greater area outside are an important part of policing the airport, not
just from the point of view of the police services agreement but in
terms of the contact between the airport and the community, the ability
to determine what is appropriate through knowing what is outside as
well as inside, and ultimately because the chief constable of the local
constabulary has to sign off the agreement. It is therefore much more
appropriate for them to be on the group. I would not for a second
expect chief constables 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column533" />Column number: 533</div>to fail to consult with constabularies with which
they have collaborative relationships and agreements because of the
locations of airports. I am sure that that happens at the moment, and I
would be surprised if it did not happen once the measure is passed. The
new procedure will be even more transparent than the existing
one.</div><a name="09022525000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000569"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The Minister has given a helpful reply. I am not
entirely convinced on his last point about collaboration agreements.
However, we need to make progress so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022525000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09022525000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000570"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I beg to move amendment 294, in
clause 60, page 78, line 33, at
end insert</div> <a name="09022558000008"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;provided
that such agreement required of any individual shall not be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000571"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 295, in
clause 60, page 78, line 35, at

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000572"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The amendment goes to the heart of the unanimity
that will be required when a security plan is signed up to. Proposed
new section 24AH(2)
states:</div><a name="09022525000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
provision may be included in an aerodrome security plan unless all the
members of the group unanimously agree that it should be
included.&#148;</div><a name="09022525000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of amendments 294 and 295 is to probe the feasibility of
seeking unanimity in what may be a group of as many as a dozen people.
The wording of the amendments is the same, and they both suggest that
rather than a provision requiring unanimity,
the</div><a name="09022525000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;agreement
required of any individual shall not be unreasonably
withheld.&#148;</div><a name="09022525000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
would therefore be a reasonability test when individuals make their
decisions. An individual could object and thus deprive the rest of the
group of the unanimity required for a plan to be signed off. They might
decide, perversely, not to give their consent as a bargaining chip for
another part of the negotiations. The unanimity concept in the clause
is problematic. Will the Minister consider a requirement that consent
should not be unreasonably
withheld?</div><a name="09022525000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022525000573"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): The question of unanimity was
raised when the Committee took evidence. Bob Jones, the chair of the

system:</div><a name="09022525000435"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">&#147;Our
only slight reservation, probably contrary to the airport operators, is
that the current system effectively requires unanimous agreement. That
is a commendable desire, but it effectively results in a position where
there is an individual veto. The appeal against that...can drag on
for a considerable period of time, when there may be an important
security risk that needs to be addressed in the short term rather than
going through such a cumbersome process. I would hope that the
Committee looks at the arrangements for resolving those issues where
there is not unanimous agreement.&#148;&#151;&#151;[Official

page 78 of the Bill, between lines 31 to 35, there are two specific
requests for unanimity: one states that there must be unanimous
agreement on the aerodrome security plan; and the other states that
there must be unanimous agreement on variations to it. This is an
appropriate point to ask the Minister to tease out the thinking on
those provisions. I know that later clauses mention independent
tribunals and the power that the Secretary of State has to step in and
act as King Solomon by adjudicating, and the Minister will probably
refer to those provisions when he replies to the debate.</div>

amendments offer one way of dealing with that, but they set up their
own problem: if one is to define what is, and is not, reasonable, one
has to look at statute and dig oneself into all sorts of problems
trying to define it. The unanimity issue is very desirable, as Bob
Jones said, but it can also be a great hindrance if people are to take
effective decisions, so it would be good to hear the Minister explain
how the Government propose to get around that issue in this clause and
those that follow it and offer a possible break on effective decision
making.</div><a name="09022525000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000574"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> Although we agree that parties to an
aerodrome security plan should not behave unreasonably when providing
consent to the inclusion or variation of a provision, I regret to say
that our view is that the amendment would complicate rather than
clarify matters. Stipulating that consent to the inclusion or variation
of a term in an aerodrome security plan may not unreasonably be
withheld prompts the question of who would be entitled to make the
decision about whether such consent is being unreasonably withheld. The
dispute provisions, as presently drafted, ensure that it is the
Secretary of State who is entitled to make such decisions. That ensures
real clarity, which we consider essential to ensuring that stakeholders
sign up to and deliver the measures contained in the aerodrome security
plan.</div>
<a name="09022525000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">If unanimous
agreement to a provision cannot be reached after proper discussion and
a serious attempt at compromise, the matter may be referred as a
dispute. Requiring that cases in which consent is being unreasonably
withheld go to dispute does not mean that we are creating a long and
drawn-out process for dealing with such matters. If it is blatantly
obvious that a party is being unreasonable in its refusal to provide
consent, the Secretary of State can indicate that early in the
proceedings and may ultimately award costs associated with the dispute
process against the party concerned. We believe that that will act as a
real incentive on parties not to force matters to the dispute stage
unreasonably. We believe that the provisions ensure real clarity on the
issue of agreement to the terms to be included in an aerodrome security
plan and provide sensible and practical mechanisms for dealing with
parties who seek to behave
unreasonably.</div><a name="09022525000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds said that that could offer police
forces a veto on whether the plan is adequate, but it also offers the
airport operators a veto. It is a double-edged sword, and that is what
we believe gives protection and ensures that the process is equitable,
transparent and agreeable and that it is known that costs can be
awarded against someone who appears unreasonable. We will have the
benchmark of other airports to show what is happening in airports of a
similar
size.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column535" />Column number: 535</div><a name="09022525000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that requiring unanimity actually places a burden on both the
airport operator and the police to act reasonable because they know
that the Secretary of State is waiting in the wings to act as
arbitrator if a dispute arises. Where it was previously suggested that
there be an independent panel to arbitrate on disputes, it was the
stakeholders who said during consultation that they wanted ministerial
oversight and the responsibility to rest with the Department for
Transport. We accepted that suggestion and have now made the amendment
to the Bill. We think that that strengthens the arrangements for
workable and acceptable plans, and on that basis I ask the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022525000495"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

his remarks is interesting and important. He describes a symmetry
which, in a perfect world, would operate to ensure that one part is not
unreasonably vetoed, because of the knowledge that, at some later date,
they could be paid back in kind. On the basis of the Minister&#146;s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000578"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The amendment seeks to clarify the drafting. In
subsection(2) of the proposed new section, &#147;24AM Meaning of
dispute about security planning&#148;, there are two examples of
areas relating to disputes about security planning. Subsection(2)(a)
is</div> <a name="09022525000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
dispute about the contents of an aerodrome security
plan&#148;,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column536" />Column number: 536</div><a name="09022525000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
subsection (2)(b) is</div>
<a name="09022525000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a dispute about
the implementation of an aerodrome security plan for the
aerodrome.&#148;.</div><a name="09022525000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
what we do not have in subsection (2) is clarification of disputes
relating to the costs of policing to be met by the aerodrome managers.
Amendment 257 seeks to insert clarification, a new little (c), which
makes it clear that disputes can relate, not just to the contents or
the implementation of an aerodrome security plan, but to any dispute
about the costs of policing to be met by the aerodrome manager. The
reason that it does need to be spelt out is the real concern that we
have already heard about from aerodrome operators&#151;and even
airlines, but mainly aerodrome operators&#151;regarding the costs of
policing.</div>
<a name="09022525000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
might suggest that my amendment, which defines disputes and relates to
costs, is actually caught by subsection 2(a)&#151;in other
words,</div>
<a name="09022525000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a dispute about
the contents of an aerodrome security plan&#148;.</div>
<a name="09022525000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">He might have a point,
but I think that it is worth spelling out on the face of the Bill that
disputes do, in fact, relate to the costs of policing to be borne by an
aerodrome manager, because the <i class="I">Yorkshire Post</i>, using rather
colourful language, suggested that it was a terror tax.</div>
<a name="09022525000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The payments
that this part of the Bill implies, are payments that are going to be
extracted from private businesses, aerodrome operators, and in that
sense it can be called a tax&#151;it is a tax of a kind. Whenever
imposts are levied on private individuals or corporate entities, we
have to be careful to ensure that the extraction of money is open and
transparent. I know that the Minister will want to assure us that the
Bill gives more transparency than the current regime. We know that that
comfort is needed because of the plethora of representations that
members of the Committee&#151;certainly on this side&#151;have
received about the lack of transparency and the apparent inability of
some police forces to explain exactly what it is that they are charging
for. The amendment flags up that important point.</div>
<a name="09022525000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall turn
to amendment 296. The Bill gives the Secretary of State a power to
intervene in a dispute even if there has been no formal referral of
that dispute to the Secretary of State by one of the parties affected.
For him to intervene, the Secretary of State must only think that there
is a dispute&#151;&#147;thinks&#148; is the word in the clause.
That is a bit weak. The Secretary of State wakes up and
&#147;thinks&#148; that there is a dispute. It is an unusual word
to find in legislation and it leapt out at me, so I proffer the
deletion of &#147;thinks&#148; and the insertion of
&#147;reasonably believes&#148;. That makes clear that the
Secretary of State cannot skittishly or coquettishly think that there
is a dispute before using his or her powers to intervene.</div>
<a name="09022525000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Broadly the
same point is being made in amendments 297 and 298. The relevant
proposed new subsections may require a party to take steps to resolve a
dispute and clearly include a requirement to make a payment. As the
amendments say, we need to be
clear</div><a name="09022525000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
the Secretary of State believes that the amount of such payment in
respect of costs is reasonable and proportionate having regard to all
the relevant
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="09022525000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 255, in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Hornchurch, is a probing amendment to ensure that it is clear that
appealing a Secretary of State&#146;s decision will not be restricted
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column537" />Column number: 537</div>judicial review. It may have been a fault on my
part, but I was not clear where in the appeal mechanism a formal
judicial review form of appeal would operate. I would be grateful if
the Minister could clarify that for me, given my all too unforgivably
hazy understanding of how that appeal mechanism would relate to
judicial review. In that spirit of honest inquiry, I proffer these
amendments and look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
<a name="09022525000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000579"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> Amendments 257 and 296 both relate to
disputes. The first concerns the cost of policing and the other deals
with the initiation of dispute proceedings. Amendment 255 considers the
right of appeal. Amendments 297 and 298 both relate to how the
Secretary of State apportions the costs of resolving a dispute
concerning an airport security plan to those parties in dispute.
Government Amendments 300 to 302 clarify, revise and ensure consistency
of approach. I will look at each of those in
turn.</div><a name="09022525000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
257 would allow disputes about the cost of policing to be raised in the
context of the provisions relating to security planning. It is worth
stating from the outset that the Bill already allows parties to raise
disputes about the costs of policing. We recognise that it is
absolutely essential for airport operators and the police to be able
formally to dispute costs. This is why we have made provision for this
in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09022525000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
section 29A of schedule 5 of the Bill allows airports, police forces
and police authorities to dispute the terms of a police services
agreement. The PSA is the document that will contain information about
payments to be made by the airport to the police, and the services that
the police will provide in exchange for these payments. But although we
are clear that stakeholders must be able to dispute the cost of
policing, we do not believe that they should be able to do this before
they have agreed whether or not a dedicated police presence is actually
required at the airport. This is what this amendment would
require&#151;what it is seeking&#151;and, with respect, we do not
think that it would make much
sense.</div><a name="09022525000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
airport security provisions as drafted require stakeholders to adopt a
logical process when planning and delivering security at airports.
First, risks and threats to the airport are assessed and set out in a
risk report. Secondly, stakeholders agree on what security measures are
necessary to mitigate these threats, and these are set out in an
airport security plan. Thirdly, if the airport security plan shows that
a dedicated police presence is necessary to mitigate one or more of the
threats to the airport, a police services agreement is drawn
up.</div><a name="09022525000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stakeholders
are able to access dispute resolution proceedings at both stages two
and three of this process. At stage two, when the airport security plan
is being drawn up, the current provisions already allow stakeholders to
dispute whether a dedicated police presence is actually needed to
mitigate any given threat. This is provided for at subsection 24AM of
clause 60. Once the airport security plan is agreed, it will be clear
whether a dedicated police presence is actually required at the
airport. If it is, stakeholders can proceed with stage three, which is
the process of drawing up a police services
agreement.</div><a name="09022525000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
occasion, it may not be possible to reach agreement as to policing
costs. The provisions therefore allow stakeholders to dispute the costs
of policing, by accessing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column538" />Column number: 538</div>the dispute resolution proceedings attached to the PSA provisions. These
are contained at subsection 29A of schedule 5 of the
Bill.</div><a name="09022525000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Structuring
the dispute resolution proceedings in this way ensures that parties
must agree whether a dedicated police presence is actually required at
the airport before parties start becoming involved in discussions about
costs. I hope the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds will be reassured
that there are provisions in the Bill that will allow stakeholders to
take disagreements about the costs of policing to dispute but at the
appropriate
stage.</div><a name="09022525000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
suggested wording change in amendment 296 to section 24AO implies that
without the substitution of the word &#147;thinks&#148; with
&#147;reasonably believes&#148;, that the Secretary of State might
somehow act unreasonably in making a judgment as to whether a dispute
might exist in relation to an airport security plan. With respect to
colleagues opposite, this represents a misunderstanding about how the
Secretary of State is required to carry out statutory responsibilities.
The well established rules of natural justice already require the
Secretary of State to act reasonably in using any statutory power. For
this reason, the suggested amendment is
unnecessary.</div><a name="09022525000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
297 and 298 both relate to how the Secretary of State apportions the
costs of resolving a dispute concerning an airport security plan to
those parties in dispute. The Government believe that it is only right
that the taxpayer should not be responsible for meeting the costs of a
dispute. Rather, costs associated with resolving the dispute, for
example, the costs of providing experts to assist in its resolution,
should be met by the parties in dispute. In apportioning costs to a
party or parties, the Secretary of State will have regard to whether
those involved have acted reasonably. In other words, costs will not
necessarily be split equally between parties. In making any decision as
to the costs that should be met by disputing parties, the Secretary of
State will naturally judge whether his decision is reasonable and
proportionate, having considered all of the relevant circumstances.
This is the way in which any Secretary of State executes his legal
responsibilities; it is unnecessary to prescribe this approach in
legislation.</div><a name="09022525000496"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="09022525000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
300 makes express provision that the Secretary of State may not, as
part of any determination on an ASP, require any other party to make
payments to the chief officer of police for the relevant area. This is
to ensure consistency in relation to the provisions concerning the
content of ASPs. Amendment 255 to proposed section 24AR seeks to ensure
that those delivering measures in an airport security plan are able to
appeal any decision made by the Secretary of State in relation to a
plan on the ground that it may not be a correct decision. If the right
to appeal the Secretary of State&#146;s decision were to be limited
to judicial review, the decision could be challenged only on a limited
basis. In the main, the factors that could be considered would be as
follows: first, whether the Secretary of State was acting within his or
her powers; secondly, whether fair procedure had been applied; and
thirdly, whether the decision was reasonable in the sense of whether it
amounted to an abuse of power. Indeed, we heard part of the definition
of judicial review from the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
in relation to another part of the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column539" />Column number: 539</div><a name="09022525000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
fully agree that the Secretary of State&#146;s determination should
be challengeable in the High Court on the grounds that, given the
available evidence, a more appropriate decision about an airport
security plan could have been made. That is why proposed subsection
24AR(1) is included. Without an express provision for appeal to the
High Court, the right to challenge a decision by the Secretary of State
would be restricted to judicial review. I am aware that some members of
the Committee are far better acquainted with the law than I am; they
will not need me to tell them that the amendment would result in a far
more limited right of appeal than that included in the
Bill.</div><a name="09022525000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a matter of law, there is no doubt that the clause would not restrict
appeals against the Secretary of State's decision to that of judicial
review. Given that the present drafting already achieves the outcome
intended by the amendment, the Government&#146;s view is that the
amendment is unnecessary.</div>
<a name="09022525000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 301 simply revises the existing phrasing. Amendment 302
ensures that a consistent definition is applied wherever variants of
dispute relating to airport security plans are referred to in clause
60. I invite the Committee not to press amendments 257, 296 to 298 and
255.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000580"></a>Mr.

that by their very nature the amendments are probing. Indeed, as a

administrative case law. Through the amendments, we were seeking to get

manager.&#148;</div><a name="09022525000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">As

Minister should give a full reply to this debate because cost is an
issue that most concerns those who have contacted Committee members.
What has struck me is not that aerodrome managers and operators are
going to die in the ditch over the concept that they have to cough up
for policing. Some think that it is totally iniquitous, but many
believe that the principle in the Bill is sound. However, they wish to
ensure that any payments they must make are levied in a transparent
way. I gave examples earlier of operators who have suggested that under
the current regime some police forces will merely say, &#147;This is
a security risk and this is the level of policing. Now pay your
money.&#148; The purpose of the amendment is to tease out how we
might improve the current regime, which appears to be inadequate for
many operators.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000582"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> The amendment is clearly designed to ensure
that the Secretary of State&#146;s determination in resolving
disputes about policing at aerodromes is transparent, fair and
proportionate and that it provides value for money. Those are the very
factors that were considered in drafting the schedule so I understand
why the hon. Gentleman wants to ensure that it has that effect. As I
mentioned, stakeholders in industry and the police have welcomed the
decision to change the final arbiter in disputes from a panel of
independent experts to the Secretary of State for Transport precisely
because they believe that it will provide sufficient accountability for
decisions and will be fair and proportionate.</div>
<a name="09022525000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks to achieve the desired outcome by placing specific requirements
on the Secretary of State, which we believe add no value to provisions
that already provide broad powers to ensure that a fair and thorough
determination is made.</div>
<a name="09022525000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
section 29C (5) is drafted in broad terms to allow the Secretary of
State to gather information from relevant parties, whoever those may
be. That extends to the airport operator and the police as well as
other relevant organisations. The measure was included to ensure that
the relevant police force supplies information on resourcing, as
described in the amendment under proposed section 29C (8). By using
powers under proposed new section 29C (5), the Secretary of State will
look for clear evidence that police resources are justified in making
any determination. Prescribing the specific types of information that
the Secretary of State should consider is unnecessary as those powers
are already in the
Bill.</div><a name="09022525000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to ensure that the police do not impose an unreasonable
level of their resources at the airport, which the aerodrome manager
will be required to pay for. It is also about ensuring that airports
receive value for money, and we understand that. The Government are
conscious of those issues, which is partly why we are instituting an
end-to-end process for security planning that builds in collective
agreement for the necessary security measures based on agreement
between all those with an interest in airport
security.</div><a name="09022525000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government believe that subsections (9) and (10) to proposed new
section 29C should not be included in the Bill. We all agree on the
principles of transparency and accountability and they run through the
entirety of the current provisions. The act of producing a risk report
and an airport security plan to support security decisions&#151;both
of which will be available to all relevant parties&#151;is wholly
transparent and provides a clear set of accountabilities. The amendment
would provide no added value as such measures already exist.</div>
<a name="09022525000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(10)(a) to proposed new section 29C would create a hypothetical
situation whereby the Secretary of State would need to consider whether
another police force would have made different operational resource
decisions. It would not be possible do that adequately without asking
another police force to make such a judgment. That would be impractical
since the other force would not have been privy to the discussions and
arrangements that led to the final decision. It would have to go back
to the start, take evidence and weigh it up. Therefore, the process
would be time-consuming and could leave the Secretary of State in a
dilemma as to which force&#146;s view should be given greater
credence.</div><a name="09022525000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">If,
however, the Secretary of State feels that such advice would be
helpful, that can be pursued under the existing provisions as drafted
in the schedule. It would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column542" />Column number: 542</div>not be appropriate for the legislation to prescribe
that in every instance when it is not relevant to the dispute. If
accepted, the amendment would require the Secretary of State to
consider whether another police force would have provided resources at
a lower rate. That implies that policing of airports is a competitive,
commercial venture&#151;that was the discussion that we had at the
beginning of the debate on the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for
Bury St. Edmunds.</div>
<a name="09022525000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Resourcing
costs are calculated on numerous factors such as shift patterns,
management structures and the like, which may vary from force to force.
The costs must reflect the circumstances of each force and the
Secretary of State must consider those factors when determining if
something is proportionate, rather than considering whether another
force could have provided the resources more
cheaply.</div><a name="09022525000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule is designed to ensure that the procedures followed by the
Secretary of State in determining a dispute are impartial and
transparent, and that the determination is fair and proportionate.
Comprehensive guidance material will clarify the more detailed issues
raised by the amendment. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09022525000280"></a>

Fitzpatrick:</b> Amendments 303, 305 and 306 provide for
section 30 to be repealed with saving provisions to ensure that any
orders made under the section are preserved. In practice, section 30
has principally been used where airports have been designated to effect
the transfer of private forces to local Home Office constabularies and
to make associated arrangements. The relevant orders date back to the
late 1970s. As the aviation security provisions in the Policing and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000589"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. Welcome back to you,
too.</div>
<a name="09022525000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">This group of
amendments is designed to improve the working of the planned new
vetting and barring scheme provided for under the Safeguarding
Vulnerable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 544</div>Groups Act 2006 and, as indicated by amendment 307,
the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order
2007.</div><a name="09022525000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
aims to improve the safeguarding of children and vulnerable adults, and
builds on the outcome of a public consultation with stakeholders on the
details of the scheme's operation. We propose four main
changes.</div><a name="09022525000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
amendments 335 and 336 we propose to remove the redundant status
of</div><a name="09022525000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject
to monitoring and undergoing
assessment&#148;</div><a name="09022525000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">from
the online status check that will be available to employers who employ
people in regulated activity with children or vulnerable adults.
Undergoing assessment is too sensitive a status to appear in a publicly
available IT system. In addition, when people first apply to be subject
to monitoring by the scheme, they will inevitably be undergoing
assessment for a while, so giving them that status will be
meaningless.</div><a name="09022525000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Instead,
guidance to employers will highlight that though new applications by
members of the work force to be made subject to monitoring will be
processed quickly, information may still be coming in to the CRB about
those people until the associated enhanced disclosure is ready to issue
a few weeks after the application. Until then, employers should apply
appropriate safeguards in relation to all new applicants as neither
they nor the ISA will yet have the full picture. Employers will have a
true guide to a person's status through a CRB enhanced disclosure,
which will say clearly if the person is under consideration for barring
by the
ISA.</div><a name="09022525000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 27 and 28 strengthen the notification of employers whose
employees may pose a risk of harm to the vulnerable groups. The
amendment provides that when the ISA has reached the advanced stage in
its consideration and proposes to bar someone from working with
children or vulnerable adults subject to their representations, it must
notify any interested party who has registered for notification of any
change in the person's status in the scheme&#151;normally an employer
in regulated activity with the vulnerable
groups.</div><a name="09022525000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also,
if the ISA is satisfied that any other party has a legitimate interest
in the person, it may notify that party that it proposes to bar the
person. Such a party might be an employer of a person in regulated
activity who has not yet had the opportunity to register his or her
interest, because of the scheme's phasing-in
period.</div><a name="09022525000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
person whom the ISA proposes to bar has eight weeks to make
representation, and there might be a further period of time before the
ISA is able to make its final decision. We do not believe that it is
sustainable for the ISA to be aware of a risk posed by that person
during that period but that the employer not be aware. It will be for
employers to determine what action it is reasonable and appropriate for
them to take in those circumstances, and guidance to employers will
advise on what they might do if they receive such a
notification.</div><a name="09022525000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, they might suspend the person or move him to work other than
with the vulnerable groups. I stress again that the ISA is at an
advanced stage in its process when it makes the notification. It has
made a finding of fact and a judgment that it would be appropriate to
bar, and has invited the individual to make representation about its
decisions.</div><a name="09022525000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 29 and 30 give the ISA an explicit power to provide information
to the police about people who come to its notice where that is
necessary for the purposes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column545" />Column number: 545</div>of crime prevention, detection or investigation.
Normally, the ISA will receive information from the police. However,
there may be exceptional circumstances where the ISA receives
information that is unavailable to a particular police force about a
person, but the ISA knows that that force has an interest in them and
can form a view that they pose a risk of harm. The ISA should then have
the power to inform the police in order to prevent crime. The police
might then notify any known employer, local children&#146;s services
or adult social services, who would be able to take appropriate action
if
necessary.</div><a name="09022525000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 31 and 32 change the way in which the scheme will process
automatic barring. Certain criminal offences, which are set out in
secondary legislation, will cause the offender to be barred
automatically. Both the 2006 Act and the 2007 order envisaged the CRB
finding such offences in the police national computer, and the ISA then
simply being required to bar the offender. Practice has shown that life
is not so simple, because, in some cases, the circumstances in which
the offence was committed need to be checked. For example, in some
cases the age of the offender, and, occasionally, the victim, need to
be clarified before it can be confirmed whether the prescribed criteria
have been met, so an automatic bar should be applied.</div>
<a name="09022525000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">ISA case
officers&#151;rather than the CRB, whose function is data
processing&#151;will establish the details of the circumstances in
which an offence was committed. Indeed, the ISA has already started
that work under transitional arrangements that were approved by
Parliament last November. We need to reflect such practical experience
in permanent legislative
provisions.</div><a name="09022525000315"></a>

trivial.</div><a name="09022525000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister explain why it was absolutely necessary to rename the
Independent Barring Board? I ask that for two reasons. First, that

thing&#151;&#147;barring&#148; is a good word. Secondly, the
Opposition are often struck by the remorseless amount of change that we
see from the Government. I forget whether it was Bolingbroke or Halifax

is a serious point that remorseless relabelling, rebranding and
rebadging&#151;to use terrible PR-speak&#151;is something that
Government should avoid as frequently as possible. Will the Minister,
as a careful and prudent keeper of the public purse in relation to the
Home Office budget, tell us the cost of the renaming in terms of
changing letterheads, business cards and contact details? I may well
have missed something, but the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column546" />Column number: 546</div>change does not seem necessary. It is a semantic
change that will only cost the taxpayer, and confuse people who have
been cheerfully rubbing along and carrying out their lives by looking

hon. Gentleman for the Opposition&#146;s support for what we trying
to do, and his reassurance that they treat the issue as importantly as
we do. He said that &#147;barring&#148; was a good word in his
view, and indeed it has some use as a word that sends out a message.
But in reality, in the widespread consultation, the stakeholders of the
vetting and barring scheme indicated that they did not particularly
like the word &#147;barring&#148;, and preferred the word
&#147;safeguarding, because that gives greater prominence to the
safeguarding agenda. It grew from them, as opposed to the Government

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000596"></a>The

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
63</h4><a name="09022525000013"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Educational
establishments: check on members of governing
body</div><a name="09022525000330"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div><a name="09022525000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000598"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am most grateful, Sir Nicholas, for your
excellent guidance and forbearance. I am particularly pleased that you
allowed me some latitude on clause 63. This important clause relates to
checks on those who are or seek to be school governors, and it throws
up a serious question. Subsection 13(3) of the Safeguarding Vulnerable
Groups Act 2006 ensures that an officer who runs those checks does not
commit a criminal offence if they do not make a check on a governor who
was appointed before section 13 became law. That is a clear exception.
Subsection 13(4) of that Act allows the Secretary of State by order to
set a date when that exception will come to an end&#151;a sunset
provision.</div><a name="09022525000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to understand how the time scale will operate, for the
simple reason that that time-limited exception allows for a check not
to be run against a governor who happens to be a paedophile. How long
does the Minister expect that exception under the sunset provision to
exist? I do not for one second suggest that Ministers have not got
their eye on that; it is clear from the explanatory notes that they
take the matter seriously. I seek to make no party political or other
point; this is an honest inquiry as to how long the phasing out of the
exception will take. There is a difference between the exception
existing for three months and it existing for a year. None of us on the
Committee, and certainly not the Ministers and officials, would want to
see an exception, which is there for understandable reasons, lingering
on. The longer the exception is there, the less focusing there will be
of the minds of appropriate officers, because the exception removes the
criminal liability of those officers who fail recklessly or negligently
to do the required checks of school
governors.</div><a name="09022525000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to ensure that the exception for those individuals who were
governors before the 2006 Act came into force does not continue for too
long. We want the norm to be appropriate officers making checks on all
school governors, whether they were governors before or after the
passage of that Act. It is on that question of genuine, honest,
non-partisan inquiry that I, and many families and schools, would like
the Minister&#146;s
guidance.</div><a name="09022525000334"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022525000599"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Further to that
point, will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary say whether a similar
provision will apply to local authority members who visit schools? That
issue arose some time ago in my constituency. As selected
representatives we go in and out of all kinds of institutions without
any checks. I have only once been asked for a police check to visit a
children&#146;s establishment, and that was when I was travelling
abroad with a voluntary organisation. Elected representatives are not
always immune from difficulties in this area either. Could my hon.
Friend respond to that point?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column548" />Column number: 548</div><a name="09022525000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000600"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am grateful to both the hon. Member for Bury
St. Edmunds and my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North not
simply for raising the issue, but for the way in which they did so. We
have a shared concern. These are important questions. It is important
to get the right system in place to identify and exclude people who are
at risk. We also need to give confidence to people working in schools
and parents that the system is robust. That also helps to keep this as
a high
priority.</div><a name="09022525000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman raised the issue of sunsetting. We have said that we
will phase in the requirements to check over a period of time, but I
can assure him that this will be done on a risk basis. So the person he
identifies who has never been checked and yet could be a paedophile
would be placed in a very early stage in that period. While in theory
there may be a short period, I can assure him that it will be the
shortest period
possible.</div><a name="09022525000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend raised the issue of local authority members visiting
schools. To some extent it rather depends on the visit whether the
local authority member does any work for the school. If they do, they
will be checked. Again, we will be phasing in over a period of time. I
will certainly take away the points that she raises. There are a number
of people in elected positions who will fairly regularly go into
schools in their area. Indeed, it is important that we can give her and
the Committee the reassurance that she
seeks.</div><a name="09022525000338"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000601"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The clause refers to the very important question
of the powers that the state has in relation to persons entering or
leaving the UK. It goes to the very heart of the broader issue of
border control. It will amend the Customs and Excise Management Act
1979 by inserting a new section, which will enable an officer of
Revenue and Customs to require a person entering or leaving the UK to
produce their passport or travel documents and answer questions about
their
journey.</div><a name="09022525000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
are sensible powers. They are also desirable because porous borders
only lend succour and aid to those who wish to commit crime. The
UK&#146;s border is too porous in our view. I know that Ministers in
the Home Office are not happy either. The Minister for Borders and
Immigration
said:</div><a name="09022525000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
have, compared to other rich countries, been liberal in our border
controls&#148;.</div><a name="09022525000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
infer from that that he thinks the Government could do better at border
control. If that inference is correct, Ministers should adopt the
Opposition&#146;s suggestion and have a dedicated border police force
to toughen up our
borders.</div><a name="09022525000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sixty
per cent. of illegal immigrants resident in the United Kingdom arrived
here illegally, the majority in the back of a lorry, extraordinarily
enough. People will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column549" />Column number: 549</div>not need reminding that the economic and social costs of people
trafficking to the UK amounted to &#163;1 billion in 2003. Some would
put the estimates much higher than that, particularly in non-pecuniary
terms. We know that weapons are smuggled across UK borders and we must
do better at clamping down on
that.</div><a name="09022525000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
powers in the clause will be important in improving our performance in
stamping out illegal weapon transmission into this country, people
trafficking and people wishing to enter the country illegally. The
powers will clamp down on those problems by sensible questions being
asked of individuals along with the requirement for them to produce
their passport and other documents when asked to by an official of Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs.</div><a name="09022525000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause raises a bigger question. The Government have not been slouches
on this issue. They have decided to enter the electronic age in
announcing the e-Borders programme. I will not detain the Committee for
too long on this point. The e-Borders system is under development in
this country. It will ensure that the state can access a comprehensive
record of everyone wanting to come into or leave this country and of
everyone who crosses our borders. That will strengthen the security of
those who live in and visit our country, make it easier for those who
are travelling and trading legitimately, and maintain tight control of
our
border.</div><a name="09022525000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the e-Borders programme information will be collected from the carrier,
not the passenger. The carrier will be legally required to collect
information and provide it to the UK border authorities as part of a
check-in
process.</div><a name="09022525000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause asks sensibly for more information from individuals who wish to
cross our borders. I will try not to stray out of order. The e-Borders
programme must be integral to and complementary to the powers in the
clause that will improve the information and details individuals must
furnish when they wish to cross our borders. In that context, will the
Minister say at what stage Her Majesty&#146;s Government are in the
e-Borders programme?</div>
<a name="09022525000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Information
supplied to me and my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch suggests
that airlines, which will be the prime furnishers under the e-Borders
programme, are concerned about the costly changes they will have to
make to their reservation and departure control systems to comply with
the programme. They are also concerned about a lack of information from
the Government to prepare them for the changes. We are advised that the
e-Borders programme should have gone live on 2 October 2008, but
carriers were not told until 24 October that the deadline had been
revised. I have been told that the Home Office puts an unrealistic time
scale on carriers making the relevant changes. Some airlines will have
to make significant changes to meet the terms of the scheme as set out
by the
Government.</div><a name="09022525000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Running
the e-Borders programme is a &#163;650 million contract, which was
awarded in November 2007 to Trusted Borders, a consortium led by
Raytheon Systems. A delay has occurred, but I have been advised that
the programme is now scheduled to start being rolled out at the end of
February. That is pertinent when we are discussing the clause, because
the type of information required from passengers who are, after all,
crossing our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column550" />Column number: 550</div>borders will include personal information such as
their date and place of birth, their address and the type of
information that would allow them to be checked against the watch list
of individuals who might pose a threat to the British
state.</div>
<a name="09022525000499"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7 pm</div>
<a name="09022525000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
information is that Trusted Borders, when asked, has given no public
information on progress. One might say that that is commercial in
confidence information and that it cannot really talk about it, but in
these days of an ever present threat of terrorism, we are talking about
a Government programme that has been announced and will allow for
better alerts at relevant border points where individuals who might
pose a threat to this country are identified, but we do not have a
clear indication of when the e-Borders programme will be up and
running. If the Minister, who has made some sensible proposals on the
information individuals will have to provide, wants our support for the
clause, he should also tell us where we are on the e-Borders
programme.</div><a name="09022525000353"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000602"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have been advised by the usual
channels&#151;I am merely a servant of the Committee&#151;that they
hope to make certain progress by the time of the Division on the Floor
of the House, which I understand will take place at about 20 minutes
past seven. I say that merely to concentrate the minds of Committee
members.</div>
<a name="09022525000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000603"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. Before I address the
specifics of the clause, I will give the hon. Member for Bury St.
Edmunds some of the information on the e-Borders programme that he
requested and that he and other Committee members might find useful. So
far, the &#163;1.2 billion e-Borders system has screened more than 78
million passengers travelling to and from the UK, leading to more than
2,700 arrests, including those of murderers, drug dealers and sex
offenders. Other interventions have resulted in the seizure of
improperly used British passports, the confiscation of drugs and the
refusal of leave to enter to a substantial number of foreign nationals.
E-Borders will screen against watch lists 60 per cent. of all passenger
and crew movements in and out of the UK by December 2009, rising to 95
per cent. by December 2010 and 100 per cent. by March 2014. That
answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific question about the
progress of the e-Borders programme, and I hope that that is of help to
him and the Committee.</div>
<a name="09022525000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
hon. Gentleman for his support for what I think is a reasonable change
to the powers that customs officers have. Clause 73 supplements the
existing customs powers available to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs and the UK Border Agency in relation to people arriving in the
UK, which, broadly speaking, are currently limited to questioning
travellers about their goods and baggage. Customs checks are no longer
random, but risk-based and intelligence-led. Customs officers and UKBA
officers need first to establish whether the person in front of them is
the person they are looking for or, if they are at a busy airport,
whether they have arrived on a high-risk flight that they are
targeting. For that purpose, the clause gives customs officers powers
to require the people to produce identity and travel documents and ask
questions of passengers about their journey. That will enable officers
to decide whether to proceed with further checks, such as examination
of baggage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column551" />Column number: 551</div><a name="09022525000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
that important alignment of powers between Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs officers and those of the UK Border Agency will make a
significant difference, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his support.
This is one of those measures that, on reading it, I asked,
&#147;Can&#146;t they do this already?&#148; It is a sensible
measure, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman supports it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000606"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Member for Hornchurch and I deserve to
exchange wry smiles, I think. We have been trying to sort this problem
out between ourselves for quite a while. The provision arises from
samurai swords as much as from anything else, but we are getting
there.</div><a name="09022525000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
77, with the amendments made in part 10 of schedule 6, separates out
the importation consequences of specifying a weapon in an order under
section 141 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 from the consequences that
flow under section 141(1) on sale, hire and so on. In doing so, the
clause provides clarity on the powers of the Scottish and UK
Governments to ban offensive weapons and facilitates the development of
a common border control north and south of the border to support our
drive to tackle knife crime.</div>
<a name="09022525000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
311 and 314 set out exceptions to the prohibition on importation of
offensive weapons, rather than defences to specific offences, as is
currently the case. That means that the exceptions can be relied on in
proceedings for any criminal offence, as well as in forfeiture
proceedings under the Customs and Excise Management Act
1979.</div><a name="09022525000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
315 and 316 amend the transitional provision in clause 77. The
transitional provision applies where the date of importation cannot be
established beyond reasonable doubt and where that would prevent a
person from being convicted. The amendments widen the transitional
provision to apply to any offence under the Customs and Excise
Management Act rather than to specified importation offences.</div>
<a name="09022525000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
328 to 333 and 337 to 342 amend Scottish legislation on offensive
weapon bans and ensure that defences for the purposes of film, TV and
theatre can apply to the offences of sale, manufacture and so on of
offensive weapons in Scotland. Such defences are already available in
England and Wales. I hope&#151;the hon. Member for Hornchurch will
understand this&#151;that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column552" />Column number: 552</div>this is the last time that I will have to move an amendment on the
matter before this Committee or indeed the

Government amendment
317.</div><a name="09022525000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000610"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Given your indication, Sir Nicholas, in terms
of time and the impending division, I will be brief. However, in the
short time I have been in this House it has been interesting to note
how these minor inconsequential amendments provisions have grown,
seeming to cede more authority to the Government to deal in secondary
legislation with matters previously dealt with in primary legislation.
With your leave, Sir Nicholas, I will combine my stand part comments to
save time. Look at subsection (3) where</div>
<a name="09022525000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Secretary
of State may by order make such supplementary...provision...for
the general purposes, or any particular purpose, of this Act or in
consequence of any provision made by or under this
Act&#148;.</div><a name="09022525000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is extremely wide in its ambit and drafting and seems to give a broad
swathe of additional powers and authority to the Government to make
subsequent orders 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column554" />Column number: 554</div>that may be important and significant by way of order-making power,
rather than dealing with it by way of primary legislation, allowing a
full and proper debate on the merits or otherwise of those
provisions.</div>
<a name="09022525000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds
seeks to delete subsections (7) and (8). Those subsections provide that
the negative resolution mechanism will apply in circumstances where the
repeal, amendment or change does not apply to a public general Act.
There may well be other statutory instruments approved by affirmative
resolution that may then be captured and changed by virtue of these
provisions, such that they are being amended, and on the basis of this
language they would suddenly become subject to the negative resolution
process. It is this mission creep in respect of these clauses that
seems to extend the additional powers, moving not simply into statutory
instrument territory but also into the negative resolution approach.
That is what I object to in the way these matters have been
progressing, even over the past few years. I would urge the Minister to
consider this provision more carefully in the way it has been drafted
and the powers that seem to be ceded because on its current terms I do
not think it is
acceptable.</div><a name="09022525000382"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022525000611"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for seeking
to clarify this measure because it has prompted a Government amendment
to seek to do precisely that.</div>
<a name="09022525000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may
speak first to Government amendment 317 which is a minor technical
amendment intended to clarify clause 86 (7). Subsection (7) states that
the affirmative resolution procedure is not required for an order made
under this clause that does not amend or repeal a provision of a public
general Act. The amendment is intended to make clear that an order does
not amend or repeal a provision of a public general Act as described in
subsection (7) if the provisions being amended or repealed were
inserted by a local Act or any other Act that is not a public general
Act. Indeed, such an order would be subject to the negative resolution
procedure. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment 343, on the other
hand, seeks to make all orders made under clause 86 subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure. We believe that the affirmative
resolution procedure is necessary for those orders that amend or repeal
public general Acts, a point made by the hon. Gentleman, but it is not
necessary for all orders made under clause 86 to be subject to that
procedure. For example, the order-making power could in theory be used
to replace references in secondary legislation to the Independent
Barring Board with references to the Independent Safeguarding Authority
should clause 62 come into force. We consider that such amendments
would not warrant the use of the affirmative resolution procedure.
Indeed, the clause is in line with provisions in other Acts of
Parliament. For example, similar provisions were made in section 148 of
the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 and section 75
of the Charities Act
2006.</div><a name="09022525000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw amendment 343. I invite the
Committee to support amendment
317.</div><a name="09022525000500"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15
