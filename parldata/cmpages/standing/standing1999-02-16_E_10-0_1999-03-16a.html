<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry, sends his apologies for not being in Committee. Unfortunately, he is in hospital for tests. He would much prefer to be here rather than there, but I am sure that members of the Committee wish him a speedy recovery and return.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. We should like to be associated with the hon. Gentleman's remarks. We hold the Minister of State in considerable affection and recognise his expertise in employment relations. We also recognise some of the difficulties that his absence is bound to impose on the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry whose duty it will be to handle our discussions. We are not insensitive to such matter, but we are most anxious to debate the Bill as the Minister of State would wish us to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey (Eastleigh):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. We add our good wishes for the Minister of State's speedy recovery. He must be disappointed not to be here to argue the points in which he so valiantly believes. We shall miss him and hope that he will be back with us soon.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We shall miss the Minister's sense of humour, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce (South Dorset):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I do not want to interrupt the heartfelt concerns that are being expressed for the Minister of State's return to Committee, but do the Government intend to introduce some draft regulations? Yesterday, I was sent a press release that was issued by the Department of Trade and Industry on 25 September 1998 when the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) was Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. It listed the matters that were to be covered by clause 28. However, those matters are not set out in the Bill. Moreover, the press release stated that draft regulations and a consultation paper would be issued later in 1998, on which the industry could comment. Apparently, each time that the industry has asked for it, it has not been forthcoming. Do you know whether it will be made available to the Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but it is not a matter for the Chair. No doubt the Minister has heard what he said.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Collective bargaining: recognition</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Clause 1 is a paving clause; it gives effect to schedule 1. It is now appropriate to refer to the schedule as it will contain procedures for union recognition and derecognition. It is a central part of the Bill. We gave a commitment in our election manifesto to enable unions to be recognised if that was what the majority of the work force wanted. The clause and the schedule will implement that commitment. It is one of the main planks of the Bill that, along with the national minimum wage, working-time regulations and family-friendly policies, will form the framework of decent and fair minimum standards at work. We are committed to introducing those measures.
<P>
We are also committed, in a spirit of co-operation and partnership, to making such measures as practical and workable as possible. It may help the Committee if I explain the reasons behind the Government's amendments to schedule 1. We have been consulting more or less continuously on fairness at work since May 1997. Employers' organisations, trade unions, other organisations, individual employers and workers, academics, lawyers and countless others have bombarded us with advice and opinions, in letters and notes, and at many meetings with officials and Ministers. We were also privileged to receive numerous comments from the media. That flood of welcome, but often contradictory advice, began immediately after the election, and has continued in waves ever since. Fresh waves resulted from the publication of the White paper and of the Bill.
<P>
We listened to all those representations and considered them carefully. That is still going on and as a result, we are constantly refining our proposals. To introduce some Japanese into the proceedings rather than Latin, it is kaizen&#151;a process of continuous improvement. In that spirit, I emphasise that all constructive suggestions made by the Committee will be as welcome as those from any other source. We shall carefully consider any suggestions that are made today and at subsequent sittings.
<P>
Most of the Government's amendments to schedule 1 make technical improvements. They correct defects and omissions, or clarify and strengthen the drafting. Some have been made in response to suggestions that were made after the Bill was published. I shall explain all the amendments. However, we have revised the flow charts that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) originally suggested, and which I believe he has found helpful. Those revisions will reflect the changes that will be made to Part I of schedule 1. We have produced a version of the schedule that shows the effect of the Government's amendments. I stress that it is an unofficial document: we must continue to work from the Bill and the amendments. Nevertheless I hope that hon. Members will find it helpful to see the effect of the amendments in a single document.
<P>
I recognise that schedule 1 is complex, but we were governed by our experience of previous employment relations legislation. The provisions of the Employment Protection Act 1975 were pithy. They dealt with trade union recognition in six sections and in slightly less than six pages, although Bills in those days were printed in a smaller format. Unfortunately, that Bill was problematic for several reasons, not least because of its very pithiness. A major shortcoming was its lack of detailed criteria and procedures for making decisions.
<P>
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, which was charged with applying the legislation, constantly faced judicial review of its decisions, which were taken in the absence of clear guidance from the law and from legislators. We are determined not to let that happen again. Our proposals are therefore very different from those of the 1975 Act. They are also more comprehensive, because we want the law to be precise and complete. We want to give clear guidance to employers, trade unions, workers and the Central Arbitration Committee on every aspect of what the law requires and allows. It is a complex subject, and we have had to encompass a wide variety of situations and permutations. Inevitably, therefore, the schedule is complex. I make no apology for it, but it is important that the Committee understands why.
<P>
Fortunately, most people do not need to read the law; that penance is inflicted chiefly on parliamentarians, lawyers and civil servants, and we are all remunerated for it. [Interruption.] I hasten to add that we are remunerated as parliamentarians. My Department will issue plain English guidance on the law and we are making a great effort to ensure that the guidance is clear, helpful and user-friendly. I hope that the explanatory memorandum sets a good precedent. The CAC, which will play a fundamental part in implementing the Bill, will be available to help the different parties to applications through the procedures. The inevitable complexity involved in making the law precise and comprehensive need not trouble the end user.
<P>
I am grateful to you, Mr. Atkinson, for allowing me to make those general introductory comments before I deal with the detail of clause 1 and schedule 1. I hope that they will help the Committee understand the Government's intentions.
<P>
I hope that any doubts that Opposition Members may have had about the need for the Bill have been removed by several recent cases in which employers who have resisted recognition, perhaps for many years, and have been involved in troublesome disputes as a result, have begun to see the light. It is especially heartening that the Bill is having a positive effect even before it has become law. In the past few months, some long-running disputes over union recognition have been resolved by the application of the principles embedded in the clause and schedule 1.
<P>
At least one employer agreed to a ballot, which showed clear majority support for trade union recognition. The employer therefore accepted that the union should be recognised. Others have dropped their opposition to unions in the face of clear evidence that most workers in a bargaining unit wanted their union to represent them. That is doubly encouraging. First, it shows how a statutory procedure can help resolve disputes. Such a demonstration that legislation is workable before it has reached the statute book must be rare, but we welcome it. Secondly, it shows that most employers faced with clear evidence of their workers' wishes will agree to bargain with unions. That is the essence of the Bill. It reinforces the Government's view that few cases will need to be pursued all the way through the procedures specified in the schedule. Only the most recalcitrant employer or trade union will fail to reach agreement on one of the many occasions that the schedule offers.
<P>
Voluntary agreements are the best way to build partnerships between workers and employers. They have worked well for about 90 per cent. of the 50 largest United Kingdom companies that choose to recognise trade unions.
<P>
Opposition Members may say that employers should not be forced to recognise trade unions. I doubt whether they would say that&#151;indeed, I am not sure that they will&#151;if they genuinely knew what it was like to work for a bad employer. Employers and trade unions have changed a great deal since the 1970s, and for that reason alone, I do not accept that the Bill will damage industrial relations. If the Opposition persist in the view that it will, that will show that they do not listen to the thousands of employers who have increasingly successful partnerships with their employees and trade unions.
<P>
I was interested to read what Mr. Noon said after his company had reached an agreement to recognise the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union. According to that well-known supporter of trade unions, the Daily Mail of 4 March:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Asked if he feared the kind of industrial unrest which typified the heyday of union might in the late 60's and 70's, he replied: `Why should there be such problems? I am very pleased with this partnership.'''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Employers and employees already work in partnership; they depend on each other. We have wide agreement on both sides of the Committee about that. We have designed the recognition procedure as a way of encouraging partners to talk to each other. The ultimate sanction is, therefore, not an imposed agreement on terms and conditions, which might produce a momentary benefit for employees but would do nothing for the long-term relationship in the workplace. Rather, the ultimate sanction is a duty to meet and to try to negotiate.
<P>
The principle behind statutory recognition is simple. If a majority of workers want to be represented by a trade union in collective bargaining, they should have the right to be so represented. According to Mr. Noon in the Daily Mail:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Once we became aware that the majority of our workforce were GMB members we decided there should be recognition. That is democracy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The majority of employers honour the wishes of their workers in that way, but a significant minority do not. We prefer voluntary agreements to imposed settlements. The procedure for recognition reflects that, by allowing time for agreement at every stage. The flow charts in the explanatory notes make that very clear.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I turn now to those firms to which statutory recognition will not apply&#151;those with fewer than 21 workers. Opposition Members may say that that threshold is too low; some of my hon. Friends may think it too high. The Government recognise that small firms may be different in that they are often managed on a personal basis and collective bargaining may be inappropriate. However, some small firms below the threshold already recognise unions voluntarily, and I am sure that they will continue to do so. As my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House said when introducing the White Paper ``Fairness at Work'', we will review that limit if it is not working satisfactorily.
<P>
Another detail of the legislation that has excited some comment is the matter of what is reasonable support. The CAC will not accept applications unless they have reasonable support, which we have defined as having at least 10 per cent. of the proposed bargaining unit in membership and as being more likely than not to gain majority support for recognition. That will rule out frivolous applications. We have also included detailed rules to deal with competing applications and to prevent the CAC from having to decide between rival unions.
<P>
In the past, one of the most difficult issues has been the determination of the appropriate bargaining unit for recognition. Given the almost infinite variety of situations in the workplace and their changing nature, it is impossible to lay down detailed rules and the CAC will have to exercise discretion. We shall give it the clearest possible guidelines to help it exercise that discretion. The overriding criterion is the need for the unit to be compatible with effective management. That is the modern definition of recognition; it is tailored for single status, single-table bargaining workplaces, if that is what the employer wants. There will be no return to fragmentation and the damaging demarcation disputes of the past.
<P>
Of course, we recognise that bargaining units may change as the result of mergers and acquisitions, divestments, diversifications and other changes and we have made detailed provision for that.
<P>
On recognition ballots, recognition will generally rely on a majority vote, with at least 40 per cent. of affected workers having to be in favour. When more than half the workers are union members, recognition can occur without a ballot on the basis that union membership usually indicates a wish for the union to conduct collective bargaining on behalf of its members. However, the CAC can hold a ballot if there is good reason to doubt whether the majority of the work force wish the union to bargain on their behalf.
<P>
When a union is recognised, whether voluntarily or through the statutory process, a bargaining procedure must be established. I am confident that, in most cases, when the bargaining unit has been settled and support for recognition has been demonstrated, the parties will just get on with it and reach agreement on a recognition procedure, perhaps with the benefit of ACAS's experience and assitance. If that does not happen, either the employer or the trade union can apply under schedule 1 to the CAC for assistance in establishing a bargaining method.
<P>
If the CAC has to impose a bargaining procedure because the parties cannot agree, it will be legally binding. However, it will be a procedure for holding talks only; the parties will not be required to reach agreement for the simple reason that people cannot be forced to agree. Derecognition will follow a broadly similar procedure. Employers will continue to have the right to derecognise voluntary recognised unions at any time.
<P>
Unions recognised by the statutory procedure will be protected against derecognition for three years. After that, if workers or the employer apply to the CAC and workers vote in favour of the move, recognition will end. If a union has been recognised automatically by having more than 50 per cent. membership, it is easier to trigger a derecognition ballot than if the union has been recognised via a ballot. In both cases, the criteria for derecognition are the same&#151;a majority and at least 40 per cent. of the bargaining unit must support derecognition.
<P>
There is a special procedure for derecognition of non-independent unions that are controlled or liable to control by employers. The aim is to ensure that an employer cannot frustrate the wishes of his work force by recognising a non-independent trade union, a so-called sweetheart union.
<P>
If workers are happy to be represented by a union without a certificate of independence, there is no problem. An employer is free to recognise such a union voluntarily, and no other union can apply for recognition in respect of those workers. If workers are not happy with a non-independent union, they will be able to have it derecognised. A different, independent trade union can then apply for recognition if it has the support of the workers. That is a carefully balanced provision, which avoids inter-union disputes and unjustified disruption of existing arrangements, but ensures that workers can be represented by the union of their choice.
<P>
For recognition and derecognition to be effective, workers must be able to take a stance without fear of being treated badly by their employers as a result. Part IV of the schedule provides protection against detriment or dismissal resulting from taking part or refusing to take part in a campaign for recognition or derecognition.
<P>
We are confident that we have set out a workable scheme for union recognition and derecognition in schedule 1, but we realise that it may need some fine tuning in practice. We will review the working of the legislation, and we have included powers&#151;I draw the Committee's attention to them&#151;to enable us to amend the 21-employee threshold and the 40 per cent. ballot majority requirement if either proves not to work satisfactorily.
<P>
For the same reason, we have provided that the CAC can tell the Secretary of State if it thinks that automatic recognition is having an unsatisfactory effect. The Secretary of State will then be able to amend the automatic recognition procedure, and to issue guidance to the CAC on how automatic recognition should work. The Secretary of State can also specify a model method for collective bargaining to be adapted by the CAC to meet particular circumstances. We envisage a code of practice, possibly drawn up by ACAS, on trade unions' access to employees during recognition campaigns.
<P>
We propose that, in applying the rules on recognition, the CAC should have a duty to promote fair and efficient practices and arrangements in the workplace. That sums up exactly what the Government seek to promote in the Bill and throughout our approach to labour market issues: fairness and efficiency. We believe that treating people fairly is right in itself, but we also believe that it is good for employees' commitment, morale and productivity&#151;therefore, it is good for businesses.
<P>
I believe wholeheartedly in the proposals, which provide a better way to deal with union representation disputes. They will defuse conflict and avoid industrial action&#151;as I said, they have already begun to achieve that. The key to better relationships between workers and employers, to better morale and to greater profitability is to respect workers' wishes&#151;that is what recognition is about. The schedule stands for partnership, not conflict. I therefore commend clause 1 to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the Minister spoke, the words of a well-known hymn came to my mind:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This seems to be the opportunity for the Minister to establish his labour movement credentials, and possibly to earn the ministerial salary to which he is currently not entitled. We shall decide whether to pay him by the hour or by results, according to developments in the day.
<P>
The Minister made a good show of exuding, with what I have described as his characteristic bedside manner, an atmosphere of calm rationality and principle behind the proposals. He probably did that as well as he could have done. Nevertheless, the procedural confusions on the construction of the Bill are symptomatic of wider differences to which I shall draw the Committee's attention.
<P>
It is a remarkable fact, one for which I do not quite recall a precedent in a mere dozen years of being a parliamentarian, that the Government, having reordered their Bill twice to suit themselves, have now produced two very substantial amendments to schedule 1, which is almost a Bill in itself, and a large number of additional amendments. Those have been justified to the Committee on the grounds of continuous improvement&#151;along Japanese lines. If the Minister wants to introduce kaizen as a desirable concept&#151;I have no difficulty with that&#151;I remind him, too, of the kanban principle, which the Minister has also embraced, just in time.
<P>
The amendments arrived dripping&#151;and in one case misprinted&#151;from the printers at the last minute. The Government have done very well out of the exercise, as they have provided no opportunity for any reasonable person to table amendments to their amendments.
<P>
The Minister's ideas of continuous consultation fall apart. It is necessary to consult and to improve products continuously, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) would concede, there comes a moment when it is necessary to decide on the Rover 75&#151;or any other car&#151;and get it into production. It is no good selling it in kit form and saying that it is finished and ready for the road. Although it is easy to make cheap jokes&#151;it would be easy in return for the Minister to say that we are not encouraging him to get the Bill right&#151;this is an extraordinary way of proceeding. The Government are fond of talking about joined-up government between Departments, but we are seeing the deconstruction of the Minister's own Department into a dysfunctional state. We are faced with a Bill, a schedule, which is longer than the clauses of the Bill, amendments to the schedule, which are a result of the Government's second thoughts, and a promised debate&#151;the most important of which is the debate.
<P>
I do not find it difficult to agree with what the Minister said about the importance of partnership between the two sides of industry. The issue between us is how best to promote that partnership, and the Minister's analysis of what has happened so far is revealing. He referred to the Employment Protection Act 1975 and conceded in terms that were almost as blunt as those that I used last year when we debated the matter for the first time on an Opposition day, that the 1975 Act was not a great success. His reason for saying that was that it was too simple, dealt with only the overriding principles and left the whole job to ACAS. Every time that something went to ACAS, it found that some malicious persons were trying to trip up the process by going to a judicial review.
<P>
Members of the Committee, including yourself, Mr. Atkinson, will remember last year's deliberations on the Minimum Wage Bill and will be aware that at least one member of my family is something of a judicial review buff&#151;a wonderful trait. The difficulty with this Bill is that, the longer it gets, the more it attempts to deal with every last jot and tittle, unlike the 1975 Act, and unlike the less objective-oriented and less communautaire approach, which is the traditional British approach to legislation. The more details that there are, the more opportunities there will be to subvert the Minister's admirable intentions by throwing legal sticks in the spokes of the wheel. That is my major concern. While I agree with the Minister that partnership at the workplace is desirable&#151;we are not arguing about that&#151;the question is whether the statutory underpinning will facilitate or undermine that. Our concern is that it will be the latter. I say that without prejudice to any side of industry because, as I said earlier, there are good as well as bad employers and constructive as well as less constructive trade unions.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Whether or not we like or commend it&#151;I do not&#151;some employers will, for reasons that may or may not be justified, take a view about the recognition of trade unions. Some employers may not want trade unions at any price, even if it were in their interests to accept them. It is a little like the right to roam: it may be irrational, unnecessary or self-defeating of landowners to try to force people off their property but if that is what they want to do, it is difficult to take that right away. Hon. Members may think that by drawing that analogy I am setting up an Aunt Sally that employers employ people in the way that landowners own property. Of course I am not saying that; I am saying that people may have proprietorial rights to a firm and not want at any price&#151;for all the Minister's talk about partnership&#151;to involve trade unions. If legislation invites them to do so, they may seek to subvert it. Whether there were six clauses of 60 pages of detail, those employers would find ways of challenging the legislation. Conservatives do not believe that coercive partnerships are effective; partnerships should be of mutual consent and interest.
<P>
In discussing the detailed amendments and provisions, we should bear two considerations in mind. First, concern has been expressed by engineering employers, the Confederation of British Industry and others that the provisions for voluntary agreements may go wider than intended; voluntary agreements that were not made with those provisions in mind may also be swept up and need negotiation before they can be accepted. There is a case for such agreements to be validated under the new procedure and not automatically treated as binding.
<P>
The second concern is on enforcement. However hard one looks at the issue or argues for recognition, or however much the CAC deliberates on the matter and encourages collective bargaining rights, the Bill cannot force&#151;if I have overlooked something, doubtless the Minister will enlighten me&#151;employers to carry out collective bargaining constructively. Employers may be forced, after much legal argy-bargy and a considerable dislocation in industrial relations, to concede the principle, but if they then metaphorically sit there with their arms folded, it is not clear how that would achieve the Minister's objective&#151;with which I am sympathetic&#151;of finding a reasonable solution that represents the interest of the parties involved. A horse can be taken to water but cannot be made to drink.
<P>
In summary, we are concerned that&#151;even as we speak&#151;the Bill is being thrown together and amended. Barrack-room lawyers and industrial relations experts will home in on the opportunity that it provides. It may also send a signal for coercive partnership, which is different from ``partnership'' partnership.
<P>
We tabled the amendment to delete clause 1 when we thought that schedule 1 would be taken with that clause at the beginning of our consideration of the Bill. That was before the extraordinary events of the past week, and I now invite my hon. Friends to join me in opposing our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> We come to the heart of the Bill&#151;clause 1, schedule 1 and the controversial subject of trade union recognition.
<P>
I broadly welcome the Minister's opening remarks. I recognise his aspirations, but the test will be whether they can be turned into a working reality that does not create further division in the workplace. We need to find out how that process is intended to work, what the roles of ACAS and the CAC will be, and how we will ensure that we establish and keep good relations between employers, unions and employees.
<P>
The flow chart that has been produced helps to set out the framework into which the schedule is intended to fit. It brings into focus some of the difficulties of imposing trade union recognition by regulation and formula. I am sure that the Minister will accept that we must draw on the experience of ACAS. In 30 years of negotiating trade union recognition, it has found that establishing recognition is a more complex process than merely applying a simple formula, or determining how a democratic vote by a group of workers from a union or competing unions can define a satisfactory relationship in terms of collective bargaining.
<P>
We must be sure that the Bill sets out a robust framework that takes into account a company's character and management structure, and the skills of specific members of the work force. Although we are talking mainly about compulsory recognition procedures, it is equally important that the Bill allows proper freedom for voluntary recognition of unions. We must ensure that all workers can and do work in a climate in which they may be represented by a union should they so wish. That is a fundamental individual right that I want to see the Bill not only enshrine but put into legislative practice.
<P>
I know that we shall return to many of those issues as we debate schedule 1, so I shall not dwell on them now. However, it is important that we keep our minds focused on the objective.
<P>
I do not think that the impact of the fluctuation of popularity and membership of unions in certain companies has been mentioned in detail. We have all recognised over the past decade that there have been massive changes in the workplace&#151;many large national firms have shrunk dramatically. The mergers and acquisitions that the Minister mentioned may have an impact on the structure of union memberships in some work forces. Union officials have told me that union membership in certain work forces is down from several hundred members to a handful. That changes the concept of how such unions can operate satisfactorily in the interest of their members. We have to recognise that the causes of such changes are not only mergers and acquisitions, but large-scale redundancies and recruitment to new companies.
<P>
We also have to recognise the impact of unions merging, as they have done in recent years when union membership has declined. How will that issue be handled in the context of continuing recognition of unions and their right to undertake collective bargaining?
<P>
I was interested in the Minister's comments on the continuous consultation process, but I say that with a wry smile. It is only now that we see the fruit of that continuous negotiation&#151;the Government amendments. I am a great believer in continuous improvement, but I do not think that this is a matter of being just in time; it might be a matter of being just too late. We have not had much time to look at the meat of the 150 amendments that the Government have tabled, but the Committee will debate them this morning. I welcome the Government's open attitude, but I suspect that the Committee will have little time to follow the due process of forensic examination. I hope that we will return to such matters later, perhaps on Report.
<P>
The unofficial schedule is a great help, and I welcome that initiative by the Government. However, these matters are still complex, as the Minister will acknowledge. As he said in his opening remarks, the lack of detailed criteria in previous legislation on union recognition made life difficult. Therefore, I welcome further detail so long as we can develop it to ensure that it is clear, robust and not open to different interpretations and, therefore, legal challenge in the courts. One of the dangers of detail is that it can be open to different interpretation. That was one of the failings of the previous legislation.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's acceptance that the Bill might benefit from further amendment. Perhaps he can inform us better as the debate continues, especially about the reports in today's press that the Prime Minister has appointed a Cabinet Minister from the other place to oversee amendments to the Bill. The Prime Minister has apparently done so because he is concerned that the new regulations will affect the competitiveness of British industry and that the Government's business-friendly image may be tarnished. I wonder whether we in Committee are amending the Bill or whether someone else is. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I know that we have a lot to get through today, but I should like to address some of the important issues that have been raised, because doing so may inform today's debates.
<P>
Unfortunately, the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) is not in his seat. I wanted to reassure him about the draft regulations about which he is so concerned. He will no doubt be delighted to hear that they are in an advanced state of preparation and that they will be published for consultation shortly.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised the issue of coercion. His desire is that no coercive procedures should be adopted. However, what is right for employers is also right for employees. The essence of the Bill is that a trade union should be recognised if the majority of the work force wants that to happen. To prevent that from happening would be coercive.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) mentioned his desire to ensure proper freedom for voluntary recognition. Of course, we share that desire. Voluntary arrangements are currently the main route to union recognition. We welcome the fact that that will continue to be so, and the procedures that we are introducing will deal with the circumstances in which that is not the case.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh also mentioned the story in this morning's Financial Times. I thought that that story would surface sooner or later. I shall set the record straight. I think Mark Twain said that a lie is half way around the world before the truth has had a chance to get its boots on. Wonderful newspaper that the Financial Times is, I am afraid that that story is untrue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Pearson </B>(Dudley, South): Does my hon. Friend agree that one story in the Financial Times that is true is that small businesses are 5.7 per cent. better off as a result of the Budget?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is clear that, on the Government's side of the Committee, deconstruction is beginning to apply to their support for the clause. To balance the ticket and before we debate the meat of the amendments, I remind the Committee that I find myself in the position of an American President who was described by one of his predecessors as being unable to walk and chew gum at the same time. I shall do my best to ensure that I associate the right amendment with the right speaking notes. However, the matter is complex and it may be difficult for all members of the Committee to get it right. Avid students of our Committee's papers will notice a certain variation in the timing of some of our amendments, which suggests not only that the amendments were considered at different times, but, as wine buffs would say, they have a different provenance and have been added to embellish points.
<P>
Amendments No. 3 is one of the old faithfuls that is associated with some of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady). It is about the number of trade unions that can seek recognition. It is a probing amendment, but it recognises our abiding concern with some of the less successful aspects of British industrial relations that we are anxious not to make worse. I am talking about the multiple situation of unions and the so-called recognition disputes between them that scarred the industrial relations world until the reforms of the 1980s.
<P>
It is easy to be tidy minded, and the Minister will recall that those who administered Germany after 1945 wisely prescribed one industrial union for all employees in each major industry. Sixteen unions span the whole of German industry, of which the largest is IG Metall, which is busy ratcheting up the pay of its workers. We need not go into that now, however, nor need we puruse an ideal world in which unions in the United Kingdom are rationalised into that structure. I am well aware of the tradition whereby trade unions work together and of the arrangements under the Bridlington agreement not to poach each other's employees or to create aggravation for each other.
<P>
Behind the amendment was the concern that there might be difficulties from time to time, with unions competing over the same patch. The Financial Times has already been mentioned. I have not pursued the details of yesterday's story, but I understand that one of the staff unions of British Airways invited the Amalgamated Electrical and Engineering Union to represent its members at a time when most of the cabin crew and other support staff were members of the Transport and General Workers Union. That was alleged to have triggered at least the potential for trouble.
<P>
I do not want to comment on the particular issue, but members of the Committee who are active in unions will know that from time to time such tensions arise. The amendment would make sure that such problems did not spill over into the statutory recognition procedure. On reading the small print in the schedule, it becomes clear that there is to be a single request for recognition. That request may involve more than one union, but the logic of the position is that the application will be made by the unions together in the same form. What will happen if more than one request is made simultaneously in different forms? I doubt whether the Minister wants to dissent from the principle of having as much clarity as possible between the two sides of industry or from his commitment to produce the simplest practicable structure. Ideally, the application should be made together, either by one union or by a consortium of unions, representing all workers. We do not want employers&#151;especially the smaller and less sophisticated of them&#151;to be tearing their hair because they have to deal with parallel applications that are not entirely in sympathy or harmony with each other. They should not have to face unions that cannot agree among themselves about who should make the application. The amendment is intended to explore the position and to get the Minister's assurances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's apparent enthusiasm for the German social model, but I do not think that it is strictly relevant to this Committee.
<P>
The amendments would prevent two unions, each of which had 30 per cent. of the membership in the work force, from applying jointly for recognition. I appreciate the probing nature of the amendments, but the proposal would not promote good industrial relations. Deciding which union should apply for recognition would cause conflict in the short term and in the long term would put pressure on all employees to join one union, rather than the union of their choice, which is an option that we want to keep open.
<P>
On the specific points, I can reassure the Committee that paragraph 27 of the schedule requires unions making a joint application to show that they will co-operate with each other and, if the employer wishes, conduct single-table bargaining. If they cannot satisfy the CAC of their co-operation, the application will automatically be rejected. Recognising two or more unions should not make negotiations more difficult for the employer.
<P>
The fundamental point remains that if a majority of workers want it, they should have the right to ask union representatives to conduct collective bargaining on their behalf. We believe that workers should have that right if they wish to be represented by more than one union. It is democractic. For instance, if workers at a firm are represented by two unions&#151;A and B&#151; and each union is supported by 30 per cent. of the work force, either could apply for recognition, and either might succeed. It seems perverse to prevent a joint application being made by A and B, which together represent 60 per cent. of the work force, unless the unions can show that they will act together in collective bargaining.
<P>
It is possible that some workers will not wish to be represented by A and B together. If a significant number of union members oppose such an application, a ballot will be required. Recognition will not be automatic if union members do not want it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister say how the 10 per cent. test for balloting will apply to unions that want to act together? Are we talking about 10 per cent. of the membership of each union, or about 10 per cent. of the whole work force?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Workers should have the right to be represented by the union of their choice. That fundamental principle informs everything in the Bill. We are considering unions acting jointly on behalf of their members; it will therefore be a joint 10 per cent. threshold. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
If a significant number of union members oppose an application, a ballot will be required. There will be no automatic recognition if union members do not want it. The union members' wishes are the key. The ballot will test whether workers want to be represented by A and B together; it will not be assumed that members of A automatically support a joint bid for recognition by A and B.
<P>
As it stands, schedule 1 preserves the right of workers to choose a particular union. The amendments would force workers wanting union representation in collective bargaining to choose between their favoured union and the one most likely to win a recognition ballot. That is not likely to improve industrial relations; it could have the opposite effect. I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry has been persuaded to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for reminding us of the provisions made in a later part of the schedule. I hope that they will work satisfactorily. Is the Minister saying that the CAC will want to be sure that the unions involved have reached an understanding among themselves, and that, if collective bargaining is wanted by the employer, it will be conducted on a single-table basis?
<P>
I see the Minister nodding. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 20, line 22, after second `employer', insert `(or employers)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 6, in page 20, line 35, after `employer', insert `(or employers)'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendment deals with the converse of the situation that we considered under amendment No. 3. Although it may not be so, it seems that there may be more than one union but that there can only be one employer. I move the amendment to probe the Government on something that came to light during our debates on the National Minimum Wage Bill. Sometimes, more than one employer may co-exist simultaneously. Those persons will probably be associated, which is important in relation to paragraph 2(5); the amendment would provide that an employer could be taken to include an associated employer or employers. The context is slightly different, but it rehearses the point. I tabled the amendment to probe what would happen in the case of a worker employed by more than one person simultaneously, and to ensure that the Bill was sufficiently comprehensive to deal with such contingencies.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendments are probing. They would enable a union to apply for recognition to two or more employers simultaneously. That is not the Bill's intention. The Bill deals solely with relations between an individual employer and his or her employees. Experience shows that it is in such relations that disputes are most likely to arise.
<P>
To avoid confusion, I should explain that the provision in paragraph (5) that refers to ``associated employers'' bears only on whether an employer is regarded as being above the threshold, employing more than 20 workers. It does not allow a union to apply for recognition with a single application to all those employers. It merely prevents an employer from escaping recognition by splitting his work force into separate undertakings, each with no more than 20 employees.
<P>
Collective agreements between unions and employers' associations are increasingly rare. Typically, the agreements that still exist cover minimum conditions. Individual businesses in an organisation often offer better terms for some or all aspects of the package.
<P>
The Bill will not interfere with the ability of employers' associations and unions to reach recognition agreements if they so wish. However, as at present, they will be voluntary agreements, outside the statutory framework. The statutory framework will concentrate on relations between a single employer and his or her employees. That employer determines pay, hours, holidays and other aspects of the package.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am trying to follow the speeches of the Minister and of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry about how a trade union operates. Some explanation may help the Committee. The schedule states that a trade union shall seek recognition. It does not appear to make the link with people in the company who ask a trade union to seek recognition on their behalf. What is that mechanism? Will a trade union be able to tell an employer that it wants to recruit members in his or her area, and is applying to have a ballot? If so, what is effectively a recruitment letter will arrive from every union under the sun. Where is the link with people in the workplace who would like a trade union to ask for recognition? I have some difficulty in finding it in this massive schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> If I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, he makes a fundamental point with which we shall deal frequently during the remainder of our sitting. I shall continue to speak to amendments Nos. 4 and 6, and hope that, by the end of the day, he will be rather more enlightened than he is at present.
<P>
It would be a considerable complication to enable unions to apply for recognition to two or more employers simultaneously.
<P>
That was not envisaged by the CBI and the Trades Union Congress in their joint statement. I can think of no reason to make such a change, and I hope that, in the light of those explanations, the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 215, in page 20, line 25, leave out from `relating to' to end of line 29 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`pay, hours and holidays; but this has effect subject to sub-paragraph (8).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 5 in page 20, leave out lines 27 to 29 and Government amendments Nos. 216 to 219.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Government amendments Nos. 215 to 219, taken together, are designed to ensure that, as a minimum, collective bargaining covers negotiations about pay, hours and holiday. The union and employer can agree that other matters be included, but if they cannot agree, and the CAC imposes a bargaining method, it will apply only to pay, hours and holiday. The amendments ensure that the Bill achieves the policy set out in the White Paper. We tabled them because we realised that the original wording went wider than originally intended. The union and the employer are free to include other matters in the collective bargaining agreement&#151;that is a deliberate feature of the legislation, to encourage voluntary agreements by giving the parties room for manoeuvre. A union may wish to bargain about occupational pensions, for example. The employer may be prepared to agree to that, provided that the union accepts the employer's proposal on, say, time off for trade union duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister might save me having to make a speech later if he clarifies that point. One interpretation of occupational pensions is that they function as a sort of deferred pay and will therefore not come within the purview of the clause and the amendments. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We had hoped not to have to define pay; we would have preferred to leave it to the parties involved to decide for what aspects they were willing to bargain. However, we accept that there may be a case for defining pay in the Bill, for the purposes of the imposed procedures, and the hon. Gentleman will welcome the news that we may table an amendment to that effect on Report.
<P>
We are inclined to give the parties the maximum room to find compromises on their own. However, if they are unable to agree and the CAC has to impose a procedure, that procedure will be limited to pay, hours and holidays&#151;the core terms of employment. That is a minimalist selection, which both employer and union are likely to find restrictive. They will both therefore have an incentive to agree a different arrangement that suits them better. At every stage, the procedure encourages voluntary settlements. The amendments represent another simplification of the recognition procedure, and I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Patrick Hutber was the first City editor&#151;and one of the greatest&#151;of The Sunday Telegraph; he coined the law that improvement means deterioration. As the Minister made his case, it became more complex. Having said that he wanted the legislation to be as flexible as possible, he then had to say that ``pay'' had to be defined&#151;in a way that he cannot yet share with us&#151;or there would be further confusion and legal lacunae. That is the point that we have been seeking to make, but in the spirit of good will and because the Minister has set out the new Labour doctrine of minimalism&#151;a sort of cuisine minceur approach to industrial relations&#151;we will concede the matter, on the understanding that we may need to return to it, as he has promised to do.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall speak first to amendments Nos. 163 to 168, 172 to 178 and 181 to 182, which are all technical amendments, intended to clarify what tests apply before the CAC may regard as valid, or proceed with, an application.
<P>
The tests divide into two categories: tests of whether applications are valid, and further tests of whether they are admissible. The distinction is academic, as failure of any test means that the application will not proceed.
<P>
The crux of the amendments is a change of emphasis. Instead of putting the burden of proof sometimes on employers and sometimes on unions, the CAC, in deciding whether the tests are passed, will have to consider any evidence given by either party. We believe that the amendments make schedule 1 clearer, more straightforward, and more helpful to practitioners. I therefore urge hon. Members to accept them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that the Minister needs to speak to the other Government amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am sorry. With some relief, I thought that I had finished with many amendments rather rapidly, but I realise to my regret that I still have several of them to speak to.
<P>
I hope that we can quickly agree to make the purely technical amendments Nos. 169 and 170. The current text means that if union and employer agree that the union should be recognised, none of the rest of part I will apply. The amendments make the meaning explicit. If the numbering of the paragraphs changes, the amendments will maintain the purpose of the current text. I therefore commend the amendments to the reasonable and honourable Members of the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 171 is the core of a set of amendments&#151;Nos. 163 to 182&#151;that clarify the way in which preliminary tests affect applications to the CAC. It will insert three new paragraphs into part I. Proposed paragraph 10A will require the CAC to inform parties when an application is received, so that they know when to submit evidence as to whether tests are fulfilled. Proposed paragraph 10B will replace the old provision on competing applications with a new procedure that rejects all competing applications unless only one passes a 10 per cent. union membership test in the relevant bargaining unit.
<P>
I know that hon. Members may have concerns about the width of discretion given to the CAC, and I hope that making the procedure more specific will give them some comfort. The CAC should not decide between credible competing applications. We think that 10 per cent. union membership is a sufficient test of credibility at such a preliminary stage&#151;we are seeking only to eliminate spoiling applications.
<P>
Proposed paragraph 10C makes clear the preliminary tests&#151;apart from that in proposed paragraph 10B&#151;that the CAC will apply before it accepts and proceeds with an application. All the tests must be passed.
<P>
All those changes improve the clarity and function of the application procedure, and I hope that hon. Members will feel able to accept them.
<P>
Amendments (a) to (f) and Government amendment No. 171 would alter proposed paragraph 10B&#151;
<P>
I beg your pardon, Mr. Atkinson. In my enthusiasm, I have moved rapidly on in response to a speech that has not yet been made.

<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand the Minister's problem. It is a confusing selection list&#151;I am having difficulty sorting it out myself.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The purpose of amendments (a) to (f) is to insert a hurdle of 20 per cent. union membership for qualification. We will want to refer to the matter while debating other amendments. However, it is relevant at this point, as the amendments are grouped on the back of the Government's substantive amendment No. 171, which is pretty big for an amendment to their own Bill. At this stage, I recognise that there is no precise test and that the Minister's objective, which is commendable, is to prevent spoiling applications. I would have preferred the hurdle to be rather higher, and in responding to the various amendments, the Minister may wish to say more about that.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to turn now to amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10. Amendment No. 8 makes a substantial point, because it refers to a single bargaining unit, rather than the whole spectrum of employees, as the appropriate framework for the test. Differentiating the work force in that way would provide a higher and stiffer test. The Committee should decide whether it wants a single test to apply to the whole work force or more realistic tests to apply to those in a particular location or with a particular trade, craft or skill.
<P>
For convenience, I will deal next with amendment No. 10, which refers to the average number of workers and unpacks the issues stemming from that. It is difficult to know exactly how the schedule will work. Our concern is that an aberrant pattern of employment could be established and an employer could take on or lay off a high proportion of his employees on a short-term basis. We are talking about a weekly framework, though it remains to be decided whether that is appropriate.
<P>
The average number of employees turning out may not be a realistic measure of the work force. The average between having one foot in the freezer and the other foot in the oven is a conveniently equitable temperature, but that is a far from comfortable position to be in. The Minister might like to reflect on that.
<P>
Amendment No. 9 would impose a small business test or filter of 51 rather than 21 employees. I am saddened that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), to whom we all look for great sensitivity in industrial relations, has another commitment and is not present in Committee&#151;not least because of his undoubted knowledge of American labour legislation and of the concessions made available to small firms in that country by a centre-left Administration with a record&#151;dare I say it, a better record than that of the United Kingdom&#151;of some economic success.
<P>
To put it in English&#151;or Atlantic English if one prefers&#151;the basic test in America of a small firm is 50 employees or fewer. Obviously, the number of businesses with 50 employees is greater than the number with 20, just as the number with 20 is greater than the number operating under the microbusiness test of 10. Nevertheless, in terms of the total number, 50 would take the figure up to a substantial participation of the labour force and provide a better basis for exclusion from the recognition test. I recognise, as I must, that no figure has a precise validity and that deciding on a figure is always a matter of judgment.
<P>
Two points underlie our amendments, the first of which is that the Secretary of State is bent on taking powers to amend the figure by order. The Minister said that he could be willing to consider comments from the CAC about whether the 20-employee tests worked in practice. If they did not, he said that the Government would be prepared to alter the number by order. We favour starting with 50 employees and if the Secretary of State found, or the CAC so advised him, that 20 employees would be better, he could amend the figure to 20. To borrow the concept that the Minister introduced helpfully to the Committee, let us be minimalist at the start and, if necessary, include other people.
<P>
Another important element concerns the resources that are available to employers, especially in small businesses. The Minister knows that I employ one person. He has experience of small firms. When he was starting out, I doubt whether he had an elaborate human resources department or in-house lawyers to back him up. In some respects, all the better for that. Although it is important to have specialists, I do not believe that human resources should be treated as a separate structure from the overall commitment to good labour relations. However, we need not go into that philosophy.
<P>
An employer whose firm employs only 20 people will have to make sense of the Minister's redrafted schedule. The Minister says that the matter is for lawyers and that there will have to be heavy reliance on guidance notes. However, if an employer has 50 employees, there is a chance that a human relations specialist will have time to deal with such issues. Given the way in which the Bill has been launched and the fact that no guidance notes have been made available, to start with 20 employees will be a disaster.
<P>
If the Government started with 50 employees and, in the light of experience, reduced the number to 20, it would be intelligible. We should aim for the higher number of 50 and see how it goes. The amendments relate to the complicated criteria for recognition, and I appreciate that the Minister wants to make the provision as clear as possible. However, it is not clear and the hurdle is caused because the number of employees is too low. It should have been set higher. We may wish to press our amendment to a Division on that principle, but I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on the substance of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pearson:</B> Government amendment No. 171 would insert into the Bill the 10 per cent. test before we have even discussed in Committee the relevant provision under the heading of ``Union recognition''. As the hon. Member for Daventry said, given that those with small businesses will want to make sense of the schedule, it would be helpful if the Bill followed a logical structure. Amendment No. 171 would insert the 10 per cent. test on joint applications in the wrong place. The structure would not work well. Perhaps a minor drafting amendment can be introduced later.
<P>
I have some sympathy with what the hon. Member for Daventry said about small businesses struggling to come to terms with another 25 pages and 88 paragraphs of legislation. The minimalist approach is welcome, but we must get it right when defining the minimum requirements. That has not always been the case.
<P>
Will my hon. Friend the Minister clarify a couple of points? In a small business employing 22 people, three could be union members&#151;one from the GMB, one from the Transport and General Workers Union and one from the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. Those three could apply jointly for recognition, the 10 per cent. test would be passed and the employer would have to negotiate with three trade union officials, each with a union legal department, around a single table.
<P>
We should remember that small businesses do not have personnel departments, and that the entrepreneurs themselves will be involved. If we want to stimulate entrepreneurship, we should not create such a bureaucratic structure needlessly. I therefore welcome the Minister's saying that the CAC will see how the 21 limit works. That provision should not be cast in stone; it should be reviewed.
<P>
I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to say whether the 10 per cent. limit, too, could be subject to review&#151;and who should review it. Will he explain what evidence is needed of the 10 per cent. limit having been agreed? The CAC has decided whether a majority is likely to favour such recognition, but what indicators will it be looking for? How will it decide? The 10 per cent. threshold seems rather low.
<P>
If a firm with 21 employees had four sales staff, it would need only one of them to want a bargaining unit, with two trade union members of the work force, to pass the 10 per cent. test. The others might not be interested in having formalised union recognition procedures. However, there seems no way of presenting evidence of those views to the CAC to allow it to form a balanced judgment. I would welcome the Minister's comments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): If the hon. Member for Buckinghamshire were here, he would doubtless give us a list of the different definitions of small businesses. It is obviously a subjective opinion. We must recognise that many different types of companies have between 20 and 50 employees.
<P>
The most exploitative situations that I have seen were in small clothing and textile factories and in engineering factories with between 30 and 35 shop-floor workers, with a clear hierarchy between them and the manager. I remember particularly the Burdsall's dispute. Because small companies are not in the spotlight of publicity, exploitation is often greater. However, the same rules do not necessarily apply to a design studio with 35 employees in one of our major cities, which would have a mixed work force, different pay scales and many different people coming and going&#151;and the exploitation, if any, would be of a completely different order. For that reason, the Government are right to start with a cut-off of 20 employees, if necessary reviewing it upwards.
<P>
Clause 11 will give people the right to be accompanied and to be represented. It is open to a trade union in a company of fewer than 21 employees&#151;or, indeed, in a company of fewer than 50 employees&#151;to make representations on behalf of an employee up to 21 or 50 times. Knowing, as I do, the wily nature of many trade union officials, I expect that they will knock on the door not 21 times, but 50 times.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I thank my hon. Friends. I recognise the concern about small firms of my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson). I listened to what he had to say with great interest, having been a small employer myself. However, his concerns are slightly misplaced because the Bill already covers one of the scenarios that he mentioned. There will be a joint bargaining procedure. Dealing with three unions will be no more burdensome for a small employer in the particular circumstances that we have stipulated in the Bill than dealing with one union. I shall deal with the threshold in speaking to the amendments.
<P>
I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) for his extremely helpful contribution and his interesting insight into the nature of small firms.
<P>
I shall speak to the amendments more or less in the order in which they appear on the amendment paper. However, I shall begin with amendments (a) to (f) to Government amendment No. 171. This would alter proposed paragraph 10B, so that 20 per cent., rather than 10 per cent., union membership would be required for an application to be acceptable. Obviously, targets can be raised or lowered almost according to wish. We have chosen the 10 per cent. figure to match the test for sufficient support&#151;10 per cent. union membership and likely to win a ballot&#151;so the CAC will have to assess union membership only once for the two tests. That will be administratively convenient; it will streamline procedures and save time and effort.
<P>
We believe that 10 per cent. union membership is perfectly adequate as an initial test of the credibility of a union's application. There is no need to change that and, therefore, I hope that the Opposition will agree that their amendments to amendment No. 171 are unnecessary.
<P>
It might be helpful to set out the background to amendments Nos. 8, 9, 234, 10 and 235, which the Opposition have tabled. An employer controls the terms under which his or her workers are employed, subject to minimum standards of fairness and decency. Collective bargaining takes place when a union or other organisation represents those workers in negotiations.
<P>
If a single company owns or controls several employers, it is appropriate to allow a request for recognition that affects some or all of them. If the companies are genuinely different, the CAC will regard each a separate bargaining unit. Without the provision on associated employers, which would be removed under amendment No. 8, an unscrupulous employer could split his or her business into small units of 20 or fewer employees to avoid recognising a trade union. That would not be good for employers or conducive to good industrial relations.
<P>
	I turn to amendment No. 9, on the crucial matter of the threshold, which I accept has been a matter of concern to the hon. Member for Daventry and others. The cut-off below which statutory recognition will not apply has been a subject of much debate. I understand that some hon. Members want the cut-off to be increased; others want it to be removed, for the reasons mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth. I sympathise with the desire to treat all workers the same and to give them the same rights to trade union recognition. I understand, for reasons with which the Committee is familiar, the concern not to burden small businesses. However, bearing in mind those concerns, we believe that we have set the figure about right. The reason for having a cut-off at all is that employees in small firms are often managed on a personal as well as an individual basis. In some circumstances, requiring a collective bargaining agreement is not likely to be appropriate in that sort of small firm.
<P>
It is a matter of judgment where the cut-off should apply. Small firms are very varied, as my hon. Friend the member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth said. We have to use our judgment. We have applied the cut-off in this case, but we have made it clear that we will review it. If it appears that it is not working&#151;I respond in particular to the point of the hon. Member for Daventry&#151;we will review whether the level is too high or too low. Our aim throughout is good industrial relations.
<P>
A union can apply for recognition in a firm that employs at least 21 workers. Amendment No. 10 would require the 21 to be employed on the day of the request, rather than allowing that figure to be the average number of workers over the previous 13 weeks as well.
<P>
To have an average of 21 workers, the firm must employ 21 or more workers on some days. The average of 21 workers is, if anything, a harder test to meet than 21 workers on the day of the request. An application should not fail simply because it is handed in on the wrong day. That would be a technicality and a waste of everyone's time; it would defeat the spirit and object of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I want to come back to the Minister on a point that I do not intend to press later. Does the Minister concede that an average is a somewhat varied concept? One can be referring to the mean, the median or something else.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> The mode.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The mode, as the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth rightly reminds me. Equally, despite the Minister's undoubted good intentions, there may be an entirely aberrant form of employment that would make it impossible to come to a conclusion that is sensible and consistent with the facts when the application is made. That is our only concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am perfectly happy to accept what the hon. Gentleman says about statistics. Nevertheless, an average means that the number of employees will be 21 or more on any given day, which is a harder test to meet. We are trying to create a system that is practicable and meets the objectives of both employers and workers, as well as the spirit of the Bill. We believe that our proposal is the best way in which to do that. As I said, if an aberrant situation becomes sufficiently common that we think that a review is required, we will re-examine the cut-off, although I take the point that that relates to amendment No. 10 rather than to amendment No. 9.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 234 and 235 would limit recognition to bargaining units with 21 or more members. We believe that those amendments are technically deficient and would not achieve their aim, but I shall try to explain why their desired effect is not particularly desirable.
<P>
In general, bargaining units are likely to consist of 21 or more members, because in smaller companies the appropriate bargaining unit may be the whole work force, whereas large companies will tend to have large or larger bargaining units. Indeed, one of the criteria on which the CAC is to decide what bargaining units are appropriate is the undesirability of small and fragmented bargaining units.
<P>
The key issue is whether a firm is large enough to conduct collective bargaining effectively. Our judgment is that firms of 21 or more can be expected to deal consistently with a group or a few groups of workers. It may be perfectly reasonable for 15 delivery drivers to be treated separately from 25 production line workers. If a firm is capable of conducting collective bargaining for 25 production workers, it might well be capable of doing so for 15 drivers. If not, the CAC would be unlikely to decide that two separate bargaining units existed.
<P>
Furthermore, setting a cut-off in the size of the bargaining unit would cause endless squabbling about what was the appropriate unit. That would not be in the interests of good industrial relations because workers would inevitably suspect that the employer was trying to evade a quite reasonable application for recognition. Bearing in mind all that, as well as the Government's commitment to review the 21-worker cut-off to ensure that it meets the Government's overall objectives, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister sought to explain the Government's thinking in greater detail, which was the main objective of the amendment. However, I must advise him that for amendment No. 9, which would substitute 21 for 51, we feel disposed to call for a separate vote.
<P>
I will amplify my earlier remarks. The Minister has said that the figure is flexible, which is all very well. I accept his good intentions and appreciate that he is prepared to review the figure in the light of experience. However, in practical terms&#151;I say this in his interests&#151;there is a strong argument for initially aiming for a high hurdle and, if in practice it proves inappropriate, reducing it. There are two reasons for that. First, notwithstanding the perfectly sensible industrial comments of the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth, drawn from his experience, about small firms&#151;30 or 35 employees in a single shop&#151;in an industry not characterised at that level by especially good industrial relations, clearly it must be right to go first for the big cases, the major shops, rather than dissipate the efforts of the CAC on a series of penny packets of consideration, all of which will require strong legal input, and ballots, to start with.
<P>
Secondly&#151;this is for the Minister's very serious consideration&#151;may I say that it is all very well to offer a right, but withdrawing it would be much more difficult. If I were the Minister, and were drafting an order to derecognise the position for the future, in circumstances in which it was clear that the 21-worker limit was giving rise to unfortunate consequences but had led to statutory recognition in some instances, I would have to consider the transitional arrangements under which the 21-worker limit had been imposed and had brought about the prevailing circumstances. In the interests of natural justice, I could not possibly include in the derecognition order provision for withdrawal of statutory recognition from unions to which it had already been conceded. It would be much easier to aim high, and, if it were not working well enough, to give unions an additional right to statutory recognition in firms in the 20 to 50 range, and to admit, ``It has not worked. We now want to take it away for future applications, but we do not know what on earth to do in cases where it was granted and gave rise to trouble.'' That is a technical argument, but it is also a substantive argument for amendment No. 9. So while we are grateful for the Minister's assurance on other matters, I fear that we must persist with amendment No. 9.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and if it ceases to be independent at any future time when recognised under this Schedule, its recognition shall be automatically voided'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This need not take up much of the Committee's time. Students of the small print will have noticed that I tabled this amendment a long time ago. That was on my first detailed perusal of part I of schedule 1, before I gave the equivalent attention to part V, which is about the voluntary derecognition. An important issue is raised here. If the statutory procedure has been followed and a trade union has been recognised and has ceased to be an independent trade union, it perhaps does not have quite the same status as before.
<P>
The Minister has already explained that it is open to the parties involved to continue to recognise that union for the purpose of collective bargaining. There is no problem. But if the employer has succeeded in capturing the union so that it is no longer an independent union, I am not sure whether the whole matter should not fall away. The amendment was designed to flush out the issue. I should like to hear the Minister's views on the issue of principle and also on how the interaction with part V of the schedule will work.
<P>
In a sense, the amendment pulls in neatly with the points that I have just been making about extending a right to collective bargaining and then withdrawing it in one way or another. If this right is extended and circumstances change, as the Minister conceded they may, it should be withdrawn in a sensible and appropriate way and should not be nullified in an irregular manner or one that will give rise to recriminations and the suggestion of unfairness. It is a sensitive point and the amendment is certainly not anti-union. I would be grateful for the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I recognise the probing nature of the amendment and I may be able to offer the hon. Gentleman some comfort. One of our key aims is to promote stability in industrial relations. Indeed, stability is a key aim of the Government in all sorts of areas of public policy. Ending recognition simply because a union ceases to be independent, regardless of the wishes of the employer, would be counter to that aim. The withdrawal of a certificate of independence from a union is extremely rare. DTI officials can recall no such case. Having said that, it would make sense for a union that loses its certificate of independence to be treated as voluntarily recognised. An employer would then be able to derecognise the union at any time. It would also allow the workers to apply for derecognition of the newly non-independent union.
<P>
The comfort that I can offer the hon. Gentleman is that we will consider amending the Bill so that a union recognised by the statutory procedure which loses its certificate of independence will count as voluntarily recognised. I hope that that reassurance will enable the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> No action could better exemplify the Kafkaesque nature of our proceedings than the contribution&#151;or almost non-contribution&#151;of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Lorna Fitzsimons) to the vote on the previous amendment. It is difficult for the Committee to focus on all the issues, but we must do so. If we are to have statutory procedure, we must ensure that it is as clear and viable as possible.
<P>
This little group of amendments deals with yet another 10 test. I apologise to the members of the Committee for confusing them with a series of figures&#151;I have to check each time which 10 I am talking about. My first point is about giving 10 working days' notice before an application for collective bargaining recognition is considered. I raise it in the spirit of agreement which, despite apparent differences, has characterised this Committee so far.
<P>
The amendments, which hang together, would extend that prescribed notice time to 20 working days. I have no particular brief for a precise period, but I know that a number of responsible employers&#151;as I recall, the Engineering Employers Federation&#151;have suggested to us that 20 working days may be more effective for the initial consideration.
<P>
The Minister's view is that many employers would recognise trade unions if only the fact were drawn to their attention that a union had significant support among their employees. If that view can be sustained, it seems sensible that, from the first trigger point, there should be a period of up to three or four working weeks to consider whether or not the application should be recognised voluntarily, before the statutory procedure kicks in.
<P>
We tabled our amendments to deal with that question. There is no exact science in dates and numbers, but I believe that the Minister should make a case for his proposal and acknowledge that some responsible players in this field do not feel that it is wholly adequate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pearson:</B> I have some sympathy for the case that the Engineering Employers Federation is making, particularly in relation to small businesses. I am not sure that I would want to go as far as it does and ask for 20 working days' notice. However, a response period of two working weeks could unnecessarily cause problems for some small employers who may be busy trying to get out orders at a difficult time of the year. A compromise of three weeks would be more flexible. I am minded to support the amendments of the hon. Member for Daventry. Some small firms could have difficulty in making an initial reponse within the 10 working days if they were busy. Perhaps the arrangement can be flexibly reviewed if problems arise in implementing it in future.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride (Bromsgrove):</B> I am moved to speak becase I wonder whether the cross-party co-operation on this matter will persuade the Minister to listen and give way. Clearly, difficulties may arise for businesses. For example, if, one member of staff was taking unpaid paternity leave and another had a family crisis, during a very small firm's busy time of year, when the order books were full and it was necessary to get the work done, the short period proposed by the Government could be extremely unfair. We do not perceive any particular disadvantage to lengthening the period. The law would still apply and the procedures would be followed, but given that some smaller businesses face a barrage of new employment law, the Minister might well make a concession with respect to this unnecessary restriction&#151;particularly, perhaps, in the light of the cross-party support for the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> To put the matter in context, we should consider that the decisions in question will be fundamental, particularly for firms that have not previously had to think about union recognition&#151;not necessarily because of opposition to it, but simply because it has not arisen. The decision, once made, is likely to stand for several years at least. In that context, the difference between 10 and 20 days is not too great a burden if it means getting the process right and ensuring that all parties are comfortable with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In this case&#151;although I may have overlooked something in the schedule&#151;there is no provision for amending the period by order, so we shall be stuck with it once we have it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that point. I am equally unsure about it, but perhaps the Minister can advise us.
<P>
It is important for the Bill to allow due time for deliberation and agreement on the process, so that neither party is likely to have feelings of animosity or antagonism, or of having been bounced into the resulting arrangement. The decision is likely to last for years, and it is to be hoped that that will be in a settled working environment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pearson:</B> I was wondering whether other hon. Members' reading of the provision accords with mine. It seems possible that an employer could receive a faxed request for union recognition while on holiday in the Seychelles and have to respond in 10 working days. Despite being on holiday, he would be the owner of a company who had received a written request, and would be put in a difficult position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point, although for many of the small businesses that are struggling to survive, the holiday would be more likely to be in Blackpool than the Seychelles, and a fax machine might not be available. However, the point is well made. A steady approach to the matter will result in far better, more amicable and better respected decisions, for the benefit of both employer and employees taken over a period far greater than the 10 or 20 days being discussed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As always, I was extremely interested in the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South and fascinated at the support he received from the hon. Members for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) and for Eastleigh. I share their concern for small firms. However, their views reflect a misapprehension of what is at stake. The aim of ensuring sufficient time for the negotiation of trade union recognition is laudable, and we all share it. Equally, there is no point in prolonging negotiations unduly.
<P>
As to the preoccupation of my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South with holidays in the Seychelles, all that an employer need do in the initial 10-day period is state whether he is willing to negotiate. Even your hard-pressed small employer on holiday in the Seychelles obviously has access to a fax machine and can decide, while snorkelling around the coral reef, what response to fax back.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I should like to pursue the point, but shall be happy to give way in a moment if the hon. Gentleman wants to return to the point about the Seychelles.
<P>
Nothing is lost by agreeing to negotiate. It does not imply concession or agreement; it merely suggests a willingness to negotiate. A period of 10 working days seems more than adequate for that process. If agreement cannot be reached, or if one party refuses to negotiate, additional time would merely drag out the process.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Will the Minister respond to my comments and to the intervention of the hon. Member for Daventry? Will the regulations provide for the matter to be revisited in due course?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall deal with that after I have spoken to the amendments. If the hon. Gentleman holds his breath, we shall reach that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I do not intend to hold my breath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall be extremely rapid; my advice is not life threatening.
<P>
Amendment No, 11 would extend the employer's initial response period from 10 working days to 20. It would lengthen the application process, without materially improving it. If the employer is willing to negotiate, a further 28 days are available for negotiations. If not, there is little point in delaying the application. The employer and the union may agree to extend the negotiating period if they want to do so. However, industrial relations would not benefit from the statutory extension of the first period for negotiation to 20 working days.
<P>
Amendment No. 12 would in effect require a union to accept an employer's proposition to involve ACAS at any time during the second period of negotiations. However, there is little point in involving ACAS if it has no time in which to work. It would be similar to inviting someone to a party that is already half finished. The union and employer may agree to extend negotiations, but they can also agree to involve ACAS. I can see no good reason for an employer who genuinely wants to negotiate through ACAS not to propose to do so within 10 working days of agreeing to negotiate.
<P>
Amendment No. 13 would give a union 20 working days in which the respond to a proposal for the use of ACAS. That would in practice allow the union to sit out the 28-day negotiation period, agree to the use of ACAS and refuse to agree to extend the 28-day negotiation period. Allowing a union to refuse a proposal of reasonable negotiation is not the Government's intention.
<P>
Amendment No 28 would extend the period available to employers in which to provide evidence that they employ fewer than 21 workers. Under the Bill as drafted, employers will have a minimum of 20 working days in which to assemble their evidence&#151;10 working days after the application is made, and 10 further days under paragraph 28, or paragraph 10C, which will replace it. If the employer enters negotiations with the union, a further 28 days are available. That is more than sufficient time for an employer to ascertain whether he or she had 21 or more workers. Indeed, it does not require that long. It is therefore not necessary to extend the period.
<P>
Lest I be accused of being anything other than even-handed in my treatment of unions and employers, I turn to amendment No. 242, which would affect an employer's application to derecognise a union. The amendment would extend the union's initial response period from 10 working days to 20. I criticised amendment No. 11 for needlessly lengthening the application process; I have exactly the same approach to this amendment. None of the amendments are of material benefit to unions or employers.
<P>
I told the hon. Member for Eastleigh that he would not have to hold his breath for long. We have no specific provision to amend the 10-day period, but we shall consider a general evaluation of the law. If he is suggesting that we take a general power to amend all aspects of the schedule, we shall consider that interesting suggestion. However, I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That was a fascinating exchange. I shall not lecture the Minister at length, even though he has responsibility for small businesses. Despite his rather bland reassurance, small businesses do not work that way.
<P>
Let us advert to our experiences as Members of Parliament. We have moments of stress and overload, including, for example, the introduction of a quasi-new schedule before the weekend, leaving little time to table amendments and get our ducks in a row before we discuss the matter on Tuesday morning and driving out our consideration of other matters. Although I rely firmly on my secretary to open my correspondence and, occasionally, to flag-up matters of interest, in a fast-changing scene it is even possible to overlook submissions on the Bill, let alone anything else. In such circumstances, an apparently entirely innocuous or inconsequential letter from a constituent might neither have been opened nor drawn to my attention in time for me to deal with it in a two or three-day period. Then, of course, if I have to take time off from working in my small business to read a letter of legal import, I probably have to ask my lawyer, ``What the blazes does this mean?'' If one's lawyer is on leave or in a conference, or otherwise unavailable, further time is lost. The contributions of Labour Members, including those of the hon. Member for Dudley, South, bear that out.
<P>
In considering a Bill such as this one, especially in the prevailing circumstances, it is not a bad idea to have a few points that can be lobbed out to keep the ravening wolf pack at a distance. Members of the Committee of a more antiquarian nature may remember the famous film, ``Sanders of the River,'' in which there was a fine escape by canoe from the pursuing Indians. When it was shown at Oxford university, long before my time, when Sanders reached the safety of the bank someone shouted out, ``Well rowed, Balliol,'' at which point the cinema had to be closed owing to riot. The Minister may commend himself to the Committee by having a few such hypothetical douceurs to keep the ravening hordes from the Opposition Benches&#151;and, apparently, from Government Members&#151;at a distance.
<P>
A consensus is beginning to emerge that a threesome should be considered; there is no perfect answer, but the Minister should think hard about whether that alternative would commend itself to everyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I have to confess that I had not mistaken the hon. Gentleman's gentlemanly approach as part of a ravening horde, but I shall look at him differently in future. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that in practice, in small firms where the employer and his work force have a daily face-to-face relationship and work closely with each other, the sort of situation that we are discussing will hardly come as a surprise? We are not talking about a constituency, which generates hundreds of letters each day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In many small firms such a situation can arise in an aberrant situation. That is my point. The worst possible eventuality would be if the matter went to the next stage and was subject to the formal procedure as the employer was judged to be delinquent because he had not complied with or responded to the application within 10 days. The Minister took some time to think up his argument and perhaps introduced it to defuse my point, which is that there is a strong emerging consensus among those not on the Treasury Benches that a three-week period might be sensible. However, I can envisage difficulties because, as a matter of principle, I do not like legalising by regulation or order for a more general sweeping-up power to enable the figures to be altered.

<P>

<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> It strikes me as curious that the Minister is suggesting that his unwillingness to accept our proposals and those of his hon. Friend is because they deal with aberrant situations. Huge swathes of the Bill deal with circumstances that are very unlikely to arise and for which we have said the Bill is largely unnecessary. If the proposed legislation applies in other respects, I cannot see why it should not apply here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall not prolong the debate, but I was interested in why the hon. Gentleman was so concerned. We have now been enlightened&#151;he was talking about aberrant situations. The Government are perfectly happy to accept constructive suggestions&#151;I made that clear at the start of the Committee. However, it is difficult to see why, in aberrant situations, three weeks, rather than two, will make any difference. I cannot see why the amendment would have any material benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister said that my concern is confined to aberrant situations, but it is more likely to involve a cock-up than a deliberate attempt to respond to circumstances. However, there may be circumstances, including pressures on small business, when the parties do not signal their intentions clearly. The trade union side may not be familiar with the procedure either. Allowing a little longer would not be a charter for unnecessary delay. Delay is something that might happen, however much we deplore it.
<P>
I am anxious not to skewer the Minister or his Back Benchers. I am not asking for an order-making power, but I want him to think again about whether three weeks might be better than two.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): The hon. Gentleman openly admits that the thrust of his argument is about aberrant situations. The Bill is geared towards a more sustainable and acceptable approach to the issue of recognition. In the past, trade unionists and trade union officers had to organise in secret before making an application for recognition. The Bill will assist in making that unnecessary and it is highly likely that an employer will know what is going on before a formal application is made. In those better circumstances, I expect that trade unions and employers, small though they may be, will come to an amicable agreement about when the formal application that triggers the process is made. The circumstances will, therefore, be different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> If private or secret consultations take place between members of a firm and the unions, it is likely that the employer will know nothing about it until a formal application is made. It is not possible to determine that in advance.
<P>
If an employer feels that he is being put up against a wall, and forced to make a quick decision, he may, out of pique or because he thinks it wise tactically, decide not to accept the procedure voluntarily. The sort of letter he might write would be, ``If you think that is where I am going, sunshine, I don't want anything to do with it.'' That would be a pity, which is why I want a slightly longer period for reflection.
<P>
I have been trying to pursue the matter with sensitivity to the points made by the hon. Member for Dudley, South. I shall not press the amendment, on the understanding that the Minister will reflect on it, to see whether he can accept the arguments that have been made and make some appropriate concessions later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Although there are several amendments, taken together they represent a small technical change that is repeated in many places. I appreciate that they are hard to follow for all of us, so I have taken to heart the enthusiasm of the hon. Member for Daventry for flow charts. We have provided one that shows how part I will operate if the Government amendments are accepted.
<P>
Paragraphs 9(2) and 10(2) allow a union to ask the CAC two questions: what the appropriate bargaining unit is and whether the union has sufficient support for recognition. The union can ask either question or both. However, it is not clear what happens if the union asks only the second question. We have therefore introduced amendments that make clear what happens when the questions are asked.
<P>
The amendments make a further change. In order not to waste employers' and unions' time and money on ballots that are likely to be unsuccessful, once an application is referred to the CAC it must pass some preliminary tests to proceed. One of those is a test of sufficient support in the proposed bargaining unit, as is detailed in paragraph 26.
<P>
If the union and employer have already agreed a bargaining unit, it makes sense for that unit to be the one tested. We have therefore introduced the idea of the relevant bargaining unit, which is the agreed unit if one exists or the proposed unit if one does not. The preliminary tests will be applied to the relevant bargaining unit.
<P>
Once the appropriate bargaining unit is decided, another test of sufficient support is detailed in paragraph 13. As the appropriate unit may differ from the proposed bargaining unit, another test is necessary. The amendments provide that if the bargaining unit has stayed the same, the test of sufficient support&#151;which has already been passed once&#151;will not be reapplied.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 198, 243 and 244 make the tests of sufficient support in paragraphs 13 and 26 the same, in the interests of streamlining. Given that the intention behind the test is the same, we wish them to have the same effect. The sense of both would be that the CAC must not proceed with an application under paragraph 13 unless 10 per cent. of the bargaining unit are union members and a majority of the bargaining unit are likely to favour recognition.
<P>
The three amendments also&#151;I am being open with the Committee&#151;alter slightly the criteria on which the CAC will decide whether there is sufficient support to proceed with an application for recognition, as amendment No. 198 deletes the reference to prima facie evidence. Hon. Members are, no doubt, anxious to know why we have taken against prima facie evidence in that way. The answer is that we think that the CAC should look in more detail at whether a majority of workers are likely to favour recognition, even at such an early stage in the application procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Do I understand the Minister to mean that the CAC is not precluded from the prima facie evidence, and that such evidence is merely one of the factors that it could take into account in deciding what the situation is before recommending the procedure's continuation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am happy to confirm that we think that the CAC should look in more detail than merely at prima facie evidence when considering that important question.
<P>
The amendments involve several minor, linked changes, the cumulative effect of which will be to streamline the recognition process. The method for the CAC's scrutiny of applications will be clearer and more rigorous under the amendments. I hope that hon. Members will agree that that is a good result and, therefore, that they will accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is a complex group of amendments. I accept the spirit in which the Minister has spoken and his articulation of a rather clearer procedure than had been originally included in the Bill. We are grateful for that advance.
<P>
We are concerned that the position be properly understood. I shall draw on another analogy. It is rather like the convergence tests for British membership of the European monetary union. It is important that the convergence should not involve the sort of contingency of two London buses crossing. That is the concern behind our amendments, which suggest that there should be a stable, long-term basis for assessing such matters.
<P>
All the amendments have helped us to drive the CAC away from mere literalism, a mere receipt of evidence, which will inevitably be&#151;I mean no disrespect to the unions who submit it&#151;a partial account of the position as they see it, designed to make their case, towards taking clearer, more principled decisions on whether or not recognition is appropriate. However, that will impose certain strains and stresses on the unions involved and on the CAC because it must reach a judgment on the balance of evidence. It will not always be easy to do that, and the CAC might be subject to legal challenge, given that it is a public body.
<P>
Under amendment No. 29, the CAC would be required to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``give the reasons for its decisions in writing''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That important amendment was suggested by several interests. It is important that the CAC builds up a principled basis for its procedure. The basis on which it takes decisions about appropriate bargaining units and the appropriateness of recognition should be transparent whenever possible and certainly consistent.
<P>
If the CAC does not have a clear way to operate and does not build up a clear body of doctrine, none of the parties involved&#151;the unions, employers, any outside person or the CAC&#151;will know how things will work out. That would cause confusion and arbitrariness, and different decisions could be taken in apparently similar circumstances. That would not help the process; it would probably discredit it.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will think about that and return to the Committee&#151;if he cannot decide now&#151;with proposals for a better basis to secure greater consistency. A clearer doctrine on how the CAC will proceed is needed. In some measure, he has provided that in the amendments that he has tabled. A clearer doctrine must be established over time so that the CAC takes its individual decisions within the wider industrial context. That must be wholly to the good. I shall not press our amendments to a Division. They are intended to stimulate the Minister into considering what help he can give later.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> We are dealing with the essence of the problem. No one disputes the role of the CAC or that it should establish bargaining units. The matters that it must consider in reaching such decisions are clearly set out in the Bill. My concerns are similar to those of the hon. Member for Daventry. The last thing that I would want is for the Bill to be continually challenged in the courts because of what might be considered a subjective decision taken by a particular CAC panel in a particular case. The principles are in the Bill, but I am anxious that the Government should clarify how those principles could be quantified in any particular case. That will enable the CAC to give strong guidelines&#151;under legislation&#151;when it is trying to decide what an appropriate bargaining unit is. The problem must be resolved, as we are in danger of making the Bill a hostage to fortune, not to mention a lawyers'' paradise.
