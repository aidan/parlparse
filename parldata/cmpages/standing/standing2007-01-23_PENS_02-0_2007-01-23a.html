						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701246000297"></a>The
Minister for Pensions Reform (James Purnell):
						</b> It is a
great pleasure and privilege to serve under your chairmanship again,
Mr. Taylor, as we did in the Programming Sub-Committee. I
know that you are an extremely experienced Chair and I look forward to
your chairing our proceedings.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 46</div>
					<a name="0701246000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we broke earlier, the
Committee was no doubt fascinated by my saying that if the new clause
were included in the Bill, the Pension Service would have to reassess
the pensions of more than 2 million pensioners in one go. We estimate
that in some 350,000 cases where the pensioner is getting pension
credit, despite the significant expense that would be incurred, the
provisions of the new clause would not make a penny of difference to
the person&#146;s total pension income. So there would be a
significant amount of work, involving confusing notifications for many
people with little or no overall gain in many cases. Although I
understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North tabled
the new clause so that we could have this debate, which has been
helpful, given its consequences I urge her not to press
it.</div>
					<a name="0701246000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 30
focuses on a narrow issue of bereavement benefits. I understand the
rationale behind my hon. Friend&#146;s new clause, which would apply
the new single contribution to widowed parent&#146;s allowance and
bereavement allowance. Although I, like every Committee member, have
every sympathy for people coping with the effects of bereavement, I
cannot see a clear rationale for changing the contribution conditions
for bereavement benefits. Reducing the number of qualifying years for a
full basic state pension to 30 years is designed to address the
inequalities of outcome that currently exist for women, as we discussed
this morning. However, those inequalities have built up over many years
and bereavement benefits were only introduced fairly recently&#151;in
2001&#151;and are available to both men and women. Prior to 2001,
widow&#146;s benefits were only available to women. Our data on
widowed parent&#146;s allowance show no real evidence of unequal
outcomes between men and
women.</div>
					<a name="0701246000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">As one would
expect, significantly more women than men receive bereavement
benefits&#151;around 25,000 women, compared with some 10,000
men&#151;but that reflects the fact that men are far more likely than
women to die before their spouse, because women live longer. However
there is no significant difference in the proportion of men who qualify
for full rate widowed parent&#146;s allowance compared with
women.</div>
					<a name="0701246000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The existing
contribution conditions for bereavement benefits allow the number of
qualifying years to be reduced where a person dies before reaching
state pension age. For example, if a man dies at 40 he would need to
have accrued only 21 qualifying years for his widow to qualify for full
widowed parent&#146;s allowance if she were left with children. There
is already a mechanism in the Bill to achieve the spirit of what my
hon. Friend was trying to do. The current link between the contribution
conditions for bereavement benefits and pensions is largely historical
and has little basis today, given that bereavement benefits are paid to
people of working age who have very different needs and
responsibilities from those of
pensioners.</div>
					<a name="0701246000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend asked whether a widow might not qualify for bereavement benefits
at the full rate, even though her husband would have qualified for a
full basic state pension under the new rules. That is possible, but the
number of cases will be fairly small, as the 30-year qualifying test
has a marginal effect on the proportion of men, as we discussed
earlier. A woman in that situation would not be any worse off than she
is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 47</div>now, on her eligibility for bereavement benefits, but she would be
better off than she is now on the basis of her eligibility for state
pension benefits. In the same way as her husband would be better off in
terms of his lower number of qualifying years for his state pension
benefits, so would she. The Bill only improves the situation, compared
with today.</div>
					<a name="0701246000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
priorities for working age benefits are to increase employment and to
reduce child poverty. Change in the contribution conditions for
bereavement benefits would have only little if any impact on either of
those two issues. We are reducing the number of qualifying years so
that people have better incentives to save to reflect the different
caring contributions and patterns of work. That is appropriate for
pension benefits, but we do not consider that it is appropriate for
working age benefits. I urge my hon. Friend not to press her new
clauses and extend that wish to new clause
23.</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0701246000298"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): I, too, welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Taylor. We made good progress under your fellow
Chair this morning, and I hope that we will continue to do so this
afternoon. I am grateful to the Minister for his response to the
cluster of new clauses, especially new clause 23. I am sure that my
memory will let me down although it seems a long time ago, but I think
that the Minister undertook this morning to publish in the summer of
2007 the research that the Government describe in their response to the
Select Committee&#146;s report. I assume that that means before the
House rises for the summer recess, although we can never be too sure
about such definitions. I therefore hope that the information will be
made available to us before we discuss the personal accounts Bill in
the latter quarter of this year. Obviously, that information will be
extremely useful. It will inform some of the other debates that we
shall have later, including those under clause 3 so I shall not raise
them now.</div>
					<a name="0701246000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I raised
earlier with the Minister the ability of the Department to give
estimates after the reforms in 2010 of the proportion of male and
female pensioners&#151;the stock of pensioners&#151;who will
receive a full basic state pension. Although I might have missed it, I
do not believe that he was able to respond to that point in the debate,
which is understandable given the information that he needed at his
fingertips. If he does not have the information now, would he at some
stage put it on the public record? With those provisos, we do not
intend to press our new clause to a
Division.</div>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions

Mr. Taylor.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 48</div>
					<a name="0701246000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now come to the provision that
ends the requirement that entitlement to category B pension is
dependent on a category A pension having been claimed by the
person&#146;s spouse or civil partner. Hopefully, clause 2 is one of
the more straightforward clauses in the Bill. It simply will remove the
current restriction on entitlement to a category B pension, which is a
pension based on the contribution of a person&#146;s spouse or civil
partner rather than on that person&#146;s own contribution in
situations when the spouse or civil partner defers claiming his or her
category A
pension.</div>
					<a name="0701246000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Category B
pensions for married people and people in civil partnerships are
payable at about 60 per cent. of the standard rate of basic pension.
They are still commonly known as married women&#146;s pensions, but
from 2010 they will be available to some married men and people in
civil
partnerships.</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0701246000300"></a>
							<b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Is that payable
only when the person who receives the category A pension defers or is
it applicable in all cases such as if the person who receives the
category A pension has not reached retirement age? Does it mean that a
woman aged 58 years or 62 years can claim it if her husband is also 62
years and therefore not reaching his
pension?</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701246000301"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Both parties have to have reached retirement
age. I am just about to clarify such matters. My hon. Friend has
anticipated the material to which I am about to
refer.</div>
					<a name="0701246000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">A person can
only qualify for a category B pension if their own entitlement to a
category A basic pension is lower than a category B rate. For example,
a married woman with entitlement to a category A pension at50
per cent. of the standard rate would have her pension topped up by 10
per cent. to the category B
rate.</div>
					<a name="0701246000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the current
rules, a person cannot qualify for a category B pension until both he
or she and his or her spouse or civil partner have reached pension age,
and the spouse or civil partner has actually claimed his or her
category A pension. This clause removes just the latter
restriction&#151;one that limits choice and that can create
complicated decisions on whether to defer drawing state
pension.</div>
					<a name="0701246000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">To help my
hon. Friend and other members of the Committee with an illustration,
let me introduce Mr. and Mrs. Jones.
Mr. Jones is considering deferring his category A pension
because he plans to work on for two years after reaching state pension
age, but Mrs. Jones has already reached state pension age
and is drawing a small category A pension based on her own
contributions. If Mr. Jones defers his pension, then
Mrs. Jones will not qualify for her category B pension until
he eventually claims. So, Mr. Jones faces an invidious
choice. He would like to accrue deferral benefits&#151;a lump sum or
extra weekly pension&#151;on his own pension, but that would mean
that his wife would not be able to draw her pension.</div>
					<a name="0701246000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2 solves this dilemma:
Mrs. Jones will be able to draw her category B pension from
the point that Mr. Jones reaches state pension age,
regardless of whether he decides to defer. The change will apply from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 49</div>
						2010 to both existing and future claims. The
proposal will simplify the claims process and enable people to make an
independent claim for their state pension. They will no longer be
dependent on their spouse&#146;s decision. That will make it easier
for people to understand what they may claim and when they may claim
it, and for those reasons I urge hon. Members to support this
clause.</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0701246000302"></a>
							<b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): It is also my
pleasure, Mr. Taylor, to welcome you to this second sitting
of our Committee. I have had the pleasure of serving under you before,
and look forward to doing so again.</div>
					<a name="0701246000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2 is short and
uncontroversial. It is generally to be welcomed and I see no amendments
or new clauses tabled in relation to it. The removal of a restriction
on entitlement to category B retirement pension has to be generally
welcomed, meaning that, in future, it will be possible for one member
of a couple to receive such a pension even if the other has deferred a
category A pension. This is particularly important, as more and more
people are likely to be deferring their pensions by keeping on working,
as older people generally enjoy better health and working in later
life&#151;past state pension age&#151;becomes more common. As the
Minister said, there are clearly benefits to deferring a pension in the
increases that come later. Because we are going to see more of that,
Opposition Members are happy to see clause 2 in the Bill.</div>

						</b> I, too, welcome you to the chairmanship this
afternoon, Mr. Taylor, and into the course of the Bill. This
morning, we were treated to a number of helpful and interesting debates
and, as often happens with Bills, the defining characteristics of the
different groups are starting to emerge.</div>
					<a name="0701246000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The watchword of the
Conservatives seems to be &#147;not a penny more for
pensioners&#148;, to which they seem to be sticking quite rigorously.
The Minister seems to be saying on numerous occasions that the
&#147;computer says no&#148;. Unfortunately, when I suggested that
he might want to crack that joke, my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil
was not quite so well up with what he calls youth culture. The Liberal
Democrats&#146; watchword is that we are trying to get a better deal
for pensioners<i class="I">. </i>[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;Money tree&#148;.] From a sedentary position, Conservative
Members have mentioned a money tree but I would rather refer to it as a
money sapling. In my defence, on our side of the House we have
mentioned savings of &#163;8 billion which have been identified
already. Therefore, we are not going to take any lessons from the other
parties on how to save or spend
money.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Nigel Waterson</b> (Eastbourne) (Con): Before the hon. Lady
gets into her flow, I should point out that she referred, with a rather
broad-brush attitude, to&#163;4 billion for scrapping
contracted-out rebates. However, the Government&#146;s figures show
that that has now been reduced to just under &#163;2 billion.
Therefore, she is just over &#163;2 billion adrift from the
Treasury&#146;s figures. Will she deal with
that?</div>

Burt:
						</b> My figures are taken from those presented by Help
the Aged. Notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman&#146;s figures&#151;or
the Government figures&#151;they are still double what we have
proposed. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I should move swiftly on.</div>
					<a name="0701246000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome this part of the
Bill, particularly because carers do a phenomenal job. If we want to
bandy figures about, let us consider the situation if carers did not do
their job. It would cost the NHS roughly double what it currently
spends to look after people who are selflessly cared for by carers who
give their time and who also suffer financially. This Bill goes some
way to redress the situation for carers who care for 20 hours or more a
week, and it is therefore extremely welcome.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div>
					<a name="0701246000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I want to
explore the situation for people who miss out. By 2010, as it stands
under this legislation, of the 160,000 carers who will be caring for 20
hours or more a week and not building entitlements to the basic state
pension, 120,000 will get credit through the carers credit. This means
that 40,000 will not be building their entitlement. We are trying to
address that.</div>
					<a name="0701246000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 26 was suggested
by Carers UK. The Equal Opportunities Commission and Help the Aged also
support it. The type of people who would miss out on carers credits
will be those who have fluctuating conditions and who may be on and off
benefit; those who care for someone who goes into hospital long enough
to lose their benefits; those who care for someone who does not want to
claim disability benefit but the carer nevertheless sacrifices that
amount of time&#151;very willingly, as a rule; and those who care for
more than one person but neither of them is in receipt of the right
benefits. We discussed those people on Second Reading. We propose that
a health or social care professional could
nominate&#151;certify&#151;that those people are in need of care
for 20 hours or more a
week.</div>
					<a name="0701246000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 63
was, again, not our idea; it was proposed by Carers UK. It lists nearly
all disability benefits and argues that if a carer is caring for
someone in receipt of said benefits for more than 20 hours a week, they
should be eligible to accrue entitlement to the basic state pension.
The amendment is also supported by Help the Aged, Age Concern and the
Equal Opportunities Commission. At the moment, under the eligibility
criteria, someone would need to be caring for a person almost
constantly, day or night, to qualify. The extension of the list of
benefits is
important.</div>
					<a name="0701246000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the
Government have done so far is excellent, but we ask them to go the
extra mile for the 40,000 people of the 160,000 who will not benefit
for reasons that are not their fault.</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701246000308"></a>Ms
Keeble:
						</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Taylor.</div>
					<a name="0701246000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled amendment No. 61 after
discussions with carers groups to find a way to balance the different
pressures on caring and pensions. It is important to recognise that
many carers will benefit from other changes in the Bill&#151;in
particular, the reduction in the number of hours that have to be worked
per week to qualify for the state pension. If they do not have to work
for so many hours, it is easier for people with substantial caring
responsibilities to qualify for a state pension. That has to be
recognised.</div>
					<a name="0701246000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
obviously important that the system should properly compensate carers
and recognise the contribution that they make. Some carers are not able
to work because of their caring responsibilities, so they cannot
qualify even on the fewer-hours basis. They therefore need credits to
count towards their
pensions.</div>
					<a name="0701246000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not
muddle that up with the caring roles that people normally play for
their families. We have to draw the lines carefully. Otherwise,
everybody will end up being a carer and what we are trying to do will
become virtually meaningless. We have to be clear about
that.</div>
					<a name="0701246000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The credits are
valuable; they are not light things. They are important, and there has
to be a proper process for deciding who qualifies and who does not.
Tagging on a long list of benefits means that people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 52</div>can tick a box and get a benefit, but that does not always meet the
realities of carers&#146; lives. That is why, in addition to the
specified benefits, which I agree are probably not wide enough, we need
a process that allows for the person who cannot tick the boxes, but who
none the less does what amounts to a caring job. That person cannot
qualify even at the fewer-hours rate because of their caring
responsibilities. We need to find another way to recognise and assess
what is going on.</div>
					<a name="0701246000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition said that that should be done by one health or social
services professional, but I do not think that that would be robust
enough. To give an example from the Home Office, the domestic violence
exemption system, in which two professionals sign, works well. That is
sensible; there is evidence from two sources. In the case that we are
discussing we could say that a doctor and social worker should sign.
However, one person with a lot going on in their lives&#151;caring,
working, this, that and the other&#151;would have to run around
collecting bits of paper from different professionals. Furthermore,
there would be the issue of what would happen if the doctors decided to
charge. That is a problem because there is no agreement in place with
doctors yet.</div>
					<a name="0701246000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">All of us
have seen the letters that professionals write in support of housing
applications, but a person advocating a patient or client is not always
in a position to make an impartial judgment, one that follows due
process or a set of criteria. They are more likely simply to say,
&#147;This person works very hard. They look after three children,
who all have difficulties. Yes, they qualify as a carer.&#148; An
established process for such applications might provide a way forward.
Amendment No. 61 would place a responsibility on the social services
authority to undertake the process, rather than with an individual
social worker whom people may not know. A social services authority in
any event has a responsibility for undertaking care assessments for the
different client groups; it will have family records, so the process
would look at the care needs of the people concerned. The authority
could say whether the mother looking after three children is indeed
working as a carer as stipulated in the Bill, and that she should
therefore be entitled to the carers credit.</div>

							<a name="0701246000309"></a>Lorely
Burt:
						</b> We agree about the robustness of the measurement,
and we would want to have that degree of robustness in everything that
is done. Given that the hon. Lady has left out the alternative of
having a doctor advocate, would there not be circumstances in which
social services is not involved with an individual? A person may not be
on specific allowances; they may simply be very ill. Does she not
envisage circumstances in which a doctor&#146;s letter would be the
only appropriate avenue for an individual to get pension credit without
having to get involved with social
services?</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701246000310"></a>Ms
Keeble:
						</b> I do not want to go on about amendment No. 61 for
too long because it is not robustly worded, and I do not intend to
press for a Division. I am asking that my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary have a look at the issues raised, come back, and
perhaps move a little on the measures.</div>
					<a name="0701246000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are probably no
circumstances in which a person would be seeing a doctor when they did
not also require some kind of care assessment that would go 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div>through social services. I find such circumstances very hard to
envisage. A person may want assessments made for adaptations to their
house, or a special needs assessment for a child who is in school.
There are a range of circumstances in which, if any kind of caring, as
opposed to medical treatment, is needed, the social services authority
would be the appropriate body to provide an assessment. I am sure that
my hon. Friend will confirm whether that is the legislative
position.</div>
					<a name="0701246000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">No doubt we
can all think of a few cases where a person will not be able even to
work the reduced hours that are needed now to qualify for the state
benefit and the reduced years. Such a person may also be looking after
a number of people with substantial needs, although not with the level
of need that entitles them to benefits. A person in such a complex
situation would effectively fulfil the requirements to get the carers
credit. The amendment might provide a way to soften the edges of what
is otherwise a tick-box
exercise.</div>
					<a name="0701246000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
important and will transform things for a lot of people who are
currently left out and find themselves unable to get a pension because
they have to give up work to care for
relatives.</div>

it.</div>
					<a name="0701246000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 26
and 63, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, and amendment No. 61, tabled
by the hon. Member for Northampton, North, would allocate contribution
credits to more people from 6 April 2010 than are provided for in the
Bill and there will be public expenditure implications from 2010
onwards. Those implications will be small at first but will become
increasingly significant over time. I hope that the Minister will tell
the Committee what the costs ofthe three amendments will be,
because it is difficult for the Official Opposition to find precise
costings for them. It would be useful if we could find out what we are
talking
about.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701246000312"></a>Lorely

						</b> The hon. Gentleman says that the additional number
of people who would be eligible for the credit would increase over
time. Would that not justify the argument that says that, because such
people are being left out, even more people will be unfairly treated

implications.</div>

							<a name="0701246000313"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I actually said that the costs would increase over
time. However, the hon. Lady is right: if we are to believe some of the
estimates from some of the special interest groups that follow this
matter carefully, the number of carers is likely to increase as well.
If she will bear with me for a little while as I develop my argument,
she will see that one of the new clauses that I tabled deals
specifically with that
point.</div>
					<a name="0701246000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was saying
that the three amendments in the group have public expenditure
implications. Unlike the Liberal Democrats and the hon. Member for
Northampton, North, we in the Official Opposition take our financial
responsibilities to the taxpayer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 54</div>
						slightly more seriously. We are not prepared to make
significant spending commitments many years ahead without considering
other demands on the Exchequer and understanding that the money to pay
for those commitments will need to be raised in a sustainable way
through increased taxes.</div>
					<a name="0701246000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">In contrast to the other
parties, our approach in new clause 15 is to ensure that this matter,
which is important&#151;as the hon. Members for Solihull and for
Northampton, North said&#151;is brought before the House of Commons
annually. Because this is a significant matter, we have called for a
report to be made annually&#151;rather than once in every Parliament
or once every five years&#151;that would require the Secretary of
State to tell the House of Commons about the number of carers caring
for 20 hours or more and not receiving contribution credits. This
matter is disputed. I understand that the Equal Opportunities
Commission says that about 50,000 carers would be excluded from the
pension system, and I believe that Carers UK thinks that about 40,000
would not be included, even though they are caring for more
than20
hours.</div>

					<a name="0701246000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Baroness Hollis of

Lords&#151;references HL604, HL605 and HL606&#151;seeking the
number and percentage of people on the different levels of benefit,
both included and excluded under the current eligibility criteria, who
receive more than 20 hours of care a week. I shall read parts of the
answer as it is relevant to the amendments. It
states:</div>
					<a name="0701246000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Estimates
from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) 2004-05 indicate that
approximately 100,000 people are in receipt of incapacity benefit, but
not the middle or higher rate care component of disability living
allowance, and are receiving care for 20 hours or more a

					<a name="0701246000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those 100,000
people would not be eligible for contributions credits under the
eligibility criteria defined in the Bill. The answer
continues:</div>
					<a name="0701246000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
data also suggest that approximately 300,000 people are receiving the
lower rate of disability living allowance and are receiving care for 20
hours or more a week.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i> 17 January 2007; Vol. 688, c.
WA153.]</div>
					<a name="0701246000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">That makes 400,000 people
in total. Their carers might be caring for 20 hours or more a week as
well as holding down a full-time job and therefore paying national
insurance contributions. I am not saying that there are 400,000 people
whose sole activity is caring and who are not part of the pensions
system by virtue of making contributions. However, unless we have a
detailed breakdown, it will be impossible for us to estimate the scale
of the problem to which the hon. Members for Yeovil and for Solihull
have rightly drawn our attention. If we do not know the size of the
problem, we do not know the price tag either. We need the basic
information to be set out annually, and I am grateful to have had the
questions asked by Baroness Hollis drawn to my attention.</div>
					<a name="0701246000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said, the reason why
we have called for an annual report is the importance of the issue.
Carers UK estimates that there are 6 million carers in the UK, a
quarter of whom&#151;1.5 million&#151;care for 50 or more hours a
week. I suspect that many of them find it extremely difficult to pay
national insurance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 56</div>contributions as well, although no doubt some of them do so. As has been
mentioned, Carers UK estimates that there could be as many as 9 million
carers in the UK by 2037. We know that 1.5 million carers are more than
60 years of age and that one fifth of carers over60 report
that their health is not good. Those people face severe stress and
strain in the their everyday
lives.</div>
					<a name="0701246000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any of us can be
a carer at any time. Carers are not a separate class or group of
people, detached from the rest of us, who have a caring vocation. Some
of us in the Committee may even have been carers. I had a disabled
mother when I was younger and, although I am not sure whether I would
have classed myself as a carer as such, I certainly knew what it was
like as a child to care for an adult. It will probably be the common
experience of most of us in the room to care for aged parents or
relatives in the
future.</div>

grateful to Carers UK for raising with Committee members six different
examples in which people would be excluded from the eligibility
criteria for contribution credits as specified by clause 3 or by the
related regulations. For example, there are people with mental health
issues who are advised to claim the relevant disability living
allowances, but because of their state of mind do not do so. The people
who care for the mentally ill people in that group would not qualify
for credits.</div>

about someone caring for several people,none of whom is on the
prescribed benefits? The responsibility on that carer could
be&#151;in fact, is likely to be&#151;even greater than that on a
carer of just one person who is on the prescribed benefits. What about
those people who overturn on appeal their rates of benefit so that at
some point in the future they receive the benefits that make them
eligible for credits? When they were on the lesser benefit, their carer
would not have been entitled to contribution credits. Does the carer
have any right of eligibility to the contribution credits from those
missed years? They are all practical cases, the type of case that all
Members might have brought to them at their constituency surgery on any
given Friday of the year.</div>
					<a name="0701246000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">What about those people who need
significant care but do not receive disability living allowance? What
about those people with fluctuating conditions, who sometimes have
severe needs but at other times are relatively well and do not need
care? If one is a close family member who cares for them, one knows
that there is a possibility of remission and that they will need
serious care later on. It is not easy to go back into the labour market
while the person for whom one has cared is well, knowing that at any
moment they will slide down into illness and need full-time
care.</div>
					<a name="0701246000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">What about those
people going into hospital long enough to lose their benefits? There
are reasons for the withdrawal of benefits when one goes into hospital.
One is fed, does not have central heating bills and so on. I understand
the rationale, but again I speak from family experience. When my mother
was in hospital on various occasions, there was an acute necessity for
my sister and for other members of the family to be in close attendance
because my mother was severely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 57</div>disabled. Will such carers also lose out because someone has gone into
hospital long enough to lose their benefits?</div>
					<a name="0701246000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to Carers UK for
providing Committee members with those six examples. Is the
Minister&#146;s mind still open to suggestions about how to ensure
that all carers have a better pensions safety net? He, like me,
attended a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on ageing and
older people on 5 December. I do not know whether the minutes of that
meeting are accurate, but they certainly say that the Government were
still open to suggestions about how to ensure that all carers had a
better pensions safety net. If that is true, I shall listen with
interest to the Minister&#146;s response.</div>

the relationship between the worthiness of a cause and the price
attached to it. I am surprised that she cannot understand the link
between the two. I am sure that on a Saturday morning, when she goes
down to her local supermarket or shopping centre, she wants to buy many
items that are worthy and that would add to her life, but, like the

						</b> I stand duly and correctly rebuked. The hon. Lady
is quite right and I am grateful to her for picking that up. I meant to
say nothing bad about carers and I hope that, given what I have said
about them up until now, she will accept that that was a slip of the
tongue. I meant the payment of national insurance contributions. I
agree with her that parents and carers do some of the most important
work in the United Kingdom. She is quite right&#151;that cannot be
said too strongly or often. I thank her for pulling me up on
it.</div>
					<a name="0701246000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall move on to
new clause 17, which is in my name, that of my hon. Friend the Member
for Eastbourne and that of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Milton Keynes&#151;our esteemed Whip. I confess that I wrote the new
clause, in my own hand, on Second Reading. I was prompted to do so by
the powerful and persuasive speech from the hon. Member for Burton
(Mrs. Dean). She happens to be a Labour 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div>Member, but her point could have been made by any Opposition Member and
would have been, I hope, if such a case had been brought to one of us
by a
constituent.</div>
					<a name="0701246000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly,
without going over the whole of the hon. Lady&#146;s speech on Second
Reading, the case to which she drew the House&#146;s attention
related to a Mr. and Mrs. Cartwright&#151;she
named them so I feel free to do so&#151;who contacted her in August
2005 about the payment of child benefit into their joint back account.
Mrs. Cartwright was not in paid employment making national
insurance contributions, but looking after their children. However,
Mr. Cartwright&#146;s was the first name on the joint bank
account and, therefore, their child benefit was deemed to have been
allocated to him rather than to Mrs. Cartwright. That was
despite the fact that he was making national insurance contributions
and had a paid job, and Mrs. Cartwright was at home looking
after their children.</div>
					<a name="0701246000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apparently, Mr. and
Mrs. Cartwright should have received form CH718 which, when
child benefit is being paid into a joint bank account, enables a couple
to specify to whom the child benefit should be paid, which, of course,
triggers the allocation of home responsibilities protection to the
correct member of the couple. The Cartwrights said that they never
received form CH718 which, some 20 years later, is almost impossible to
prove. The question that the hon. Lady asked is whether anyone
knowingly would waive their right to home responsibilities protection
when shehad been caring for her children and not in paid
employment earning national insurance
contributions.</div>
					<a name="0701246000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I gather
that such a case is not isolated. The hon. Member for Burton is one of
your fellow Chairmen on the Chairman&#146;s Panel, Mr.
Taylor. If I am not mistaken, I have had the pleasure of serving under
her in Committee. She went on to
say:</div>
					<a name="0701246000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Pensions
Advisory Service produced a document entitled &#145;Report on Women
and Pensions Helpline&#146;, which was theresult of a pilot
helpline available from 18 October to10 December
2004.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701246000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was clear that
the problem was widespread. The hon. Lady cited the report:</div>
					<a name="0701246000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some enquiries came from
individuals where the child benefit was being paid to the working
partner rather than the partner who had given up work or was working
reduced hours to look after the couple&#146;s
children.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 16 January 2007; Vol.
455, c.721-22.]</div>
					<a name="0701246000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
rightly gender-neutral in Committee, but there were cases when a
stay-at-home husband had not received the allocation of home
responsibilities protection. Whether it is a matter of fathers losing
out on HRP or mothers such as Mrs. Cartwright doing so, the
case is the same. We cannot really believe that anyone would willingly
lose out on &#163;32 a week in pension entitlement, as happened to
the Cartwrights, if it had been easy to establish early on who wished
to be allocated home responsibilities
protection.</div>
					<a name="0701246000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the hon. Lady has raised the matter with the Minister.
Indeed, she has discussed the case with him. I hope that it will not
again be a matter of the computer not being able to rectify the
problem. In all seriousness, I understand the difficulties that
surround information technology. The issues are serious; I am not
making light of them. However, when there has been an administrative
mistake of such a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>nature, I should have hoped that, even with a manual override, it could
be solved. Given the evidence of the Pensions Advisory Service, clearly
the problem has affected more than one couple. I hope that it has not
happened in hundreds of thousands of
cases.</div>
					<a name="0701246000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">It should not be
beyond the wit of the Department and its staff to do something about
the problem. I am not talking about a matter that would cost the
Government any money. It is about unfairness; it is about making sure
that what happens is what should have happened and what the couple
intended to happen. It is a minor technical point, but exactly the sort
of matter that should be properly raised in Committee. I, for one, am
pleased to have been able to bring the hon. Lady&#146;s concern
before hon.
Members.</div>

						</b> This has been another important debate and I want
to respond to the many points that have been made. If I do not reply to
some, I shall be happy to write to hon. Members particularly about the
six cases that were mentioned so rapidly. I shall pick them up in
writing, if I may do
so.</div>
					<a name="0701246000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to start on
the theoretical money grotto&#151;rather than tree&#151;from where
the hon. Member for Solihull was planning to fetch her money to pay for
the commitments that the Liberal Democrats are making. I am afraid that
she will be sorely disappointed if she goes there because half of the
money that she has identified is extra money that the Department would
be spending if every single person who is eligible for pension credit
took up its benefits. That is clearly not money that is sitting around
in a vault ready for the Liberal Democrats to spend&#151;not an
uncapped source of it&#151;but extra money.</div>
					<a name="0701246000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Eastbourne
was quite right to say that estimates of the contracted-out rebates
have changed since the White Paper. We set that out inthe
regulatory impact assessment&#151;the figure was&#163;1.6
billion. It is worth noting that the contracted-out rebate needs to be
seen in the context of the long-term spending implications of the
system, specifically long-term spending on the state second pension
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 60</div>would be incurred if more people were to contract into the system.
Therefore it is again not possible to say that we can take that money
and spend it as we
wish.</div>

							<a name="0701246000326"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I do not want to interrupt the Minister while he
is dragging the Liberal Democrats back to the real world, but will he
give an undertaking that when discussing that part of the Bill, he will
have at his fingertips an explanation for where this &#163;2 billion
has gone? It has not been very long between the White Paper and the
drafting of the regulatory impact assessment and while these sums may
not mean a lot to the Treasury in the great scheme of things, it does
seem a lot of money to have
overstated.</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701246000327"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I am happy to do that. It is not an overstatement
but different trends in people contracting into the system. We have
also received updated figures which we fed into our projections.
However, I do not want to test your patience, Mr. Taylor, on
the definition of the clause so I will move rapidly on to the costs of
these proposals.</div>
					<a name="0701246000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Compared to the basic state
pension figures, these are relatively modest single-figure millions
because we are talking about a very small gap in the number of carers
that could be covered. However, there would be a significant long-term
cost to these proposals. On the state second pension side, we would be
accruing&#163;400 million by 2050. The key point in looking
at individual amendments is whether they effectively target the 40,000
people who we do not think are currently covered by these
proposals.</div>
					<a name="0701246000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
restating that the major part of the progress on carers is achieved by
reducing the number of qualifying years to 30. That is the change that
achieves the greatest increase in entitlement for people who are
caring. We have been consistently clear that our research suggests that
that would not, on its own, meet carers&#146; needs.</div>
					<a name="0701246000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">This provision is about a
specific proportion ofthe people who are caring. Those who
care for over35 hours a week are already entitled to carer's
allowance because they received class 1 national insurance credits.
Those who care for less than 20 hours a week appear to have similar
work patterns to the rest of the population and can therefore build up
their entitlement through their own national insurance
contributions.</div>
					<a name="0701246000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, our evidence suggests
that those who care for more than 20 hours a week do have their job
opportunities affected and therefore the carer&#146;s credit is aimed
at that group. It is an important backstop for those who would have
less than 30 years&#146; contributions without it.</div>
					<a name="0701246000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Information from the family
resources survey suggests that around 160,000 people will be caring for
more than 20 hours a week but not building up entitlement to the basic
state pension in 2010.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman may wish to consult the gender
impact assessment that we published, which set out the figures in
detail. The figures that were published in the May White Paper were
then updated in November. There were more people who were eligible,
again on the basis of new information that we had received. So there is
a higher overall proportion of people who we think could benefit from
the change that we are introducing.</div>

Hollis on 17 January&#151;that is really very recent
indeed.</div>
					<a name="0701246000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said that it
is entirely possible that those 400,000 people are paying some form of
national insurance contribution. We know that they are all caring for
more than 20 hours a week, but we need more detail on exactly where
they fit; whether they are in work and paying national insurance
contributions, or if they are purely carrying out a caring role. On the
basis of the definitions in the clause, they would miss out on
contribution credit. If the Minister is unable to give more information
on that issue now, perhaps he would agree to write to every member of
the Committee with a little more analysis regarding the answers
received on 17 January.</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="0701246000331"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman that
assurance.</div>
					<a name="0701246000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
is precisely targeted and we have been clear all the way through that
it could still leave 40,000 carers who might not be entitled. Of
course, that does not mean that they will miss out on a full basic
state pension. Other provisions in the Bill, such as the measure
requiring 30 qualifying years, will ensure that they are more likely to
get close to the full basic state pension than they would under the
current system. Furthermore, research suggests that not all carers will
remain in that position for the whole of their working
lives.</div>
					<a name="0701246000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not put
the definition of &#147;caring&#148; in the Bill. That is because
we are introducing a new credit and we believe that it is essential to
use the flexibility offered by secondary legislation so that we can
make changes if we find that the definition is not meeting the needs of
carers. However, we have set out our current plans for that definition
in the delegated powers memorandum. Our intention is to provide the
credit for someone who is caring for 20 hours or more each week for one
or more people in receipt of attendance allowance, the higher or middle
rate care component of disability living allowance, or constant
attendance
allowance.</div>
					<a name="0701246000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to explain why we have chosen that option. When we were
consulting on this new credit, the lobby groups involved clearly said
to us that they did not want us to create an overly bureaucratic
system, in which people would have to demonstrate the number of hours
for which they were claiming, there would potentially be inspections of
that number of hours, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div>
						there would be a significant amount of paperwork for
the carer. Therefore, we have sought to design a system that will be
based on self-certification. However, to ensure that there is a
safeguard against misapplication of this credit, we are requiring that
the person being cared for is claiming a benefit that would typically
require the level of care of 20 hours a week.</div>
					<a name="0701246000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not a perfect measure,
but it is a good fit with our policy objective, and balances simplicity
and targeting. It is because of the existence of the benefit being
claimed by the person being cared for that we can be flexible in the
way that the carer self-certifies, so that they can receive the
credit.</div>
					<a name="0701246000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
63 would extend radically the range of benefits that could be
identified. I do not intend to go through each benefit that is listed,
but in most cases I do not think that significant care is a condition
for receiving the benefit. In fact, the majority of people in receipt
of the other benefits covered in the amendment will not require care
for 20 hours a week. In trying to extend coverage to the 40,000 or so
carers, the amendment would widen the eligibility to a vast number of
carers. The amendment is clearly out of proportion with the issue that
we are seeking to address.</div>

							<a name="0701246000332"></a>Mr.

						</b> It may be that the Minister was going to do this in
his speech, but can he indicate whether he is still sympathetic to the
possibility of introducing, perhaps later in the stages of the Bill,
additional amendments that seek to target those 40,000
carers,or does he feel that the Government, because of
practicalities or other reasons, have for the time being reached the
end of the line on their generosity in this
area?</div>

					<a name="0701246000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
sympathise with the intention to ensure that as many carers as possible
are eligible for the credit, I am not at all persuaded that the blanket
approach proposed is an appropriate way
forward.</div>
					<a name="0701246000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 26 and 61 suggest that the level of and need for care should be
certified by either a health or social care professional, or local
social services authority. We are happy to explore this option. It has
the attraction that it could be effectively targeted at carers who
might fall between the gaps of the benefits that are identified in the
Bill. However, I must warn the Committee that there are significant
issues about how it would be implemented that would need to be
addressed before we could be confident that itwould work.
Those issues include whether health professionals would have the
expertise to quantify the hours of care, whether they would require
payment and how the new requirement on local authorities would fit into
our overall approach to carers. In any case, there would need to be
consultation of representatives of those who would carry out the new
duties before we could decide how to
proceed.</div>
					<a name="0701246000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
discussing the issue with the Department of Health and will report back
before the end of the passage of the Bill through both Houses of
Parliament. The important point is that any extension of eligibility
along these lines could be done under regulations made possible by the
Bill as drafted.</div>

						New clause 15
would impose a requirement to publish an annual report on whether the
provisions to bring more carers into the state pensions system
constitute the right approach. These reforms are a coherent package and
there are a number of ways in which they benefit carers. I suspect that
the new clause is a probing one, but I urge my colleagues to resist it
if it is pressed to a vote. That is because the information is already
available from a number of sources, including the departmental report,
the Government Actuary&#146;s Department quinquennial review and the

Reading that we were convinced of her argument and would introduce
measures in regulations made under the Bill to allow the problem to be
rectified. The hon. Gentleman is welcome to look at the end of that

					<a name="0701246000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">It transpired
that, for various reasons, unusually the parent who took time out of
work to look after their children was not awarded the child benefit;
instead, it was awarded to the parent who was working. The effect was
that the parent who needed home responsibilities protection did not get
it because a person is entitled to HRP only if they have been awarded
child benefit. The new clause is designed to correct the outcome that
such inflexibility may produce.</div>
					<a name="0701246000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, we made it clear on
Second Reading that we intend to deal with the problem through powers
taken in the Bill, but we so not want to include in the Bill the level
of detail proposed. We intend to build an element of flexibility into
the new regulations, so that eligibility for the new credit will
continue to be linked to the award of child benefit. Where it is
evident that one member of the couple has missed out on the credits
because the other member of the couple is the child benefit payee but
does not need the new credits&#151;for example, because they are
working&#151;our intention is to allow the parent who has been caring
for the children to benefit from the credits.</div>

they will end up on pensioner credit, so the Government will pay one
way or another. Of course, 20 per cent. of people who are entitled to
pension credit do not claim it, so it would be a hollow saving, as
those people would not be claiming money to which they were entitled.
The point is that such people are missing out. They are not scrounging;
they are earning the right to pension credit, but they do not meet the

Burt:
						</b> This is a simple amendment that would apply fairly
to individuals, particularly women, who change their entitlements to
different benefits and go in and out of work within a tax year.
Currently, women who receive home responsibilities protection do so
only for full tax years during which they do not work. The amendment
would allow women to be granted the new pension credit on a much fairer
week-by-week tax basis that would reflect more closely the periods for
which they ought to be granted pension
credit.</div>
					<a name="0701246000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">A woman who
returns to work will lose any entitlement to home responsibilities
protection for the whole tax year unless she returns on 6 April. Our
proposed system would mean that her pension income for that tax year
would be protected at whatever point she decides to return to work. It
should not be more complicated to implement, as national insurance
contributions are calculated weekly anyway. I hope that the Minister is
prepared to reflect on it. Women&#146;s employment tends to be a lot
more sporadic than men&#146;s. We discussed earlier the need for
flexibility regarding times when caring is needed and when women can
return to work. I hope that the Government will agree to this small and
inexpensive adjustment to restore
fairness.</div>

periods spent caring, either as a parent or as a carer, to be converted

credits.</div>
					<a name="0701246000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">We understand
what the hon. Lady is trying to achieve, but it is none the less
retrospective legislation and, like a number of Liberal Democrat
amendments, would come with a price tag. She did not say in her remarks
how much it would cost; I fear I shall have to rely on the Minister yet
again to supply a price tag for a Liberal Democrat policy proposal. It
will not be the first time, and I do not suppose that it will be the
last. I would also be interested to know from the hon. Lady how it
would be paid
for.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701246000350"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I thank the hon. Member for Solihull for the
amendment as it gives us an opportunity to set out our proposals for
replacing the present scheme.</div>
					<a name="0701246000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all agree that, since 1978,
home responsibilities protection has played an important role in
improving the entitlement of women and carers to the basic state
pension. However, HRP is complicated and hard to understand because,
rather than adding qualifying years, it reduces the number of years
required for a full basic state pension. Our proposals are intended to
change that. Clause 3 will replace HRP from 2010 with a simpler and
more generous system of credits for parents and carers to help them to
receive an enhanced basic state pension. Those credits will ensure that
the state pension system recognises contributions from caring on a par
with contributions from working.</div>
					<a name="0701246000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be easier for the
Committee if I first explain Government amendments Nos. 47 and 48. They
are minor technical amendments that seek to remove any ambiguity around
the number of HRP years that will be converted to qualifying years
under the new crediting arrangements. It would be difficult to combine
a HRP system that reduced the number of qualifying years with a
reformed system of credits for parents and carers that would help
people build up qualifying years. We are proposing to convert HRP years
acquired before 2010 to qualifying years. That means that each HRP year
that someone has before 2010 would derive 52 class 3 contribution
credits. However, under the current system, a person can only get HRP
for up to half of the requisite years in their working life. That means
that a man reaching state pension age in 2010 would be able to build up
a maximum of 22 years of HRP&#151;half the 44 qualifying years
currently needed for full basic state pension. So far, so relatively
simple, but for women the position is more complicated. A woman
reaching state pension age in 2010 would be eligible for up to 19 years
of HRP, rising to 20 between 2010 and 2012 and 22 by 2020, in line with
the equalisation of the state pension age.The Government
amendments seek to remove the ambiguity around the maximum number of
years that people can build up HRP.</div>
					<a name="0701246000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 will
allow a maximum of 22 years of HRP acquired before 6 April 2010 to be
converted. That is more generous for women than the present upper
limit. We set the maximum at 22 years because that is the upper limit
for men and will be the upper limit for women in 2020. If we did not
set such a maximum upper limit, there might be some doubt 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 67</div>about the number of HRP years that could be converted into credits.
These technical amendments address that.</div>
					<a name="0701246000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 27, I hope that
the hon. Lady will be reassured by my comments. As I mentioned, HRP has
been available for complete tax years in which a person is caring and
unable to work&#151;either because they are caring for severely
disabled people or for children. The majority of people benefiting from
HRP receive it for their parenting contributions. The hon. Lady is
right to say that many people do not get full years of HRP when they
first have a child. Part years of parenting or caring do not attract
any HRP; they are therefore not recorded as part of someone&#146;s
contribution history. That is, of course, precisely why we are moving
to a system of weekly credits.</div>
					<a name="0701246000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have already said that we
intend to treat all years of HRP as qualifying years. The amendment
would, however, make a further transitional change to the way in which
HRP has operated by recognising part years through the new crediting
arrangements. Committee members should remember that the changes we are
making through clause 3 are being made alongside a raft of other
beneficial measures, including the introduction of a single
contribution condition through clause 1.</div>
					<a name="0701246000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those reaching state pension age
on or after 6 April 2010 will need just 30 years for a full basic state
pension. Combined with what we are doing through clause 3, that will
mean that approximately three quarters of women will reach state
pension age in 2010 with a full BSP. More than half of the remainder
will get more than 60 per cent. of the full rate&#151;more than the
category B so-called married person&#146;s
pension.</div>
				
					<a name="0701246000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">My key point to the hon. Lady is
that her amendment would have very little effect on top of that
significant change; the reduction to 30 years achieves her goal.
Awarding credits for part-years of HRP would have little or no extra
effect. Under the current system, most people would normally have only
two incomplete years in which they had not been covered by
HRP&#151;one when they started caring for their child and one at the
end. The reduction in qualifying years to 30 more than makes up for
that possible gap in their contribution history.</div>
					<a name="0701246000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">No doubt the hon. Lady will say
that her amendment involves something marginal and ask why we do not
agree to it. The problem is that the administrative burden would be
extremely significant. What she argues for is not worth doing; her
overall goal is already achieved through the reduction to 30 years.
Accepting the amendment would create significant administrative work. A
person&#146;s work and caring history of the past 30 years would have
to be looked into to uncover gaps in an individual&#146;s
contribution history.</div>

benefit would be significantly outweighed by the administrative burden

under the hon. Lady&#146;s proposal. However, we have no similar

He said that people who have missing part-years tend to have just
two&#151;one at the start and one at the end. I think that he was
basing that on the assumption that the majority of people qualifying
will be parents and that the missing part-years would be at the start
and end of parenting time.</div>

Minister could confirm my understanding that this will apply to
children under the age of 18 as far as foster parents are concerned.
So, within this proposed new subsection, we have children under 12
being eligible on one hand, and children under 18 being eligible on the
other.</div>
					<a name="0701246000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the
Government sometimes have to be careful. They have made statements in
pre-Budget reports&#151;and elsewhere, in the associated
notes&#151;talking of their view that adult dependency is an outdated
concept. I think that is more or less a quote from a pre-Budget report
document. A carer looking after either children or an ageing or sick
family member may by nature be a dependent relative on some other
family member who is in paid employment. So, that touches quite
important, wider social issues. It may be purely the financial cost,
which I would not say was wholly unreasonable, but the Committee need
to probe slightly to find out Government thinking on this particular
point.</div>

							<a name="0701246000361"></a>John
Penrose:
						</b> This clause is an essential step towards the
righting of an essential wrong relating to the unfair treatment of
women&#146;s pensions over many yearsand, more broadly, the
pensions of carers, who are predominantly women. It is one of the best
aspects of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="0701246000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">In particular, I was delighted
to see that the clause involves a degree of simplification. As the
Minister said earlier, almost everywhere else, the language of pensions
and the contributory principle is about adding years&#151;building up
a pot of rights and contributions&#151;and creating a sense of saving
for one&#146;s retirement. Almost uniquely, the HRP talks of reducing
years. Not only is that a complication of language, but of
administration and systems as well. Clearly, it makes sense to put the
new equivalent to that system&#151;I appreciate it is a like-for-like
comparison in terms of being fiscally neutral and so forth&#151;and
related language on all fours with the rest of the pensions
world.</div>
					<a name="0701246000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also makes
sense to put across a notion of equivalence to paid employment. The
hon. Member for Northampton, North picked up on what we were saying
earlier in order to ensure that we were not talking about people who
were working, but those in paid and unpaid work. Such unpaid work is
tremendously important, and the clause not just symbolically, but
actually ensures that it is valued and put on the same basis as paid
work. For that reason alone, the clause is to be welcomed, as well as
for its simplification of the systems and processes involved,
particularly given the fact that we have one of the most complicated
pensions systems in the entire developed
world.</div>

							<a name="0701246000362"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I do not want to detain the Committeefor
long, but the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire raised an
important point. Rather than 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 71</div>interrupt the Minister in mid-flow, I would like to reinforce our
interest in hearing an explanation of how the proposal relating to the
care of and responsibilities for children at particular ages ties into
other parts of the Government&#146;s thinking on the responsibilities
of parents. Parents in the UK are allowed to remain on income support
until their youngest child is 16, without work responsibilities or
having to go on to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. I wonder whether this
change is a precursor to wider changes in the way that the Government
interpret parents&#146; responsibilities towards their children and
towards
work.</div>

							<a name="0701246000363"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> To answer the specific point about foster carers,
registered foster carers are covered until the child that they are
caring for is 18 because of payments being made to them. They may have
to provide more significant care for older children than might be the
case for other families and it is not untypical for their working
patterns to be affected by their responsibilities as a foster carer.
The principle is to examine how people&#146;s ability to work is
affected.</div>
					<a name="0701246000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
nothing particularly theological about the age specified. I sense the
waters in which those on the Opposition Benches are tempting me to
swim, but I shall stay firmly on the shore. The clause is simply
intended to simplify the system: there were different conditions for
the basic state pension and the state second pension. We have increased
one and reduced the other. I hope that I will be able to explain how
that makes the overall system much more generous for those who care for
parents. It is not in any way a restriction on the support we give to
parents.</div>

wider thinking of the Government on the role of parents looking after
children up to the age of 12 and
beyond.</div>

Gentleman the reassurance that he
seeks.</div>
					<a name="0701246000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have covered
the fact that the system will be much more transparent than it is now.
HRP is complicated, and one of the further complications is that it was
possible to get a basic state pension contribution for a child under
the age of 16, but with a state second pension that was possible only
for a child under the age of six. Under the proposals, a class 3
contribution will instead be credited for each week in which a person
is either awarded child benefit for a child under 12, classed as an
approved foster parent or engaged in other forms of caring, which I
shall come to later.</div>
					<a name="0701246000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been rightly pointed out,
the age is currently 16. We have lowered that, but it is important to
note that no one will lose out from those changes, for two 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 72</div>reasons. First, the move to 30 qualifying years for a full basic state
pension in clause 1 more than compensates for the move to age 12.
Secondly, for the first time, through the provisions in clause 9, there
be will a credit in respect of the state second pension for those
awarded child benefit for a child aged between six and 12. Taken as a
whole, the Bill therefore improves state pension outcomes for parents
and carers. As before, foster parents will need to make a claim to
ensure that they build up entitlement to the basic state pension,
although under clause 9 they will also accrue entitlement to the state
second pension.</div>
					<a name="0701246000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
promised, I shall say a couple of words about those engaged in caring.
I assure hon. Members that the clause indeed makes provision for HRP
years acquired before 2010. As we have discussed, there will be a
maximum of 22 years, which we can convert. The clause includes a
regulation-making power, in proposed new section 23A(3) of the Social
Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, to prescribe those who
may be said to be engaged in caring. The reason we have done that and
resisted earlier amendments is to give ourselves flexibility, which
this debate has again demonstrated will be necessary. The goal of
helping carers to build up contributions when they cannot do so through
national insurance contributions is widely shared, but the way of doing
that might change over time. It is therefore important to give
ourselves the right
flexibility.</div>
					<a name="0701246000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, the regulations will allow the flexibility to ensure that
carers can continue to be awarded the credit for up to four weeks
during which such conditions are not satisfied, such as where the carer
has fallen ill. There will also be a range of other technical details
in the regulations, to allow us successfully to deliver class 3
contribution credits for those engaged in caring. Copies of the
delegated powers memorandum, which sets out further how we intend to
use the power in the clause, have been placed in the House. I therefore
propose that the clause as amended stand part of the Bill. I also thank
the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare for his kind comments about the
clause.</div>

proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701246000368"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I am sorry for rising belatedly to speak, but I
was under the impression that, as there are no amendments, the Minister
would introduce the clause. However, let us proceed the other way
round, just for fun.</div>
					<a name="0701246000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
first blush, one might think that the clause is pretty uncontroversial.
Indeed, that might yet prove to be the case. It certainly has no
enemies, because nobody has tabled any amendments to it; but does that
mean that it is a wholly innocent part of the Bill? There might yet be
a torrent of written evidence stacking up somewhere&#151;it has not
reached me, but presumably 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 73</div>someone would be looking at it&#151;but, as far as I recall, no
outside body has taken it upon itself to make representations about the
clause to us either. It might therefore be quite easy to write off
adult dependency increases as just an historical anomaly&#151;an
outdated matter that needs to be tidied up round the edges, as part of
the wider reform.</div>
					<a name="0701246000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there are a few issues
that I should like the Minister to deal with in his summing-up. The
first is the extent of the savings likely to be made by scrapping ADIs.
Figures have been bandied around in supporting documents, but I shall
deal with them in more detail in a moment. The second is the extent to
which there will be net losers as a result of the proposals and how
many there will
be.</div>
					<a name="0701246000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, it is
perhaps an indication of the strange status of clause 4 that one must
fall back on the excellent Library brief to find out the effect of the
provision. I have to say that ADIs have not featured high on my list of
interests within the DWP brief until fairly recently. According to the
brief, however, a married man on the basic state pension can claim an
increase for his wife provided that she does not have earnings or an
occupational pension of more than &#163;57.45 a week. That is paid at
the same rate as the category B pension, about which we heard so much
earlier. A married woman can claim a dependency increase for her
husband only if she received an increase in incapacity benefit for him
immediately before she qualified for her own pension. It is perhaps not
surprising, therefore, that according to the brief, more than 99 per
cent. of adult dependency increase recipients are men. That figure is
based on DWP
statistics.</div>
					<a name="0701246000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The White
Paper announced that ADIs will be abolished in April 2010. It might
help if I quote the reason for that given in the White
Paper:</div>
					<a name="0701246000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
conclusion is that the concept of &#145;dependency&#146; on which
the ADI provisions are based has little relevance in today&#146;s
society in which partnerships of equals are the
norm.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701246000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may, I shall
come back to that in a moment. Again, as I understand it, all existing
entitlements to ADI will be protected up until 2020. On the question of
possible losers, as I understand it, the average weekly pension for a
person with a category A pension with no dependants was &#163;94.77,
but for those with adult dependants it rose to &#163;144.51. In May
2006, 59,000 were in that category&#151;pensions with an
ADI&#151;at a cost of &#163;160 million. Some 59 per cent. of
recipients are men aged 65 to 69. One begins to see the shape of any
likely overall saving in that &#163;160 million
figure.</div>
					<a name="0701246000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Child
dependency is another issue. Any new claimants were effectively shut
off as a result of the Tax Credits Act 2002, but existing ones
continued to receive increases. Again, in May 2006, 5,300 pensioners
received an increase for a dependent child. The average increase was
&#163;104.63. The clause would abolish such increases to pensioners
caring for children. I have made the point already that new claimants
are dealt with under the child tax credits legislation. According to
comments in the debate on 6 January 2006, overall savings, as a result
of the abolition, will be about&#163;500 million by 2015,
and about &#163;1.2 billion by 2020. It will be interesting to hear
from the Minister whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 74</div>those figures have changed in the interim. The Department has estimated
that 660,000 people would otherwise have received increases in
2020.</div>
					<a name="0701246000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is interesting
that, as the Library briefing points out, this part of the Bill has
received so little comment outside this place&#151;in fact, I feel
sort of guilty to be the first to add a comment. Perhaps people do not
appreciate what is happening, do not understand the way in which it
works, or have not done the calculations. I am not in a position to
comment. However, there has been intervention by <i class="I">Saga Magazine</i>,
which, as we all know, is a powerful voice for the over-50s and offers
a very decent rate of insurance for those of us who have passed that
magic milestone. Paul Lewis, in the magazine&#146;s guide to pensions
reform in August 2006&#151;I am sure that it has been required
reading for all members of the Committee&#151;made the point that the
scrapping of new claims for the dependency increase will result in some
pensioners being worse off than others because of reaching pension age
the wrong side of 5 April 2010. That has the potential to be another
cliff-edge or steep-incline problem, and it needs to be addressed. One
sentence of Mr. Lewis&#146;s piece
reads:</div>
					<a name="0701246000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
will be a lot of people who will fall just the wrong side of this line
and who will get a much smaller pension than someone in the same
circumstances just a few days
younger.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701246000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">He says
&#147;a lot of people&#148;. What is the Minister&#146;s current
estimate of that
number?</div>
					<a name="0701246000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s position, of which we will hear more in a moment,
appears to be that the transitional arrangements will protect people
already receiving ADIs up to 10 years from now and that the money
saved&#151;it would be interesting to have the net figure&#151;will
provide better state pensions, particularly for women. Like the savings
made on contracted-out rebates, that is an example of money being
ploughed back into the pensions
system.</div>
					<a name="0701246000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The gender
impact document published with the Bill contains some rather delphic
comments on the matter. It points out that ADIs will be abolished under
the reform proposals and
states:</div>
					<a name="0701246000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
increases are less necessary where both members of the couple are
likely to be economically active and can also act as a disincentive for
women to work up until the State Pension
age.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701246000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to say that
it sounds to me as though the amounts involved are not likely to be
sufficient to stop a woman working until pension age if that is what
she wants to do.</div>
					<a name="0701246000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulatory impact assessment states at page 29 that the rationale
is</div>
					<a name="0701246000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the principle that the
reforms would enable a person to accrue pension entitlement in their
own right.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701246000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is fair
enough.</div>
					<a name="0701246000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
abolition of adult dependency increases removes a disincentive for
women to continue in work up to at least State Pension age and the
Government&#146;s position is that the principle of dependency in the
benefit system is
outdated.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701246000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems a
sweeping statement. Yes, as we constantly hear, and no doubt will in
the Committee, we have moved on from the days of Beveridge when the man
went out to work and the woman stayed at home, brought up the children,
looked after elderly relatives and usually never went back into the
jobs market. That has changed out of all recognition, but even in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 75</div>most modern societies there will be some dependency in the system. My
hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire touched on that
point in our previous debate. If the Government hope, by diktat, to
scrap the concept of dependency altogether, they are making a
mistake.</div>
					<a name="0701246000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">To summarise,
I have raised three broad issues that I wish the Minister to deal with:
first, the likely savings arising from the change, which he is
apparently relying on to help finance the rest of the pensions reform
package; secondly, whether there will be any losers in real terms; and
thirdly, whether he accepts that there will be situations in which,
through no fault of the individuals involved, dependency still exists
and where some people may be part of the group of potential losers that
I have
mentioned.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701246000369"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has given the clause a good
airing and I do not intend to go back over the wider issues that he has
raised. I do wish to make a couple of specific points. The hon.
Gentleman is right that relatively little attention has been paid to
the elements of clause 4 that he mentioned. Indeed, the Work and
Pensions Committee did not cover the issue during the course of its
inquiry, saying so specifically at paragraph 223 of its report, which
simply picks up and quotes from its earlier report, &#147;Incapacity
Benefit and Pathways to Work&#148;, where some concern about the
impact of the changes on people with disabilities is expressed. I
should be grateful if the Minister would tell me whether the potential
concerns have been addressed in any other way, or whether there are any
particular implications for vulnerable groups, such as for people with
disabilities.</div>
					<a name="0701246000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Eastbourne said that he had had no representations on the
clause. We can declare one. The group to be commended is the National
Pensioners Convention, which raised a specific point about the
proposal. I will quote the group in order to give it full
credit:</div>
					<a name="0701246000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Most of
the increases in payment in 2010 will have come to an end before 2020,
as the dependants, of either sex, reach pension age and become entitled
to a pension in their own right. The cost of continuing those still in
payment would therefore be very small. If the increases are to be
abolished, it should be done gradually, over a much longer period, so
that the rights already accrued are
preserved.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701246000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know that the existing clause 4 proposes to protect rights up until 5
April 2020, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne indicated. In addition to
his wider points about costings and effects, it would be particularly
helpful to know from the Minister who would still have some of the
payments owed to them beyond 2020 and who would suffer the loss after
the protected period ends. I should be grateful if the Minister would
let us know how many people he expects to fall into that category and
what the savings will be from bringing the guillotine down in 2020,
rather than allowing the costs to taper away. Also, why have the
Government chosen 2020? Was the issue one of costings, to correspond
with a date when some of the costs of the other pensions reforms really
click in? Was a judgment made that most of the accrued rights would
have been paid off by 2020 and continuing the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 76</div>payments beyond then would be administratively complex? What were the
reasons for choosing that particular
date?</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701246000370"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Scrutinising such a proposal as this is exactly
what the Committee is for. As the Opposition Front Benchers said, the
issue has not been hugely looked at. We had one response in the
consultation, from Carers UK, which agreed that ADIs were outdated.
Other than that, they have not been the top subject of conversation
down in &#147;The Dog and Duck&#148; or, indeed, in pensions
circles.</div>
					<a name="0701246000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
abolishes increases in state pension entitlement in respect of a spouse
or an adult who has the care of the pensioner&#146;s children. The
clause would have effect for new claims from April 2010, but would not
apply to certain existing claims until April 2020. Our big-picture
argument is that the whole concept is outdated. The idea of one person
being dependent upon another purely because of their age is outdated.
When the hon. Member for Eastbourne quoted the remark about adult
dependency being an outdated concept, we do not mean that adults can
never be dependent, just that the particular principle&#151;there
should be a payment to someone who is over state pension age because
their spouse is under state pension age&#151;is, I think, pretty much
agreed by everybody not to be something that anyone would come up with
today. The core reason why abolishing this is important is not so much
because the cost is huge now. However, because of state pension age
equalisation, every couple&#151;unless both were born on the same
day&#151;would in effect have one person who was thought dependent on
the other under the provisions. The costs would increase significantly
over time.</div>
					<a name="0701246000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
the clause intends to remove the provisions in the Social Security
Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 that enable a person claiming a
category A or a category C state pension to receive an increase in
their pension in respect of a spouse or alternatively an adult who
cares for a child on their behalf. I should explain that none of the
increases in respect of category C pensions are in payment, nor will
any arise in the future. That is one of the parts of the legislation
that shows for how long today&#146;s debate will have an effect,
because category C pensions are payable only to people who were over
state pension age in July 1948 and their widows but they are still in
the system and those pensions are still being paid. Only widows remain
and they will not be affected by the changes.</div>
					<a name="0701246000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our intention is that from April
2010 increases of pension in respect of adult dependants will no longer
be available. Any such increases in payment immediately before the
proposed change will cease, if they have not already done so, in 2020.
The clause is part of our policy to simplify the rules for state
pensions. The current dependency increase provisions are a hangover
from the immediate post-war period when single-breadwinner households
were the norm. There is little justification for that in the 21st
century. As I have said, only a small number of people benefit: only
around 65,000 men and a handful of women receive an increase of pension
for an adult dependant. Over the past decade the proportion of men
receiving an increase for an adult dependant has fallen from about 2.5
per cent. to about 1.5 per cent.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 77</div>
					<a name="0701246000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, between 2010 and 2020
those numbers are forecast to increase roughly tenfold for two reasons.
The first is the increase in women&#146;s state pension age, because
the dependency increase provisions benefit only those couples in which
the wife has not reached pension age when the husband claims his
pension&#151;in effect they are applicable only to the minority of
couples where the wife is more than five years younger than the
husband. As women&#146;s pension age increases, the provisions are
set to have far wider application. The second reason is that from 2010
the dependency increase provisions were set to extend to
women&#151;that is to enable a woman to claim an increase of pension
for her husband&#151;and to people in civil partnerships. As a result
the net costs of paying increases foradult dependants were
estimated to rise to around&#163;1.4 billion by
2020.</div>
					<a name="0701246000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Eastbourne will be glad to know that we are reinvesting the money
that will not be spent on our reforms to the state pension scheme. By
taking money out of paying people as dependants, we will be paying
people in their own right. That is why the analogy about a cliff edge
does not quite run. For any couple who retire after 2010, although they
would not get an adult dependency increase, the spouse would get the
benefit of a far more generous pension provision. There is no strict
analogy, as the hon. Member for Yeovil will see, with the issue that we
debated earlier because of the compensating benefits for anyone who
retires after 2010. He is furrowing his brow, so I do not know whether
he wants to intervene.</div>

Laws:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for making those
points. So that I can, perhaps, get my mind around all the issues in my
own time, can he still answer my question about the number of people
affected beyond 2020? If he does not have that information now, perhaps
he could write to the Committee about it so that I can give some
thought to the matter of whether there will be any losers as a
consequence of the changes in the cohort beyond
2020.</div>

						</b> I am struggling to think whether those people
would be affected beyond 2020. I am happy to write to the hon.
Gentleman, but I will come to that later in my speech.</div>
					<a name="0701246000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The savings are not the only
reason for abolishing the increases for dependants. That will be
particularly interesting to those members of the Committee who favour
pension simplification. The rules governing entitlement to those
increases are mind-bogglingly complicated as a result of tinkering by
successive Administrations in order to restrict entitlement. Under the
current rules there are three different earnings limits depending on
whether the dependant is the pensioner&#146;s spouse, living with the
pensioner or employed by the pensioner as a child carer. In addition,
&#147;earnings&#148; does not mean only earnings. The legislative
definition also includes some, but not all, occupational or personal
pensions paid to the dependant. Entitlement to the dependency increase
is determined on a weekly basis, depending on the dependant&#146;s
earnings, either in that week if she is his wife and lives with him or
the previous week if she does not.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 78</div>
					<a name="0701246000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The &#147;earnings&#148;
limits operate on an all-or-nothing basis; if the dependant earns over
the limit, no increase is payable. For example, if a woman&#146;s
husband is claiming an increase for her, even a modest wage increase
can result in withdrawal of the dependency increase, which can create
the disincentive to which the hon. Member for Eastbourne
referred.</div>

					<a name="0701246000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I ask the Minister
to answer two questions. First, leaving aside the potential losers
after 2020, I can see that a tremendous surge of people would then be
entitled. A ballpark figure would be helpful of people who, up to that
date, might well be losers in some shape or form. He is expressing
quite eloquently the complications of ADIs; can he say what estimate
has been made of the take-up level? Presumably people have to fill in
forms, and given the relative anonymity of ADIs until this moment I
assume that the take-up is rather small.</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701246000374"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I shall deal with the point about losers later.
If the hon. Gentleman will trust me on that it would be great. However,
I am happy to tell him that the computer indeed says no to those cases,
as they are not done by the computer; they have to be done clerically
because they are so complicated.</div>
					<a name="0701246000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am sure that the
Committee will agree that these complicated arrangements are difficult
for the customer to understand and for Pension Service staff to
administer. But for all the complexities, increases for adult
dependants are of little or no help to the poorest pensioners, as the
increase is simply offset against the pension credit guarantee credit
and other income-related benefits. Indeed, to pick up on one of the
points raised by the hon. Member for Yeovil, ADIs are not paid if the
dependant is getting a disability benefit such as incapacity benefit in
his or her own right.</div>
					<a name="0701246000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						For those reasons
we propose to remove these outdated provisions in two
stages&#151;first, by abolishing increases for adult dependants for
new claims from April 2010; and secondly, by ceasing to pay them in
transitionally protected cases from April 2020. The transitionally
protected cases will be those where entitlement was established before
6 April 2010.</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">We anticipate that payment of
the increase will have ceased before 2020 in the majority of
transitionally protected cases, because the wife will have reached
pension age and become entitled to her own state pension. In the
minority of cases in which a couple is still in receipt of an increase
at the point of change, we will ensure that they are made aware of
other benefits for which they may be eligible, particularly pension
credit. By and large, any people losing their ADI at that stage would
be looking forward to receiving a state
pension.</div>
					
					<a name="0701246000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The transitional arrangements
are appropriate, given that everyone recognises that the principle of
the existing arrangements is many decades out of date. Preserving it
for another 15 years would involve a fair
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 79</div>amount of transitional protection. We estimate that the case load in
2010 will be 60,000 people, and that about three-quarters of them would
have ceased getting ADIs before protection ends in 2020, so between
15,000 and 20,000 ADIs would be switched off at that stage. That is the
answer that the hon. Member for Eastbourne was seeking. Given that they
would be later, and that there will potentially be an increase in
pension credit, we think that that is the right balance. We do not want
to keep the system going for decades to come, for a small handful of
cases.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 80</div>
					<a name="0701246000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are complicated and arcane
provisions. They do not benefit many people at the moment, but they
would create a significant spending increase for those who had not
reached state pension age. We therefore think it right in principle to
remove them.</div>
