</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: Government Amendment No. 59.
<P>
No. 18, in page 189, line 46, after "meeting", insert "to every authorised person".
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I was just coming to the end of my remarks. I am sure that some Committee members will be pleased about that; others, however, will be disappointed.
<P>
There is not a great deal between the Government and the position that we take in our amendment. The Government acknowledge the need for the fresh air of publicity to be brought to bear on annual meetings of the Financial Services Authority. They acknowledge that the widest possible dissemination of information should take place, whenever feasible, and say that that can be left to the FSA, on the grounds that it must take reasonable steps under the Bill to ensure that everyone who wants to know about or come to the annual meeting can do so.
<P>
We suggest that that should be included in the Bill, so as to remove uncertainty. Our amendment would require the FSA to notify "every authorised person", ensuring that those who want to know about the FSA's annual meeting would be informed.
<P>
As there is not such a great gap between the Government and ourselves, I hope that the Government may change their mind. The Financial Secretary's only remaining objection was that notifying authorised persons of an annual meeting would cost a lot. That is not a strong argument, and should not be considered seriously as an objection. We do not use such an argument to allow public companies to escape the requirement to notify their shareholders, even when such companies have very many shareholders--indeed, probably more shareholders than the FSA will have authorised persons. In any case, the cost of notification is likely to fall as a result of electronic communication.
<P>
I therefore urge the Government to accept our amendment along with the two that they have tabled.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> I cannot usefully add to what I have already said. I am glad that the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) endorsed the Government amendments and I thank him for doing so.
<P>
I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that on the amendment, there is not much between the Government and the Opposition. However, I shall repeat what I said this morning and request Committee members to examine paragraph 11(4) of schedule 1, which requires the authority to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"give reasonable notice of its annual meeting."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I also remind Committee members that I said earlier that we expected the FSA to take all reasonable steps. In light of my remarks, I commend the Government amendments to the Committee, but invite the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to press his amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> No, I do not intend to move the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 59, in page 189, line 36, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"its most recent report under paragraph 10"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert "that report.".--[Mrs. Roche.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight (Arundel and South Downs):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 190, line 36, after "persons", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"by the payment of rebates to authorised persons who paid fees in relation to the year in which the fines were imposed".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 32, in page 190, line 40, after "proposals", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"including contemplated amounts of penalties".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 33, in page 191, line 8, leave out "incidental purpose" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"purpose which is necessary or desirable for carrying out its functions".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 34 in page 191, line 14, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) to pay reasonable remuneration to non-executive members of the governing body".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I apologise for being a few minutes late, but I am delighted that you, Mrs. Dunwoody, are chairing our proceedings.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 31, 32, 33 and 34 would sharpen up some of the provisions for penalties and fees. Following the recommendations of the Joint Committee, the Government made much of the argument that penalties would be rebated and that the FSA would, thus, not have an incentive to levy excessive fines. The Bill's drafting, however, is unclear and the rebating of fines could give rise to members benefiting when they had not been a member in a year when fines were levied but had become authorised subsequently. Amendment No. 31 would make it clear that fines should be rebated to those who are authorised members during the year that the fines were levied.
<P>
The current wording in the Bill could be interpreted as providing a basis for a straight letting-off. If one were extremely devious, one could argue that, in setting the level of fees, the authority might consider what sort of fines it will levy. Amendment No. 31 would remove that temptation by introducing a retrospective provision, so that fines would be related to the year in which members had paid the fees.
<P>
Amendment No. 32 seeks to make it clear that if the FSA wishes to vary the scheme relating to penalties, it will need to publish details about contemplated amounts of future penalties and, in particular, about any new offence that might be introduced. Conservative Members think that greater transparency about penalties is good and healthy from all aspects. If changes are to be made, information on the penalties that might apply should be made available to the industry ahead of time.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 deal with fees. Amendment No. 33 would sharpen the language in the Bill. It would substitute the phrase "incidental purpose", which could be interpreted widely, with the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"necessary or desirable for carrying out its functions"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as defined in the Bill. If the Government have in mind another definition instead of "incidental purpose", we would like to know what it is.
<P>
Non-executive members will need to be remunerated in some way or another. We could not find provision for remuneration, so it will have to come out of fees. Amendment No. 34 would provide for such remuneration.
<P>
We have let you off pretty lightly under the two headings. There are many other issues relating to competitiveness that could be raised, but they will be dealt with elsewhere.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has not let me off anything.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I welcome you, Mrs. Dunwoody, to the Chair. May I say how much I look forward to serving under your fair, but firm chairmanship?
<P>
I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight). I shall try to provide him with some reassurances that may persuade him to withdraw the amendment. The Government fully accept that the financial benefit of income from financial penalties should be returned in full to the regulated community. Indeed, we announced that in our response to the Joint Committee's report.
<P>
The drafting deliberately focuses on the required result while leaving some flexibility on how it is to be achieved. By requiring the FSA to devise a scheme in consultation with authorised persons, the Bill ensures that the FSA has the necessary flexibility to take account of the views of authorised persons on a range of issues such as whether there be a separate rebate payment or a discount on fees. Should windfalls--that is peaks in the flow of penalty income--be spread across years to avoid volatility? Should firms which in the meantime have had their authorisation taken away, or are newly authorised, or have paid the penalties, also benefit?
<P>
Those are complex matters on which it is right to have consultation. That is why we have given the authority this flexibility. We certainly believe that they should be reflected in the consultation process, rather than tie the FSA into a single approach. The Joint Committee noted that it might be desirable for the rebate to be spread over a period of three years to avoid excessive fluctuation in fees. That possibility would be ruled out by limiting the rebate to the year in which the penalty was imposed as the Opposition are suggesting. I do not suggest for one moment that Opposition Members wish to do that and I assumne that those are probing amendments to gain reassurances from the Government.
<P>
I understand that the FSA is currently working out proposals on how the rebate would work. It is likely to involve a discount on the fees charged with authorised persons receiving a single invoice showing both their fees and the reduction for penalties levied in the previous year. That will be a helpful step forward. The Committee will agree that this appears to be a sensible approach from the point of view of both the authority and the industry. There is no point in having completely separate mechanisms for fees and rebates so long as the accounting is clear and transparent.
<P>
Nor can I see the value in effectively requiring the FSA to consult in advance on the amount of the penalties it intends or expects to impose. Our aim, after all, has been to minimise any potential incentive for the FSA to levy higher financial penalties. Indeed, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs raised that matter when he moved the amendments and the aim was endorsed by the Joint Committee in its report. A requirement to set a figure in advance is liable to introduce exactly the target or incentive we are trying to avoid.
<P>
In any case, this is not the right vehicle for publishing figures on fines. It is not intended that the scheme should necessarily be revised frequently or regularly. If it works well, the same general scheme may stay in place for years. The amount of income from penalties will in any case be disclosed annually in the FSA's report and accounts.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 add nothing to the current drafting on the fees. I see no advantage in limiting the purposes for which fees may be raised to those that are "necessary or desirable" rather than "incidental" for carrying out the FSA's functions. Those seem to us to be equivalent. We could have a lengthy debate over that--but I do not want to try your patience, Mrs. Dunwoody--and it could be argued that the Opposition's amendment would widen the range of expenses that the FSA could raise fees to cover.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As for the remuneration of non-executive directors, the FSA will incur that expense in carrying out its functions. There is no doubt that the FSA will be able to use fee income to pay its non-executive directors reasonable remuneration. I hope that those remarks will have reassured the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs and his right hon. and hon. Friends, and that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We will withdraw the amendment on the basis of the Government's undertakings with the proviso that a letting-off scheme could undermine the objectives. Budgeting for fees at the same time as budgeting for the level of fines to be levied could cause difficulties. Even though the FSA will not be the direct beneficiary, fines could be levied to suit financial budgeting. We take some comfort from the fact that there will be consultation with authorised members in working out the route to be followed. However, general budgeting and the fines that arise in the course of business should be separated, not tied together. We wanted policy on future penalties to be tied to varying the scheme rather than going into excessive detail on a specific tariff. If the scheme were varied, it would be appropriate to make an announcement of changes.
<P>
On amendment No. 33, we believed that "incidental" was very wide and we sought to narrow it, but it is not a hugely material point. I hope that the Government are right that non-executive salaries will be catered for automatically elsewhere in the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 22, in 191, line 39, after "faith", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or in the case of the Authority unreasonable, reckless or negligent".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 23, in page 191, line 42, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4) Any damages payable by the Authority shall be met by the Treasury out of money provided by Parliament".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We now come to the important issue of statutory immunity, on which we have touched in previous debates. I am glad to have the opportunity to explore the issue further. In some ways, it goes to the core of the Bill and certainly to the status of the FSA.
<P>
Amendment No. 22 would limit the statutory immunity granted in the Bill and make the authority liable for acting unreasonably, recklessly or negligently. The Government presently want to grant the FSA a substantial degree of statutory immunity going well beyond that. Our starting-point is that it is objectionable in principle for any organisation to be above the law.
<P>
The monarch has always been considered to be above the law because it was the monarch made the law in earlier times and it was thought unsuitable for them to be subject to their own actions. Immunity of various sorts was practically automatic and went with the job. That concept has been eroded through time and the remains of Crown immunity have gone.
<P>
Only a few years ago, no matter how many cockroaches were found in NHS kitchens, no one could do anything about it because the hospital could claim Crown immunity. That has ended, rightly; I hope that the cockroaches have gone, too. It should appeal to parliamentarians because we operate under the important principle of equality under the law. For example, although the police enforce the law they are not above it; they are subject to it and can be sued.
<P>
The Government must make the case for statutory immunity for the FSA, and they have not yet done so. The Joint Committee examined the matter at length; several witnesses raised the subject and were asked about it. The Committee concluded that it was happy with the proposals for immunity
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provided that the complaints procedure is strengthened as we recommend below."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We debated the complaints procedure this morning and the Government did not accept the Joint Committee's three recommendations. First, they did not agree that the appointment of the investigator should require the approval of the Lord Chancellor; secondly, they did not agree that the investigator should be able to launch investigations into complaints received directly, because the Bill as drafted provides that complaints should reach the investigator via the authority; and thirdly, the Joint Committee asked the Government to consider seriously whether the investigator should be able to award compensation. Admittedly, the Government will come back to us on that, we hope with some better news, but as things stand they have not accepted the complaints procedure recommendation. It therefore follows that the Joint Committee's agreement to the proposals for the FSA's immunity no longer applies. That is important.
<P>
The link between statutory immunity and the complaints procedure was raised constantly by witnesses. There was a good deal of grumbling about statutory immunity, but they could see the force in a limited degree of immunity, provided, they emphasised, that the complaints procedure was strengthened, made fully independent and able to award financial compensation. That point was made before the Joint Committee and has been made in writing, and privately, to me and, probably, to other members of the Committee. In the light of the inadequacy of the complaints procedure in the Bill as drafted, we should look particularly closely at its provisions concerning immunity.
<P>
The Government say that they are simply rolling forward the arrangements in the Financial Services Act 1986. That is true, but this is a different Bill and the FSA is a different organisation. The financial services markets have been largely self-regulating and many of the people servicing and serving on the Committees are themselves practitioners. They asked to be given a degree of immunity from prosecution if they were to give their time--voluntarily and freely in many cases. They felt that it would be an unacceptable risk if they were to serve on regulatory committees when they could face legal action. Whether that reason was justified, it certainly provided much of the thinking behind the development of the law to date. We now have a Financial Services Authority that has far greater powers and is run by full-time professional staff. Therefore, that reason for immunity no longer applies. 
The Government have not granted absolute immunity, but only when the FSA acts in good faith. To put it another way, statutory immunity does not apply when it can be shown that the FSA has acted in bad faith. It is notoriously difficult to prove in court that someone has acted in bad faith; essentially a subjective judgment is made.
<P>
It is not clear to me whether the immunity covers reckless behaviour. If someone in a position of authority behaved recklessly towards me, I would certainly allege that he had acted in bad faith. That might be a matter of dispute. Our amendment would put the matter beyond doubt. It would explicitly remove statutory immunity when there is reckless behaviour.
<P>
Perhaps, more importantly, we also seek to remove statutory immunity when the act or behaviour is unreasonable or negligent. In many cases, the FSA might make mistakes that would not amount to a malicious campaign against a firm or individual, but which would constitute a sin of omission. It would have failed to take proper care and attention. Therefore, it would have acted negligently and cost the victim substantial sums of money. This morning, we asked for such cases to be investigated by the complaints authority and for financial compensation to be paid if the investigator wanted that to be done. Our suggestion was turned down, so the only route left for the person or firm involved is to sue at law. If the FSA is able to show that it acted negligently and the Bill makes it clear that such a defence will give it complete immunity, that will be unfair and unjust.
<P>
When the Economic Secretary and others appeared before the Joint Committee, they pointed to foreign experience. In particular it was said, without complication, that the Securities and Exchange Commission in America enjoyed legal protection. I am not a lawyer, still less an international lawyer, but I have made inquiries. In truth, the position is a little more complicated than that presented to us. I am advised that regulators are routinely named as respondents in appeals of their decisions. That differs from suits against agencies themselves. Regulators are generally immune from such claims unless instances of egregious bad faith and intentional misconduct against a firm can be shown. Mere mistake in judgment will not do.
<P>
Therefore, not only the SEC, but individual regulators, can in certain cases be the subject of legal action.
<P>
I am also advised that, in practical terms, such actions are extremely rare. In general, action is taken against the SEC as a corporate body. However, that is not easy or common and a detailed route has to be taken if one wishes to bring a case against it. If one deviates from that route, the SEC can claim immunity. I hope that that explanation assists the Committee. It may not be entirely clear, but it shows that this is a complex matter and that the SEC does not enjoy blanket immunity as was claimed during the Joint Committee inquiry.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I come back to the central point that statutory immunity is objectionable in principle unless there is a clear case for it. There is a case for a degree of statutory immunity, but it should not extend to action by the FSA which is "unreasonable, reckless or negligent", in addition to the clearer cases where it has acted in bad faith. The force of that is doubled by the Government's failure so far to respond satisfactorily to the complaints recommendations of the Joint Committee. If the Minister cannot give us assurances today, perhaps she will think about it again because it is of exceptional importance.
<P>
Amendment No. 23 requires that any damages that arise out of a court action should not be paid by the FSA, but by the Treasury out of public funds. The reason for that is that the FSA's money is derived from fees from the regulated community. It would therefore be rather odd if the FSA lost a case but the penalty was borne indirectly by the regulated community which had the complaint in the first place. To prevent that from happening, any damages should be a charge on the Treasury as amendment No. 23 makes clear.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In supporting my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) I make the point that since regulation began some 13 years ago, several businesses and individuals have suffered quite unjustly as a result of regulatory error or mistake. That was in an organisation that was notionally a club; there was self-regulation with participants organising regulation of themselves. There was therefore the convenience of the argument that there should be no compensation and no immunity. We are now creating an enormously more powerful body--a leviathan legislator--and there must either be some organised system for compensation or much narrower immunity than that defined in the Bill.
<P>
As we have made clear, the Opposition tend to the view that enabling the complaints officer to award compensation is the better way of dealing with the issue. The Government have not accepted that, but they may think about it and come back to us. We urge them to do that. I second the crucial point made by my right hon. Friend that if that is not to change, immunity as defined in terms of fairness and decent justice is too narrow.
<P>
The excluded areas such as European rights do not really deal with the whole issue by a long chalk because, as we have already discussed, at the bottom of the heap, businesses and people's lives can be ruined by injustice which is certainly not malignant or in bad faith, but which may just be casualness or getting it wrong.The balance of liberty for the individual against this leviathan Organisation is not satisfactory unless there is give on one or other issue.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): The amendments give us an opportunity to tease out from the Government the justification for statutory immunity. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, while we are inclined to accept a measure of statutory immunity, possibly a substantial measure, it is extremely important that we tease out from the Government the precise justification for the level of statutory immunity that we are being asked to give to the new authority. In that context, we must tease out the nature of the complaints procedure and the remedies available under that procedure to those who cannot bring a legal action to obtain a remedy when it is accepted that they have suffered substantial damage--sometimes substantial personal damage--and loss at the hands of the authority.
<P>
Our amendment would do that by suggesting that there should be a level of statutory immunity, but that it should not apply in three specific sets of circumstances. The amendment states that statutory immunity should not apply when the FSA's conduct has been
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"unreasonable, reckless or negligent".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In terms of seriousness, those forms of conduct should probably be put in a different order. When the authority acts recklessly, it is likely to come close to failing to act in good faith. The two forms of conduct are not identical, but are fairly similar. Giving the authority statutory immunity in respect of recklessness will require a high level of justification. Will the Minister therefore explain why immunity may be justified in the case of recklessness?
<P>
Negligence is the next step down. Should the authority be immune when it has been negligent? Frankly, it will probably not be too difficult for the authority to become negligent from time to time, as it is a large authority, dealing with a many people who work in the market and require authorisation. Human frailty makes a great deal certain when things go wrong. So there are sure to be a significant number of occasions on which the authority, with the best will in the world, finds that it has been negligent and a smaller number--I hope, although that number is still likely to be significant--on which that negligence causes serious damage and hardship.
<P>
Will the Minister therefore give an explanation? She will probably say that negligence is bound to happen. The authority will set up a tight, expensive and overweening regulatory procedure that is self-defeating if it is always looking over its shoulder in relation to negligence. That is not an adequate answer, and we want to hear the justification.
<P>
Unreasonableness is the third level of behaviour. We are right to tease out that concept, but it is a more difficult legal concept in such a context. Will the Minister address that specific issue?
<P>
The next criterion against which we should judge the authority's action relates to foreign experience or regulatory practice among other major regulatory bodies in the western world, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States and major market centres in Europe and other areas. I hope that the Minister will give a fairly detailed answer as to whether we are comparing like with like or asking for something different in relation to regulatory authorities in other parts of the world.
<P>
We must tease out the relevance of article 6 of the European convention on human rights. It has been suggested that, as a result of article 6, the blanket statutory immunity that the Bill currently provides is unlikely to hold water. I shall pursue that matter in more detail when we come to discuss other aspects of the Bill. I shall not go into the detailed provisions of article 6 now, but it would be well understood by Ministers that people's rights to a fair trial and a fair hearing are relevant to civil as well as criminal proceedings. Most of the disciplinary proceedings in the Bill are described as civil. Will the Minister clarify his views on the advice that he has received about the blanket immunity and its conformity with article 6 of the European convention on human rights?
<P>
I want to return to the inter-relation between statutory immunity and the complaints procedure. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells rightly emphasised that one reason for concern over statutory immunity is the continuing inadequacy of the complaints procedure, particularly regarding the ability of an independent investigator to recommend or grant financial compensation in certain circumstances. That has always been recognised as one part of the balance.
<P>
Paragraph 139 on page 38 of the Joint Committee's first report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We consider that the proposals for immunity for the FSA are appropriate, provided that the complaints procedure is strengthened as we recommend below."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know that the complaints procedure has not been strengthened in all respects and I would be grateful if the Minister would ennumerate point by point--albeit briefly at this stage--the justification for not following the full recommendations of the Joint Committee and failing to strengthen the complaints procedure. That should be sufficient to tease the matter out at this stage.
<P>
As I said, I do not wish to resile from my overall position because there is a case for an element--perhaps a significant element--of immunity, but there must be a fair balance and an opportunity for compensation and protection of those who are regulated by this market. There must also be accountability and answerability of the authority itself. I believe profoundly--as I suspect do all members of the Committee--that it is undesirable to give any body in this mortal world so much authority and immunity that it never has to look over its shoulder. That would be a bad thing to do.
<P>
The body will be under pressure--we should should make no mistake about that--and it will have a tough task in keeping its many employees working effectively. If it does not have to look over its shoulder, it will tend to take short-cuts, which will damage those being regulated. It is a healthy factor when any regulatory body is accountable and answerable for what it does or what it fails to do.
<P>
I hope that my short contribution has highlighted several important points and we look forward to hearing the Minister's response. We can then return to the issues in greater detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I want to add a few points to back up my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells.
<P>
When the Joint Committee started its discussions I was initially sceptical about the prospect of continuing immunity to such a powerful body. I was temporarily persuaded that when the Securities and Investments Board was set up in 1996, it was not intended to have statutory immunity. That became necessary later, before the legislation was finalised, because of the difficulty in finding individuals who would serve on the Committees within the Securities and Investments Board. That is how statutory immunity came about.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> Was not the board granted statutory immunity because that allowed it to do a better job for the benefit of those whom it served?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Indeed, that was one case advanced in its defence. However, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) said, there was no need for the authority to look over its shoulder if, because of a statutory immunity, there was no threat of an action against it. The two views must be balanced; that is why Conservative members of the Committee have thought so long and hard about the issue.
<P>
There is an American example. One of the failings of the Joint Committee and the witnesses we heard--the Minister and her civil servants were also unable to elaborate on the matter--was that we did not discover exactly what was the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States. It would appear that there is a degree of immunity that does not apply to that Organisation. Can the Minister give us chapter and verse on the subject even at this late stage?
<P>
There is a case for demarcation between the immunity of the authority and the immunity of the individuals who serve within it. I am in favour only of the latter, which is why I support the amendments. It is beholden on the Government, in introducing the Bill, to prove the case for continued immunity and they have not yet done so.
<P>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire quoted from the first report of the Joint Committee which stated that it was in favour of statutory immunity but with the counterbalance that there should be a properly strengthened complaints procedure. I fully endorse what my right hon. and learned Friend said, that this Committee has not strengthened the complaints procedure. In responding to the schedule, the FSA agreed that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will be important to complement the statutory immunity with a robust and independent procedure for handling complaints against the FSA."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We may argue about that again, as we did this morning, but on its own criteria the FSA is on thin ice in terms of justifying such a broadly based immunity--that is our complaint. It is a catch-all immunity.
<P>
Why does the FSA warrant such immunity? It is not applicable to the police, the medical profession or the legal profession. If someone from the Serious Fraud Office uses his powers recklessly or maliciously to cause damage to a firm, a case may be brought against him. None of those bodies need immunity to function properly. There may be inadequacies in the way in which the police and members of the medical profession do their job but, by and large, they get on with it; they are not hamstrung by the fact that they do not have statutory immunity if they do the job wrongly. The FSA is no different from those bodies, except that it is much more powerful. Therefore, it should be more accountable if it does not perform its duties to the best of its expectations. The FSA can cause firms to go out of business and individuals to lose their living. That is on a par with a doctor being struck off the British Medical Association register or a legal practitioner losing his livelihood. It is no different.
<P>
The Bill assumes an awful lot. It assumes that the FSA will always be a benign institution and that the head of the FSA will also be benign. I take no issue with that view, but Howard Davies is just one of almost 2,000 employees. Things can go wrong much lower down the ranks with people who may not have the same degree of intention and honour. The amendment is intended to mitigate against the behaviour of such people.
<P>
The experience of those who have been regulated by the self-regulatory organisations since 1986 shows that it is "advisable" not to fall out with one's regulator. The regulators' implied threat is: "Don't push it too far." When people feel that they have been wrongly treated by the regulator, it does not matter how justified their case might be. The scales will be tilted even further if one gives blanket immunity to powerful organisations such as the FSA. There will be no incentive for the FSA to think twice before it proceeds with certain important actions that might have extreme consequences. I shall listen to see whether the Economic Secretary can develop the argument further, but the case for immunity was not made in the Joint Committee.
<P>
Another issue is incompatibility with the European convention on human rights and whether the measure breaches the right of access to the courts as guaranteed by article 7 of the convention. All the members of the Joint Committee have article 6 sketched on their hearts. We heard it mentioned so many times in so many different forms and we heard so much different legal counsel on whether it was applicable.
<P>
I ask the Economic Secretary to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Bill will not fall foul of the European convention on human rights. Her legal advisers were not able to give that guarantee when they appeared before the Joint Committee, and none of the other legal counsel was able to give anything like such a guarantee. Indeed, we heard views to the contrary.
<P>
No doubt the Economic Secretary will plead in mitigation the fact that there is still the facility for judicial review of any wrongdoing by the FSA. That does not offer an alternative, however. If judicial review were similar to the right to sue, the FSA would have no need to hold out for statutory immunity. Judicial review is a much softer sanction than the full might of a civil action. It might embarrass a Minister, an Organisation or an agency, but it does not deliver financial redress to the seriously wronged party.
<P>
That brings us back to the complaints procedure. We want to beef up accountability, independent adjudication and so on. However, the penalties are important. A metaphorical slap on the wrist through judicial review is not sufficient if someone has transgressed the rules and the high standards expected of him.
<P>
Amendment No. 23 deals with the business of paying fines. If immunity did not exist and redress could be made through the courts, it would be absurd if the FSA had to stump up the money. Ultimately, legitimate subscribers, who had abided by the rules, would lose out. They would not receive the rebate on penalties and fines. That is why we have specified that the Treasury should pay any redress. It would provide it with yet another incentive to keep close scrutiny--and not just "have regard to", or to come dashing out on its charger at the last minute with its reserve powers--over the FSA. The Treasury would ensure that the FSA did not give its money away by proceeding with unnecessary and unwarranted cases.
<P>
The amendments to this part of the schedule are just another part of the business of making the FSA more accountable. I am prepared to be convinced otherwise, but the Government have not so far made out a concrete case for why the FSA deserves the widespread blanket immunity proposed in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): It is puzzling that Opposition Members of the Joint Committee now say that they dissent from the wide measure of agreement expressed in that Committee about statutory immunity. Not only was there agreement among Members of both Houses, but the British Bankers Association and the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, which both represent a wide range of people who would be subject to this power, agreed. The basis of the agreement was that if members of the staff of the FSA were constantly frightened of civil actions being taken against them, their judgment would be distorted or they would become over-cautious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We are going to plead different witnesses. Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that we had representatives from Clifford Chance, which is about to become the largest law firm in the world, from Herbert Smith and from the Association of British Insurers who all disagreed with what he has just said. Indeed, pleas were made for the loss of immunity in certain cases. Many other witnesses took a quite contrary argument to his.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> I accept that there were other voices on this, but those two associations stand out as being representative of practitioners right across the board which Clifford Chance, as a firm of solicitors, was not. The first reason for the fair degree of uniformity of view across the board was that judgments to make the structure work need to be independent. People need to look at the facts, unawed by the chance of being sued. If there is a chance of being sued, the risk is strong that members of staff will be over-cautious. They will always err on the side of being absolute certain and sure. That was not the right basis on which the FSA should conduct itself. Indeed, that same judgment was made by many international authorities, all of which have been given statutory immunity.
<P>
It has also been said this afternoon that the reason for recanting is that the Joint Committee made it a condition of supporting statutory immunity that the complaints procedure should be strengthened. The recommendation for the complaints procedure almost exactly matches what the Government have produced in the Bill. it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The appointment of the investigator should require the approval of the Lord Chancellor"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not stray too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> No, I will not. I was just taking the main point. That has not been done exactly, but the idea is that it is an independent person. That is now being given to the Treasury. The second major point was that adequate resources should be provided. That has also been seen to. The third point was to ask the Government to look at the means of awarding damages. That has not been brought out, but instead the Joint Committee also said that ex gratia payments should be looked at. They have been looked at, as was mentioned this morning All the basic principles that the Joint Committee set out have been abided by. It is therefore strange to use that as a justification for recantation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I will just say a few words on this as many of the key points have already been made. We have here a powerful body and a less than thorough going means of holding it to account. The Joint Committee clearly recommended, as has already been read into the record, that immunity would be appropriate only if the complaint procedures had been strengthened. It has not been strengthened. In that case, practitioners--
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> In a moment. Practitioners will be left at the mercy of the FSA, which, for small practitioners will be intimidating.
<P>
To remove recourse to the law, the most basic right of redress that almost every individual and Organisation has, requires a lot of justification.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman say in what respect the requirements of the Joint Committee to strengthen the complaints procedure have not been met? Provision for compensation is taken account of in this morning's statement that ex gratia payments could be made. In what respect has the Joint Committee's requirement not been met?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I was not on the Joint Committee but I am told that the recommendations on compensation and on the automatic referral of complaints have not been met.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> As my hon. Friend was not on the Joint Committee, I refer him to page 40 of the report and inform him that the Joint Committee made three recommendations, none of which has been met by the Government. Has the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) actually read the report to which he gave his name? It is clear from what the Government said that they have met none of the three recommendations to which I referred in my speech.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that we are going to return to the wording of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> With respect, Mrs. Dunwoody, I did not leave the wording of the amendment. I was doing my best but I was led astray.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I encourage the hon. Gentleman to return to the path of righteousness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am doing my best to do so.
<P>
Ministers will say that there is a precedent for immunity--the Securities and Investment Board. The Committee should bear in mind the advice of Tim Herrington, the partner at Clifford Chance. What he said is quoted in the report, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Accountability under the law is vitally important for any public authority and we do not believe that the case for the continuation of the immunity has been clearly made in the light of the increased powers of the FSA."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is the scale of the increase in the new body's powers--my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs described it as Leviathan-like--that makes us question the retention of the SIB's immunity.
<P>
The Minister must answer two questions: first, why are the Government ignoring the Joint Committee's advice, which was clear to anyone who listened to what was said, or who read pages 38, 39 and 40 of the Joint Committee report? I acknowledge that the report is not the repository of all wisdom, and it may contain errors, but we would value an explanation of why that advice has not been taken. Secondly, Ministers must answer the question asked by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire: why should immunity be granted for reckless and negligent behaviour? Why should that behaviour be covered by immunity? That seems extraordinary to anyone who comes to the issue reasonably fresh, as I have done.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> The debate is on a subject that has aroused enormous interest in the consultation process and in the hearings before the Joint Committee. The Joint Committee accepted that there was a strong case for giving statutory immunity to the FSA, subject to strengthening the complaints arrangements, to which I shall return briefly in a minute.
<P>
Opposition Members have not mentioned the fact that the Joint Committee, having accepted the case for statutory immunity, also recommended that it be extended to recognised investment exchanges. In response to the Joint Committee's proposals, we undertook to reflect further on that. The difficulty with recognised exchanges is that they are commercial bodies and no immunity in respect of their regulatory functions could possibly cover their commercial functions. There are questions as to whether that line can be drawn effectively in practice.
<P>
The Joint Committee heard evidence from some of the exchanges about the way in which they were hampered in their regulatory functions by the non-existence of immunity. Similarly, I have heard directly from some of the regulators on the board of those exchanges about their difficulties in the absence of statutory immunity. That is an important point, which clearly impressed the Joint Committee. As I said, it not only supported the continuation of statutory immunity as provided for in the Bill, but recommended a further extension of it.
<P>
Let me deal with the strengthening of the complaints procedure. I regret the fact that the right hon. Member for Wells, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs and other Opposition Members have repeated the accusation that we have not accepted the Joint Committee's recommendations. It is terribly important that the Committee is not misled on that point and that we do not mislead the media or members of the financial services industry who will be following our deliberations with interest.
<P>
Let me summarise briefly how we have responded to the Joint Committee recommendations on the investigation of complaints. First, there is the recommendation that the appointment is approved by the Lord Chancellor's Department. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford said, we have put in place the approval of appointments by the Treasury. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs acknowledged in moving the amendment that an argument could be made in favour of either. The central point is that an independent body approves the appointment. Statutory immunity should not stand or fall on whether the Lord Chancellor's Department or the Treasury approves the appointment of the independent complaints investigator. That would be absurdly disproportionate.
<P>
Secondly, the Joint Committee recommended--and I note that Opposition Members failed to mention this--that the complaints investigator should have continuing assistance and adequate resources. We have accepted that recommendation and it is built into the Bill.
<P>
Thirdly, it was recommended that the investigator dealt directly with complaints. I discussed that at some length this morning when I explained that Government Departments and other public bodies that are subject to the independent investigation of the parliamentary commissioner for administration or the local government ombudsman must investigate complaints themselves. If they do not do so to the satisfaction of the complainant, the complaint will pass to the independent investigator.
<P>
Similarly, the FSA should have the responsibility for, as well as the opportunity of, investigating complaints. However, because of the Bill's strengthening of the complaints investigation machinery in the light of the Joint Committee's recommendation, we have ensured that every complaint--irrespective of whether the FSA investigates and whether the complaint is upheld--will go to the independent investigator who will have the power of his own unfettered judgment to decide whether to proceed with an investigation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> With respect, the hon. Lady has slightly misinterpreted the three specific recommendations of the Joint Committee's report. The first was that the appointments should be made by the Lord Chancellor and not by the Treasury. The Government have not accepted that. The second was that their existence should continue, as I mentioned in my speech. We welcome the Governmentls acceptance of that. The third was the award of compensation, which the Government have explicitly rejected. The Government accepted only one of the Joint Committee's three recommendations.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am just coming to the issue of compensation. The hon. Gentleman himself mentioned the investigator being able to deal with complaints directly, as I made a note of it and added it to the three recommendations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It is not a recommendation in the report.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Well, my recollection is that the hon. Gentleman mentioned it as a matter raised by the Joint Committee.
<P>
The Joint Committee asked us to give serious consideration to payment of compensation. We have done so and, as I said this morning, we will continue to reflect on the matter. As a result of that recommendation and our giving serious consideration to the matter, we have clarified the FSA's power to award ex gratia payments in cases in which that is justified.
<P>
However we cannot create an open season through the complaints system, allowing some of the multinational billion-dollar companies that will be regulated by the authority to seek unlimited compensation via the complaints mechanism in circumstances in which they would not be able to get damages as a result of statutory immunity in the form that the Joint Committee and several, if not all, Opposition Members, support. The two things must complement, not contradict, each other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendment relating to compensation, which we discussed this morning, would have merely empowered the investigator to pay compensation; it would not have required him to do so and would not have fixed any limits. Therefore, the possibility of a large or small business asking for compensation could not exist under that amendment, as it would have merely empowered the investigator to pay compensation when he saw fit.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I should make it clear that I have no desire to limit sensible debate, so I have not sought to restrict Committee members. However, if they persist in going over debates that have already finished, there will be some unhappiness on the part of the Chair, which may be drawn to the attention of hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Thank you very much, Mrs. Dunwoody. I certainly would not wish you to be unhappy. I merely felt that it was my duty to respond, albeit briefly, to points raised in debate.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is not at all naive about global financial markets. I therefore hope that he is not naive about the real danger of global financial operators seeking to get from the complaints system that which they would be debarred from getting from the courts by means of statutory immunity. The courts are not required to grant damages; they are empowered to do so. That is what the amendment sought to provide for the complaints investigator.
<P>
However, that is enough on the complaints investigator. We have responded fully and adequately to the Joint Committee's recommendations. We must now put in place a structure allowing the FSA to get on with its work efficiently and effectively. All members of the Committee must agree that a strong but accountable regulator is in the interests of the industry and consumers alike. A key element in delivering the balance that we need between effective regulation and proper accountability is the limited form of immunity from suit that appears in the Bill.
<P>
In a moment, I will deal with the various precedents and the nature of immunity in other countries, including the immunity enjoyed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States. However, first, I wish to deal with what would happen if we destroyed the limited statutory immunity that we have carried over from the current measure into the Bill. That statutory immunity would be destroyed by amendment No. 22.
<P>
Without statutory immunity, the proper and efficient action of the regulator would be frustrated by lawsuits and red tape. Frivolous litigation could be an extremely easy ploy to distract or hinder the regulator. The absence or the weakening of the immunity could also have more dangerous effects on the industry. It could lead to a tendency to over-regulation with the FSA seeking to collect more information than it needed, setting tougher minimum standards than necessary, avoiding giving guidances or waivers or taking longer to reach decisions than it otherwise would. The FSA could take such action in order to shore itself up against a court action by an extremely powerful financial services company that would no doubt be accompanied in court by an extremely powerful City firm such as Clifford Chance.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although I have nothing against lawyers--I am married to one--it is hardly surprising that some City law firms wish to remove the statutory immunity provision in the Bill. They are rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of the fees that they would be able to pocket if we created, as the amendment would, open season for lawsuits against the regulator.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> By the same token, the lawyers who were in it just for the business would not be keen for the conditions of the European convention on human rights to be watertight. That would deny them the business gained from taking a case to Europe.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that the Economic Secretary will resist the temptation to consider the motives of lawyers. If she does not, we shall have a very long Committee stage.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall certainly resist that temptation, but I thought that my point was worth making. I shall return to the point about the European convention on human rights shortly.
<P>
I stress that if the FSA had to worry constantly about putting in place a defence against an actual or possible suit for damages, we would run the serious risk, which Conservative Members do not want to run, of the FSA tying the industry up in red tape in the same way that it would be tied up in legal action. That would not help consumers. They will benefit from light-touch regulation if that provides a more competitive marketplace, but they need protection in appropriate circumstances. The regulator must not be deterred or prevented from delivering the protection that consumers need by a constant and lurking threat of litigation. Such threats are real, and they are frequently made against the regulator. However, as things stand, he can point to the statutory immunity.
<P>
Let me stress that the immunity will not be unlimited. It will not prevent actions for damages where the FSA has acted in bad faith. We have now made it clear in the Bill that it will not prevent actions for damages under the Human Rights Acts 1998 when convention rights are alleged to have been infringed.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I heard it said earlier that the Bill would not affect the position under the Human Rights Act. Will the Economic Secretary, in a sentence or two, illuminate us on what that will mean in practice?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister, in a few sentences.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> There are rights under the Human Rights Act, such as the right to a fair trial, the right not to be punished without proper recourse to law and the right to respect the privacy of family of life. If a consumer or authorised person believes that those rights have been infringed by the FSA and he seeks to mount a claim for damages in respect of that breach, he will be free to do so. It would be wrong to exclude actions brought under that Act by means of the statutory immunity.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Is there any relevance in this context of the right--under the Human Rights Act--not to be deprived of one's property?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I stress that we are discussing statutory immunity for the FSA rather than the details of the Human Rights Act and the European convention on human rights. As the schedule currently provides, actions for damages arising out of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act are not covered by the limited statutory immunity that is put in place. Nor does the qualified statutory immunity give the FSA a sort of general licence to act negligently.
<P>
We have also put in place in the Bill a series of procedural checks and balances to protect authorised persons. For instance, before the FSA takes an intervention or a disciplinary action, it must issue a warning notice, receive representations from the recipient of the warning notice and then, after proper consideration, issue a decision notice. The person in question can then refer the matter to the independent tribunal which will consider it afresh for a first instance decision, not on appeal, if it does not agree with the FSA's decision.
<P>
Even where the FSA decides that it needs to act in a case of emergency without going through all those processes--as will occasionally arise--the tribunal still has jurisdiction to consider whether the FSA was acting properly. Similar safeguards also apply in relation to actions taken against individuals under part V of the Bill and to those suspected of market abuse under part VII. The danger of amendment No. 22 is that by effectively destroying the statutory immunity, which, in particular, is an immunity from actions for negligence or unreasonable behaviour, it would undermine the proper functioning of the FSA and in turn harm both the industry and the consumer.
<P>
For those reasons and because of the need for the regulator to do its job properly, our current domestic legislation provides for the same degree of statutory immunity. That is contained in the 1986 Act for the self-regulating organisations, a provision introduced by the previous Government and, I assume, supported by those Conservative members of the Committee who were then in the House.
<P>
The same immunity existed for the Bank of England in respect of its function as the banking regulator. Core principle No. 1 of the Basle core principles for banking supervisors provides for the "legal protection for supervisors". The notes on that principle state the need for banking supervisors to be free from suits for negligence and so on. Equally, we see similar provisions in other jurisdictions, in part because of the Basle principles.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells referred to the Securities and Exchange Commission's immunity. In his description he demonstrated just how strong it is. Like him, I am not a lawyer but as I understand the position, the grounds for action against the SEC do not include "egregious bad faith", the phrase he used. It has a broad immunity although it is not immune where a clearly established constitutional right has been breached. Employees are immune from action for common law torts so long as they were acting within the scope of their employment, regardless of whether they were acting in good or bad faith.
<P>
For established constitutional rights, which in a sense might be the analogy to our Human Rights Act, they can be sued, but the right must be universally understood as such and will generally have already been established by a court ruling. The SEC quite clearly has a substantial, although not unlimited, statutory immunity equivalent to that which we have in this country and which we are confirming in this Bill. Equally in Canada, Australia and several other jurisdictions regulators enjoy unlimited immunity from suit which covers negligence.
<P>
Amendment No. 23 questions who should fund any damages payable by the FSA were the immunity to be effectively destroyed. It would be quite inappropriate for those to be paid by the Treasury out of public funds. The FSA is a body that is funded by the industry it regulates, not by the public purse. Any damages or ex gratia payments should come out of its own income. That creates the proper incentive for it to ensure that such a situation is extremely rare.
<P>
Any arrangement that provided otherwise could, perversely, act as a disincentive on the FSA's accountability to those it seeks to regulate and protect. Indeed, the danger of the two amendments taken together is that they create open season for actions against the FSA, first by destroying the statutory immunity and secondly by providing what some might see as a bottomless pit of taxpayers' money with which to finance any subsequent award of damages.
<P>
It is vital to the success of the regulatory system that we get the accountability package and the checks and balances on the FSA right. As part of that, the FSA needs the right incentive. It is a careful balancing act but one which the Bill as it stands delivers effectively. However, it could easily be wrecked if the statutory immunity provided for--indeed, required in respect of banking regulation by the Basle principles and well established in our own law, and that of other countries--were destroyed in the way that the amendments seek to do.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for addressing the issues we raised. She has not fully answered the arguments in a number of respects or overturned our points. I would be out of order if I debated the merits of the compensation scheme and I assure you, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I will not do that, but, I must refer to them one more time because the approval of witnesses and others to the present arrangements for statutory immunity is explicitly linked to views about the adequacy of the complaints and investigations scheme.
<P>
The Minister said that she had substantially accepted the Joint Committee's recommendations. The same point was made by the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford. I must disagree. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) generously said that the Government had accepted two of the three recommendations. I am rather less generous as always and would say that it was two and a half.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That is more generous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I should have said that they have accepted only half of the middle one because it refers to the investigator being required or enabled to receive complaints directly. We debated this morning whether that was the case. I concede that the Economic Secretary has moved quite a long way on that point in setting up a higher degree of independence.
<P>
Of the other two recommendations, the approval by the Lord Chancellor has been turned down. The Economic Secretary may say that other arrangements are in place that are as good, but that quite definite recommendation has been turned down. Secondly, the question of whether the investigator can award compensation has not wholly been settled by the Government. As we sit this afternoon, it has not been accepted.
<P>
All the witnesses who gave their assent to a degree of statutory immunity linked it to the question of a proper compensation scheme. The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford mentioned the British Bankers Association. I have looked up the evidence given by the director of that association, Mr. Peter Vipond on page 92. He complains about the existing complaints scheme, saying that the FSA can behave too powerfully and in too arbitrary a manner and that there is no redress. In evidence to the Joint Committee, Mr Vipond says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There has got to be some redress."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take that to mean that there must be some provision for financial compensation.
<P>
Mr. Vipond was quoted as being in favour of statutory immunity. However, that is linked to a system of redress that the Government have not yet accepted.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the witnesses were divided on the question of statutory immunity. Many of them were against it, as page 38 of the first report of the Joint Committee reveals. However, those who were in favour of the statutory immunity arrangements were clear about linking that to the changes to the compensation scheme going beyond what the Minister has accepted, as they refer to redress.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Joint Committee said that the Government should give serious consideration to the investigator being able to award compensation. In its first report it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If the investigator is not to have this power, the Financial Services Authority should consider whether its policy should be to give such compensation ex gratia".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said this morning, that is precisely what we have done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I wish that the Minister had completed that quote. It ends:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if the investigator so recommends."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So the ex gratia payment should not be at the discretion of the FSA, but at the discretion and direction of the investigator.
<P>
That was turned down this morning. I remember the Economic Secretary saying that it would be wrong for the FSA to be required to make such payments. Ex gratia possibilities are welcome. Nevertheless, the Government have stopped short of the Joint Committee's recommendation about linking such payment to the discretion of the investigator.
<P>
Should the Minister decide to reconsider the matter, we would welcome that. However, we are being insistent about further limiting statutory immunity because the Government have not given what we and practically all the witnesses require in the way of a better, more comprehensive investigation which would include the possibility of compensation.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My right hon. Friend will have noticed that the Minister has not given an answer in relation to the question of recklessness. My right hon. Friend pointed out that commentators, including the London Investment Bankers Association, said that the measure should not apply in the case of recklessness. Am I mistaken in thinking that an explanation has not been given as to why it should apply in such circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No, but my right hon. and learned Friend is right.
<P>
I am disappointed because I raised the matter in my opening remarks by suggesting that recklessness was not necessarily covered by the phrase "in bad faith" in paragraph 19(3)(a) of schedule 1. I used an example to make the point that, should the FSA behave recklessly, it may defend itself by saying that, although it accepts that its conduct was reckless, nevertheless it was acting in good faith.
<P>
The matter may be argued either way. However, removing ambiguity is much better, so as to make perfectly clear that reckless behaviour would not receive statutory immunity. The Economic Secretary did not respond to that.
<P>
My right hon. and learned Friend argued eloquently about the provision relating to the European convention on human rights. Article 6 of the convention tries to guarantee the right to a fair trial, as the Economic Secretary said. However, it also guarantees people access to a court. That is rather important, as one can imagine the FSA acting negligently and that negligence costing the complainant a great deal of money or, perhaps, his business. The FSA might say that it had acted in good faith and had statutory immunity from any suit. In view of the European convention on human rights, I wonder whether that would hold up--a doubt also expressed by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire.
<P>
The complainant could go to the European Court and assert that article 6 was breached because he had been prevented from testing the issue in court. That would be disastrous for the individual in terms of expense and would also deal a body blow to the Bill. It could be setting up a vulnerability to the European convention, which the Government and indeed ourselves are anxious to avoid.
<P>
The Minister mentioned the Basle convention on banking supervision and its aim to grant statutory immunity. However, that convention is inferior to the European convention on human rights. It would not do to argue in front of a court that some convention signed in Basle supported the FSA's point of view.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am most grateful to my right hon. F. Does he agree that the Minister must clarify the position in the light of his comments? Has my right hon. Friend read the evidence Mr. Sidney Kentridge and Mr. James Eadie who assisted him in the Oury case, which is a French case, and the Brown case, which is a Strasbourg case? Does he share my difficulty in understanding the precise effect of article 6 in this important area? Does he share my anxiety that the Government, with whom I have some sympathy because it is such a difficult area, have not yet clarified their position?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Even interventions from right hon. and learned Gentlemen should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My right hon. and learned Friend makes an important point, which I would like to pass on to the Minister. At this stage we would like an opinion on whether the provision is vulnerable to the European convention, as we have suggested. It is not enough for the Government to point to the general assertion on the front of the Bill. In the name of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In my view the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Bill are compatible with the Convention rights."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want something more explicit. Where the FSA has by general agreement acted negligently, could it be vulnerable under article 6? That is a more specific question, which the Minister should answer. It is a serious matter if the FSA is vulnerable and it provides another reason for the Government to accept our amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Am I to take it that the right hon. Gentleman is persisting in his amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall be brief. The right hon. Gentleman asked about article 6 of the European convention. Following the Osman case, it was suggested that the statutory immunity conferred on the FSA by the Bill might contravene article 6. We do not believe that that is the case. We believe that a statutory immunity would be vulnerable only if it deprived a person of access to the court for a breach of some other convention rights.
<P>
In the Osman case, the complainant's father had been murdered and it was alleged that the Metropolitan police had failed to take proper notice of the family's warnings about the behaviour of the perpetrator. The action arose out of the deprivation of the right to life, which is protected by the convention.
<P>
The Bill and the way that we have redrafted it in the light of the Joint Committee's recommendations and other consultations, makes it clear that statutory immunity does not apply if someone seeks an action for damages arising under the Human Rights Act. Therefore, we do not believe that the Osman case or similar cases place in doubt the Bill's compliance with the European convention on human rights. Therefore, the Chancellor of Exchequer signed the statement confident that the Bill complied with convention rights.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> rose--

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> We come to some important policy areas that are not currently covered in the Bill. One relates to social exclusion as it affects financial services and the other relates to the quality of products.
<P>
Last Thursday, we had an extended discussion on what qualified four core objectives to fit within what one might call the premier league of statutory objectives. Others fell into what one might call the Nationwide first division of subsidiary factors that should be taken into account. I am concerned with a whole series of factors that did not even make the first division, but which are considered to be important. They did not make the Bill, but I wish to make a case in respect of financial exclusion and quality products.
<P>
The Select Committee that reviewed the legislation examined financial exclusion in some detail and made a strong recommendation that financial exclusion considerations should be built into the responsibilities of the FSA. The Joint Committee also considered the matter sympathetically, but concluded that the FSA should not be overburdened with objectives. However, the amendment does not suggest that the four core objectives should be changed; it merely suggests that financial exclusion should be taken into account, particularly with regard to vulnerable customers.
<P>
I shall briefly review the key arguments that were well set out in a speech on Second Reading by the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love). He devoted the whole of his speech to the issue and captured the arguments very well.
<P>
We want to focus on the fact that groups of people, especially those on low incomes, are disadvantaged because of the way in which financial services are provided, partly as a by-product of how the financial services market is regulated. People are physically isolated, because banks and building societies consolidate and branches close--it is a well-known phenomenon. The business of financial services is transacted electronically, and vulnerable people on low incomes do not have access to it. Some people lack access to financial services products because it is simply not worthwhile to write a personal pension policy for anyone with an income of under 10,000. The costs are so high relative to the benefits, that it is not in the interests of the potential pensioner or the pension company to provide it.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I apologise for my weak voice.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's argument, but as to the vision of banks closing down and withdrawing from estates, the Joint Committee said that it was the Government's responsibility to propose remedies. It was not the responsibility of the regulator to stop people making commercial decisions. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that assessment? In America, for example, the Community Reinvestment Act--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The rule is that interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I agree in part with the hon. Gentleman that the bulk of the responsibility lies with the institutions themselves and with the Government. However, there is a residual responsibility to the financial regulator and I will explain how the financial regulator can help.
<P>
I sketched out a couple of reasons why the financial services market fails many people. Another reason is that many financial transactions involve very high costs. Small weekly collections mean high labour costs; many people in a financially vulnerable position are affected by a unique set of problems such as those involving repossession and insurance policies. Above all, people who are financially vulnerable need advice. They are therefore directly affected by the regulatory issues involved in producing financial advice. The question is whether the issues can be dealt with by the Government on their own or whether they should involve the FSA, a point made by the hon. Gentleman. Clearly, much of the responsibility lies with the Government but those who are concerned about the matter, for example John Bridgeman of the Office of Fair Trading, made it clear that there was a specific role and responsibility for the FSA to consider consumer vulnerability and poverty as part of its remit. We want that to be stated in the Bill.
<P>
Why is regulation relevant to the issue rather than being part of the background atmospherics? For several reasons: first, one of the FSA's main objectives is public awareness, but the public is not homogeneous but diverse. It includes the informed and well-off and the ill-informed and poor. We want the Bill to include an explicit recognition that public awareness must take account of different segments of the public. Secondly, in many instances cross-subsidisation within financial institutions will be needed in order to cater for the specific needs of vulnerable groups. Regulatory support should provide for that.
<P>
Thirdly, regulations should not be onerous. Products and processes that affect income groups should not be left on a laissez-faire basis, but some regulatory obligations can be excessively onerous--for example, the training requirements of financial advisers, which often involve expensive examinations. Is that necessary for the volunteers who run credit unions? A general principle or obligation regarding good practice may not be relevant for institutions that deal with the financially excluded, and the Bill should take account of that.
<P>
I am not arguing that dealing with financial exclusion should be specified as one of the objectives of the FSA, but that the FSA must take it into account--not an especially demanding criterion. It is listed with several others as one of the factors that the FSA has to consider, which is not an unreasonable request.
<P>
Amendment No. 47 deals with the quality of products. It arose from evidence, which members of the Joint Committee and the Select Committee will remember, relating to the Consumers Association and the National Consumer Council, which were concerned about the overall slant of regulation towards processes to the exclusion of products. We debated that extensively and it was decided that it would be inappropriate to change wholesale to product regulation. Nevertheless, that bias within legislation has had some adverse consequences.
<P>
Many financial institutions view their obligations in a very narrow sense in terms of compliance and meeting process requirements. They are under no pressure to improve the quality of their products. The amendment would bring some pressure on them at least to take that into account, as consumers have been badly served in the past by many financial products on the market.
<P>
A second consideration is competition in financial markets. Those who took part at one stage of the review process will remember that consumer groups had great difficulty explaining how competition in the consumer market works. It does not seem to take place through price competition or through policy performance, which is difficult to measure. It was specifically urged that a requirement should be placed on the regulator to press for improved quality of products in order to make competition more meaningful.
<P>
The amendments are modest in scope. We are not suggesting that the FSA should be over-burdened, as the Joint Committee feared, with statutory obligations. The amendments suggest only that a couple of additional factors should be taken into account and I hope that the Government will accept them in that spirit.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity briefly to debate these interesting amendments. They pose problems, however, and I would be surprised if the Government accepted them. They focus on one of the most difficult financial issues facing Parliament today--how to provide investment and pensions products for people on modest incomes. Governments have had to deal with that problem in the wider context of stakeholder pensions, which are much talked about.
<P>
Last Friday I opened the new offices of the financial services training college, located at Wyboston in my constituency. I do not want to make a constituency point, but to observe that it is interesting that the financial service training college exists. it is a private college, much supported by the industry, in an area in which coordinated training is extremely rare. However, the discussions brought home to me how the low levels of charges--1 per cent., I think--relating to products such as those to which the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) is referring, will make it extraordinarily difficult for companies and enterprises seeking to offer such provision to give anything containing significant advice.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is useful to debate the matter briefly, and that is why I have kept my contribution short. I do not wish to be unduly critical of the amendments, as they raise an interesting matter. However, adding them to the Bill is rather like inviting the Government to add a pious hope to a Bill. I am not sure that we really wish that to happen.
<P>
However, there is a real problem in providing products, whether through pensions or investment products, for people on modest incomes. It would be nice to crack that problem and I shall listen with great interest to what the Government say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 52 and new clause 3 are different from amendment No. 47. New clause 3 argues that the regulator should take over from the Treasury responsibility for such matters as charges, access and terms marking. The regulator could do that, but that is not its role, which is set out in the objectives and principles. It is the Government's responsibility to deal with political matters such as CAT marking.
<P>
Ensuring that financial services are available for all consumers is a worthy hope. We shall all see whether that is necessary. However, what is the FSA to do? Is it to subsidise services? Unless providing such services is only a pious hope, it should not be an objective carrying the same weight as the key objectives that should be prioritised in the Bill. Therefore, I support my hon. and learned Friend's comments, as I cannot see how such worthy objectives fit in with the Bill's objectives.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Louise Ellman </B>(Liverpool, Riverside): I am having difficulty relating the amendments to the objective of making provision for a variety of consumers, especially those on low incomes who may be excluded. I support that objective.
<P>
Will the Minister provide guidance on how services for the 500,000 or so people in trade unions may be affected by the regulations? Indeed, will she re-examine the Bill's proposals? I am having difficulty relating the general objective to the detail of the proposals, which do not deal with the specific problems that have been identified.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Twickenham for tabling the amendments along with the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare.
<P>
The matter is very important. The Government are sympathetic to the motives and reasoning behind the amendments. As the hon. Member for Twickenham said when he moved the amendment, we have accepted the recommendations of the Joint Committee that the current structure of objectives and principles should remain and that there should be no additional objectives. Nevertheless, we have given careful consideration to the proposed amendments because we feel strongly in tune with their underlying goals. The Bill already has the desired effect, which I hope will sway the Committee and persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 47 addresses financial exclusion. The thinking behind the amendment, Mrs. Dunwoolly--I am sorry, I mean Mrs. Dunwoody--is to tackle social exclusion as a top priority. Financial exclusion is both a symptom and a cause of social exclusion. People in deprived neighbourhoods get locked into a cash economy and too often their access to finance is limited to cheque-cashing shops, pawn shops, expensive money transmission shops and illegal loan sharks. That is something that we all want to change. I am sure that the FSA will have a role in that.
<P>
Clause 5, the consumer protection objective, clearly differentiates in subsection 2(b) between the needs of those with different levels of experience and expertise in financial services. That is very important. I raise it not to dwell on it at any length as I would be in deep trouble with you, Mrs. Dunwoody; in deeper trouble than I am in already in suggesting that you are woolly in any way. I raise it to explain that the protection that the hon. Member for Twickenham wishes to place in the Bill with this amendment is not necessary because of clause 5. That is how I am attempting to extricate myself from a potentially difficult situation. The FSA will have to take that into account when deciding the appropriate levels of protection.
<P>
An additional provision, clause 5(2)(c), was added in the light of the Joint Committee's report and that requires the FSA to take into account the need that consumers may have for advice and accurate information. That is intended to deal at a general level with concerns that were expressed about what otherwise might be seen as the starkness of the reference to caveat emptor in paragraph (d). It clarifies what is reasonable for consumers to expect and puts their responsibility to themselves to make sound decisions into perspective. But it is implicit that consumers' exact needs for information and advice will differ according to their circumstances and the FSA will also have to take that into account.
<P>
I will also pray in aid clause 4, not to go into it at any length but simply to make a similar point in relation to clause 5.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the Minister will forgive me, I would like to make a serious point. If we are to go backwards and forwards over clauses, when we get to them whoever is in the Chair may take quite a stringent view of how much debate there can be. If we do not go back to this morning or leap too far ahead and if we concentrate on what we have got, we might get some astonishing results.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I agree absolutely, Mrs. Dunwoody. As I am a fawner in my dealings with Committee Chairmen, you would not expect me to operate in any other way. I mention this only because the Bill is so closely interrelated. The hon. Member for Twickenham and his hon. Friends have raised a number of important points, so I mention it quickly by way of reference. Clause 4 will require the FSA to promote to the public the benefits, as well as the risks, associated with various kinds of investments and financial dealing. I hope to reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point.
<P>
One of the factors most likely to cause authorised firms not to provide services to particular groups is cost. The hon. Member for Twickenham raised that issue when he said that adequate financial services might not be available in parts of the community. Clearly, not all the costs associated with providing financial services are down to regulation. However, those costs are not insignificant and they could be enough, at the margins, to turn the provision of a product or a service from being marginally profitable to being unprofitable. That is why it is important that we keep regulatory costs under control.
<P>
As a matter of policy, we entirely agree with the hon. Members who tabled amendment No. 47. In practice, however, we think that the Bill already provides for an appropriate focus for the FSA's activities where that is relevant and appropriate.
<P>
Amendment No. 52 and new clause 3 propose a new statutory objective in relation to product quality. We sympathise with the sentiments behind the proposal. An efficient and effective financial services industry is vital for our prosperity and the standard of living of millions of people depends on well designed and competitive financial services products. We agree with the hon. Member for Twickenham and his hon. Friends on that. We see the need for continuous improvement in the design of those products, but we would not wish to make them the subject of a separate objective. It was important that the hon. Gentleman raised these points, but I hope that I have reassured him on how the Government propose to act.
<P>
The amendments are not necessary because several provisions in the Bill will have a major impact on quality. The promotion of information and education is encapsulated in the Bill, and that will have a knock-on effect on quality. With those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will decide not to pursue the amendment.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I thank the Committee for reacting to the amendments. I discovered a whole new dimension to the phrase being damned with faint praise. Hon. Members sympathised in principle with my aims, but not precisely with what I want to do.
<P>
Two distinct issues are involved. One relates to product quality and the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs referred to a specific aspect of that. He asked whether product quality is coterminous with standard setting, such as CAT marking. He raised an important issue. When we discussed CAT marking in other contexts, particularly on ISAs, there was concern that standard setting by the Treasury would raise problems in itself. There could be an expectation that a product had an implicit guarantee, so it is more appropriate for independent regulators to have the function of setting the standards. None the less, I make the general point that the Government are concerned with a broader objective, and CAT marking is a part of that. It is strange that the Government find that difficult because, the list of principles, as opposed to objectives--in other words, the second order of FSA's aims--states that one of the purposes is to encourage innovation. It is not obvious why the FSA should be concerned with promoting innovation, but not product quality. After all, they are both broad aims, not the FSA's fundamental objectives. It is difficult to understand why the amendment cannot be accepted.
<P>
6.45 pm
<P>
 The second point, which hon. Members have raised sympathetically, relates to credit unions. I am sure that we shall hear how the Government want to approach the regulation of credit unions and friendly societies, which are germane to the debate. We shall table amendments on de minimis limits for friendly societies to test how far they can be allowed to function as providers of financial services to vulnerable groups. I shall see how the Government handle the rest of the Bill and perhaps return to such matters on Report if they do not deal with the spirit of the amendments. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We have debated much of clause 2 in detail, but it is the most important clause in the Bill. It has three crucial aspects. It must be decided, first, whether the FSA must follow the wide objectives relating to what it does, or just certain defined, narrow general functions; secondly, whether its interpretation of those objectives should be subjective or objective; and thirdly, but above all, whether the promotion of competitiveness and the maintenance of competition should be objectives or merely something to which the FSA should have regard.
<P>
When we debated those matters at great length, the Economic Secretary promised to consider them further and comment later. The Financial Times is not known as a salacious newspaper, and I appreciate that not all the spin one reads about the Government is to be believed, but it reports that, on the advice of the former telecommunications regulator, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is absolutely determined to make competition a statutory objective under the Bill and in other measures and that the Government will give urgent attention to revising the Bill to that end.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I, and most of the industry, believe that, because of its intrinsic value and its protective value in restraining this Leviathan, having competition and competitiveness as an objective is crucial. We hope that, in the vein of that which we read about the Chancellor's views, the Government have had second thoughts and may wish to move in that direction.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs says about competitiveness. My hon. Friend intended to focus not so much on competition, which is important in the industry, as on the competitiveness of the United Kingdom's financial services industry, which is crucial to our country. Unless we have a vigorous and competitive financial services industry, the products that are so valuable to consumers and the profit that so greatly benefits this country, helps to provide much employment and is one of the engine rooms of our economy are likely to be damaged. I am grateful to hear from my hon. Friend--I have not read the newspaper article--that behind the scenes the Government are said to be seriously considering the matter as an amendment to this crucially important clause. If they intend to amend the clause, they have my strong support.
<P>
Regulatory objectives can all too easily be stifling. I cannot believe that the chairman, the chief executive or other members of the Financial Services Authority intend them to be stifling, but it is helpful for an authority that is constantly balancing competing objectives to have a statutory obligation to consider the industry's competitiveness. It enables a regulator that will often be criticised for not being tough enough to explain that it must keep a balance and keep the industry alive. It is no good trying to have everything so safe that no one ever dares to cross the road and is not permitted to do so. It is a question of balance and of the Bill's overall approach. The Bill would be improved by the change that my hon. Friend suggests.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I had not appreciated that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs and the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire would want to return to the issue of competition and competitiveness, which we debated in considerable detail last week.
<P>
I remind hon. Members what my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary said in the debate on the sittings motion in our first sitting. He warned hon. Members not to believe everything that they read in the press, including even the Financial Times.
<P>
In our debate last Thursday, I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I have no doubt that we shall continue to reflect on the issue of competition."-- [Official Report, Standing Committee A, 8 July 1999; c. 64.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, we shall do so, because, as he made clear in the speech that was also reported in the Financial Times article from which the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs quoted, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has invited Mr. Cruikshank, the former regulator of the telecommunications industry, to investigate competition in the banking sector and to produce an interim report on the matter, which we expect to receive before the end of the month, and in the light of which we shall reflect on the matter.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that clause 2 (3) (e) Iready requires the FSA to have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the international character of financial services and markets and the desirability of maintaining the competitive position of the United Kingdom".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We dealt fully with that matter in our debates last week, I therefore commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 2, line 31, leave out paragraph (b) and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(b) authorised persons so far as they engage in regulated activities; and".<P>

This is a brief amendment that relates to the part of the Bill that deals with further defining the maintenance of confidence in the financial system. We are advised that, under the Bill as drafted, the banking sector is not covered. The amendment is designed to ensure that the banking sector is included as well as all other financial service territories. It touches on the wider issue of the place of the Bill in relation to the new arrangements with the Bank of England to monitor, regulate and maintain confidence in the banking sector. There would be a question as to the division of the roles in the event of a systemic crisis, even though the two parties would get together and would be supposed to work hand in hand. Time is of the essence when systemic crises occur in banking, and maintaining confidence in the banking sector is ultimately the most important issue. It is crucial, therefore, that the Bill clearly covers that matter; that is the reason for our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> May I add a few bons mots, Mrs. Dunwoody? I would like to raise some questions with the Minister.
<P>
This provision deals with the system of regulatory objectives and systemic risk, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned. Other hon. Friends and I have asked who was responsible for what, in relation to systemic risk. We now have this new tripartite regime, whereas before it was a matter for the Bank of England. The monitoring of the financial system and the financial services market is to be shared between the FSA, the Treasury and the Bank of England.
<P>
That regime was set up under the memorandum of understanding that emanated from the Bank of England Act 1998. We are led to believe that that memorandum of understanding manifests itself in monthly meetings between those three bodies, which supposedly meet to discuss the current state of the banking system, whether there is any systemic risk on the horizon and what preventive action may be taken.
<P>
The trouble is that there are no minutes or reports of those mysterious monthly meetings. We do not, therefore, know what they discuss, even in general terms. It would obviously be improper to learn what they discuss in specific terms--for example, which companies might be under assessment by the tripartite body--because it would release potentially market sensitive information. But even in general terms, we do not know how the banking system and any systemic risks to it are being monitored. I would like the Minister to take this opportunity, under the objectives set out here, to enlighten the Committee. Perhaps she can give us some examples. I return to the issue of competitiveness against systemic risk. If a bank--a British bank, or a foreign bank operating in the London market--were in trouble, what would be the facility for a metaphorical lifeboat to be launched? Where would the funds come from to man that lifeboat? How would it work?
<P>
There is an irony here, because so much of what we proposed earlier has been countered by the idea of the FSA having to have enormous powers in order to act quickly--within a matter of minutes, as the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford keeps telling us. However, the powers previously guarded by the Bank of England, perhaps with a reference to No. 11 Downing street via a quick telephone call, are now to be fragmented between the component organisations of the tripartite regime. It will presumably then take much longer to resolve such matters as what course of action should be taken in a Barings-type emergency, or to assist whatever other part of the banking system is under threat at the time.
<P>
The flip-side to that coin is whether it would present a systemic risk to the banking system if, in order to promote competitiveness, foreign banks were allowed into the London banking market with lower capital requirements. That might occur in order to promote a greater number of banks and greater competition, thereby producing downward pressure on consumer fees and a greater variety of products. However, if lower calibre players were let in to the banking market, would it present a systemic risk?
<P>
Those are legitimate questions, and in the old days they would have been decided by the Governor of the Bank of England. They are now to be subject to the rigours of this tripartite body. Will the Minister reassure us, with reference to the clause, as to how the system will work? On that basis, I commend the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs as a probing amendment, in order to obtain more information as to who will be covered.
