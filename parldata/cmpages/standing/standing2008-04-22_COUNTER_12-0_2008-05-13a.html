							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): Good
afternoon.</div>

Mr. O&#146;Hara.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div>
					<a name="0805148000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rise to
answer the debate on amendment No. 213. As I said earlier, special
advocate procedures are available in other contexts, notably the
Special Immigration Appeals Commission and the Proscribed Organisations
Appeal Commission. The general objective is to keep the special
advocate provisions in the Bill as close to those existing procedures
as possible. The clause reflects corresponding powers in the SIAC and
POAC provisions&#151;for example, paragraph 5(c) to schedule 3 to the
Terrorism Act 2000.</div>
					<a name="0805148000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
indicated, it might be useful if we spoke in more general terms about
asset freezing as it is now. In that context, unless the Committee
needs greater clarification, I am happy to forgo my contribution to a
clause stand part debate.</div>
					<a name="0805148000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will know that asset freezing aims to help prevent terrorist acts by
preventing funds, economic resources or financial services from being
used or diverted for terrorist purposes. The clause reflects the fact
that the United Kingdom does that in accordance with United Nations
obligations. The police and security services have noted the positive
disruptive impact that asset freezing can have, and have made it clear
that the regime is essential for counter-terrorism
operations.</div>
					<a name="0805148000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a document
published in February 2007 by the Home Office, the Treasury, the
Serious Organised Crime Agency and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
entitled &#147;The financial challenge to crime and
terrorism&#148;, we noted that the Treasury had agreed on the advice
of the law enforcement agencies to use closed-source evidence in asset
freezing cases if there were strong operational reasons to impose a
freeze but insufficient open-source evidence was available. The
document stated:</div>
					<a name="0805148000482"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In order to ensure the
fairness of any court challenge to the imposition of a freeze, the
Government will introduce a procedure for the appointment of special
advocates to represent the interests of the applicant in respect of the
closed evidence&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805148000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
should be noted that the Bill&#146;s provisions are not about the
Treasury&#146;s decision to freeze a person&#146;s assets; they
deal with subsequent challenges by the designated person or another
affected person to that decision or a related licensing
decision.</div>
					<a name="0805148000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to some of the concerns expressed this morning, these are enabling
powers. As such, they should be drafted broadly, with the rules of
court giving the details. However, I assure the Committee that the
provision has been drafted to ensure that all cases are dealt with in a
consistent and fair manner, with regard for the rights of the appellant
and the Government&#146;s need to withhold material in the interests
of national security.</div>
					<a name="0805148000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
seek to make provision for a level of detail that is not appropriate to
be included in the Bill. Many of the concerns are about the detailed
operation of the system. In general, I support the underlying concerns
for protection and fairness for all parties. Those will be addressed in
the rules of court, which will be put to Parliament for approval. I
hope that the Committee understands that the vagaries of time do not
allow me to say absolutely, but as I have said about assorted codes of
practice and other secondary matters that follow on from the Bill, I
hope to make the draft rules of court available before
Report.</div>
					<a name="0805148000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
stating the obvious, but I want to clarify the meaning of certain
provisions. First, the words &#147;in the absence of&#148; a party
or a legal representative of that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 437</div>party in clause 57(4)(b) exclude the designated person and his open
advisers. However, they do not exclude the special advocate, who is
appointed to represent the interests of an excluded party in exactly
those circumstances. Earlier references to the designated person or his
agent&#151;in this case, the special advocate&#151;not being able
to be at the closed session are not accurate. They were not a part of
the process as I understand it. The interests of the designated party
were absolutely excluded from the
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="0805148000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0805148000579"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): I am sure that
I will be shot down in flames and corrected, but my reading of clause
57(4)(b) is thus:</div>
					<a name="0805148000483"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;enabling the court to conduct
proceedings in the absence of any person, including a party to the
proceedings (or any legal representative of that
party);&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that not
mean that the lawyer for the party would be excluded from that
hearing?</div>
					<a name="0805148000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000580"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> But not the special advocate&#151;that is the
whole point. The whole purpose of the special advocate provision is to
have the advocate in the room during those nominally ex parte
proceedings, given that the legal representative and the designated
person are excluded. That is the whole purpose of the special advocate
process.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): I hope that I can
help my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham. I disagree with the Minister: I appreciate his point that a
special advocate is not the legal representative of a party, and that
the advocate&#146;s appointment is independent of the court. However,
my reading of subsection (4)(b) is that it enables the court to conduct
the proceedings in the absence of any person. That, on the face of
it&#151;although it might be a bit far-fetched&#151;would appear to
allow the court to conduct its proceedings with nobody present at
all.</div>

of court may make
provision&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805148000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
crucial part. It is a permissive power, but to exclude any person. That

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000588"></a>Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000589"></a>Mr.

so, we have to interpret the Bill as it is currently before us.
Subsection (4)(b) refers
to</div>
					<a name="0805148000489"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;enabling the court to
conduct proceedings in the absence of any
person&#148;&#151;</div>

					<a name="0805148000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is, the

advocate is not caught by the phrase &#147;any
person&#148;.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000590"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Well, the very next paragraph does precisely
that. Subsection (4)(c) says that the rules of court may make
provision</div>
					<a name="0805148000491"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;about the
functions of a person appointed as a special
advocate&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">That interlocks
with subsection (6). It is necessary to put them all together. As I
said at the beginning, I shall make it very clear that the draft rules
should be available to the House before Report. The right hon. and
learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham falls into the trap of
isolating a clause without looking at all the interlocking parts both
in and across clauses, which is easily done but should not really be
done by such a learned and experienced
gentleman.</div>

want to get bogged down in a debate that might be somewhat academic.
However, on this subject I must say that I happen to agree with my
right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham.</div>
					<a name="0805148000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Granted
everything that the Minister has said about special advocates and the
fact that they are not one of the parties to the proceedings, the power
to exclude any person, as I read it in subsection (4)(b), appears to
give the tribunal a power&#151;which might be derived from the
previous rules about the Special Immigration Appeals
Commission&#151;to conduct proceedings without anybody present at

						</b> I am sorry, Mr. O&#146;Hara; I am now
standing and I can intervene on the Minister, because he is the one who
is speaking. I could not intervene before, although I was invited to do
so.</div>
					<a name="0805148000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are making a
mountain out of a molehill here. Yes, the rules of court could make
provision in exactly the way that the hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield and the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham say. It is open to the interpretation that
&#147;any&#148; could mean &#147;all&#148; in the context of
the rules of the court. Subsequent clauses make it clear that that is
not the intention; the Minister is right in saying that.</div>
					<a name="0805148000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I do not think that one
can read &#147;any&#148; as necessarily meaning &#147;all&#148;
in this context. It is a permissive power within the rules of court,
and it would be for the rules of court, not the tribunal, to determine
that. The Minister could usefully avoid the ambiguity in a later draft,
but I do not think that it necessarily means what the hon. and learned
Member for Beaconsfield says that it
means.</div>
					<a name="0805148000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000596"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I appreciate that this discussion is not entirely
about semantics, given that we do not have the rules of court in front
of us. However, I give the assurance that the interpretation as made
will not happen. I grant that the interpretation was not made wilfully;
although some of us struggle with the legalese, I take that view rather
than the stricter version. It will not happen that the party will be
denied a special advocate and this measure is drafted so that the
special advocate is in the room rather than otherwise; that is the
whole purpose of having the special advocate there.
</div>
					<a name="0805148000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I accept that
that is difficult to ascertain on trust from me, without our having the
rules of court in front of us. I therefore assure the Committee that I
will try to ensure that that happens before Report. Anyway, there will
be a subsequent parliamentary procedure on the rules of court; if
people remain dissatisfied, they can react
accordingly.</div>
					<a name="0805148000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
regarding the words in subsection
(4)(a),</div>
					<a name="0805148000493"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;without full
particulars of the reasons for the decisions to which the proceedings
relate being given to a
party&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0805148000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">they
mean that the party and their own advisers will not be informed of the
reasons, but they do not mean that the special advocate appointed to
represent the party&#146;s interests will not be informed of them. On
the contrary, the special advocate will be informed of those reasons
and will have an opportunity to make representation to the judge in the
interest of the excluded party.</div>
					<a name="0805148000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Treasury
notifies individuals of the reasons behind their designation, as far as
possible. Where closed-source material has been used to inform a
designation decision, it might not be in the public interest to
disclose that. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>However, to the extent possible, given the requirements of national
security&#151;as in other such constructions&#151;a gist will be
provided.</div>
					<a name="0805148000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of
the special advocate regime, however, is to create a structure in which
the court, in hearing a challenge, can consider material that cannot be
openly disclosed, and can do so in a way that preserves to as great a
degree as possible the fairness to the designated person. However, it
necessarily involves withholding certain material from that person, for
reasons of national security; if that were not so, there would be no
need for a special
advocate.</div>
					<a name="0805148000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The structure
of the scheme and the provisions are very closely modelled on schedule
3 to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which set up the special
advocate regime, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome suggested,
for control orders. That regime was recently considered by the House of
Lords Judicial Committee in the case of MB. Subject to one amendment,
which is reflected in clause 58(6) of the Bill, the structure was held
to be fully compliant with article 6 of the European convention on
human rights. In the Bill, we have sought to replicate, virtually
identically, the provisions in the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005.
One addition to the Bill is clause 58(6), which expressly recognises
the relevance of the right to a fair hearing under article 6 of the
European convention on human rights.</div>
					<a name="0805148000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon. Members will be aware,
there is no special advocate regime for asset freezing&#151;otherwise
we would not have the present clauses. That means that it is not
possible to rely on evidence that cannot be disclosed openly, unless
the judge uses his inherent discretion to appoint a special advocate on
an ad hoc basis. We seek merely to formalise that
arrangement.</div>
				
					<a name="0805148000532"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0805148000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the only case of this nature to have come to court so far&#151;A, K,
M, Q and G <i class="I">v. </i>HM Treasury&#151;the judge did not feel that he
had such discretion. He felt that such discretion arose only where the
need for a special advocate would be a rarity. In a situation such as
asset freezing, where it is clear that closed material will often be
relevant, it is for Parliament to impose such a scheme through
legislation, not for the judge to introduce one. That is what we are
doing these
provisions.</div>
					<a name="0805148000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">There might
be circumstances in which a hearing is not necessary or appropriate.
The draft rules indicate that all proceedings under this part of the
Bill must be determined at a hearing, except when the applicant
withdraws the application to set aside the asset freeze, when the
Treasury agrees to the asset freeze being set aside, when the appellant
withdraws an appeal, or when the Treasury consents to an appeal. In
those latter cases, a hearing will not necessarily be needed or
required, so we need a little flexibility to enable them to be disposed
of without a hearing.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000597"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I am sorry to intervene on a slightly peripheral
point, but I hope that we will have a chance of dealing with it when we
look at the clause, because we have not touched on it. The clause is
procedural, but the Minister will be well aware that he has a problem
in relation to the power to seize assets under the United Nations order
in council. Was there any proposal to address that issue in the
Bill?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000598"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> No, in the sense that we are currently appealing
against that decision, so the position is very difficult. I cannot say
in absolute terms whether the appeal will have run its course by the
time that the Bill has completed its passage through Parliament, but I
will keep that under advisement. I will not give an absolute no, but I
am in the hands of the timing of the appeal process and, of course, its
outcome. I would not dismiss what the hon. and learned Gentleman says,
but we are really talking about formalising and improving the system as
it stands.</div>
					<a name="0805148000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return
to the point about how to dispose of cases that do not necessarily need
a hearing, we might well need an amendment that adds a phrase such as
&#147;where both parties agree to proceed without a hearing&#148;,
rather than making things compulsory, as at present.</div>
					<a name="0805148000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concern has
also been raised about the interests of a third party with a legitimate
claim on frozen funds. The Treasury may&#151;and usually does, when
requested&#151;grant licences to allow exceptions to the
prohibitions. Licensing is an integral part of ensuring that
asset-freezing measures are proportionate, while ensuring that funds
are not diverted to terrorist purposes. Licences also ensure that third
parties are not harmed by the asset freeze.</div>
					<a name="0805148000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where someone has a legitimate
claim to frozen money, the Treasury can grant a licence to allow
payment to be made. The third party will be able to bring a challenge
to court where they consider the Treasury&#146;s refusal to grant a
licence unreasonable or inappropriate.</div>
					<a name="0805148000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000599"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> The Minister is referring to the rights of possibly
innocent third parties. Is he saying that those will be dealt with in
the rules, or that something in the Bill provides for innocent third
parties to make an application to the
Treasury?</div>
					<a name="0805148000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000600"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> No, I think that I am saying that that will be
duly reflected in the rules of court because it is part of the process
now.</div>
					<a name="0805148000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 207
is not necessary. It would be more appropriate to preserve the
court&#146;s discretion to determine whether a hearing is appropriate
and to avoid inappropriate wasteful hearings, notwithstanding my point
about cases where both parties agree not to proceed with the hearing.
We therefore resist the amendment, although we do not dismiss it
entirely.</div>
					<a name="0805148000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 208 and 214 would&#151;quite rightly in the minds of those who
tabled them, I guess&#151;delete some or all of clause 57(4), which
would entirely defeat the purpose of the asset-freezing provisions in
part 5. This part creates, by way of the appointment of a special
advocate to represent the interests of the applicant, a way in which
the Treasury can reveal to the court and to the special advocate closed
material on which it relies, but that it cannot, for reasons of
national security or public interest, make available more
widely&#151;including to the applicant. I will therefore resist those
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0805148000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 213, 216 and 217 all relate to the protection of fairness, and I
agree with the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham that it is very important that, in all disputes, the
proceedings are, and are seen to be, conducted fairly. Of course, I am
going to invoke article 6 of the European convention on human rights,
among other things. In a very recent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>judgment&#151;I think that it was made in October or November last
year&#151;a similar special advocacy system was broadly afforded a
clean bill of health by the House of Lords. It was an overall judgment.
All sides sought clarity from it, although that was not forthcoming in
all regards&#151;there was a little bit in it for everybody. The
amendments are not necessary for the protection of fairness for the
individual.</div>
					<a name="0805148000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 225 is a requirement to disclose adverse material. This too runs
counter to the whole premise of a special advocate system, which, at
its root, has a desire to instil as much fairness as possible in the
system. Amendment No. 226 refers to the proposed additional requirement
for material in support of the applicant to be disclosed, which, again,
runs counter to what we are seeking through the special advocacy system
and by trying to be as fair as possible to the designated
person.</div>
					<a name="0805148000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, we think that putting the special advocate element in the Bill
is useful and substantially better than the system that prevails for
all concerned at the moment. It is rooted in law and systems that are
already in place under control orders, the Special Immigration Appeals
Commission<b class="B"> </b>and the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission. I
do not think that any of the amendments offer a substantial
improvement, and I urge that they all be
resisted.</div>

							<a name="0805148000602"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. Before I call the right hon. and learned
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, it is quite clear that the
nature of this block of amendments is such that the Minister has said
all that he would need to say in the clause stand part debate, so I
will group that debate with this one. If, therefore, any member of the
Committee wishes to speak to that motion, now is the time to do
so.</div>
					<a name="0805148000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000603"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I understand that decision, Mr.
O&#146;Hara, and make absolutely no complaint about it. May I say,
however, that I am very unhappy about the response that we have
received, and I am going to explain the reasons why over some little
length. To begin with, let us be absolutely plain that a special
advocate is a very imperfect procedure for guarding people&#146;s
rights. A special advocate is not the personal representative of the
affected person; he has a special status. He may not reveal large
chunks of the evidence that is communicated to him. Consequently, he
cannot get the instructions of the affected person as to that material.
In substance, the special advocate&#146;s duties are not owed to the
affected person, and that is why many special advocates have expressed
real concern about and dislike of the procedure. I have never served as
a special advocate, but I certainly understand why those who have
believe that the system is essentially
flawed.</div>
					<a name="0805148000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we
have been told that draft rules will be laid before the House on
Report. That may well be true, and I will welcome it. Let us remember,
however, that we cannot amend the draft rules. They will considered, I
think, under the affirmative procedure, but they may be either rejected
or accepted in whole. I dislike rules of such far-reaching consequence
being dealt with by statutory instrument, rather than in a
Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div>
					<a name="0805148000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that the
Committee, and through it the wider public, understand how far-reaching
clauses 57 and 58 are. They will enable the maker of the rules to
publish rules that almost entirely in favour of the Treasury and bear
little relation to the interests of the affected person. As has been
pointed out, under clause 57(4), proceedings could take
place</div>
					<a name="0805148000494"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
the absence of any
person&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805148000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps that is
not the intention, but the special advocate could therefore be
excluded.</div>
					<a name="0805148000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Evidence
will not have to be disclosed to the affected person; only a summary of
evidence will be required. In fact, the proceedings could be determined
without any hearing at all. No doubt all that is meat and drink to the
Treasury, but to an affected person it is pretty
ghastly.</div>
					<a name="0805148000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then we
examine the rules under clause 58 and find that the disclosure
provisions are such that the maker of the rules can, in effect, exclude
almost any material from the affected person. There are very few
safeguards in the Bill and my amendments are intended to redress that
balance. Amendment No. 213 would require the maker of the rules to
ensure that</div>
					<a name="0805148000495"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the manner in
which the proceedings are conducted is fair to every party to the
proceedings.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask
rhetorically why on earth we cannot put that in the Bill. It seems to
me that that is the duty of every parliamentarian. Amendment No. 216
would require the maker of the rules to ensure
that</div>
					<a name="0805148000496"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the withholding of
the material would not cause injustice to a party to the
proceeding.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, why on
earth are we not putting that in the
Bill?</div>
					<a name="0805148000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 217
would require that a summary
be</div>
					<a name="0805148000497"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sufficient to ensure
that the conduct of the proceedings will be fair to all parties to
those proceedings.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems to be a basic requirement. Amendment No. 266 would require that,
in the event of proceedings,
the</div>
					<a name="0805148000498"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;material which
supports the case of a
party&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">may not be
withheld. My intention is that the Treasury should not be in a position
to withhold from parties to the proceedings material that undermines
its case or promotes that of the affected person. The Treasury does not
have to bring forward any freezing procedure if it is worried about the
nature of information or the means by which it has ascertained it. If
it does, it seems to me that some basic rules should be
observed.</div>
					<a name="0805148000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy made a perfectly fair point about
affected third parties. We are told that the rules will address that,
and let us hope that they do, but I cannot see why the Bill does not
address it. It is of fundamental importance. I shall not withdraw the
amendment. I shall press it to a Division, and the same will apply to
stand part. The clause is profoundly unsatisfactory and I am against
it.</div>

						</b> I will speak primarily to amendment No. 215.
The clause enables rules to be made about disclosure. I have already
pointed out how far-reaching the withholding of relevant information
can be. That being so, it is extremely important that someone who has
some regard for the interests of the affected person should be present,
especially as subsection (3)(a) states that the rules of court must
secure</div>
					<a name="0805148000499"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the Treasury
have the opportunity to make an application to the court...not to
disclose material otherwise than to...the court, and...any
person appointed as a special advocate&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>
					<a name="0805148000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3)(b)
states:</div>
					<a name="0805148000500"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such
an application is always considered in the absence of every party to
the proceedings (and every party&#146;s legal
representative)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805148000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
rules might preclude the affected person or their legal representative
from being present at an application. That could have a dramatic effect
on the nature of the material that will be presented to the
affected person down the track. Who will represent the interests of the
affected person at that point? The Minister will no doubt say that the
special advocate will, and that is precisely what my amendment
says.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000637"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend that
the wording of clause 57(4) could, strictly speaking, despite the
comments of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, allow everyone to
be excluded from the proceedings. However, it seems to me that the
special advocate is not a party to the proceedings. I find the wording
of clause 58 odd, and I think that my right hon. and learned
Friend&#146;s amendment would make an important clarification, but I
would not read clause 58(3)(b) as precluding the presence of the
special advocate at the application.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000638"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I agree with my hon. and learned Friend. It does
not, but it does not require that either. I tabled amendment No. 215
because I think it essential that the special advocate&#146;s
presence is ensured. I agree entirely with my hon. and learned
Friend&#146;s interpretation. That being so, the question is whether
we should make it mandatory that the special advocate should be
present. I believe that we should, for the reasons that I have
outlined. The Bill may permit that, but I want it to be mandatory.
That, perhaps, is the only difference between my hon. and learned
Friend and me. The Minister might well assert that the special advocate
will be present under the rules of the court, in which case I say: let
us put it on the face of the Bill.</div>

Heath:
						</b> The right hon. and learned Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham has a point here&#151;the special
advocate should be present when an application is considered. I accept
that the fact that there is no provision for it, but that he or she is
not excluded leaves 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div>open whether or not he or she is there, but the Treasury is inevitably
party to the application because it is the Treasury that is making the
application. Under any normal arrangement, the special advocate ought
to be there and there should be specific provision for that in the
Bill. I hope that the Minister will accept that principle and, if he
cannot accept the amendment, at least make it clear that that is the
intention in the rules of court that he intends to bring forward and
which we will see before
Report.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000644"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I am sorry to disappoint
because we are where we are, as we were with the last set of clauses. I
have not asserted that this will be in the rules of court; I have given
the Committee an assurance that it will be. If we are serious in our
deliberations to achieve some consistency across our primary
legislation, this is lifted almost entirely out of the primary
legislation provisions relating to the SIAC, POAC or control orders.
There will be the references that the hon. Gentleman requires in the
rules of court, and I do give that assurance. That, with the belt and
braces approach in subsection 6&#151;nothing in the section or the
rules of court made under it is to be read as requiring the court to
act in a manner inconsistent with article 6 of the human rights
convention&#151;achieves the fairness point on which we all agree.
However I do want it to reflect and be consistent with other
legislation. That is the only reason for the
configuration.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000645"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I appreciate the
Minister&#146;s point, and it is a fair one, about co-ordinating with
other legislation, but I have to say that including amendment No. 215,
tabled by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham, does make perfect sense. There is an oddity about the
way the original legislation was drafted. I accept the
Minister&#146;s assurances and it is a minor matter, but if my right
hon. and learned Friend presses amendment No. 215 to the vote, I will
support him because I do not think that I get carried away with the
absolute necessity for these two forms of legislation to be identical.
The regulations being identical may actually matter rather more and I
would assume that they would still be identical. It is an oddity and I
think it probably reflects, not a drafting error, but a tendency of the
original drafter to short-cut slightly. It seems abundantly plain that
the special advocate has to be present.</div>
					<a name="0805148000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000646"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I take the point that it is a
relatively minor drafting issue, but that the substance of it is
serious. I do not dispute its serious nature. For example, for control
orders, the provisions for the presence of a special advocate at the
application hearing appear not in the Terrorism Act 2006, but in the
rules made under it&#151;now part 76 of the civil procedures
rules.</div>
					<a name="0805148000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not a seeker of consistency purely to compound a previous drafting
error. I take the point about the greater degree of eloquence and
clarity&#151;to say the least&#151;in the amendment, but that does
not mean that I will accept it. I am happy, however, to reconsider the
matter on Report. Certainly the important and substantive point, on
which we all agree&#151;that the special advocate should be in the
room&#151;was well made. As I said, I shall reconsider the matter in
relation to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 and other legislative
frameworks. If the amendment would work, and it is in order, I shall 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div>return with something similar, to put in the Bill, rather than in rules,
something on which we all agree. I am more than happy to give the
assurance&#151;not an assertion&#151;that I am prepared to do
that.</div>

Hogg:
						</b> It would be churlish of me not to
acknowledge and welcome what the Minister has said, and on that basis I
shall not press the amendment to a vote. However, may I say that his
remarks rather indicate the importance of putting in the Bill the
requirement reflected in amendment No. 215? When enacting legislation,
we look back to past legislation, as he has done. He pointed out the
previous legislation making provision for the special advocate, and
remarked that it did not make provision for the presence of a special
advocate in counterpart circumstances. I suspect that this will not be
the final terrorism Bill to be considered by this House, and in future
Bills I want the Committee to be able to say, &#147;Well, in the
Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, special provision was made for the presence
of the special advocate in counterpart situations, so we shall do the
same.&#148; We build by precedent, so I want to say something to that
effect in the Bill. However, he has been gracious enough to say that he
will think about it, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

some clarification from the Minister. Am I to assume that the

the Act comes into force? Or should I assume that, in fact, there is no
consultation because it took place when the rules of court were brought
in for control orders? It will be useful for the Committee to know
that. In addition, amendment No. 222 requires the resolution of both
Houses of Parliament before any rules of court are brought into

							<a name="0805148000663"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Under the Bill, the
asset-freezing provisions come into force at Royal Assent. Therefore,
if the amendments are accepted, we will have a period in which the
rules of court will not have been consulted on or agreed but the
personal parts of the Bill will be in force, which is clearly not
appropriate. As the provision says, we need to have a full and
substantive consultation. None the less, it is highly desirable that
the rules of court, which are made under clause 62 and the contents of
which are provided for in part by clauses 57 and 58, should have effect
as soon as possible after part 5 of the Counter-Terrorism Act comes
into force. That is because the rules of court will set out the
procedure which is to apply to the appointment of the special advocate,
for which provision is made in clause 59.</div>
					<a name="0805148000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. and learned Member
for Beaconsfield said, part 2 states clearly that we should properly
consult with the Lord Chief Justice of England Wales on the rules
applicable in England and Wales, and the same for Northern Ireland.
That is right and proper. It is simply a matter of timing so that we
have the consultation on the rules of court taking place at the same
time as we bring in part 5. The notion of part 5 commencing before the
rules of court are in place is inappropriate. The notion that there
should be any delay in the implementation of part 5&#151;contiguous
hopefully with Royal Assent&#151;would be unfair to the individuals
concerned. Therefore, it is a matter of timing. We want as much
consultation as possible, but we want to do it in a timely
fashion.</div>

but he has created a bit of a conundrum here. If the commencement is at
the point of Royal Assent, and the proceedings cannot take place
without rules of court, the Lord Chancellor is under a duty that
applies before consent is given to the Act. That is a very odd thing to
put into legislation; a duty that must have been fulfilled before the
Bill is an Act in order to apply the duty to the Lord Chancellor. Does
the Minster accept that that is a slightly topsy-turvy, Humpty-Dumpty
way of making a
decision?</div>

McNulty:
						</b> I shall not delay the Committee in the context of
whether I think it is topsy-turvy, Humpty-Dumpty or any other such
provision. The key purpose is that part 5 should come into effect as
soon as is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div>practicable&#151;at Royal Assent for example. We have just discussed
how the asset-freezing provisions can impact very directly on
individuals.</div>
					<a name="0805148000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the
hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield, there has been a good deal of
consultation within the relevant Departments, but not yet with the
Lords Justices of Appeal in respect of England and Wales and Northern
Ireland, because the draft is not in that sort of shape yet. Yes, that
consultation has to happen and, yes, Parliament must deliberate on the
matter as well. I assure the Committee that it is only a matter of
time.</div>
					<a name="0805148000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
consider the import of the direct effect on individuals of the
provisions set out in part 5, notwithstanding the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s earlier point about what may or may not happen in
terms of the appeal while the Bill travels gently through both Houses
of Parliament. Things may be topsy-turvy and Humpty-Dumpty, but I
thought that all hon. and hon. and learned Members had agreed that,
given the import of the effect that the provisions will have on an
individual&#151;they can be extensive and serious&#151;the sooner
the measure is in place with a special advocate apparatus around it,
the better for all
concerned.</div>

						</b> If I were being slightly
naughty&#151;and I shall be&#151;I would gently say to the Minister
that there must be a cost involved in this consultation. If the
consultation takes place and, for whatever reason, the Bill never gets
on to the statute book, money will have been wasted. I appreciate the
Minister&#146;s point, but there is an anomaly about providing a
mandatory requirement on the Lord Chancellor to do something that only
becomes mandatory when the Bill is enacted, although he will have done
it before it all happens. This is not the first time that we have
encountered such anomalies. I dare say that, if we changed the rules so
that Ministers had to pay out of their own pockets for any money wasted
as a result of a Bill not being enacted, this practice might
cease.</div>
					<a name="0805148000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased to
hear that there will, at least, be consultation on the provisions that
we are talking about. It is not deemed, as I thought might be the case,
that the previous consultation would be sufficient. On that basis, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the

							<a name="0805148000669"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> We come now to part 6, which deals with inquests
and inquiries and is of some concern to me, notwithstanding the
helpful, useful presentation by the Government last week that
explained their reasoning in respect of this part of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="0805148000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 134
is intended to probe the Minister on the circumstances in which a
certificate will be issued for an inquest to be held without a jury.
Clause 64
states:</div>
					<a name="0805148000504"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may certify in relation to an inquest
that,&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">in his
opinion,</div>
					<a name="0805148000505"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the inquest will
involve the consideration of material that should not be made
public...in the interests of national security...in the
interests of the relationship between the United Kingdom and another
country, or...otherwise in the public
interest.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Owing to the
nature of the Bill&#146;s original introduction, my understanding has
always been that this provision will apply principally to inquests
carried out in respect of matters with a terrorist connection, although
perhaps because of the scope of the powers under clause 64(2) it will
apply potentially in a much wider set of circumstances. I wish to probe
the Government on that
point.</div>
					<a name="0805148000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
words,</div>
					<a name="0805148000506"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the interests
of national security...in the interests of the relationship
between the United Kingdom and another country, or...otherwise in
the public
interest&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0805148000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">provide as wide
a definition as one can possibly get. The clause therefore goes much
further than dealing with terrorism cases. I had the impression that
the sort of case about which we might be concerned is where a terrorist
is shot dead by the police, and the police had intelligence information
relating to his activities that could not otherwise be made
public&#151;something that I can see is a very real possibility. In
fact, the wording we are providing here potentially enables such an
appointment to be made in a much wider set of circumstances. It is for
that reason that I would seek some clarification from the Minister as
to what those circumstances may be.</div>
					<a name="0805148000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000670"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I rise to support what my hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield has said, but I do it more
robustly than he has done, because he has been rather gentle in his
approach to the Government in this matter. I remind the Committee of
the iron rule of politics, which I mentioned several sittings ago, that
once power is granted, it is always, on occasion, abused. Therefore one
has to ask the important question: should this power be granted in the
first instance? That takes one to the question, what in fact are we
doing in regard to this power?</div>
					<a name="0805148000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge
that jury trials in inquests are pretty rare. In the context of
inquests overall, they are a small minority. It is also to be
recognised that they are sometimes very important in terms of public
confidence. When difficult deaths occur, the public sometimes expects
there to be a jury. A good example of that is the jury that Lord
Justice Scott Baker convened in the case of Princess Diana. It may be
recalled that the Court of Appeal substituted a decision that there
should be a jury trial for the previous coroner&#146;s decision that
there should not be one. That reflects the importance of jury trials in
difficult cases.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 451</div>
					<a name="0805148000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we are doing here is
enabling the Secretary of State by himself alone to certify that a jury
should not be convened. The circumstances that have to be satisfied are
set out in new section 8A(1)(a), (b) and (c). I entirely agree with my
hon. and learned Friend that paragraph (c) is couched in the most
extraordinarily wide
language:</div>
					<a name="08051431000007"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;otherwise in
the public interest.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State may well hold that there are many things that it
would not be in the public interest to disclose. Let me give some
examples.</div>
					<a name="0805148000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us say,
for example, that a British national died in Guantanamo Bay and his or
her body was repatriated to the United Kingdom. At that point, a
coroner would have jurisdiction, and I think it is the case that the
public would expect there to be a jury-based inquest into why and how
that individual died in Guantanamo Bay. However, I can see the
Secretary of State saying, &#147;Ah. This is not something that is
conducive to our relations with the United States, so paragraph (b) is
satisfied.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Or let us say
that a plane carrying somebody who was the subject of extraordinary
rendition landed at Heathrow. We know they have landed in the United
Kingdom on occasion. Unfortunately, the person being transferred to
wherever was dead. At that point, the coroner&#151;normally
speaking&#151;would summon a jury; I am sure the public would expect
the jury to be summoned. Yet, the Secretary of State could say,
&#147;Ah. We do not wish to see our relations with the United States
imperilled. We will have this thing without a
jury.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Or let us
say there is a situation which is rather closer to what we have in our
minds at the moment. Say the police shoot somebody in a house. That
does not have to be terrorist based: they just shoot somebody. I can
well see that the Secretary of State may be persuaded, for example,
that it is not a very good thing for the public to know the engagement
rules under which the police are operating. They might dress it up by
saying to themselves, &#147;Well, it is not a very good for
terrorists to know precisely what the engagement rules are that would
justify the armed police opening fire.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once we start giving powers to
exclude juries from inquests we can be quite sure that on occasion they
will be abused. For example, I have a case in mind&#151;perhaps the
Committee has a case in mind&#151;where a person was shot in
circumstances that are a bit hard to explain. The police may feel
uncomfortable about such a matter and seek to persuade the Secretary of
State that it would not be in the public interest to allow a detailed
inquest to be held and a certificate might be issued. As the Bill is
presently drafted there is absolutely nothing to stop that.</div>
					<a name="0805148000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of amendments seek to
address this problem. My own preference would be to have some other
figure involved. I suggested that the Lord Chief Justice should be
required to agree that the criteria were satisfied. At the very least
we should strike out the phrase</div>
					<a name="0805148000507"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;otherwise in the public
interest&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">because, goodness knows,
that is as wide as it conceivably could be. My strong view is that this
Committee is in the business of safeguarding liberty and the public
interest. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div>We are not in the business of giving the Secretary of State the power to
exclude juries whenever it is in his or her opinion in the public
interest so to
do.</div>

							<a name="0805148000671"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I intend to speak to my
amendment No. 32, which is in this group. I will preface my
remarks by again saying how grateful I was for the opportunity to go to
the Home Office and discuss these matters with officials. It was
extremely helpful and it is a good Government policy to share views on
contentious parts of Bills in that way. Having said that, I am not
persuaded that the provisions within the Bill at the moment are an
appropriate way of dealing with a very circumscribed issue that was
described to us as a problem. I still believe that the much-promised
coroners Bill is the appropriate vehicle for reform of the coroners
system and for this purpose, notwithstanding that I understand that a
long-awaited inquest cannot be held under present
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="0805148000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
fundamental principles of the coroners system and article 2 rights with
regard to the investigation of deaths are in danger&#151;I put it at
no higher than that&#151;of being compromised by the proposals before
us. There are two issues here: first, the inquest being held without a
jury and, secondly, the inquest being held by an appointed coroner and
in private. We are dealing at this point with the certificate requiring
the inquest to be held without a jury. The Minister may well say that
this would affect only a very small number of cases because the vast
majority of inquests&#151;98 per cent., I think&#151;are already
held without a jury. The 2 per cent. that have a jury present are the
most contentious of inquests and they are the ones that require the
most careful scrutiny because the death that has occurred involves an
agent of the state. It is right that people should clearly have the
opportunity to see that the state is not acting as judge and jury in
its own court and that there is proper scrutiny of all the arguments, a
proper investigation and a proper verdict. The public is rightly
reassured by a jury being present in those circumstances.</div>
					<a name="0805148000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may well be
that there is a very limited number of cases where there is a
difficulty with that and I understand that. I am not trying to disguise
the fact that there may be difficulties where there is evidently an
expectation that material will be revealed in the course of an inquest
that is prejudicial to our national security. I understand that, but
when I question whether a public interest immunity certificate cannot
suffice I am told that the measure is better than the PII system
because it will ensure that the eventual outcome is made
public.</div>
					<a name="0805148000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000672"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point has substance. The
situation arises in terrorists trials. On the whole, notwithstanding
the jury&#146;s presence, it would be impossible to conduct such
trials and admit quite sensitive material. There is no reason in
principle why some of that procedure could not apply to inquests,
although we may have to wait for a coroners Bill to see such measures
put forward.</div>
					<a name="0805148000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000673"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The right hon. and learned
Gentleman is right. I can conceive of constructions that would enable
that to take place. I accept at face value at the moment the
Government&#146;s intention and the arguments underlying it, but I do
not agree with it. However, I cannot accept 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 453</div>the way in which the proposed new section 8A(1) is drawn because, as has
been said, it is in the widest possible terms. The hon. and learned
Member for Beaconsfield was extraordinarily gentle with the Government
on the issue&#151;I share those gentle criticisms, but I tend to take
a much stronger view on the matter than he appeared to. Perhaps he is
reserving his wrath for later in the
proceedings.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000674"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I started gently, but we are
debating a number of proposed new clauses and a large number of
amendments in the group. The Government should first justify their
position. The amendments are probing and I want to hear what the
Minister has to say. I am also beginning to formulate in my own mind
the necessary response to the Government&#146;s proposals, and I have
tabled new clause 13&#151;I fear that we will not debate that this
afternoon but on Thursday at the earliest&#151;which may propose
alternatives. I remain unhappy with the Government&#146;s proposals,
but as a result of the briefing I have a much better understanding of
its intentions.</div>

learned Gentleman and I are on a rising curve&#151;a
crescendo&#151;of indignation, which is welcome. However, even if I
accept for the moment the Government&#146;s intentions on the clause

should certificate that an inquest should be held without a
jury</div>

					<a name="0805148000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">effectively

					<a name="0805148000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that we are amending the Coroners Act 1988 under which a
coroner conducting an inquest generally has discretion to sit with a
jury, but there are four circumstances in which he or she must summon a
jury. They are when there is reason to suspect</div>
					<a name="0805148000515"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the death occurred in
prison...while the decease was in police custody, or resulted from
an injury caused by a police officer in the purported execution of his
duty&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div>
					<a name="0805148000516"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the death was caused by an
accident, poisoning or disease notice of which is required to be
given...to a government
department&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div>
					<a name="0805148000517"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;inspector
appointed under section 19 of the...Health and Safety at Work etc.
Act 1974&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div>
					<a name="0805148000518"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the death occurred in
circumstances the continuance or possible recurrence of which is
prejudicial to the health or safety of...any section of the
public&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805148000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
years ago, I sat as a deputy coroner, and one reason why I opted for
sitting with a jury was that in some classes of cases&#151;nothing to
do with terrorism or the main purport of the Bill&#151;I thought it
was in the public interest for the inquest to be open and that a jury
should decide the cause of death. More to the point, I believe that
summoning a jury in such circumstance reinforced public confidence in
the system. We all know the adage that justice must be seen to be done,
and there is seldom a better example of justice being seen to be done
than a jury sitting in public and deciding a major issue such as the
reason for a sudden or inexplicable
death.</div>
					<a name="0805148000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The various
categories of the Coroners Act 1988 assure the public that deaths in
such circumstances are not covered up, and that the jury can hear
everything and decide. That is clearly important in maintaining public
confidence, for example, in the conduct of police and prison officers.
I am not denigrating police or prison officers, but if there is a death
in their custody, it is clear that to ensure confidence there is
nothing better than public scrutiny by a
jury.</div>
					<a name="0805148000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another point
that has not been mentioned is that although the provision is contained
in the Counter-Terrorism Bill, my reading suggests that it is not
restricted to cases involving allegations of terrorism, so it could be

							<a name="0805148000679"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is entirely
right. If he bears in mind that the Defence Secretary, for example,
went to the High Court to try to prevent coroners from expressing a
view on the equipment provided to soldiers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div>who died in Afghanistan and Iraq, one may suppose that that could be
used to prevent juries from inquiring into the death of servicemen
abroad when there could be criticism of their senior
officers.</div>

							<a name="0805148000680"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I hear what the right hon. and learned Gentleman
says, and I have read views along those lines. I do not think it is
uppermost in the Government&#146;s intentions at the moment, but he
may well be right. What I am concerned about is this: let us say there
is a violent incident in a pub, a couple of police officers are called
and, during the ml(c)e, an individual is killed. That is a
situation in which, now, the coroner would sit without a jury. I would
find that extremely undermining of confidence in the
police.</div>
				
					<a name="0805148000538"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

					<a name="0805148000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I speak as the
son of a police officer, the brother of a police officer and the cousin
of a police officer&#151;we are a boring family, but there we go. I
have a high regard for police officers. I prosecute, defend and do
whatever is necessary, but I am not one of those who lines up to knock
the police all the time. That has never been my way of thinking, and I
believe that this could be extremely damaging to the police. If the
provision is used routinely in the circumstances to which I have
alluded, it will undermine confidence in the police to a huge degree,
and that is the last thing that I&#151;or, I am sure, any other
member of the Committee&#151;would want to see
happen.</div>
					<a name="0805148000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us look at
the way in which the clause will work. The Secretary of State will
decide, for whatever reason&#151;hopefully not for political reasons,
though it is not impossible that that may happen in the
future&#151;whether an inquest is to be held without a
jury.</div>
					<a name="0805148000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000681"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> Has the hon. Gentleman noted that in this clause,
unlike in previous clauses, it is the Secretary of State&#151;the
interchangeable Secretary of State who may be the Home Secretary or
another departmental Secretary of State&#151;and not the Lord
Chancellor who is specified? Would he have any greater confidence if,
at the very least, the words &#147;Secretary of State&#148; were
replaced with &#147;Lord Chancellor&#148; so that we had somebody
who had a responsibility to perform his duties in the interests of
justice, rather than in the interests of the Government of the
day?</div>
					<a name="0805148000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000682"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> Yes, I think I would feel
slightly more confident, but I would not feel cock-a-hoop about that
either. I suppose I would feel marginally more comfortable. As it
stands in the Bill, the decision is taken by the Secretary of State,
whomsoever he or she might be, and it seems that the only potential
challenge to that decision to hold an inquest without a jury would be
our old friend judicial review in the High Court.</div>
					<a name="0805148000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
a judicial review would be to challenge the legality of a decision not
to allow a jury. Given that the grounds for the Secretary of
State&#146;s decision could be under the broad and non-specific
public interest limb or, indeed, the national security limb, a decision
might be very difficult to challenge in practice. The Bill is silent on
whether interested parties, such as family or legal representatives,
are also excluded.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div>
					<a name="0805148000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The basis for deciding that a
jury should be excluded is:</div>
					<a name="0805148000519"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the inquest will involve the
consideration of material that should not be made
public&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805148000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, by
implication, anyone who is not security cleared is likely to be
excluded from proceedings in the same way that they would be from, for
example, closed sessions in control order proceedings. Perhaps the
Minister will correct me on that if I am wrong.</div>
					<a name="0805148000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are real concerns about
this part of the Bill. There are questions about the compatibility of
the proposals with the UK&#146;s legal obligations. The European
Court of Human Rights, in the case of Jordan <i class="I">v</i>. UK, concluded
that there were five essential requirements of the investigatory
obligation arising from deaths that occur due to state action or while
someone is in the care of a state body: independence; effectiveness;
promptness and reasonable expedition; public scrutiny; and
accessibility to the family of the deceased. That position has been
upheld and confirmed as a minimum standard in domestic cases by the
Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, but this exclusion could
contravene that.</div>
					<a name="0805148000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
more general concern is&#151;I say this quite openly and without
malice or anger&#151;that this provision would seem to be tailor made
for another Jean Charles de Menezes situation. In such circumstances,
no jury would be involved. For the past few minutes, I have been trying
to make the case that that will undermine public confidence, which will
put us at a gross disadvantage. We always talk about legal niceties,
but the bottom line must always be to ensure that justice is seen to be
done. I am afraid, however, that the provisions in clause 64 will drive
a coach and horses through that very important principle.</div>
					<a name="0805148000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister said,
&#147;Well, it will only occur when there are very delicate and
important national security considerations&#148;, I might be quite
prepared to listen and accept that. However, we must bear in mind
paragraphs (b) and (c) of new section 8A(1), which I, like the hon. and
learned Member for Beaconsfield, would prefer to vote on. Nobody would
disagree on the point about national security, but public interest? Who
decides the public interest? It must always be the Secretary of State,
but, with great respect, Secretaries of State sometimes think mainly in
political terms. The measure simply cannot be right. I support the
amendment and hope that the Minister will give us some
assurances.</div>
					<a name="0805148000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000683"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> The hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield knows that juries do not sit on Ministry of Defence cases.
Coroners in such cases have been extremely robust in their findings, so
I do not know how his point was evidence for opposing the
Government&#146;s intentions&#151;the clause has nothing to do with
such cases. The MOD was challenged on one particular aspect of law and
the coroner&#146;s criticism in one particular case. This is not the
blanket, cover-all approach that he suggested.</div>
					<a name="0805148000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy quite fairly invoked Jordan and our
ECHR responsibilities, which is precisely what the clause is
about&#151;hopefully, hon. Members will have been aware of that from
the seminar. It is not just about terrorism. The criteria are drawn
broadly to catch not everything, but those cases that should be caught.
I do not want to go into the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>specific case that has, in part, prompted the provision, but it would
not be covered by paragraphs (a) or (b). It sits very squarely in
paragraph (c) for perfectly reasonable
reasons.</div>
					<a name="0805148000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The public interest simply
cannot be defined as whatever the Government or Secretary of State of
the day fancy. There are plenty of tests for determining the public
interest, and that relates to article 2 of the ECHR, Jordan and all the
other aspects. As hon. Members know, it relates purely to the finder of
fact provisions for the coroner and to giving families the closure and
clarity that they require, which, for a small number of cases, we
cannot give them.</div>
					<a name="0805148000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no alternative to the provision in the Bill, although I have not
read new clause 13, which might be proffered as an alternative.
However, a small number of cases are in limbo, with all the incumbent
stress and everything else entailed for the families concerned. That
was what prompted this provision, not nonsense about Guantanamo Bay,
extraordinary rendition and the other rubbish spoken about by the
representative of the libertarian right at the back of the room. This
is very germane to a small number of cases. It will afford coroners the
ability to do their job under article 2 of ECHR and afford some respite
to families whose cases are held in
limbo.</div>
					<a name="0805148000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000684"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> The Minister is obviously engaging deeply with this
subject, as I would expect. He said, for example, that families should
have closure. My experience as an advocate in inquests, and also from
sitting as a deputy coroner, is that families very often leave an
inquest feeling aggrieved because they did not get the right verdict. I
suggest to the Minister that they would probably be less likely to be
aggrieved if a jury decided rather than a single person.</div>
					<a name="0805148000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on to a
slightly different point, if the Minister is saying that this will
apply to only a small number of cases, he does not gainsay the fact
that this could be opened up and used as often as was liked. It could
be used every time someone dies in police custody or every time someone
dies with any peripheral involvement of the police. My point is that
that could happen, and I hope that he will tell me that I am
wrong.</div>
					<a name="0805148000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000685"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I would contend that that is not the case at all.
On closure, I do not doubt that many families leave a coroner&#146;s
feeling aggrieved, but, as we have agreed, 98 per cent. of the time
there is no jury at all. We are not talking about absolutely closed
proceedings from start to finish, in which all the family get for their
pain and stress is a result at the end. We are simply talking about
affording the coroner a system in which he or she can deliberate on
sensitive material to go towards finding the facts of why the death
occurred&#151;the whys and wherefores&#151;before going on to the
other dimension.</div>
					<a name="0805148000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not pray
the 98 per cent. in aid either, because Members are entirely right that
the cases in the 2 per cent. are, by definition, very high profile, not
least in terms of the list that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant
Conwy read out about the police and other elements. They certainly
almost invariably involve state agencies. What we have at the moment,
without this sort of provision, in a small number of cases&#151;and
that is likely to continue&#151;is stasis, or a state of suspended
animation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 458</div>in which two things could happen. The coroner could sit with a jury and
a whole host of pertinent but sensitive information that, for whatever
reason under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c)&#151;and in the one case we
are thinking of, it is paragraph (c) rather than (a) or
(b)&#151;would be withheld, so it would come to some sort of
unsatisfactory conclusion and, probably, the finder of facts could not
find the facts around the death in the first place. Alternatively, we
could come up with some kind of compromise that through which we
determine&#151;given article 2, given Jordan and given that people
have a right to a full explanation&#151;whether there is a way in
which deliberations can take place with a sense of the material being
deliberated upon, and with as much of the proceedings being in public
as possible, albeit without a jury, so that we can get the narrative,
the story and the closure that people require.</div>
					<a name="0805148000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why not public interest
immunity? Because PII is about withholding material. It is not about
going into a closed session to deliberate further on material and then
going back into an open session. We require all three limbs.</div>
					<a name="0805148000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is this a satisfactory vehicle
to deal with this? No, I would cheerfully leave it to the Ministry of
Justice to deal with in the room along the corridor in its coroners
reform Bill. However, I think, as people understand from the seminar,
that there is at least one pressing case and there might be others. The
sooner this is on the statute book as a resolution to this real
difficulty&#151;it is not going to go away&#151;the
better.</div>
					<a name="0805148000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not
about unnecessarily robust and completely misguided notions. This is
about facing a very serious practical difficult and trying to overcome
it in the best interest for a small number of cases, certainly in the
spirit of Jordan and people being afforded their article 2 rights under
the European convention on human rights. I am afraid that the
amendments, and certainly amendments Nos. 134, 32 and 185, diminish
that. I do not know, and neither does the Committee, what the
circumstances will be around the one or two cases that require this
sort of certification to get the job done. That is why the provision is
necessarily drawn as broadly as possible. I understand the suspicions
about a power that is drawn so broadly that, as Ernie Bevin said, you
could ride a coach and horses through it. However, that is not the case
in the context of the Coroners Act 1988, which is what people should be
looking at, rather than just taking these words at face value. The
provisions need to be looked at in the context of the rest of section 8
of that
Act.</div>
				
					<a name="0805148000539"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="0805148000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I contend that
this measure is about trying to get a public service such as the
coroner service doing its job in full, across the whole range of cases
that come in front of it, including those that, by necessity, are very
difficult. To get to the end game that everybody needs, those cases
require the exploration of sensitive material. Yes, some of it is
sensitive in terms of national security; some of it is sensitive in
terms of the issue about other states; but some of it is sensitive in
terms of that broader public interest. It is in that context that the
power needs to be read, rather than seen as a huge conspiracy that
means that every death created by a state agency or otherwise is
scurried away and examination of it held in
private.</div>

							<a name="0805148000686"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I understand what the Minister is saying. However,
does he understand that our concerns really stem from the fact that the
certifying authority is the Secretary of State, who is a politician?
Our concerns would be very much less if the certifying authority was
not a politician and was someone such as the Lord Chief Justice, or if
the Lord Chief Justice had to be party to the certificate. If that was
the case my anxieties would be very much diminished and I would be much
happier to look at the wider language that the Minister is commending.
However, so long as the certifying authority is a politician pure and
simple, the answer is that the power is not acceptable to
me.</div>
					<a name="0805148000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000687"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> That is a fair point and worthy of explanation. I
indicated at the evidence session that I would be happy to explore
alternatives. Given the importance, as everybody has suggested, of such
a decision, I would not want&#151;to be deeply respectful to my right
hon. Friend the Home Secretary or indeed any other Secretary of
State&#151;to see a Secretary of State scurrying around the skirts of
a judge. This is an intensely sensitive decision that should be laid
fairly and squarely at the door of the politician from the Executive
who makes that decision in as open and transparent a way as
possible.</div>
					<a name="0805148000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I think
that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome implied earlier, that is in
part how to ensure that the power is not subject to the false and
rather rusty iron law of politics that, as he suggested, is that all
power put on the statute book is eventually abused. I am happy to look
at that suggestion and take it away, and explore the certificating
process further before Report. This should not be an issue that divides
us; this is a practical and process issue in dealing with a small range
of
cases.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000688"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> Of course, the experts on the process would be the
judiciary, who always act in a non-political fashion. So, I am
delighted to hear that the Minister will look at this issue again. It
really would improve this measure and also deflate much of what I have
been saying if he were to consider putting the Lord Chief Justice in
that sort of position.</div>
					<a name="0805148000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not casting aspersions
against any politician. I am just making the point that politicians
tend to think politically at times, especially when they are under
pressure. So one thing that we should make sure of is that the decision
is taken at arm&#146;s length. I do not always say that judges are
right, either; I am not saying that. However, we would have that
particular safeguard, which is a very important one
indeed.</div>
					<a name="0805148000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000689"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Given the list that the hon. Gentleman read out
in terms of police custody, prison, police action and other situations
and given the point that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome made
about many of the areas that we are discussing involving the forces of
the state in some way or other, my starting point is to leave the
certification with the political masters. However, I take the point
about getting a deal of other cover in the judiciary. Although I am not
deeply enamoured by it, I will certainly take the suggestion away and
have a look at it. However I do not think it helps to overcome the
practicalities that we face with this system in a very few cases and
the issue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column460" />Column number: 460</div>that everyone recognises of sensitive material that is not always in the
national interest, which is why I prefer the three limbs. The
amendments would take away one and then two of the limbs and that would
not take us a whole lot further in tackling the practical problem that
we face in affording people their article 2 rights and in the context
of Jordan, which is why I am happy to say we will resist the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0805148000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000690"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> This has been an interesting debate. The Minister
asks us to not see it in the context of the Bill and of the other
provisions, but we cannot avoid doing that. What we have here is a
proposal and the proposal is that a Minister of the Crown can decide,
because of facts that he or she knows and the rest of us do not, that
the circumstances of a death will not be put before a jury in the first
instance and, secondly, that it will be put before a selected
coroner&#151;not one of the normal coroners, but a coroner appointed
by the Secretary of State for that purpose to investigate what is, by
definition, a death involving agents of the state. It is not surprising
that people are concerned about that, notwithstanding what I believe to
be the good intentions of the Minister. It is not surprising that
people are concerned about that in the context of a counter-terrorism
Bill and not a coroners Bill that seeks to reform the process of
coroners&#146;
courts.</div>
					<a name="0805148000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
there may be circumstances in the context of the policing of terrorist
activities where a person may lose his life and the circumstances are
not available to be released to the public gaze because of intelligence
matters, ongoing investigations or a myriad of factors that do directly
impinge on national security. I am not dog in the manger about this; I
am very happy to engage with the Minister to see if we can find a
better way through, as he quite appropriately said at the beginning of
our deliberations. He will see that I tried to put down amendments to
try to improve this part of the Bill in ways that would reduce some of
the anxieties about the Bill and certainly the later clauses dealing
with the appointment of a coroner. However I am still unconvinced that
this is an appropriate vehicle, particularly in the context of the
interlocking of the clauses, to extend this matter beyond national
security.</div>
					<a name="0805148000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the Counter-Terrorism Bill; it is about national security, and we
are asked to entrust to a Minister of State the decision not to allow
matters, which would normally be put before a jury in an inquest, to go
before a jury or a normal coroner on the basis not of national
security, but of an undefined public interest or the relationship
between the United Kingdom and another country. That is inherently a
political judgment. We are now not talking about the interests of
national security; we are talking about an intrinsically political
judgment&#151;how are we going to square this with the Foreign
Secretary of X state, who is hopping mad because we might be doing
something that will concern their interests. How are we going to tell
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office how to respond in the embassy in
wherever it is when it has local officials breathing down its neck,
saying, &#147;This is the last time we co-operate with you, chummy,
because you are allowing this inquest to go ahead and it is going to
greatly embarrass us when it hits the national headlines.&#148;? The
Secretary of State is required to make a political judgment about that
and then to change our legal process in respect of coroners 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 461</div>courts to accommodate it. That is the difficulty that I have with the
clause. I hope that we can find an accommodation on this part of the
Bill and a way of moving forward, but we cannot do so on the basis of
what is currently in the Bill. If the opportunity arises, I shall press
amendment No.
32.</div>
					<a name="0805148000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000691"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> Perhaps I should perhaps
apologise to the Committee, and certainly to the hon. Gentleman, who
made the criticism that I was rather tentative in describing these as
probing amendments that were tabled to try to get some clarification of
what the Government were trying to do. I accept that there was a
certain tentativeness, partly because&#151;I say this openly&#151;I
find this part of the Bill one of the most
problematical.</div>
					<a name="0805148000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
of the problem is that we have come upon the matter almost
unexpectedly. We have Mr. Rebello&#146;s letter of
clarification, but there was no prior consultation about the measure,
let alone its link with a new coroners Bill. The Minister freely
admitted that when he gave evidence to the Committee. It comes in a
counter-terrorism Bill, but, as the Minister has admitted, its scope is
much wider. It goes to the heart of whether there should be major
reform of the coroners&#146; process.</div>
					<a name="0805148000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know, and
the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy helpfully set out this based
on his experience, the criteria that coroners use. I have experience of
appearing in coroners&#146; courts. In particular, he highlighted the
circumstances in which it is provided expressly that a coroner should
empanel a jury. Without doubt, the reasoning behind that provision in
the 1988 Act was to maintain public confidence in the transparency and
independence of the process.</div>
					<a name="0805148000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike any
other process in this country, the coroners&#146; process is
inquisitorial, not adversarial. It is a form of inquiry, and that was
precisely why, when the helpful briefing began to explain the
Government&#146;s intentions to me more fully, I began to see that
there was some force in the Government&#146;s arguments. They were
certainly able to deflect me from the view that I had taken on Second
Reading, when I was simply astonished that the measure had been
introduced and worried about its implications for public confidence and
the independence of the coroners system. The Government provided me
with a degree of reassurance, and I began to see that the appointment
of coroners was not a sleight of hand by which they would get their
placemen to sit on coroners&#146; inquests.</div>
					<a name="0805148000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could also
see, perhaps even before I received the briefing, that problems would
be raised by the Government&#146;s having at their disposal in an
inquisitorial proceeding information that was likely to be highly
relevant to a decision about why somebody died at the hands of the
state, but could not be used under the Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act 2000. Moreover, although there has been talk of having
specially vetted juries, such information could be brought before a
jury only with great difficulty. As Mr. Rebello made clear
in his evidence, it could be brought before a suitably cleared
coroner.</div>
					<a name="0805148000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government clearly have a problem, and they are entitled to introduce
legislation to try to solve it. My difficulty is that the more I look
at the detail of what they have drafted, the more worried I am about
the unintended consequences of it. It seems to have been drafted in
some haste. I remain anxious, and unresolved 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>in my own mind, about what safeguards there should be to ensure that any
change to the system maintains public confidence and ensures the
outcomes that we want to
see.</div>
					<a name="0805148000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I freely accept
that these are probing amendments. I can see, for example, that the
Minister has an argument when he says, &#147;The interests should not
just be national security; they should go wider,&#148; because we
want to cover cases that involve putting intelligence material before
coroners, but they are not national security cases. One can see also,
for example, that the cases may include police intelligence that may be
relevant. Those changes may be quite progressive, but on the other
hand, when one sees introduced as a separate category the
words</div>
					<a name="0805148000520"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the interests

may go beyond the interests of national security or the public
interest, it becomes difficult to fathom what we are dealing
with&#151;except embarrassment. All that highlights why there should
have been proper pre-legislative scrutiny and an opportunity for the
provision&#151;in an ideal world&#151;to be part of the coroners
Act. Indeed, I am by no means convinced that the proper place for it is
not in a future coroners Act, even though there may be a problem with
an existing case. It may even be worth delaying an inquest for another
12 months, or however long it is, for the sake of having it in a
coroners Act. I remain unhappy about the structure of the
clauses.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="0805148000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I take
another example, Mr. O&#146;Hara? I hope that you will
forgive me if I widen the scope, but as we are having a more general
debate about the issues, it would be quite beneficial. I mentioned that
I had tabled new clause 13. Quite apart from the fact that we cannot
consider it this afternoon, because I was able to start formulating it
only after I had heard the briefing at the Home Office, and was
therefore unable to table it until yesterday, I remain rather
unsatisfied with it. My difficulty with the new clause is that it
should not be the Secretary of State who provides a certificate of
authorisation; there should be an application to the
court&#151;probably involving the Lord Chief Justice.</div>
					<a name="0805148000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am the first to accept that
the new clause is far from perfect, but that again highlights the
difficulties that we will have in trying to make this aspect of the
Bill acceptable. Our one opportunity may be on Report, which, to return
to my apology at the start of these remarks, is one reason that I have
tended to treat most of the amendments that I have tabled as probing
amendments. They would not leave the Bill in an acceptable form, even
if the Minister accepted them.</div>
					<a name="0805148000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, the Opposition
must take some decisions. Unless I am satisfied with some elements of
the Bill, I am likely to vote against them, so I put the Minister on
notice that I shall probably vote against clause stand part in each and
every case. The question arises as to whether the Bill can be improved
in order to demonstrate the Committee&#146;s concern prior to our
doing so.</div>
					<a name="0805148000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis
of what the Government are trying to achieve, granted my reservations
about everything else, I still do not understand how new section
8A(1)(b),</div>
					<a name="0805148000521"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the
interests of the relationship between the United Kingdom and another
country,&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div>
					<a name="0805148000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">can feature. As the only way of registering
that point would be to support amendment No. 32, tabled by the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome, I am minded to do so, if only to
indicate to the Minister&#151;no more than that&#151;where I am
unhappy with the Bill. The Minister has an argument that it would be
better to delete new paragraph (b) while leaving in new paragraph (c),
but that illustrates absolutely the areas of difficulty that we
have.</div>
					<a name="0805148000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my
identifying where the problems are has been helpful to the Minister. In
summary, I see them in two forms. First, I am anxious about getting rid
of a jury, and that the convenience of being able to allow in such
material might in the medium term fatally undermine the use of juries
in cases where the police shoot people, as in the example given by my
right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham. In such circumstances, we might end up with very few inquests
with juries, because we have not thought through the implications of
the provision at all. The way in which it was introduced was to say,
&#147;This is about intercept evidence in the case of
terrorists,&#148; but we now know that it is not. Secondly, I worry
very much that the issuing of a certificate by the Secretary of State
without a proper mechanism for judicial scrutiny or authorisation is
also fatally flawed. That is what I was trying to deal with in new
clause 13. </div>
					<a name="0805148000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">With your
permission, Mr. O&#146;Hara, what I propose to do,
imperfect as it is, is not to press the lead amendment no. 134, though
I hope that we might have an opportunity to vote on amendment no. 32.
Furthermore, although we shall carry on with our probing amendments, I
put the Minister on notice that unless I am satisfied that we are
putting together a package that is acceptable, it is my duty as an
Opposition spokesman to vote against the various clauses making up this
part of the Bill, until such time as we have it in an acceptable form.
That will be a challenge for the Minister, but I want to make it clear
that if he can come up with such a package for Report, I for one will
be quite happy to support
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000710"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> This continues our scrutiny of
this section of clause 64. Once the certificate has been issued in
relation to an inquest, the inquest must be held or, as the case may
be, continued without a jury, so that if a jury has not been summoned,
the coroner must not summon a jury. If a jury has been summoned, the
coroner must discharge the jury. Subsection (4) says:</div>
					<a name="0805148000522"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Accordingly, the
following do not apply in relation to the inquest whilst the
certificate has effect&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0805148000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">and then effectively says that all the
existing coroners rules can be overturned and ignored, including the
requirement to have a jury in the circumstances that were so neatly
encapsulated by the comments of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant
Conwy.</div>
					<a name="0805148000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is that what we
really want to do? First, I was slightly puzzled on a matter of
information as to the need for these certificates to be issued even
when the coroner had already summoned the jury. I would have assumed
that its only application could be to the case which is currently
pending and not in future. I wonder whether that is necessary. Even if
the Government wanted to do what the provision seeks to achieve, why
would the certificate not be issued prior to the summoning of the
jury?</div>
					<a name="0805148000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, to
return to what we were debating a moment ago, have we thought through
the impact of getting rid of juries in such cases? Perhaps we could
focus for a moment on that. We have juries in coroners&#146; inquests
for good reasons: primarily, as I said, to command public confidence
that the system is independent and transparent and that it is possible
for verdicts to be returned that might be inconvenient to the state.
That is particularly the case, although not necessarily exclusively,
where, as here, we are dealing with people whose lives are likely to
have been taken by state action. We have not had an opportunity to
debate the issue through.</div>
					<a name="0805148000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no
doubt that lots of inquests have taken place in the past 30 years in
which intelligence information that might have been of interest to a
jury was not made available. Of course, how coroner&#146;s inquests
work is sometimes criticised, but it has not been suggested before that
that is a reason to get rid of juries in those circumstances. We have
not considered whether specially vetted juries could be used. We do vet
juries; it has been done, perfectly successfully, in national security
cases. I expect that, because it is an inquisitorial process, the
information laid before a coroner&#146;s inquest is likely to be
fairly circumscribed, rather than, &#147;This is a download of all
the intelligence material that we have had about this case over the
last six months.&#148; In those circumstances, it might be possible
to have a jury if we were prepared to vet one specially, but again, we
have not debated that issue at all. As we consider the matter in
Committee, I hope that the Minister will respond on that.</div>
					<a name="0805148000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister can
also amplify his later remarks in justifying the need for the
provisions. To return to why I think that they appear in the Bill,
history shows that when trying to legislate over a single problem that
has arisen in a controversial and complex area, it is terribly easy to
get it wrong.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000711"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I utterly agree, but that is not what we are
doing. The provisions might have been prompted by one or another case
currently stuck in the system, but they have been designed and written
as regular law, not just a law to respond to those specific
circumstances. However, I understand the difficulty of how the
provisions relate to the much-vaunted and heralded reform of the
coroners system. That is a completely fair point.</div>
					<a name="0805148000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I resist the amendments, because
they negate the whole purpose of the clause, which is to allow a jury
either to be discharged or not to sit in the first place, but I am
conscious that it might be more satisfactory if, between now and
Report, we could at least explore some way in which the provision
relates to the substantive matter of all the wider reforms in the
coroners reform Bill. Aside from the matters before us now, I am
perfectly prepared to take that away and consider it in terms of
clauses 64 to 67. The fellow from the Coroners&#146; Society was
honest. He said, &#147;Well, yes, someone did mention it back in
January,&#148; but I apologised for the fact that there had not been
as much concentration as there should have, notwithstanding
Mr. Rebello&#146;s comments.</div>
					<a name="0805148000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be clear. I repeat that
this is not about going counter to the ECHR; it is the
reverse.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000713"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman
might, but not everyone in the room does. It is worth repeating. The
clause deals with a practicality that is before us now in respect of
one case, although it certainly only arises in a few cases a year. The
clause says that there are ways in which we need to dispatch and deal
with cases that sometimes require a coroner to sit without a jury, not
least because he is considering sensitive material. I cannot accept an
amendment that would mean keeping the clause but not including the
provision that there may not be a jury or that a jury should be
discharged.</div>
					<a name="0805148000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assume, and unless I am corrected I will stand by this, that the twin
points are included because in some circumstances, as the odd case
develops, sensitive materials that might aid the fact finding may come
to light that were not apparent in the first instance. The provision is
intended for that reason, rather than any
other.</div>
					<a name="0805148000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am loth to
call these amendments wrecking amendments, although they are certainly
negating amendments, and they are certainly in order, otherwise they
would not be on our order paper. Nevertheless, I urge the Committee to
resist
them.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000714"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I shall avoid taking up the
Committee&#146;s time on votes on individual probing amendments. I
have to accept that completely redrafting the clause is beyond me,
although I may attempt to do it before Report. However, my gut feeling
is that that is required. If we were able to redraft the clause, we
might even be able to point out to the Government that we are trying to
achieve most of what they intend&#151;albeit in a form that I find
much more comfortable and acceptable in my anxiety about maintaining
transparency and confidence in the system&#151;and trying to ensure
that the process has proper judicial oversight, which is lacking at the
moment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div>
					<a name="0805148000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not press the amendment to
a vote; I am simply using it to tease out this important debate.
Considering the Bill clause by clause and subsection by subsection
helps me understand the issues that arise. First, we need a system in
which judicial oversight is seen to be operating and in which the
mechanism is not triggered by the Secretary of State&#146;s
certificate. Secondly, we need some confidence that the necessity of
getting rid of a jury has been thought through. Thirdly, we need to
maintain public confidence that, under the system for appointing
coroners&#151;the Minister might be following the Home
Office&#146;s briefing and might be better able to satisfy me of the
bona fides of the Government on this matter&#151;the coroners are
independent and that existing coroners, preferably, will be doing the
exceptional work that is
required.</div>

is saying that the original inquest will be quashed and abandoned and
that a completely fresh process will begin. Otherwise, I would expect
that the coroner would be able to take account of what had been said

at the earlier coroner&#146;s inquest is for whatever reason not
available&#151;they might be dead or unwell&#151;to give evidence

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000718"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I can give the hon. and learned
Gentleman the assurances that he seeks, but let me take away and
explore the notion further. It is entirely right if it is discovered
part way through a hearing that a special coroner rather than a coroner
is necessary that the proceedings should be treated as if from the
beginning. That is perfectly reasonable for the coherence of the
clause. However, I accept the point on how to utilise evidence given by
a significant witness who has appeared earlier but who, for whatever
reason, is incapacitated&#151;death, I suppose, is the most excessive
example. That was an entirely fair point, and I shall take it away and
explore it.</div>
					<a name="0805148000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
broadly, for now, within the context of accepting the import of clauses
64 and 67 and the system that I am proposing, there is a logic to the
notion that if sensitive material in the case requires a special
coroner that means that the case cannot proceed, the special coroner
should treat the process and the hearing as though he is starting from
the beginning.</div>
					<a name="0805148000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

deals with the fact that there may well be extant cases that need

no more on that.</div>

						</b> Again, the amendments are
probing and I do not intend to press them to a Division. I am grateful
for the Minister&#146;s comments, particularly on amendment No. 193,
which concerns what would happen to evidence that was given to an
abandoned
inquest.</div>

							<a name="0805148000720"></a>Mr.

						</b> There is one way to deal with that. What would
usually happen? The earlier statement would be served under the Civil
Evidence Act 1995, and could then be admitted as
evidence.</div>

							<a name="0805148000721"></a>Mr.

						</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point: indeed,
that is what one would usually expect to happen. The oddity is that the
wording of the measure makes one think that it might be prayed in aid
to prevent that. However, that classically illustrates the sort of
problems that I have when I read the Bill. I am in relative ignorance
as to what the Bill may
do.</div>

							<a name="0805148000722"></a>Mr.

						</b> Will my hon. and learned Friend remind me&#151;I
do not remember because it is a long time since I appeared in
coroner&#146;s court&#151;whether a transcript of evidence is given
in front of the coroner? If not, it would be quite difficult to use
previously given evidence in a freshly convened
inquest.</div>

							<a name="0805148000723"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> That is a very interesting question. I do not
think that there is any reason why it should not be transcribed, but in
my experience, many coroners&#146; inquests are not transcribed. I
can see the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy nodding from a
sedentary position. I do not remember any transcript being available at
the last inquest that I did. We were completely dependent on the
notebooks of the counsel and coroner to tell us what was said. In the
inquest into the death of the Princess of Wales, I rather suspect that
there was a transcript available. In fact, I would be very surprised if
there were
not.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000724"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The answer to his question is that some
coroners routinely tape evidence, so transcripts are available on
request. Equally, half of coroners rely on the old-fashioned system of
notes being
taken.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000725"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> That highlights the unusual
nature of coroners&#146; proceedings. As the Minister will
know&#151;or perhaps he will not know because the new coroners Act
will not fall within his remit&#151;coroners&#146; inquests are
very dependent in their conduct on the character of the coroner. There
is a considerable degree of informality. Limited financial resources
are available to support coroners in their work. Often, preliminary
meetings take place at the coroners&#146; offices. If the coroner is
also a solicitor, they will be held at the local solicitor&#146;s
office in which he happens to be practising. Sometimes there is not
even a purpose-built building in which the inquest can take place, so
somewhere has to be found. Yet, coroners&#146; inquests do very
important work. Improving that work is something that the new coroners
Act is designed to try to achieve. We have to ensure that whatever we
do here, we do not put a spanner in the works. I beg leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="0805148000726"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I hope that the Minister will not take this in bad
part, but, for the reasons that I gave earlier, I have to urge Members
of the Committee not to support something that is in a form with which
they are not comfortable. I am not saying that I am opposed in
principle to what the Government are trying to do, because I am not. I
can understand that there is an important issue with which the
Government are trying to wrestle. That was made quite clear when we had
the briefing at the Home Office. At the same time, is clause 64 in a
form with which I am content? The answer must be that it is not. At the
end of the day, the urgency of the issue is not such that even with a
suspended inquest lurking, if the Government were told that they could
not proceed unless they got their act in order before Report, it would
be the wrong thing to do. For those reasons I oppose clause
64.</div>

						</b> I entirely agree. I am less
generous than my hon. and learned Friend. It is not just that I am not
comfortable with the clause; I disapprove of it. We are giving to the
Executive a power that we should not give. If we are going to give it,
it needs to be much more restricted than what we are proposing in the
Bill. The power to order an inquest without a jury is drawn far too
wide. It is within the exclusive control of a politician, and I am not
prepared to accept that politicians in this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div>context always act in good faith. My own belief is that on occasion,
they act in bad faith and we have to guard against that latter
situation. I personally will vote against this whatever my hon. and

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000746"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> We now move on to the way in
which, when a certificate has been issued for there to be no jury in a
coroner&#146;s court, a coroner can be specially appointed to
displace the coroner who would have heard the inquest at the behest of
the Secretary of State. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div>purpose of this group of amendments is to say that that simply will not
do, and that it is inappropriate for the Secretary of State to appoint
the person who heads the court&#151;the coroner&#151;instead of it
being a judicial appointment. That runs counter to any principle of
judicial independence that we may have. It simply cannot be right that
in the first instance the Secretary of State decides that it is
inconvenient for an inquest to be held with a jury and for certain
matters to be put before an open court, and then to decide who will sit
in judgment on that closed matter in the coroner&#146;s
court.</div>
					<a name="0805148000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not unsympathetic to some of the Government&#146;s arguments, but
I am totally unsympathetic to the view that any Secretary of State
should take that responsibility on himself or herself. I am looking for
an alternative way in which to ensure that as near as possible, within
the constraints that the circumstances require, an ordinarily appointed
coroner leads the inquest and hears the evidence. It is clear that for
that to be the case, the coroner must be vetted if they are to look at
material that is not available to the general public. There must be a
vetting process, and then there must be a process to indicate which
coroner in those circumstances should preside in a case when there
would usually be a territorial requirement but that requirement has
been
displaced.</div>
					<a name="0805148000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000747"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I am broadly with the hon. Gentleman, but we do
not have a national coroner system at the moment. We may have, after
the reform Bill, but we do not at the moment. If the hon. Gentleman
shuts up now and withdraws his amendment, I shall happily, with him or
without him, go away and consider the matter. I am not terribly
bothered whether it is the Secretary of State, Lord Chief Justice or
whoever, but I want to explore the matter further. I just need a device
to get said individuals in place to do what I want them to do under
clause 64, and I fear that the longer the hon. Gentleman goes on, the
more I am
dissuaded.</div>
					<a name="0805148000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000748"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am not going to be dissuaded from making the
case, Mr. O&#146;Hara, during the Committee stage of a
Bill. The Minister&#146;s response is what I anticipated. I do not
believe that he can be wedded to the idea, which is so corrosive to the
principle of an independent judiciary, that the Secretary of State
should decide who should be the coroner. First, if it were possible for
the Lord Chief Justice to take that responsibility, that would put it
into the judicial sphere rather than the political sphere. Secondly, it
should be possible for any coroner on the coroners&#146;
list&#151;I agree that we do not have a national coroner system at
the moment&#151;to be able to apply to be included on the list,
subject to the vetting procedure. Many will not want to go through that
procedure because it is onerous, and they may be happy not to be on
that list and not to hear such inquests, but they should have the
opportunity to do so and to be on the list. Once we have a list, the
Lord Chief Justice should be able to select the coroner who is most
appropriate to hear the case, having regard to the geographical
situation and any other circumstances that might apply. I think that we
can trust the Lord Chief Justice to do that in a dispassionate way and
to take an appropriate decision, and that is what I intend by my group
of
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0805148000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000749"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> In the interest of brevity and mindful of the
Minister&#146;s stark warning, I just say I
agree.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>
					<a name="0805148000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000750"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am going to say a bit more than &#147;I
agree&#148;. It is extremely important that we should substitute
somebody such as the Lord Chief Justice for the Secretary of State,
because after all, we want to go back to where we start. Where we start
from is that the Secretary of State has certified that in his or her
opinion, the matter should not be heard with a jury. We are then going
on to the next stage of contemplating a specially appointed coroner to
determine an inquest that has already been the subject of the Secretary
of State&#146;s certificate. The public has got to have confidence in
the procedure and I should have thought that the public would be very
concerned if, in such a situation, the Secretary of State were then to
nominate a specifically appointed person.</div>
					<a name="0805148000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a further dimension to
this that arises out of the European convention on human rights. This
Committee will have in mind that there has been a growing recognition,
as a result of the European convention, that the Executive has to be
distanced further than was the case from judicial actions. I have in
mind two matters&#151;for example, the fact that the Lord Chancellor
is no longer able to sit on appeals. That arose because the Government
understood, in my view rightly, that this was incompatible with the
European convention because, it was said, it was wrong for the
Executive to have any role in a judicial process.
</div>
					<a name="0805148000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
consideration that comes into play is perhaps closer to this one. The
Committee, or some of it, will keep in mind that there was a process
for appointing assistant recorders. The status of assistant recorders
has, I think, been wholly abolished and replaced by full-time recorders
and the reason for that, in my understanding, was that it was felt in
Government, and I think again correctly, that it was incompatible with
the European convention to have a judicial process conducted by
somebody appointed ad hoc, that is to say without certainty as to the
term of his or her appointment. Once you have got yourself a specially
appointed coroner, you are in precisely that position and therefore not
only as a matter of perception, but I think as a matter of substantive
law, it is extremely important that the Secretary of State is not the
appointing authority, or at least is not the sole appointing
authority.</div>
					<a name="0805148000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful to the Minister for saying he is not wedded to this particular
concept, because if he is, he will probably lose it, if only on
judicial review. I hope he will come forward with some solution along
the lines put down in the various amendments. I personally think it
best of all to have the appointment of the specially appointed coroner
by the Lord Chief Justice, and that is something that I would be
content
with.</div>
				
					<a name="0805148000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000751"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I agree with the points that
have just been made by my right hon. and learned Friend. In fairness to
the Government, when we had the briefing at the Home Office, it became
clear to me that in their intention of having specially appointed
coroners, the Government were not attempting, as I said earlier, to put
in functionaries who would do their bidding, but that primarily they
would be looking to existing coroners and to having a small specialist
panel who had been specially vetted for the purpose. In addition, it is
not unheard of&#151;it has just happened with the inquest on the
Princess of Wales&#151;to appoint a High Court judge or a Lord
Justice of Appeal as a coroner. All those things provide flexibility in
the system, which I would not wish to see removed.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div>
					<a name="0805148000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fact remains, however, and I am pleased the Minister seems to have
taken this point on board, that the appointment ought to be by the Lord
Chief Justice. Indeed, the argument in favour of the Lord Chief Justice
appointing coroners is even stronger than that in favour of him
deciding on what the interests of national security may be, and it
would be very much easier for him to do. That might be one of the
reasons why the Minister seems to be more attracted to that proposal
than to the others for the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s role. I strongly
urge the Minister to consider his role in both circumstances, but
particularly in the appointment of
coroners.</div>

uncorrected, Members will continue to feel strongly about it on Report,

to provide for the Lord Chief Justice to have this role, if it is not
commended. On that basis only, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

							<a name="0805148000755"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> The amendments are mainly of a probing nature,
although some are more specific than others. I shall run through those
of particular interest to me. Amendment No. 190 would provide that in
the exceptional circumstance of the issuing of a certificate, it would
have to be subject to a ratification by both Houses of Parliament. That
is a rather ponderous process. I think that the system of having a Lord
Chief Justice is probably preferable, but if it is to be used in highly
exceptional circumstances only, the amendment might provide for an
alternative way forward.</div>
					<a name="0805148000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think
that amendment No. 192 adds anything to the substance of the
discussion, but amendments Nos. 194, 228 and 195 are important to the
latter part of clause 65. I shall begin with amendment No. 194.
Proposed new section 18B(4) to the Coroners Act 1988
states:</div>
					<a name="0805148000528"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by regulation made by statutory instrument
provide for this Act and the law relating to
coroners  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div>and coroners&#146; inquests to have effect in relation to specially
appointed coroners with such modifications as may be specified in the
regulations.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate why that might be required, but the power is far too
sweeping to be given to the Secretary of State. If we are to have
regulations, I would expect them to be like rules of court and approved
by the Lord Chief Justice, even if they are put forward by the Lord
Chancellor. That would be a better way to do it. Furthermore, we will
obviously require the opportunity to vote on the regulations. The
system cannot simply provide for a vote on annulment. It must be
decided on a positive vote by both Houses of Parliament, so I would
expect it to be decided by affirmative
resolution.</div>
					<a name="0805148000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment No. 195 is a probing amendment that would leave out proposed
subsection
(6):</div>
					<a name="0805148000529"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may pay a specially appointed coroner such
remuneration and allowances as the Secretary of State thinks
fit.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805148000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would expect
procedures to be in place to ensure that that is not done on an ad hoc
basis, as the provision seems to imply it would be. I am not sure how
Lord Justice Scott Baker was remunerated for his work as the coroner in
the inquest into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, but I assume
that it came out of his salary for sitting as a Lord Justice of Appeal.
I would not expect there to be a special remuneration and allowances
rate as is the case if a coroner is specially vetted by a
panel&#151;although, I suppose that it could be argued that he
receives an enhanced salary for having undergone that process.
Otherwise, however, it should all be part of a day&#146;s
work.</div>
					<a name="0805148000542"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div>
					<a name="0805148000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000756"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> Amendment No. 180 is an attempt to ensure that
where these special procedures apply, an inquest is held in the place
in which it would normally have been held. That is to say that, if it
were a matter coming before the coroner in London, the inquest would be
held in London. If it would normally have been held in Somerset, it
would be held in Somerset. That is important for the victim&#146;s
family and other witnesses.</div>
					<a name="0805148000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would not
be appropriate simply because of the circumstances of the case for the
inquest to be whisked away to Paddington Green or somewhere in order to
be held even more remotely from the normal arrangements. I hope that
the Minister can give me an assurance as to how guidance will be issued
to the various authorities that determine where an inquest is held, and
that the normal circumstances and arrangements for an inquest will be
as I
suggested.</div>
					<a name="0805148000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000757"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I will comment on two matters which fall within this
group of amendments. First, on the regulations, I agree with my hon.
and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield that it is highly
desirable that the regulations should be subject to the affirmative
resolution procedure and not to any other.</div>
					<a name="0805148000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
remuneration. It is very important that we should keep in mind public
confidence, and it would be very undesirable in those terms if the
specially-appointed coroner were paid a remuneration out of kilter with
that paid to ordinary coroners, especially if the specially-appointed
coroner were paid a great deal more. I can see the
public&#151;Mr. al-Fayed, for example&#151;complaining 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 474</div>like anything and suggesting that the specially-appointed coroner was
being bribed, or something of the kind. What is required is something
like that which is provided for in my amendment No. 233, which has not
been selected, namely that the level of remuneration should be agreed
prior to the appointment by the Lord Chief Justice. If that were the
case, I think it would be extremely difficult to make the criticism
that might otherwise be made, but I do think that we have to address
the question of remuneration and put in place some mechanism to prevent
anybody crying
foul.</div>
				
					<a name="0805148000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000758"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I agree with what has just been said, and with what
the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said about inquests taking place
where they would have done under an ordinary coroner, if I might put it
that way. It goes to public confidence, and I think it is very
important that we have a geographical spread of these coroners
throughout England and Wales. That is
key.</div>
					<a name="0805148000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Wales, we must
also consider the ability to speak the Welsh language. As a Welsh
first-language speaker, I have practised many times in coroners&#146;
courts and conducted proceedings in Welsh without the need for
translation. We must look at both the geographical spread and the
linguistic differences. In Wales, there will occasionally be a need for
a Welsh-speaking coroner. I agree with the purport of the amendments
and hope the Minister will give some reassurance in due
course.</div>
					<a name="0805148000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000759"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> On amendment No. 180, it is not our intention
that the inquest should be anywhere other than the appropriate
location. Given that I have said that these will be cases that are few
and far between and very small, even with a cadre of six to eight
specially appointed coroners it should not be beyond wit or
practicability to ensure that that prevails. I hope that gives the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome the reassurance he
seeks.</div>
					<a name="0805148000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the wider
points made by the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield, much of
what he has discussed relates to what we were talking about before in
terms of whether the Secretary of State, the Lord Chief Justice or
whomever should be party to the appointments. I would prefer that we
take that away and look at it in the same spirit as I have suggested,
save for a couple of points. As I understand it, members of my office
are developed vetted over the course of six months. They have to be,
because of my responsibilities. It is quite a tortuous process&#151;I
am not sure whether their friends talk to them again&#151;and it does
not involve any increase in their remuneration. They then go back and
get on with their job.</div>
					<a name="0805148000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point about remuneration is
included because of cases such as Diana. That is not an appropriate
example, because the coroner was judge-appointed, but in such cases
there is an extraordinary level of travel and other costs additional to
the regular remuneration. It is not about paying some inflated fee to
special coroners because they are lapdogs and lickspittles of the
Government, which of course they will not
be.</div>
					<a name="0805148000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">The broad spirit of
the amendments, including amendment No. 178, which we have discussed,
is about who should make the appointment and whether it should be an
Executive role. I am happy to consider the matter and return to it on
Report. In that context, I ask that the amendment be
withdrawn.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 475</div>
					<a name="0805148000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805148000760"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> As these are probing amendments, I am happy not to
press them. I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will
reconsider. On an optimistic note, I hope that he will have seen from
the debate that we have the foundations for agreement on the issue.
That might well require the Government to redraft the clauses in
question radically to get them in a form that would command general
acceptance. I hope that he will take that on board. I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
