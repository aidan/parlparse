that, and I expect the Clerk will report me to the appropriate House

                        </p>‘(d) NHS
providers and providers to the
NHS.’.<p class="tabbed">Thank
you, Mr Hancock. I hope your decision does not exclude tea—a
fine English tradition.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000010">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment’s purpose is twofold: we seek to tease out from the
Minister assurances about accountability and how committed the
Government are to maintaining services. Will the Bill create a big
distance between the Secretary of State and the provision of services?
I will not go into positions of the commissioning board and the GP
consortia, but they are obviously an important part of that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000011">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When we
discussed amendment 32, it was stated that there would be no mechanism
in the Bill to make the Secretary of State responsible for the
provision of services. Perhaps the Minister will address that point.
The amendment is designed to reinforce the idea that the Secretary of
State is responsible for providing health services for the country, and
one way to do that is by directly exercising his function in relation
to NHS providers. That goes to the heart of a discussion that I know we
will have again
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000012">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
number of hon. Members asked whether hospitals might somehow be saved
because of the Bill, and we will certainly explore that in more detail
later. As for whether there will be no centrally directed closures,
again, there are some interesting aspects to the Bill that relate to
such matters. I am looking forward to debating whether hospital and
accident and emergency unit closures and reconfigurations will somehow
not happen because of what has been put in the Bill. Perhaps that is a
debate for later on, but it is worth flagging up at this
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000013">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to be clear about the key points. Whenever we refer to
issuing the Secretary of State with certain powers or constructing
guidelines with regard to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 212<a class="bkMark" name="Column212">&#160;</a>
                           </div>NHS providers, we must also refer to providers to the NHS—in
other words, independent or private providers seeking to provide NHS
services. It is paramount that we place “NHS providers”
and “providers to the NHS” on the same legal footing, to
ensure that there is no ideological bias in favour of the private
sector. That is important in terms of the role of the private sector in
the provision of services which, if the Government get their way, will
be affected by the commissioning board and the consortia. A crucial
debate in the Committee will be on the role of Monitor and the powers
that the Secretary of State will or will not retain over the provision
of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have mentioned, there is a debate about the direct involvement of the
Secretary of State in driving improvements in the NHS and responding to
the concerns of hon. Members and the public about, for example,
potential cuts. To return to the question of hospital reconfigurations,
because of the Government’s financial decisions on the NHS and,
if the House agrees, the decisions on the powers of Monitor, which will
designate services, there may be cuts or closures. During the clause 4
stand part debate, it will be interesting to explore what powers the
Secretary of State will exercise. Will he intervene in hospital
closures if Members of Parliament seek to meet him and get his view?
The involvement of the Secretary of State is very important, not only
in driving through improvements but in dealing with difficult decisions
that affect our constituents and constituencies.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the
Bill, the Secretary of State will not be able to exercise his function
directly in relation to NHS providers to the NHS, or intervene to
secure the provision of specific services in specific areas. That is
our understanding—perhaps the Minister will say whether that
understanding is correct. Instead, the Secretary of State will solely
have the power to instruct the bodies set out in the new section 1(2A)
of the National Health Service Act 2006 on how to act by, for example,
setting the annual mandate for the NHS commissioning board, as the
explanatory note mentions.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The annual
mandate is another very interesting mechanism in terms of its impact on
the NHS and the powers of the Secretary of State. If the Minister wants
to say something about the mandate at this stage, we would be very
happy to hear that. If he wants to say something later, we will be
happy to hear it, because the mechanism is one that we need to explore
as fully as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
is designed to ensure that the Secretary of State retains more of his
current power to drive improvements in the NHS and to ensure that any
decision is in the best interests of the people of this country and
health service provision. In a sense, we have come to what is probably
a difference between our two parties. We think that a Secretary of
State with those powers is crucial to driving through significant
improvements of the sort that that we have seen since 1997, whether in
the form of shorter waiting lists, improved cancer and coronary care,
and so on, or better appointments with GPs. There has been a range of
improvements, which I think the Minister tried to suggest in a previous
debate amounted to political interference. Again, what it is important
for the Secretary of State to direct and what is political interference
is a debate that I am sure we will continue to have throughout
Committee stage, but we

                           </div>believe that the Secretary of State should retain the powers to ensure
that he can drive through the changes with, of course, those working in
the localities and other partners within the NHS. It gives the wrong
impression if those powers are reduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000018">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As I said,
under a Labour Government, the Secretary of State would have been at
the centre of the process of driving improvements in the future. In
short, this is another example of where it is disingenuous to suggest
that the Bill represents an evolution of Labour health policy, because
we were not planning in any way to reduce or change the powers of the
Secretary of State in relation to the changes that the present
Government are pursuing. Clearly, we wanted to get clinicians more
involved in commissioning and to make improvements along those lines,
but what is proposed is not a change that we would have pursued. We
want the Minister to give us his view on the matter, and we will
consider whether to press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000019">&#160;</a>

question, not because I do not want to, as I certainly do. For example,
under the Bill we will stop the perverse

                           </div>and uncompetitive practices relating to independent sector treatment
centres. As the hon. Gentleman will recollect, they were independent
sector providers that cherry-picked certain types of health care
provision, which were given contracts that paid them more than the NHS
for the same operations. The contracts also had a rather perverse
condition that, if the provider was contracted to provide 100 cataract
operations a day and it provided only 50, it was still paid for
100, which seems rather uncompetitive. However, as I think you will
agree, Mr Hancock, I will not go down that route at this stage,
simply because that debate does not altogether come under the
clause. There will be more than ample opportunities under the right
part of the Bill to discuss the question of a level playing field in
greater detail. I am sure that the three Opposition Front Benchers are
looking forward to that avidly. We will be able to correct some of
their misunderstandings and
misapprehensions.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000026">&#160;</a>

have already said, but because, to put it in shorthand, the effect
would be to redefine the Secretary of State’s role in relation
to providers and to require him to have a direct role with them, which
is not in the whole ethos and vision of liberating the NHS. I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will come to appreciate and understand that it is
important that we have a liberated NHS that can concentrate, as I said
before, on raising quality standards and improving outcomes, which are
the most important things for patients. They want to get better

to be drawn on some of the issues that I raised about private sector
competition in the new structure, but may I refer him to the evidence
given by the British Medical Association, which is clear about its
concerns? Although it welcomes further clinical involvement in
commissioning, which is certainly contained in the Bill, the positive
aspects of the Bill are threatened by other unnecessary reforms, which,
from its perspective, include the involvement of the private sector and
any willing provider. What will the Minister do in the Bill to promote
further partnership, as was put forward by the BMA and some of the
other representatives from professional

trusts was to give them independence from the controls and the
day-to-day micro-management that the other providers in the NHS still
have from the Secretary of State and other Ministers in the Department
of Health. They have that independence because Tony Blair recognised,
as did Alan Milburn, that there were great advantages for the
advancement and improvement of patient care and quality in
having providers that had a degree of independence to get on with
developing the quality care that they wanted to provide for

I know that in 2002-03, when the first wave of legislation was

hon. Friend the Minister of State and I will demonstrate that when we
get to the section of the Bill that deals with competition, which
slightly locks in with the interventions made by the hon. Member for

                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister,
in some ways, slights me. Some of the amendments may turn out to be
probing amendments, or may be ones that Members want to vote on. I have
given the Minister the chance to persuade me and my colleagues that we
may have misunderstood the Bill in some way. He has reassured us that
the aims are somewhat different from what we think they are, but he did
not answer the key question about the change in direct responsibility
for providing and securing the provision of health services. The Bill
will change that completely—it will be a fundamental and major
change. He dressed that up with an argument about political
interference, but he was never able to articulate or explain what that
meant. We had, for instance, three examples of interference in an
earlier
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
fact, we could go back to the debates at the start of the health
service and the Conservative party’s position at the time
regarding political interference in the running of the services. We
seemed to have come again to an argument from many years ago. Over many
decades, the Conservative party—I am surprised that the Liberal
Democrats are going along with this—has generally supported the
national health service and the current provision of those services by
the health service and the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the Minister is now arguing for a major change that he has not
explained. What evidence is there that making the change will improve
health services? What evidence is there that things can be done better
this way? How does he answer the point about the Secretary of
State’s role in ensuring that the organisations responsible for
providing the services will act in a similar way to the Secretary of
State in terms of overall concern for public need? The Minister has not
outlined those issues. It is a fundamental change to the health
service, and the only answer that he seems able to give is that it will
reduce political interference. He has not been able to give any
evidence to support such a major change.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I ask the
Minister again. I am not sure that I will get very far, but it is worth
putting it on record that we tried. We are seriously concerned about
fragmentation, lack of collaboration and serious damage to the
provision of health services if the clause is
passed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000055">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will respond briefly. The trouble is that the
hon. Gentleman, I suspect for philosophical reasons, does not accept
the basic premise that drives the reforms and what we are committed to.
As he rightly says, all my political life I have been a staunch
supporter of the national health service. I believe in it, I use it and
I do not want it privatised. There is no intention whatever to
privatise it, and there never has been in any previous Conservative
Government. We want to strengthen it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, the
hon. Gentleman and I differ significantly about how to do so. I believe
that the NHS must be modernised and evolve to go from strength to
strength. That philosophy is based on a belief that we need to liberate
the national health service, with checks and balances, to ensure that
providers get on with their job of providing quality health care for
patients. It is a philosophical divide, I am afraid. Whatever I say, I
fear that the hon. Gentleman will not accept it, simply because he
wants to keep the status quo and stay within his comfort zone in his
views on how the NHS should continue to run, rather than giving it the
powers to aspire to bigger and better things by building on its
strengths to improve and enhance quality and
outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000057">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It seems clear. As for the idea that we are against
modernisation, he talked about modernisation under Labour
Governments—I shall not mention a certain person. Labour
Governments have continually modernised the health services. It is not
as though we have stood still and not improved the health service or
made changes. Of course we have, and we have talked about those
changes. To try to paint us into a corner and say that we are against
modernisation and change is completely inaccurate and wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000060">&#160;</a>

biggest shake-up of the health service since its conception. The cost
is phenomenal, and the chaos it is causing and the potential damage to
the health service are immense. That is the difference. This is
ideologically driven. It is cast under the shadow of reducing political
interference, but the Minister cannot explain what evidence backs up
the proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000061">&#160;</a>

difference between these health reforms and the approaches of previous

                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
wondered—as did some of the newer and more radical faces in my
Policy Unit, although this was still heresy in the party, not least
among most of my ministers—whether we had been right to
dismantle wholesale GP commissioning in the NHS…instead of
adapting these concepts of local self-governance to spread
decentralised management across the state health and education
systems…I also chafed increasingly at the restrictions placed in
the way of good independent providers establishing themselves within
health, education and the other public services. This seemed to me a
classic case of the confusion between means and ends which had dogged
the left for a generation—and which it was New Labour’s
mission to overcome. For public services to be equitable, and free at
the point of use, they did not all need to be provided on a monopoly
basis within the public sector, controlled in a rigid way by national
and local bureaucracies often deeply resistant to innovation and
genuine local
autonomy.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000369">&#160;</a>

swiftly because they are minor and technical. They clarify two things.
The first is that research is not solely a public health function, but
spans both public health and the NHS; secondly, they deal with the

functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000097">&#160;</a>

include all of his functions under schedule 1 to that Act. That
includes his power to conduct, commission or assist research under
paragraph 13 of that schedule. One effect of this is that, in clause 5,
the NHS commissioning board’s duty to promote the comprehensive
health service excludes such activity. However, such research may
relate to the NHS as well as to public health. It is therefore not
appropriate to exclude it from the board’s duty to
promote.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000099">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 1
has the effect of removing the research function from that definition.
That has always been the Government’s policy, and the amendment
does not represent any change to our stance on health research. We have
always been of the view that the Secretary of State should foster
research in both public health and the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000100">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 3
clarifies which provisions of schedule 1 to the 2006 Act
confer public health functions on local authorities—namely,
paragraphs 1 to 7B and 13. They cover the medical inspection of
schoolchildren, the weighing and measuring of children, and research
for health service purposes, all of which are conferred on local
authorities under clause
25.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is not merely a question of terminology. The amendments are necessary
because the definition in clause 1 has implications later in the Bill.
For example, clause 5 provides that the NHS commissioning
board’s duty to promote the comprehensive health service does
not apply to that part of the health service that is provided in
relation to the public health functions of local authorities. It is for
these reasons that I move that the amendments be

him correctly, the Minister said that the commissioning
board had responsibility. Will he clarify that? Is the Secretary of
State’s power being reduced or changed, with the commissioning
board taking over that responsibility? The Secretary of State has a
duty for public health and health generally; I apologise if I
misunderstood the Minister, but am not quite clear what he

                           </strong> I think this debate will be very useful,
particularly for many of my hon. Friends, in getting our concerns and
points across. I want to set the scene and ask the Minister a number of
questions, which will be a bit more detailed than those I was allowed
on the specific amendments. They will speak to the concerns
that we have on the role and responsibility of the Secretary of State,
transparency and accountability, and the responsibility for the
provision of services, which we have already had some debate
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to make the point that democratic accountability is the
cornerstone of our democracy. In its current form, the Bill raises
serious questions on accountability, which have not been satisfactorily
answered in debate on the amendments. In this debate, we will focus on
those areas in
particular.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we know, the NHS is the single largest state organisation, and is paid
for by our taxes. It is important that the service can be fully
provided. Our health is all-important to us. The NHS is a safety net
that ensures that we do not have to worry about how we will afford
health care. It is the very principle that underlies the health service
and some of our concerns on where it is going into the future, if these
changes take place. Will that still be the case? The Minister will have
a chance later to try to reassure us
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important that those who run the service are accountable through the
people to Parliament. To imagine that such an organisation could exist
without the Secretary of State would go against the founding principles
of the NHS. The issue about its being a national health service is very
important. That is why we have concerns about the proposed changes that
the Government are making to the Secretary of State’s
responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The reason
for the shift to reducing accountability seems clear to us. As we know
from this clause, this Bill is ideological. Public accountability is
not needed if 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 222<a class="bkMark" name="Column222">&#160;</a>
                           </div>there will be a completely free market. I will come back to that issue
in a minute. That is the driving principle of the Bill and the Minister
has not—in any way—satisfied our concerns during the
discussion of this clause. Our concern is whether the best possible
care for everyone can be secured everywhere that health care is
provided, with the change in the Secretary of State’s
responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000118">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have no doubt that we all want to see improved
accountability, which is very important at local level. We could have
another debate on commissioning and whether it should involve not only
GPs, but other commissioners, local authority representatives, patient
groups and so on. When we talk about accountability, we have to be
careful to identify what we actually mean. The Government go one way,
but during Committee stage, we will table amendments that will help to
improve accountability. I do not want to go on to the PCT-consortia
debate too much, but it comes back to PCTs. Could they not have been
made more accountable, with more commissioners or by having patient
groups or local councillors on the board, rather than going through
wholesale change? The accountability of consortia, in particular to
patients, is an important aspect of the Bill that we have yet to
explore, because there are many concerns about how it will work. The
hon. Gentleman makes an important point, but it is not as clear as he
is suggesting in his
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000120">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What
we must not lose sight of is the fact that we all want to improve the
health service and to achieve the most efficient and best possible
value delivery of services that also meet the needs of patients. My
argument is that the Bill will not deliver that in a way that we think
it can be delivered, building on the improvements that Labour has made
over the past 10 to 13 years. We will debate that
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000123">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the problems with the Bill, which I pointed out in speaking to the
first amendment, is its complexity, with a great deal of uncertainty
about what the changes will mean in practice, as well as the
interlinking between the powers of the Secretary of State, the
commissioning board, the consortia, Monitor and healthwatch
bodies—I could go on. There are lots of complexities, which is
why I said that we want to spend some time on clause 1, because it is a
fundamental part of the changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000124">&#160;</a>

experts on health told us that they did not understand what the Bill
meant or how it will work in practice, on the ground, in terms of
responsibilities, accountability and transparency, so it is only right
that we tease answers out of the Minister. His greatest argument is
that he wants to reduce political interference, but he has not yet
provided the reasons for making the changes, which are profound and
have far-reaching
implications.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000125">&#160;</a>

today that the hon. Gentleman has cited organisations within the health
service criticising the reforms, be they professional organisations,
royal colleges or trade unions. Looking back over the past 20 years, I
have trouble identifying a single set of reforms that those same
organisations greeted with acclaim. With the possible
exception of the 1997 reforms, reforms to the service, whether by
Labour or Conservative Governments, have always garnered criticism and
accusations of privatisation and such like. The foundation trust
proposals were greeted the same
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000126">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is indeed true of any reforms over the years,
going back to the setting up of the health service and the massive
difficulties between the BMA and the then Secretary of State, Aneurin
Bevan. Their exchanges were infamous for their bitterness. From the
very inception of the NHS, there have been concerns about changes in
health
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government suggested that there was wholesale support for the principle
of what they are doing, but when the Bill was published—before
that as well—suddenly people were saying, “What does this
mean?” and great concern was expressed. Some complained that the
Government were putting about acceptance of the principle as a good way
forward, because we are all in favour of commissioners being involved
in commissioning, but that was not true. In fact, I cannot recall such
a wide range of concerns expressed in recent times about a profound
change, and the change the Bill represents is profound—it is the
biggest single change. We must be careful about what we mean. I accept
that any reform or change is likely to have a lot of opposition, but we
are talking about the context and I must not stray too far from the
clause, or I will be pulled up. However, the principle is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Going
back to the complexity of the Bill, we want the Government to answer
some of our questions. Further down the line, those answers will be
very important for their arguments that the changes are not
privatisation or whatever else the Minister is being accused of. He
will have to explain the reasoning and the rationale behind some of
these changes and what they mean in practice for the delivery of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On that
point, during a debate with me on “Newsnight”, the
Minister said on the record that we will have a fully open market in
the NHS. That will clearly bring major challenges in public
accountability. That brings us back to our earlier amendment on the
provision of services. As he said, the fundamental change that there
will be, as he said, a fully open market is something we want to

State’s public health functions and his role in relation to the
securing of services for the purposes of the NHS. Currently, the
Secretary of State is directly responsible for providing or securing
the provision of all health services as set out in the NHS Act, a
function which is largely delegated to Strategic Health Authorities and

                        <p>As
I said to the Minister, he really needs to be clearer. I sought an
explanation using a quote from Tony Blair, but that does not really
explain this. He has not stated what evidence the Government have for
making this structural, profound change in going to consortia. He has
not provided evidence of how that will make things better. I will come

that the ethos behind the White Paper and the modernisation is that we
want to detach, for want of a better word, the day-to-day
micro-management of the NHS by Ministers and civil servants in
Whitehall. We are creating the national health service commissioning
board to do that. That board will drive the commissioning of health
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000136">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of State will issue a mandate that tells the commissioning
board what we expect it to deliver in health care for the people of
England. That will be done with checks and balances to ensure that that
is delivered. However, what will be different is that it will not be
Ministers doing the day-to-day managing and controlling; it will be the
commissioning board within the remit given to it by the mandate, which
is a far more transparent and accountable system. That is added to by
the fact that the Secretary of State will have to produce an annual
report to
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000137">&#160;</a>

I hope he will take in the spirit of being helpful. It would be useful
to have more explanation about the

                           </div>mandate in respect of the national commissioning
board and how he sees that working. On hospital closures and
reconfigurations, which a number of his hon. Friends have raised, I am
asking what, in practical terms, will be the impact of the powers of
the Secretary of State and his accountability when real things happen
in the health service, which is what we are all interested in? That is
what our constituents are interested in: their hospitals, their GP
surgeries and smoking prevention programmes are all
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000140">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us take hospital closures and reconfigurations. Many Government Members
are strongly of the view that the Bill will somehow stop a lot of the
closures of hospital units and A and E units. The Government keep using
the phrase, “no centrally directed closures,” but that
does not mean that there will be no closures. Can the Minister tell me
what the difference will be in the Secretary of State’s powers
proposed in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me give the example of MPs being able to lobby the Secretary of State,
or indeed the Minister, who actually listens when issues are raised. He
has been kind and helpful in a couple of cases in my constituency. How
will the Bill change that? Take the example of the burns review, which
was not about the Minister but about burns units in the north. There
was a great deal of public anxiety and opposition; tens of thousands of
people signed a petition, and there were real worries about valued
services being lost or transferred. As a group, the Merseyside MPs were
able to lobby both a Minister of State and the Secretary of State about
the closures. In the end, we were grateful that we won a victory and
stopped the proposals being carried
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000142">&#160;</a>

to explain whether that will change. If I went to the Minister now,
would he say, “I am sorry, but I can’t do anything about
it. I have no powers. I will listen to what you have to say, but that
will be the end of the story,” or will a Minister still be able
to do something as a result of the powers in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000144">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
is important in terms of accountability to Parliament. MPs who have a
big health issue in their constituency want to have access to the
Minister and to be able to talk to him about problems. Will that still
be the case, or will the Minister say, “I am sorry, you have to
talk to Monitor.”? It is important that the Minister tells us
whether MPs will be told to go to Monitor, the national commissioning
board or even local consortia to sort out health problems in their
constituency.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000145">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
appears that because of the open market, the regulator’s powers
make the Secretary of State powerless to act in, for example,
designation of a service. Under the Bill, Monitor will have the power
to designate services. What impact will that have on the Secretary of
State’s involvement? In some mysterious way, the regulator will
ensure that vital services are maintained, while the rest will be up to
various competing organisations. The Secretary of State will have no
role. How will he be accountable for quality standards, and what
actions will he take as a result of the changes in the Bill? How will
he ensure that there is no fragmentation of services? That is a key
concern about the changes proposed in the Bill. What powers will the
Secretary of State have to ensure that services are not fragmented and

delivery of health services in the future? Our concern, as the Minister
knows, is that that will be difficult because of the setting up of
consortia, the powers of Monitor, the competition rules and so on. It
is important that we know what the Secretary of State’s role
will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000146">&#160;</a>

I discussed this earlier and the Minister gave an answer, I want to
clarify it again for the record. Data and statistics are currently
produced centrally by the Department of Health and can be accessed by
MPs through parliamentary questions or by the public through websites.
Will there be any diminution in the statistics and data on the health
service under the changes proposed in the Bill, or, for example, will
MPs with a question be told to go to Monitor, the national
commissioning board or their local consortium? What will be the role of
central Government in maintaining the statistics and data, which, of
course, are essential and important for MPs when pursuing health

statement. It is also in the coalition agreement. He has argued away
the changes to PCTs, but can he explain what has changed over the past
few weeks on there being no top-down reorganisations? The promise was,
of course, made at a time when the NHS was improving. It had its
highest public satisfaction rating and lowest work load and waiting
times, and there was massive improvement in coronary heart disease and
cancer care. Our amendments would place democratic accountability for
the health service back with the Secretary of State, which, as I have
said, I do not think the Minister has properly

			Column number: 227<a class="bkMark" name="Column227">&#160;</a>
                           </div>been nothing in this House on such a scale in the
past 27 years. It comes from a Government who said in
opposition that there would be no more top-down reorganisations of the
national health service, and the Minister must accept that. In my role
on the Health Committee in the previous Parliament, I shared platforms
with the current Secretary of State when he said things such as
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000153">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Although
I accept and agree with some of the Bill’s intentions, the
history of NHS reorganisation shows that it is not the answer to
improving the national health service. It has not been the answer in
the reorganisations that I have been involved with since becoming a
Member of Parliament, and its history from the 1950s shows us that it
is not the way to do it. Reorganisation has not stopped postcode
prescribing; even the creation of the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence by the previous Government, to increase the rigour
and discipline of the health service, did not stop postcode
prescribing; and reorganisation certainly has not been able to improve
best practice in our national health
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000154">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Reorganisation
does not change the culture. The lessons from the past show
that it costs money and affects performance negatively in the short
term. I am afraid that we are going to go through this while having to
save the massive amounts of money that have been laid down for the
NHS’s efficiency budgets. I will vote against
clause stand part, because the measure is wrong. I
do not disagree with the intention of it, but I think it
is wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000155">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In view of
what you said earlier in this sitting, Mr Hancock, I will
talk at later stages of our deliberations about the different
commissioning bodies. We heard in the oral evidence session last week
not only from the vested interests, but from people at the top such
as Sir David Nicholson, for whom I have great respect, that
people are confused, to say the least, about where the change in
commissioning will take us. I genuinely believe that we should not have
it, and I will go into some detail in our discussion of future clauses
about the implications for my constituents and for people who work in
the health service. I genuinely believe that this is a wrong step. It
is based on what might happen. There have been many instances in which
people have talked about national health service reorganisation and had
very little to show for it five or 10 years down the road.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000156">&#160;</a>

the Minister wants me to get my Front Benchers to read out any of his
speeches or the speeches of his right hon. and hon. Friends, I will be
more than happy to lobby them. Let us listen to what he has to say
about this reorganisation, not what ex-Ministers or ex-Members of
Parliament have said. The real world is here and now. In my experience,
it is out there. I keep in constant contact with wide areas of the
national health service, and they fear what is going to happen.
My difficulty with clause 1 is that no one knows what the
outcome will be. We are moving into uncertain times, and it is the last
thing that the national health service
wants.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000157">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In the debate
on the previous amendment, the intent behind both the amendment and the
legislation eluded me. The hon. Member for Halton seemed to suggest
that the Secretary of State should have powers over not just NHS
providers but providers to the NHS—powers over the suppliers of
bedpans or whatever. The position of the Government was not as clear as
one would wish it to be, either. Not accepting that amendment does not
leave the Government free of a series of responsibilities and duties
apropos NHS providers. The residual power is over estates, assets,
functions and so on, and it is dictated by previous legislation. To say
that we are liberating the NHS is a nice slogan, although the word
“liberating” has an unfortunate
history—Sudetenland and East Germany and other such places were
liberated at one stage in their history.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000159">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What would
really help is a degree of precision. If the Minister wrote to the
Committee, spelling out precisely what his responsibilities are to NHS
providers, as opposed to other sorts of providers who are outside the
NHS, and what will remain after this the Bill is passed. The analogy of
the foundation trust is helpful to an extent, but we have to bear in
mind the expectation that PCTs will unravel as a series of social
enterprises, which presumably differ in marked respects from hospital
foundation trusts. Some organisations that should be foundation trusts
will not be ready for such a status by the time the Bill completes its
passage. Some organisations, such as special hospitals, have been
examined and been found to be ill-qualified or inappropriate to be
turned into foundation trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000160">&#160;</a>

will harbour a series of powers and responsibilities apropos NHS
provider organisations. It would be very helpful if the Committee could
have a note after this sitting spelling out what those powers are. None
of us have a compendious and detailed knowledge of where existing

                           </strong> The Minister stated very clearly that clause 1 and
the debate about it go right to the heart, or the nub as he put it, of
the ethos that the Government are trying to bring to bear in respect of
the changes. I suggest that ethos is the word that we have been using
today and not, as the Minister has suggested, evidence. There is a
clear difference between an ethos and the evidence. We have heard lots
about the ethos and very little about the evidence to support the
conclusion that the changes he is seeking to introduce will effect the
outcomes that he is looking for.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000162">&#160;</a>

are about. It has been suggested several times today that we have not
really got it over here. We understand entirely what it is about; we
have heard the word “liberty” said repeatedly. The sweet
bell of liberty has been ringing out all day. We get what that means.
It is there in clause 1. It is about setting bits of the NHS free,
starting with the Secretary of State. We start the ball rolling with
the Secretary of State being effectively set free from his traditional
duty to secure and provide services in the NHS—to treat people
freely at the point of need—and instead we have this
mealy-mouthed, weaselly phrase that he will act with a view to securing
or providing. That is being presented today as a very minor change that
we should not be concerned about: it is simply a reflection of the

                           </div>reconfiguration that is envisaged, whereby the national commissioning
board will be the bit of the NHS responsible for commissioning, the
trusts will be responsible for providing services, and the consortia
will be responsible for local commissioning. Therefore we do not need
to worry about the Secretary of State because he will still be
responsible and accountable through questions, and of course he will be
providing this so-called mandate, which will not be political
interference but instead will be an annual—an annual I do not
know what exactly, because it is not clear in the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000163">&#160;</a>

point we have been trying to make throughout the day is that there is a
very big difference between the NCB or the GP commissioning consortia

the Secretary of State merely having responsibility to act
with a view to securing them. I do not understand

consider seriously as it is not a frivolous point—what if the
Secretary of State fails in this attempt to act to secure? What if the
local bit of the NHS whose effective provision of health services he is
trying to act with a view to securing cannot deliver in respect of
either a particular service or a geographical area? Who is responsible

continuous coverage. He said that they have yet to determine who was
going to do that, or how, because they have not written the guidelines

Gentleman may laugh but it is absolutely relevant, because we are being
asked to take it on trust that the NCB and the GP commissioning
consortia—and other aspects of this new
configuration—will do their job correctly, and will secure and
provide appropriate levels of services within new geographies. These
will not be coterminous with traditional NHS formulae and, with
respect, these are very complicated
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000169">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
adjunct to the point about us not knowing precisely how those services
will be designated is that we also had the chief executive-designate of
the NCB telling us that they have a lot of work to do in respect of all
other aspects of their work. He told us that directly. On our side of
the House at least, there is very grave concern that we are stepping
off the cliff into this uncharted area of reconfiguration with very
little idea among the key people involved—Ministers, the chief
executive, Monitor—about precisely how this will work. It begs
the question of how hastily this has been rushed through.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000170">&#160;</a>

of autonomy that we addressed right at the beginning is critical. As
the Minister said, it sets the tone for the whole philosophical
direction we are taking with the Bill. It is about, as we have heard,
liberty—the Secretary of State is free not to be directly
responsible for what he has traditionally been responsible for since
1948. We assume the National Commissioning Board will be free once it
has its annual mandate to determine what the designated services
are—we do not know what they will be or the role of the
Secretary of State in eliciting from them the right sort of designation
of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000171">&#160;</a>

to me. A genuine market working in the NHS. The Minister also took us
down an interesting by-way, about how we got to this point. He started
to tell us how it was that in response to a question from my hon.
Friend the Member for Halton we moved from the original
position of the Government—to retain PCTs and simply inject them
with more democratic accountability—to this position, where we
do not have PCTs and, the surprising bit, where we do not have any
further democratic accountability. A particular piece of the
jigsaw—democratic accountability for the people commissioning
services in the NHS—seemed earlier to be absolutely key. They
were PCTs under the old order and there will be GP consortia, NHS
trusts or the commissioning board under the new. There is now no
democratic accountability for those, so how that piece of the jigsaw
got lost in the wash-up between the two parties is very much lost to
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000176">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
know ultimately what we are about here—creating a free market in
the NHS. That is what this is about. A lot of the stuff about liberty
is a blind because what we have is a fetishistic attachment to price
competition and free markets, weaving their magic, as ostensibly they
do in other aspects of life, where competition is meant to drive up
performance and increase outcomes and productivity. We are now meant to
believe that it is going to weave that magic in the NHS. In the
Opposition, where we have looked at the evidence and are prepared to
talk about it, we are concerned that the evidence shows that when rival
providers in health care compete one with the other, one ends up
providing bargain basement prices in a way that we have not had
hitherto. That may be called evolution, but when we were in

intention to look at it. Equally, in terms of the selective quoting we
have heard quite often, one sees further on in that outcomes framework
a suggestion that this would be a big step that would need to be
considered very carefully. We did not do it. This Government are doing
it; they are introducing a maximum tariff. We have seen and heard clear
evidence and concerns from the London School of Economics, expert
clinicians and economists, and the chair of the Foundation Trust
Network, Sue Slipman. All those people know that the evidence shows
that that drives down quality in health care in the US and in Europe,
as it would if we were to introduce it in this country. We will end up
with bargain-basement health care at bargain-basement prices.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000177">&#160;</a>

because increasingly, out there, the view is widely held that
competition undermines quality. That point returns to the critical
issue of autonomy, which is another area in which we are unclear about
the intended or unintended consequences of such significant changes.
That is why we think that the Secretary of State should remain not
autonomous, or free from such duties, but hard-wired into the NHS and
into this place as the ultimate arbiter of decisions taken in the NHS.
Without that, we would see a big change.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000182">&#160;</a>

liberty and unleashing this great torrent of innovation and cleverness

                           </strong> Fine. Whether it is £1.3 billion or
£1.7 billion, why should we believe those figures?
They come from a pretty dodgy dossier, which is the economic impact
assessment. As well as the chief executive, the chief economist at the
Minister’s economic regulator, Monitor, have dismissed many of
the economic conclusions within the dossier’s covers. Notably,
that includes the important stuff about the analysis the Department of
Health has done in respect of market distortions. If the
Minister’s economic regulator and chief economist do not believe
the figures included within the economic dossier, should we really
believe the figures in respect of commissioning? I challenge it,
because many other experts in the field have done so and they are not
at all sanguine about the volume of savings that the Minister has
suggested might be realised. Perhaps he is right, and there will be
such savings, but I do not think that that is absolutely
certain.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000187">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Evidence of
successive reorganisations of the NHS shows precisely the opposite.
They cost money time and time again. I cannot think of one
reorganisation that did not, and I am sure that other
Members who have been here for far longer than I have and who have seen
far more reorganisations than me cannot list a single major NHS
reorganisation that has saved money. The bill for the NHS has gone up
and up, and necessarily, we have had to fund it. Obviously, that lesson
should be learnt.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000188">&#160;</a>

turn to Labour’s record, because we have heard a lot about the
extent to which the plans are ostensibly an evolution of our proposals.
There is some truth there, and we cannot resile from that. We held the
door open for the vandals who are now marching through, when we should
have been wary and thought through the longer-term consequences of
exposing even part of the NHS to market competition and about there
being a greater volume of autonomy for the NHS trusts. We did not think
through the extent to which our words would be turned, or the extent to
which we would see the wholesale de facto privatisation that, in time,
I think will come down the
track.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000189">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No, I was going to talk about foundation trusts.
Crucially, they were set within a far more managed framework. The point
that was made earlier, with respect to Alan Milburn, was absolutely
accurate. When we had a framework in which there were SHAs, PCTs, and
foundation trusts, all sorts of controls were placed on them. As an
example of something that the Bill will dump, I will use one provision
that was indicative of the different approach we took. In the
National Health Service Act 2006, on prudential borrowing, there are
conditions about the way in which trusts can borrow money, if they need
to borrow more money, or if, indeed they are in financial difficulties.
Equally, there are conditions under which the Secretary of State can
“give financial assistance”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How are those
aspects dealt with in this Bill? Most provisions about financial
borrowing are stripped out, because we are about to liberate the trusts
to go out and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 233<a class="bkMark" name="Column233">&#160;</a>
                           </div>borrow money on the markets at the best rates that they can, because we
think that that will allow them to be autonomous and to
succeed—or potentially, to fail. We have seen, in the current
climate, how local authorities have caught a cold when allowed to go
out there and borrow or invest on the free market. How we could be
contemplating allowing the NHS, with £110 billion, to play the
casino with public money is beyond me.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The other
aspect is that whereas hitherto the Secretary of State’s job was
to give financial assistance and, if necessary, to bail out a failing
hospital, under the Bill he is reduced to being a lender. He is reduced
to being a bank of last resort, lending at what I presume are
commercial rates or better. If he does lend at better than commercial
rates we can expect the competition aspects of the Bill to apply to him
and the banks will take him to court for undercutting their market with
the
trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000192">&#160;</a>

important changes that advanced by the Bill is that Monitor’s
role is being completely swept aside? At present, although it does not
always do so as the hon. Member for Stafford would point out, it has
the ability to intervene to prevent a foundation trust from failing. It
can come in and change the chief executive and other members of the
board. The only people responsible for a foundation trust in future
will be the governors of the board. It will be entirely within that
hospital. There will no outside checks and balances. Does my hon.

“It’s all right. I can lend you a few bob to bail you out
for a bit.” Ultimately I do not think it would be acceptable, as
we heard in the evidence and as we touched on in some of the
conversations today, if governors of trusts were solely responsible for
determining whether they merge one with another. It would be equally
unacceptable if there is not greater control by the state in some form
over decisions that will have a direct impact on the health care being
provided for people in their local communities<em>.</em>

                           </div>evolved. Ultimately, we have reached a watershed, a watershed that the
Labour party when in office may have broached, but did not breach. We
did not step over it into a free market in health care. We did not do
that for very good reasons. There may be ways in which we can see some
degree of greater autonomy for parts of the NHS that will improve
productivity and may improve outcomes, but absolutely opening the doors
of the NHS to a voracious free market is not what we want to
see.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will conclude shortly, but I want to talk a little more about evidence.
We heard a lot from the Minister about the underpinning ethos in the
Bill, but very little about the evidence. I hope that as we move
through the Bill we will hear a lot more substantive evidence about why
we in scrutinising the legislation, and why the public in watching this
scrutiny, can have faith that we will not see the NHS—I will not
say “fail”, because I think the NHS is too full of good
people for it to be allowed to fail—but I will say
“falter”. It could falter as a result of these
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To quote Nye
Bevan again—it was cheeky, to say the least, for the Minister to
quote the great man from Tredegar—he said, when discussing
mixing money and medicine back in the 1940s and referring to the custom
of GPs selling their practices to each other, that it ill behoves a
civic and civil society for patients to be sold to the highest bidder.
I fear that that is where is we are going. I also fear that we are
going much more quickly towards my other quote from Bevan in 1948 that
I gave earlier on, where we will have an NHS that is a patchwork of
paternalism and private interest and where tins are shaken in the
streets for individual hospitals. We do not want to go down that route.
We have gone far too far already. We need to remember what the NHS is
about and what the reforms may well
destroy.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
summary of clause 1, I want to highlight one key point. We are
discussing ending decades of central control of the health service in
return for allowing us to accept that it is time to trust the
professionals on the front line, who have been working so hard. I
suggest to Opposition Members that it may be worth looking at the work
today from the other end of the telescope, because we have heard much
about problems that must be resolved by the Secretary of State and
about everything going back to them. In the past, the Secretary of
State was part of the problem, as a result of years of micro-management
that has permeated the health service. We have an opportunity, as set
out in clause 1, which sets out the framework, to move back to the
front line, with professionals in charge and a high degree of localism.
Whether that is on issues of reconfiguration or of how money is spent
to improve health outcomes in a local area, I welcome
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000201">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">From
that perspective, if we actually give the front line the opportunity,
the local democratic accountability and the ability to plan their own
health outcomes, we might see a dramatic reduction in the potential
problems that hon. Members constantly refer to as requiring the
Secretary of State to solve. It is time to have confidence in the
professionals that they can do that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000202">&#160;</a>

referred to. Let me touch on reconfiguration for a moment, because one
does not have to take my word for it, although we have experienced it
extensively in my constituency, as I know that she has in hers. The
deputy executive director at the Centre for Public Scrutiny, when
giving evidence to the Committee, was clear that the GP consortia,
which would be principally effected by reconfiguration, would have a
strong influence on the outcome, because they will be providing the
throughput of patients to the potential reconfiguration. He agreed and
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000207">&#160;</a>

warmly welcome it. Let us deal with clinical involvement. I have
trouble keeping track, but my PCT has clinical directors, vice-clinical
directors and deputy clinical directors, many of whom come from GPs,
but despite their best intentions, they have presided over a PCT that
has left us in a pretty sorry state in Enfield. More to the point, they
have presided over a massive expansion of bureaucracy, so I do not
think that tinkering with PCTs is a viable option when it comes to
genuine reform of our health service and introducing accountability
into a new model, because—this is a key point—the public
have lost trust in many PCTs. That is why I echo the words of one of my
colleagues, who suggested that Opposition Members are in the unenviable

There are skilled staff, as we pointed out earlier, and some of them
will be reappointed. I have no doubt about that, and I welcome it, both
on a personal level for the individuals concerned and because I can see
that there is a learning curve, as anyone knows, on which we can build.

“Let’s just change the PCT at the top and that will solve

                           </strong> On the health and well-being boards, I do agree.
I have a fundamental belief that GPs should be at the head of the
consortia, driving them with their knowledge. I do not want that to be
portrayed as GPs doing all the form-filling and so forth. I think we
are clear about that, but when it comes to the health and well-being
boards, I think we have it right. We have a de minimis situation at the
moment. Personally, I would welcome it if a health and well-being board
wanted to put another councillor on it, if it saw fit to do that. The
de minimis situation allows for localism, but it does not allow the
Minister to tell the boards what to do, as much as I respect him. That
is where I am coming from. After due consideration, I can say that I
believe that anything that improves local accountability has to be to
the benefit of local people. I have said that since my maiden

                        <p class="tabbed">My
earlier remarks on clause 1, although made under an inappropriate
amendment, none the less relate to an issue that is key to the scrutiny
of the Bill: the question of whether it allows the retention of the
health service as a universal and comprehensive service for the
country. It is clear that there are concerns, in spite of what the
Secretary of State said last week and Government assurances given
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000218">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">First, the
Secretary of State does not have a duty to provide a comprehensive
health service in the Bill; the duty to promote such a service and to
act with a view to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 237<a class="bkMark" name="Column237">&#160;</a>
                           </div>securing it are substituted for that. Secondly, it is not necessary to
secure a comprehensive health service to comply with the Secretary of
State’s primary duty. Thirdly, because all duties derive from
the Secretary of State, it seems that no organisation will have a duty
under the clause to provide a comprehensive health service for the
whole country. Finally, as consortia and practices will not have a
geographical responsibility, there will be no sub-national geographical
unit for making devolved duties to provide a secure and comprehensive
health service. That situation will change the present responsibility,
which is delegated to primary care trusts. Those issues are crucial to
ensure the equitable and universal provision of health services, and
are wholly inconsistent with the arrangements in the Bill. We have
heard that the Secretary of State will be held to account, but
I add a note of caution, because the provision constitutes a major
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000219">&#160;</a>

realising that we would come on to a more wide-ranging debate, for
which I apologise. I make no apology, however, for repeating some
points that have been made. The Bill is very important and I refute
some of the suggestions or implications that somehow the coalition has
inherited a health service in crisis; it is in robust health. It is
well resourced—allocation has increased from £30 billion
to, this year, £106 billion—and levels of public
satisfaction are at an all-time high. That is not to say that it cannot
be improved. I believe, as do many Labour Members, that we could find
common cause on the issues of greater clinical involvement and
improving accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000220">&#160;</a>

                        <p>when exercising his
other limited functions in relation to the NHS commissioning board, the
GP-led commissioning consortia and the local authorities. That prompts
the question: why do we have a Secretary of State at all, if all those
functions are to be handed over to other organisations?<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Secretary
of State’s remaining limited functions relate to setting an
annual mandate for the NHS commissioning board—do we refer to it
as the NCB? Where I come from, that means the National Coal Board. As
the Minister mentioned, the Secretary of State makes the standing rules
for the board and the GP consortia.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It has always
been a fundamental principle of the national health service that at its
head is an elected politician—a Secretary of State—who
acts as a custodian and ultimately takes responsibility for the
provision of high-quality and universal health care. Indeed, as we
heard in debate on earlier amendments, the Secretary of State is
currently directly responsible for providing, or securing the
provision, of all health services, as is set out in the National Health
Service Act 2006. I accept the Minister’s comment that many of
those functions are currently devolved or delegated to bodies such as
the strategic health authorities and primary care trusts, which will be
abolished under the Bill. However, that remains the duty of the
Secretary of State and, most importantly, he remains accountable to
Parliament for the provision of services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000224">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However, under
the new arrangements in the clause, the proposed new commissioning
structure and the theme running throughout the Bill means that the duty
is no longer delegated, but that direct responsibility is taken away
from the Secretary of State. Perhaps the Minister can correct me if I
have misunderstood, but my understanding is that the Secretary of State
would have the duty, as I have described, but because the Committee
voted against our amendments, the direct responsibility for securing
the provision of health services would be conferred on the NHS
commissioning board and the commissioning
consortium.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000225">&#160;</a>

is important that we consider those fundamental changes to the
responsibilities of the Secretary of State when considering the new
structure of the comprehensive health service under clause 1. I
referred earlier—indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham
East and Saddleworth asked the question directly of the Secretary of
State—to the repeal of the duty of the Secretary of State to
provide the comprehensive health service. His response was that the
1948 duty on the Secretary of State remained the same—indeed,
the Minister said earlier today that there will be no change—and
that the clause and other provisions in the Bill simply applied it to
other organisations as well. I find that difficult to accept. It is
important that my hon. Friend’s question about the duty of
Secretary of State to provide health services is addressed
specifically.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000226">&#160;</a>

fundamental to many of us, which is which services—local A and E
services, maternity care and so on—will be designated to us, has
not been answered in the Bill. That will not be the Secretary of

                           </div>in relation to the clause, than during the passage
of the Bill. As I have said, the provision is a far-reaching and
fundamental deviation from the original text and the founding
principles of the national health
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Library briefing note states, part 1 of the Bill sets out a
framework from which functions in relation to the health service are
conferred directly on organisations responsible for exercising them,
with the intention that the Secretary of State retains only those
controls necessary to discharge core functions. It would perhaps be
sensible to have some clarification on his job description if the Bill
is enacted, because I suspect that he will have quite a lot of leisure
time. It is perhaps most worrying for us as Members of Parliament and
indeed for our constituents that, although the Secretary of State is
said to be accountable to Parliament, under the new arrangements he
will be accountable only for health service expenditure. There will be
no oversight or intervention on behalf of the Secretary of State, and
therefore it seems to me—the Minister may be able to address
this point—that there is little for which he can be held
accountable.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000234">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The reforms
will be seen by the public as the removal of the
“national” from the national health service. Government
Members should think about what they would say to their constituents
when problems arise. We have already discussed issues around hospital
and unit closures and reconfigurations. I am not convinced by the
argument that the situation will be better for Ministers not having
some direct access and influence in relation to reconfigurations.
Indeed, as I am aware from past experience, although the strategic
health authorities are much maligned, reconfigurations and mergers most
often come about because of clinical imperative. Rarely does some
wicked administrator think that it would be a wizard wheeze to close a
hospital or bring about a merger. Invariably, the justification is
based on advice from clinicians about the safety of the service,
ensuring quality outputs and so on. If we lose the SHAs, as is proposed
in the Bill, that would be another lever that could no longer be
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000235">&#160;</a>

scrutiny that we are engaged in. It would be completely disingenuous
for MPs, when constituents raise such concerns, to do anything other
than explain to them what the new arrangements will be. As was said
earlier, in many respects, the marketisation of the NHS will mean that
the services will be run on a commercial basis, more like a mobile
phone provider or one of the big six gas providers. As I said, the new
NHS will be independent and market-orientated, and we as politicians

enables and facilitates the greatest degree of local autonomy for

                        <p>What
purpose could the proposal set out by the hon. Member for Southport not
fulfil? Savings could be achieved, because of a 30% reduction in
management. Clinical involvement in commissioning, democratic
accountability and less risk—because the structure is not
fundamentally changed—could be achieved. In my view, many of the
objectives could be achieved without such a radical and potentially
destabilising restructuring of the service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000255">&#160;</a>

cannot quantify the impact that many of the measures will have on
patient care and the nature of the NHS. As other hon. Members
who have worked in the NHS and the public services have said, and as I
know from having worked for 12 years in the health service, having
served on an NHS trust board for a number of years and served for many
years as an elected member in local government, it is evident that
major structural change disables the organisation, at
least in the short term. We should be aware of
that. Inevitably, the cost estimates of such
reorganisations

                           </div>are underestimates, so scrutiny is needed. Chris
Ham, the chief executive of the King’s Fund, which is often
quoted by the Minister, described the reforms as without
doubt<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000256">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have touched earlier on the costs involved in the abolition of the PCTs
and the SHAs. In answer to a parliamentary question, the Minister
indicated that those costs would be £852 million, and that
figure rises to more than £1 billion when redundancies from
arm’s-length bodies are included. A response today indicated
that when we take into account the cancellation costs of contracts from
PCTs, the figure is in excess of £1 billion. As I
remember, it was £1.4 billion, but I stand to be corrected if
that is not the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000257">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The structure
that is set out in clause 1, which moves away from PCTs towards
privately led commissioning consortia—GP practices are
essentially independent of the NHS—goes far beyond the need for
clinical involvement. The BMA has outlined its concerns, and although
it welcomed further clinical involvement in commissioning, which the
Bill contains, in its view the positive aspects of the Bill are
threatened by other unnecessary aspects of the reform, particularly the
significant move towards private sector competition and competition on
price, which this new structure facilitates. The BMA is not alone in
saying that major amendments are needed to the Bill in order to prevent
destabilisation or potentially a catastrophe in the NHS. As emerged in
the course of the debate, the BMA and others are calling for a

                        <p class="tabbed">In
support of the structures set out in the clause, the Secretary of State
pointed in his evidence to examples in west Cumbria. However, the
consortium there has racked up £11 million in debt. The
Government say that consortium debt accrued when commissioning
consortia take control in 2013 will be the GPs’ liability. That
prompts the question of how stable the new NHS structures will be under
the new arrangements. The information that I have is that the strategic
health authority bailed out that particular consortium to the tune of
£2 million this year. Of course, the strategic health
authorities will not be in place under the new
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000268">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
was going to talk a little about the public health functions, but they
have been well exercised, so I will skip that in view of the time. Make
no mistake, the Bill is the biggest shake-up of the NHS since it was
founded. As direct responsibility for the provision of health services
are handed to the NHS commissioning board and GP commissioning
consortia, the role of the Secretary of State will be demoted simply to
setting the
budget.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new structure set out in the clause not only weakens the position of
the Secretary of State to manage the NHS, but reduces the power of
Members of Parliament to challenge how our NHS is run. The Minister
finished his speech on Second Reading, and his earlier remarks, by
saying that he was remaining true to the founding principles of Aneurin
Bevan. I will end with a quote from Bevan’s book “In
Place of Fear.” He
wrote:<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000273">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will try to be brief. I hope that I rise on a
consensual note, because both sides, this afternoon and this evening,
have talked about their wish for greater accountability in the NHS. I
am particularly pleased that there is cross-party consensus, given the
Tony Blair quotation that the Minister read out earlier, which talked
about the need for local accountability. I am delighted that we have
support on that issue from a very senior member of the Labour party,
who was Prime Minister for 10 years.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have had a
wide-ranging discussion that has not always been pertinent to the
clause, but I want to consider accountability briefly. The question we
have to ask ourselves as a Committee is whether there is a lack of
accountability in the NHS as it stands at the moment. The answer is
yes. Where is that accountability? Through the Bill, we are saying that
accountability, and the current lack of accountability, are
at the local level. Introducing health and well-being boards with
democratically elected representatives from councils and tying in the
role of councils with clinical leadership from GPs will be a good
thing. It will bring much more scrutiny to bear at local
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
can see that in different areas there are sometimes different health
care priorities. For example, in parts of the country where there is an
ageing population, there may be a need to address such local
priorities. Having that accountability and scrutiny at a much more
local level is going to be a very good way of dealing with that.
Similarly, there may be areas where there are greater health care
inequalities such as higher rates of heart and vascular disease among
Asian communities. The Bill will allow local health and well-being
boards to scrutinise how local health care policies are being applied
locally. That can only be a good thing. The Opposition have failed to
give the Government credit for that very genuine and good thing that
the Bill will bring
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000276">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I shall not keep
the Committee long, but it is important to put on record my objection
to the Bill in relation to the amendments to clause 1. Without doubt,
this is the biggest reorganisation of the health service that anyone
has ever seen. That is the evidence that health care professionals
offer when asked about the Bill. It is important to contrast that with
what was said before and during the general election by the Prime
Minister and to consider the words of the coalition agreement that
brought the two parties together in this loving relationship.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000277">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Before the

                        <p>Just
weeks after making that promise, the coalition published its plans for
the biggest reorganisation of the NHS in its history, as many Labour

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 1
removes the current duty on the Secretary of State to provide or secure
the provision of services for the NHS. Currently, the Secretary of
State is directly responsible for providing or securing the provision
of all health services, a function which is largely delegated to
strategic health authorities and primary care trusts. The clause will
fundamentally change the NHS. That raises serious questions about
accountability, and many points have been made on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The NHS is a
huge organisation that needs managing and it must have clear
accountability at the top of government. That, I understand, is the
evidence of many health service professionals. It is vital that those
that control the NHS are accountable to the people through Parliament.
A situation where the Secretary of State is not fully accountable would
undermine the founding principles of the NHS. The Bill will see
152 primary care trusts scrapped, along with 10 strategic
health authorities. The changes are predicted to lead to 24,500 job
losses, costing many hundreds of thousands of pounds at a time when it
is least expected by a Government who are savagely cutting essential
services in the name of deficit
reduction.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000282">&#160;</a>

the Government’s plans, GPs will be handed the bulk of the

absolutely revolutionary. It is certainly not evolutionary, as alleged
by the Secretary of State. It is an example of the Government going too
far too fast. Despite criticism from everywhere—from health-care
professionals, patients and the Select Committee on
Health—Ministers are determined to privatise the NHS, and are

1 retains the overarching responsibility of the Secretary of State to
promote the comprehensive health service, a key duty dating from the
original 1948 NHS Act, which I am fortunate enough to say was long
before I was born. We are committed to a national health service, free
at the point of use and based on clinical need and not ability to pay.
The Health and Social Care Bill reinforces that commitment. I just hope
that there is a little openness in the attitude of Opposition Members,
and that they will accept it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000296">&#160;</a>

amendments, we went into great detail explaining accountability. In
fact, in many ways, the Bill makes the NHS in different areas and
factors far more transparent that it is now, and the accountability to
Parliament far greater than it is now. I will repeat that, in the hope
that, as Opposition Members read our proceedings, it finally sinks in
that the Bill is full of increased
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000297">&#160;</a>

will be updated with consultations. To me, that is great accountability

the first time to the best of my knowledge and certainly in recent

account for the Secretary of State. Opposition Members have also spoken
about the local accountability of Members of Parliament. I was
fascinated by the points made by the hon. Members for Halton and for
Easington about reconfigurations. I will get on to that in a minute. I

that, and it will also be holding the NHS and the Secretary of State to
account through parliamentary procedures. Similarly, I have no doubt
that MPs will continue to write to Ministers on general policy or

immense powers at the moment. We inherited due processes from the
previous Government, except that this Secretary of State in May of last
year strengthened the criteria for the consultation processes to be
conducted so that local people had more engagement. They had have their
views taken more into account, because there was a view prior to that
that too often consultations were just

from the Bill—the Minister will correct me if my understanding

competition. It is Monitor that will make a decision in certain
circumstances—that is what the Bill says. In that case, what I

                        <p class="tabbed">The
decision to change the responsibility from being directly responsible
for providing or securing the provision of all health services as set
out in the 2006 Act is very important. What is happening, and it is
clear from what we have heard today, is that powers are passing from an
accountable, elected Secretary of State to something we could even call
quangos—the commissioning boards, Monitor and, to some extent,
consortia. They will have the powers over provision of services, which
the Secretary of State had before. That is a massive change in
accountability. This is £18 billion of public money being
managed in a completely different way by someone who is unaccountable
and by institutions that are not
democratic.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have a loss of democratic accountability and powers to Parliament,
which we cannot ignore, and it is a very important part of what is
happening with the Bill. We have not had answers on those points, which
raises concerns. If Government Members think that they will get comfort
from consultation changes and other changes at local level somehow
stopping the reconfiguration or removal of services, they need to think
again. We will cover that at greater length later in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000327">&#160;</a>

that the Committee wanted to make progress today, and because

                        <p class="tabbed">The crucial
point, which I have been making throughout, is about the Bill’s
complexity, and about what the powers in it mean to the health service
and, on the ground, to patients. Of course, we will return to those
points as we go through the Bill’s various clauses and some in
particular will be subject to significant focus by Opposition
Members.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000332">&#160;</a>

several speeches on this clause stand part debate. There was an
excellent speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd, and the
hon. Member for Enfield North gave an interesting and well-thought-out
speech. We will return to the sort of comfort he seems to feel from the
changes that the Bill proposes, in terms of reconfiguration and other

some point in the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11021626000334">&#160;</a>
