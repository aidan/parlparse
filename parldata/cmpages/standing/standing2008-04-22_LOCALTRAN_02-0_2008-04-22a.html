pleasure to be serving under your

					<a name="08042315000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier,
I was in full flow explaining the difference between the general
directions that the Secretary of State currently issues to the senior
traffic commissioner and their replacement, the guidance that the
Secretary of State will issue in future. Following that, the senior
traffic commissioner will be able to issue guidance and general
directions to other traffic commissioners. It is all perfectly clear.
The idea is to increase the independence of the traffic commissioners
as a whole, but also for the senior traffic commissioner to have
greater powers to introduce consistency among other traffic
commissioners, while at every step of the way not interfering with
individual decisions, which will continue to be made on a
quasi-judicial
basis.</div>

						<a name="08042315000351"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Greg Knight</b> (East Yorkshire) (Con): In
essence, my point boils down to whether the Minister can tell the
Committee where in the Bill it states that guidance issued by the
Secretary of State cannot amount to an instruction in a specific case.
If it is in the Bill, my argument falls and I will have nothing more to
say about the matter. However, if it is not in the Bill, my point
arises because the Minister&#146;s amendment No. 1 gives the
Secretary of State the power to issue guidance and directs that the
senior traffic commissioner must 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>have regard to that guidance. It seems entirely reasonable that at the
same time we should have a statement that the guidance will be only on
the issue she mentioned and not in respect of a specific
case.</div>
					<a name="08042315000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000352"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As I understand it, we have
not said that specifically in the Bill. Clearly, general principles
would be in the guidance. The Secretary of State could not direct a
particular case and say that a commissioner ought to find in a
particular way. The guidance is not legally binding&#151;it is
guidance.</div>
					<a name="08042315000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The type of
issue that might be covered could be that bus punctuality should
improve. The guidance would look to the traffic commissioners to do
that. General guidance to traffic commissioners might be to look at how
they can work to improve bus punctuality, but a traffic commissioner
would not be breaking the law if he or she did not succeed in improving
bus punctuality, because that would obviously be unreasonable. I assure
the Committee that the guidance will be about general principles. From
the senior traffic commissioner onwards to the other traffic
commissioner it would be about how to achieve; for example there could
be details about how other traffic commissioners might achieve bus
punctuality. The guidance is only about the exercise of the senior
traffic commissioner functions, not individual traffic
commissioners.</div>
					<a name="08042315000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08042315000353"></a>
							<b class="B">Norman
Baker</b> (Lewes) (LD): While we are on the subject, may I
explore the meaning of the well-used phrase in legislation,
&#147;with regard&#148;? Does it mean that the senior traffic
commissioner is simply obliged to read the guidance from the Government
and cogitate on it, or that they are obliged to attempt to implement
those
guidelines?</div>
					<a name="08042315000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000354"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The traffic commissioner should have regard to
the guidance, which means that they should take it into account in the
exercise of their duties. What it does not mean, as I have said, is
that they would be breaking the law if they did not manage to improve
bus punctuality. It comes back to the issue of how to do things such as
monitoring performance. The guidance would need to be about the
principles relating to how the senior traffic commissioner carries out
his functions.</div>
					<a name="08042315000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000355"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> But if the Minister says to the senior traffic
commissioner: &#147;We want you to improve bus
punctuality&#148;&#151;to take her example&#151;is the senior
traffic commissioner obliged to try to improve bus punctuality or are
they free to conclude that there are other issues of more importance
that ought to take
priority?</div>
					<a name="08042315000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000356"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Like any guidance in such circumstances, if
there were good reasons for divergence from the letter of the guidance
in a particular case, the senior traffic commissioner may be able to do
so. The idea of guidance is to guide, not to force in unreasonable
circumstances. That is why we have tried to make a distinction from the
previous situation where there were general directions that could have
been more specific. What we want to achieve in the Bill, to assist with
the issues of independence, is for the Secretary of State to be able to
set parameters 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>for how the senior traffic commissioner should operate, but not to
direct them. The senior traffic commissioner would then have greater
powers to achieve a consistent approach and to be able to direct the
work of other traffic commissioners, which at present can be done only
by consent and
agreement.</div>
					<a name="08042315000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08042315000357"></a>
							<b class="B">Stephen
Hammond</b> (Wimbledon) (Con): I want to
tease a little bit more from the Minister. We have talked about the
Secretary of State issuing guidance about improving bus punctuality,
which is general guidance. My right hon. Friend the Member for East
Yorkshire might ask whether the intention is that the Secretary of
State can say to the senior traffic commissioner: &#147;You must
improve bus punctuality in Manchester, Southampton and other
places&#148;. Is there to be instruction about a specific point? That
is the concern.</div>
					<a name="08042315000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000358"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I thought the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concern was that if the traffic commissioner was
sitting on a case involving a disciplinary matter, the Secretary of
State would somehow direct the traffic commissioner on how to find in
the case. That is the point that the right hon. Gentleman made and I
confirmed that it was not the case because in those circumstances the
traffic commissioner would be sitting in the quasi-judicial capacity
that we have talked about. The idea behind issuing guidance to the
senior traffic commissioner is that it would generally be what the
Secretary of State would like to see the traffic commissioners do in
carrying out their duties. I used the example of bus punctuality
because I think it is appropriate to the Bill, given the discussions
that we will be having on the operation of bus companies. It is not
about how to find in individual cases when we are talking about a
quasi-judicial function.</div>
					<a name="08042315000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 27 would remove
the power that the Bill would give the Secretary of State to issue
guidance to the senior traffic commissioner about the exercise of his
or her functions. Because the whole point of the Bill is to give the
Secretary of State power to issue guidance, rather than the general
directions that exist at present, I am afraid that we wish the
Committee to reject the amendment. The point of the changes is
to enable the issuing of guidance and as the proposal remove that
provision it rather undermines the purpose of our changes.</div>

							<a name="08042315000359"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> Can the Minister give us an idea
of the sort of salary that a senior traffic commissioner will receive?
How does that compare with the current salary of a basic traffic
commissioner? I shall quite understand if she needs to consult about
that question.</div>
					<a name="08042315000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
power to give guidance and directions, on page 5, subsection (4)
states:</div>
					<a name="08042315000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
senior traffic commissioner must consult each of the following persons
before giving any guidance or directions under subsection
(1).&#148;</div>
					<a name="08042315000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
then lists a number of people who were referred to in our previous
debate. Can the Minister confirm that in practice it will be
&#147;consult as appropriate&#148;? For example, why would the
senior traffic commissioner want to consult Scottish Ministers about an
issue or concern 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>that relates only to England? Does the subsection mean that in practice
the senior traffic commissioner must consult all those people when it
applies to them, or must he consult them even if they have no locus
standi in the particular
problem?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000360"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As I understand it&#151;I
will correct this if it is wrong&#151;an ordinary traffic
commissioner receives a salary of approximately &#163;90,000 per
year, while a senior traffic commissioner receives &#163;100,000. On
the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about consultation, if we refer
back to the Bill, it reads &#147;subsection (1) above&#148;. I
believe that is because it is about the exercise of the traffic
commissioners&#146; functions under any enactment. The key may be in
&#147;enactment&#148;. However, I confess that I would be more than
happy to come back with further information about the meaning of
enactment. I suspect that it is not about every single decision taken,
but that in particular instances relating to an enactment, the
commissioner would have to consult with the appropriate
people.</div>

							<b class="B">Graham
Stringer</b> (Manchester, Blackley) (Lab): Although I said
that I wanted to take part in the debate on clause 4 stand
part, with your permission, Lady Winterton, I think that my comments
are more appropriate to clause 3.</div>
					<a name="08042315000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I listened to the debate
about senior traffic commissioners and traffic commissioners, their
terms and conditions and how long they are appointed for, a number of
issues and questions arose, not least whether members of the Committee
have ever met a traffic commissioner or senior traffic commissioner.
There is a sense in which this debate has taken place&#151;as in one
sense it should&#151;in a theoretical vacuum, without really
understanding the terms and conditions, what traffic commissioners have
done in the past and how they have been appointed. We must remember
that if the Bill goes through unamended, it will give traffic
commissioners considerably more powers than they have had in the
past.</div>
				
					<a name="08042315000317"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08042315000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am worried
about some of these things. My experience of traffic commissioners is
that some of them have been extremely hostile to local government and
that some of them have known more about the regulations of Her
Majesty&#146;s services than they have about traffic
regulations.</div>
					<a name="08042315000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
put that into the context of what I am about to say, because at the
heart of the Government&#146;s decisions about independence and
accountability and whether or not there should be long or short-term
contracts for senior traffic commissioners is the real tension between
independence and accountability. I think that they are contradictory,
and that the hon. Member for Lewes was getting to that point. If a
senior traffic commissioner is independent, however one tries to
surround that commissioner with regulations and contracts, he is still
independent. If, however, the strength of the regulations is such and
the period of the contracts is so short that they are very constrained
in what they are doing, they are not independent.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>
					<a name="08042315000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">My core
question for the Government is whether they really mean independent, or
whether they mean what a Conservative Minister once said to me when we
were asking for lottery money to be applied to the Commonwealth
games&#151;it could have applied to anything. She said that what was
wanted was for the Government to &#147;breathe&#148; on the lottery
funding bodies. I get the impression that these rules and
regulations and short-term contracts are about
&#147;breathing&#148; on the traffic commissioners. Will all these
people be independent? If so, they need long-term contracts, fixed or
otherwise, because when I have employed people and wanted to control
them&#151;apart from their expertise&#151;I have had them on a very
short leash and a very short contract. If one wants them to be
genuinely independent and come to independent views, they should either
be given long fixed-term contracts, or be made permanent. I would like
an answer to that
question.</div>
					<a name="08042315000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
my experience of traffic commissioners and their expertise in other
areas&#151; not necessarily the problems of transport in
Manchester&#151;I would like to know what sort of training and
qualifications will be proposed as entrance requirements for what are
important positions. I suggest&#151;I am interested in my right hon.
Friend&#146;s reaction either now or in the future&#151;that the
senior transport commissioner should be subject to interview and
interrogation by the Transport Committee. In the Prime
Minister&#146;s proposals for constitutional change he listed a
number of posts for which people should be interviewed by Select
Committees before appointment. The new post of senior transport
commissioner is important, and if this Bill is passed as it is, that
person will have immense influence over any quality contracts scheme
and over the bus network in this country. It seems to me&#151;my
right hon. Friend the Minister may not have thought about
this&#151;that that is exactly the kind of person who should be
subject to interrogation and interview by the appropriate Select
Committee. I would be pleased to hear her response on that
point.</div>
					<a name="08042315000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
may have spoken too harshly about the influence that the Government
tend to want over independent people. I know that the Government were
badly burned by the actions of the rail regulator after the Hatfield
crash, when the rail system effectively came to a halt. The rail
regulator, who was independent, was responsible for billions of pounds,
but the Government would not necessarily have endorsed the expenditure.
The debt now carried by Network Rail is the result of that
person&#146;s actions. The Railways Act 2005 abolished that
position.</div>
					<a name="08042315000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recast my
question. I want to know whether the position of senior traffic
commissioner is proposed simply to avoid independence and to keep some
sort of control&#151;as I said earlier, either through guidelines or
short-term contracts&#151;so that we do not suffer a repetition of
that problem, although it would be at a lower level because that sort
of money is not now available. I should be grateful if my right hon.
Friend would clarify those points.</div>
					<a name="08042315000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000363"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> My hon. Friend was in
Committee this morning, and that is exactly the point that I made when
explaining why we rejected the idea of short-term contracts. Amendment
No. 152, tabled by the hon. Member for Lewes, would have introduced a
short-term contract, and my hon. Friend may even have voted on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>it, but the Government&#146;s response was that that is not the right
approach. It is important for the traffic commissioner to be able to
build up experience, particularly given the quasi-judicial role, and it
is important that he should not always need to keep an eye on what
might happen a year down the line. To ensure independence, it is
important that the commissioner does not feel that his job will be up
for renewal every three years; it should be a full-time
appointment.</div>
					<a name="08042315000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
need to bear in mind that we believe that the Secretary of State should
issue guidance rather than general directions, which is the position
now, because it will improve the independence of the traffic
commissioner. We have clarified why we want to change the
position.</div>
					<a name="08042315000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend asked about the issuing of guidance. It is important that
traffic commissioners should be independent when making quasi-judicial
decisions. It is important also that they should be accountable for the
way in which they use public money and for their overall efficiency in
carrying out their duties; and there should be accountability to
Parliament, as the Secretary of State can issue guidance on some of the
principles of operation. The traffic commissioner&#146;s work will
involve decisions about large sums of public money. In future he may
also have to make decisions about bus services. It is important to
ensure that the Secretary of State has the ability to issue guidance in
that way. I would have thought that right hon. and hon. Members would
think it rather odd if that were not the case given that the
implementation of any Government&#146;s transport policies depend on
them being able to consider what guidance they want to put
out.</div>
					<a name="08042315000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to training and experience, the main criteria is the ability to run a
tribunal and have experience or knowledge of road transport law and
practice. Those are the main qualifications for a traffic commissioner.
I am not sure that I can see the Transport Committee as some kind of
interviewing panel for the position of senior traffic commissioner. I
do not know whether that would be appropriate if we want to ensure
independence. It is a matter for the Select Committee to decide who it
invites to give evidence. During the draft Local Transport Bill, I
recall the traffic commissioners being summoned before the Transport
Committee. I know that the Committee commented on the traffic
commissioner proposals, particularly pointing out that it wanted to
ensure that there was adequate funding. Therefore, it is up to the
Transport Committee to be able to summon whoever it wants as witnesses.
I hope that that is
helpful.</div>

						</b> Of course the Select Committee can invite
anybody it wishes to attend. The point that I was making is that the
Prime Minister has suggested that Select Committees should look at
important public appointments, and that before a person takes up a
post, they should discuss with them their attitude to the job. I was
asking my right hon. Friend whether she thought that this important
position should be one of those posts in which the applicant is
automatically interviewed by the Select
Committee.</div>

						</b> If those are general criteria that are decided
on a cross-Government basis&#151;I have not seen the detail of those
proposals to know exactly who they are thinking about in those
circumstances&#151;then they should be taken into consideration. I am
sure that we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>would all like to see more detail of that proposal to assess whether
this was an appropriate appointment to bring before the

							<a name="08042315000366"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I shall be brief because we have
gone around the houses on this. The contribution of the hon. Member for
Manchester, Blackley has been extremely helpful in crystallising some
of the issues that we have been discussing. He is right to say that
they are to some degree a trade-off between independence and
accountability. He is also right to draw attention to Tom Winsor and
the history of the rail industry. If in doubt, we should come down on
the side of accountability because we are talking about public funds
and the discharge of important public functions. There is considerable
potential for an individual, with or without Government guidance, to
behave in a way that is not sympathetic to Government policy, to the
local authority in the area that they look after or to the needs of bus
passengers and others.</div>
					<a name="08042315000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
accept that we need to improve accountability procedures. She has
already given one or two hints that she might be willing to look at
matters such as annual reports and so on. Without over-egging the
pudding, it is important that we have some answers. With the best will
in the world, the Government want to see bus services improved. They
may try to adapt the Transport Act 2000 to bring about those
improvements and they will have support from many people in the country
and in this House. However, there is a danger that they could be
thwarted by the actions of individual traffic commissioners who will be
beyond control from the systems put in place by the Government. When
the Minister reflects on those matters, I hope that she will consider
whether we need further controls. I do not mean day-to-day controls on
the traffic commissioners&#151;no one is suggesting that they be
micro-managed or that their individual decisions be regulated on a
day-to-day basis&#151;but there should be regular checks to ensure
that they are doing their job properly and are in line with public
policy. I do not think that there are mechanisms for doing so. I have
suggested a fixed-term contract as one way to do it. If the Minister
does not like that, we must find a different way, but we cannot just
allow people to be appointed&#151;I agree with the point about the
Select Committee, by the way; it is a useful suggestion&#151;and then
run off to do their own thing irrespective of what the public at large
need or what local authorities or indeed Ministers want them to
do.</div>

					<a name="08042315000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologise,
Lady Winterton. When I intervened earlier, I failed to welcome you to
the Chair. I remember that you chaired the Standing Committee on the
Crossrail Bill last year. I enjoyed it immensely, and I am sure that we
will enjoy this Committee immensely under your chairmanship as
well.</div>
					<a name="08042315000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
sensible amendment that I am sure the Minister will want to accept. It
concerns deputy traffic commissioners, and in particular their
dismissal. I genuinely hope that it will not prove controversial,
because it appears to me that there is a loose end in the Bill. As
things stand, the Secretary of State has the power to appoint traffic
commissioners and to dismiss a traffic commissioner
who</div>
					<a name="08042315000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) has
misbehaved; or</div>
					<a name="08042315000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) is

commissioner to a standard which the Secretary of State considers
satisfactory&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08042315000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that anyone has a problem with that provision.</div>
					<a name="08042315000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State has the power to appoint deputy traffic commissioners, who
have a number of set functions. They carry out many if not all the
functions of regular traffic commissioners. However, as I read them,
the measures and their parent Act contain no provisions for dealing
with a deputy traffic commissioner who misbehaves or is unwilling or
unable to carry out his duties. If both traffic commissioners and
deputy traffic commissioners are appointed by the Secretary of State
and have the same functions, and if there are provisions for the
dismissal of the former, should there not also be provisions for the
dismissal of the
latter?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000368"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> I can see why my hon. Friend might want that point
in the Bill, but would not his concerns be covered by proposed new
paragraph (3)? It
states:</div>
					<a name="08042315000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Appointment
as a deputy traffic commissioner for England and Wales shall be upon
such terms and conditions, including conditions as to the time to be
devoted to the duties of the office, as the Secretary of State may
determine.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08042315000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that the Secretary of State could quite easily put into the
contract identical disciplinary and dismissal provisions to those for
full-time
commissioners.</div>
					<a name="08042315000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000369"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I dispute that. It might well be possible, but
the proposed new measures contain set conditions for the dismissal of
traffic commissioners. As the Bill states the set conditions for
appointments, it seems normal to put in an amendment such as mine. As
far as I can see, my right hon. Friend&#146;s comment refers to
conditions that may apply but would not necessarily do so, whereas my
amendment would cover the eventuality and give the Secretary of State
the power necessary to dismiss deputy traffic commissioners. I hope
that the Minister can either give me some reassurance that I missed the
point altogether or accept my
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08042315000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000370"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I would not like to imply
that the hon. Gentleman had missed the point altogether, but I hope to
give a little clarification that might assist him. The amendment, as he
said, would extend to the 17 current deputy traffic commissioners the
clearer powers under clause 4 to dismiss poorly performing traffic
commissioners. As we discussed earlier, the competence with which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>traffic commissioners exercise their statutory duties can have a
dramatic effect on individual operators. Delays in processing licensing
applications or granting variations to existing licences can mean that
new businesses cannot start, existing ones cannot expand or that
business is lost perhaps with disastrous consequences for the
livelihood of operators and their
employees.</div>
					<a name="08042315000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
as we have discussed, and which will continue under the Bill, a traffic
commissioner is appointed until retirement and can be removed from
office only by the Secretary of State on the grounds of inability or
misbehaviour. As I said earlier, the Government believe that such power
is not explicit enough. For example, it does not make clear what
inability means. It does not state whether it refers to those who do
not have the professional expertise to perform their functions in a
competent and proper fashion, whether it means someone who does not
work efficiently or someone who is just unwilling to perform their
functions to an acceptable standard. The Government believe that the
power should encompass all such situations and that all commissioners
must have the professional competence to carry out their functions and
be properly accountable for ensuring that they do so in as efficient
and effective way as possible. That is why we want clearer
powers.</div>
					<a name="08042315000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
deputy traffic commissioners work on a part-time and pro rata basis.
They are paid only for the work that they do, and they work only at the
request of the full-time traffic commissioners usually when they have
an enormous amount of work and need helping out with particular cases.
Unlike the traffic commissioners, the deputies are appointed on fixed
three-year contracts. In the case of poor performance, it is true that
the Secretary of State can decide not to renew their contract or that
another new deputy could be recruited to the area. It would be possible
simply not to use the deputy traffic commissioner if it were felt by
the traffic commissioner that they were not competent. That would not
be at a cost to the public purse because deputy traffic commissioners
are paid only when they
work.</div>
					<a name="08042315000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the other powers in the Bill, the senior traffic commissioner would
have the power, for example, to use deputies from other areas to cover
short-term needs until, if necessary, a replacement was found. We do
not consider it necessary to have within the role of the deputy traffic
commissioner the same powers and the same need to go through the
dismissal process that applies to a full-time traffic commissioner.
That would complicate matters. The position, as it rests at the moment,
provides the necessary mechanisms to take appropriate action in respect
of poorly performing deputy traffic commissioners. I hope that I have
been helpful, have clarified the position and given the hon. Member for
Wimbledon the reassurance that I expect he
seeks.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000371"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The Minister was certainly
extremely helpful. It was interesting to learn that deputy traffic
commissioners are on a fixed term of office. I certainly understand her
point that, given that it is a short three-year term of office, it
might just be easier to leave someone on the list who would otherwise
fall into the category of unwilling to perform functions to the
standard required without going through all the dismissal procedures. I
assume that that is what the Government would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>prefer, rather than taking the power to dismiss them. I assume that the
Government are saying that because people are only appointed for such a
short period, we do not have to use them. We can have them on the list
of deputy traffic commissioners, not renew their contract after three
years and not go through the disciplinary procedures that would be
associated with getting rid of them. I think that is what the Minister
is effectively saying to us. My amendment was offering the Government
powers to get rid of people who are incompetent. I understand that
exercising such powers may be too
difficult.</div>
					<a name="08042315000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
listened to the Minister and am reassured that there are means of, if
not getting rid of, at least sidelining deputy traffic commissioners
who are not performing their functions. The key is being able to
perform to the standards we are all concerned about so, with that
reassurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

							<a name="08042315000372"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> I still have concerns from our
earlier debate about the question of guidance issued by the Secretary
of State. When one looks at clause 4, a ground for dismissing a
commissioner is that that commissioner has misbehaved. Will the
Minister give an assurance to this Committee that misbehaviour will
never be deemed to have to taken place where a traffic commissioner
ignores guidance that, in effect, emanates from the Secretary of State?
Unless she is able to give that assurance, it seems to me that the
Secretary of State could, by issuing specific guidance, interfere with
the quasi-judicial functions of a traffic
commissioner.</div>
					<a name="08042315000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000373"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I understand the point the right hon. Gentleman is
making, but I would be more concerned, pursuant to his argument, about
subsection 2 (b) which allows a dismissal on the basis that the traffic
commissioner has not performed to a standard which the Secretary of
State considers satisfactory. That is more of an open goal than
misbehaviour.</div>
					<a name="08042315000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000374"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman anticipates my journey, which I
do not criticise him for. In addition to my concerns over this phrase
&#147;has misbehaved&#148;, as the hon. Member for Lewes has
rightly said, it may well be that a traffic commissioner feels his duty
to a particular area is to make, or not to make, a certain decision and
that it could be argued under this clause that he was
unwilling&#151;not unable, not unfit, but unwilling&#151;to perform
the functions of a traffic commissioner. It goes to the heart of how
independent these commissioners will be in practice in the light of the
wording of this
clause.</div>
					<a name="08042315000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000375"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> What we need to consider is
the fact that traffic commissioners are appointed and employed to carry
out a public service on behalf of Government, through Parliament.
Whatever Government were in power, if the Secretary of State wished to
issue guidance as to how, for example, a senior traffic commissioner
should operate their service, Parliament would expect that there should
be some appropriate action if somebody 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>wilfully ignored any direction or guidance that was issued through the
Secretary of State, because these powers are given in an Act. It is
important that we preserve that principle, because many people carry
out public service duties and Parliament and the Secretary of State
have a role in ensuring they are carried out in line with the will of
the Government and of Parliament through particular Acts that are
passed. That is an important principle to bear in
mind.</div>
					<a name="08042315000319"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08042315000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
emphasise the fact that the Government hold traffic commissioners in
high regard. We would only be talking about going through an entire
dismissal process in extreme circumstances, for example, if a traffic
commissioner consistently refused to comply with directions issued by
the statutory senior traffic commissioner appointed under clause 3, or
if there was clear evidence that a commissioner had acted improperly,
such as acting for personal gain. I emphasise, however, that if one is
talking about an appointment lasting until retirement, as opposed to a
fixed-term contract, all of the processes would be open to an
individual if they alleged that they were being dismissed for having
made a particular decision.</div>
					<a name="08042315000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is quite clear that the
Government do not want to use this power to erode the
commissioner&#146;s independence. We have come forward with the power
because it was felt that there was a decision to be made about going
down a line of short, fixed-term contracts. As I replied to my hon.
Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley, we did not want to do that
because we did not want to erode that independence and perhaps be faced
with somebody coming to the end of their three-year contract. How would
a person feel in those circumstances? Would their decisions be
influenced? One would hope not. My judgment was that it is better to
have a normal process of recruitment and dismissal to overcome the
feeling that people might be coming to decisions because they are
reaching the end of their contract.</div>
					<a name="08042315000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers
that we are taking will extend only to the administrative competence of
the commissioner. Their judicial competence, the decisions they make
about individual operators, will remain a matter for the existing
appeal mechanisms, the transport tribunal and the court of appeal. I
emphasise that this goes hand in hand with the belief that not having
short, fixed-term contracts is a more appropriate way to ensure traffic
commissioners&#146; independence. However, we want to reflect some of
the concerns that have been raised about the fact that it is not
possible to take action if an individual consistently refuses to comply
with directions issued from the senior traffic commissioner. We have
tried to get the balance right and we believe that we have done so, but
I reassure the right hon. Gentleman that we are not talking about
interference with quasi-judicial decisions.</div>

							<a name="08042315000377"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I want to probe the Minister with a few questions
on the clause. Clause 5(1)
states:</div>
					<a name="08042315000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
existing traffic commissioner for a traffic area in England and
Wales&#151;</div>
					<a name="08042315000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) on
the relevant commencement, becomes... a traffic commissioner for
England and
Wales&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08042315000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the explanatory notes it says that traffic commissioners already in
post will remain in post on their existing terms and conditions of
employment except that they will be subject to revised conditions of
dismissal. That is not quite right, is it? Traffic commissioners who
were previously attached to traffic areas, on commencement of becoming
traffic commissioners for England and Wales, have revised
responsibilities.</div>
					<a name="08042315000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to know what the Government have anticipated they might do in
circumstances where traffic commissioners who were carrying out the
functions once attached to those old areas but then potentially look to
become a traffic commissioner for the whole of England and Wales, with
new, upgraded responsibilities, are not competent to carry out those
responsibilities. How will the Government deal with that? I can not see
a transitional arrangement anywhere which states what will happens if a
traffic commissioner currently in post is not competent to take on the
new role. There is quite a big jump, for example, in some of the
competencies that we are demanding of traffic commissioners in their
new roles, as set out by the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08042315000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to be given some reassurance as to what happens to existing traffic
commissioners who potentially do not have the skill set and the
competency, which is desired from the new definition of a traffic
commissioner.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000378"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> I have another point, which I think I know the
answer to, although the danger is that if one thinks knows the answer
to something sometimes one does not. I will therefore ask the question
in order to clarify the matter because after all, that is what the
Minister is paid for.</div>
					<a name="08042315000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand it, apart from
the changes to the reasons for dismissal, the terms of employment are
being carried over for those currently employed. The Minister spoke at
the beginning of our deliberations today about possibly varying the
number of areas for traffic commissioners. If, in the due course of
time, she decided that one particular traffic commissioner ought to be
made redundant, would it mean for the purpose of calculating redundancy
pay, that his or her whole length of service would count? Or would it
be that because of this particular clause they would be deemed only to
have just started their work as a traffic
commissioner?</div>
					<a name="08042315000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000379"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> What we are talking in clause 5 are the
transitional provisions to go to the new system. The one that
particularly comes to mind would be the fact that the senior traffic
commissioner would remain in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>post for 12 months, until a decision is made about who a new traffic
commissioner would be and how long that term of contract would
be.</div>
					<a name="08042315000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
any redundancies that may arise, I would be almost certain that there
would be a continuous period of employment. I do not think we would be
saying that this is an entirely new position. The employment conditions
will remain the same but it is about the exercise of their powers which
they will be able to exercise throughout England and Wales, as opposed
to just in their particular area as it is at the moment.</div>
					<a name="08042315000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have indicated before, we
expect that most will continue to work in their existing areas but the
senior traffic commissioner will have the power to deploy elsewhere. In
those circumstances we do not believe that it will look radically
different and I would venture to suggest that we do not envisage that
the existing traffic commissioners are suddenly going to become
hopelessly incompetent. It is more likely that in the future there may
be a desire, because of the pooled approach, to recruit other people
with particular specialisms&#151;but that is for the future. What we
are doing in the Bill is allowing greater flexibility for the traffic
commissioners&#146; work, without in any way trying to undermine the
job that they do at the
moment.</div>

					<a name="08042315000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today,
the Minister has already given us on several occasions some insight
into how she sees the relationship between the Secretary of State and
the senior traffic commissioner and other traffic commissioners
evolving as a consequence of a number of changes in the Bill. I am
probing and exploring that theme further, because the clause, labelled
&#147;Consequential amendments&#148;, entitles the Secretary of
State to use secondary legislation to make further provisions in
existing legislation on the functions and duties of traffic
commissioners.</div>
					<a name="08042315000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that secondary legislation may well be necessary at some stage
and that the Government may wish to retain that flexibility, but I am
interested in and am looking for some reassurance from the Minister
about the wording of subsection 2(a). The power of the Secretary of
State to make consequential
amendments</div>
					<a name="08042315000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;includes...the
power to make different provision for different cases or for different
areas&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08042315000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are almost back in the realms to which my right hon. Friend the Member
for East Yorkshire was taking us. What exactly does she mean? What is
the provision for the traffic commissioner to make different provisions
for different cases? Is it that some areas are going to need more
resources, so that is the flexibility talked about? Or is it that, in
some cases, the Secretary of State might direct a traffic commissioner
in something? I fear 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>that if we are not entirely clear about the exact meaning, it may mean
that the Secretary of State has the power to intervene in certain
cases.</div>
					<a name="08042315000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am assuming that what the Government intends by &#147;different
areas&#148; is what the Minister was talking about this
morning&#151;the flexibility to move traffic commissioners around
England and Wales, or to develop particular specialisations. Again,
could the Minister clarify exactly what are the circumstances envisaged
in which the Secretary of State would need those powers? What exactly
do &#147;different cases&#148; and &#147;different areas&#148;
mean?</div>

Winterton:
						</b> Clause 6 empowers the Secretary of State to
make any necessary consequential changes to other legislation through
secondary legislation, to give full effect to the provisions in clauses
2 to 5 of the Bill. We have done that because there are a number of
references in other legislation. To choose the Transport Act 2000, for
example, there may be references to work that a traffic commissioner
can do. The legislation might, for example, say that in order to get a
particular licence or to operate in a certain way individuals should
apply to the traffic commissioner in their area. What we are trying to
do in the clause is to fit in with the idea that there might be
functions that could be done more effectively at national level, say in
an office of the traffic commissioner. If there were applications that
could be made to such an office, it would be necessary to remove the
function from the traffic commissioner in each region. For us to try to
go through every piece of existing legislation and make the changes in
the Bill would be time-consuming, and we might miss something out.
Through secondary legislation, we have the ability to make any changes
that would allow such activities to
happen.</div>

					<a name="08042315000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that there are more than 80 references to traffic areas in
primary and secondary legislation, and more than 600 references to
traffic commissioners. In order properly to implement the provisions in
clauses 2 to 5, in some cases it will be necessary to make
consequential amendments to many of those references.</div>
					<a name="08042315000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment proposed by the
hon. Member for Wimbledon, which I take to be a probing amendment,
would prevent those consequential amendments from making such changes.
The problem is that it would reduce flexibility when implementing the
proposals contained in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08042315000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may help the Committee if I
make it clear that all orders under that power would be subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure, and that any order under clause 6
will apply in Scotland only in relation to reserved, not devolved,
matters. I hope that is helpful in explaining why clause 6 is in the
Bill and why we are asking the Committee not to accept the amendment,
as it would reverse what we are trying to
do.</div>

the Minister, and I understand the need for secondary legislation to be
available so that the Government can amend previous pieces of
legislation. I understand the concept of consequential legislation and
accept that we need a catch-all early in the clause. I still struggle
to see why what the Minister wants is not dealt with by clause
6(1), and why there are different cases and areas. I probably need to
read the provision more carefully as I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>am not entirely convinced that it is absolutely necessary; such
provisions are already elsewhere in clause 6. None the less, with your

back at the relevant parts of the Transport Act 2000, I was struck by
the number of words, and the next set of amendments will explore some
of my thinking in the same way. I was struck by the word

states:</div>

tighten up the definitions of exactly what a transport policy should
be.</div>

that anyone in the Committee will disagree with the assertion that a
local authority should develop plans and policies that deliver the best
value for money&#151;that is especially pertinent at a time when many
councils find themselves strapped for cash&#151;but
&#147;economic&#148;, in classic terms, means getting the maximum
possible average utility for the amount spent and the maximum marginal
utility for any extra money spent or, in shorter dictionary terms, the
thrifty and efficient use of material resource.</div>
					<a name="08042315000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the provision to have any

and I hope that right hon. and hon. Members accept, that it is
important for local authorities&#146; transport policies to be
economic. Authorities need to take into account the costs of
implementing their transport policies. I should add that transport is
not an end in itself. Effective transport is often a key factor
underpinning successful local economies. Transport can play an
incredibly important part in getting people to and from work and
getting goods to market, for example. The economic aspect of transport
is critical, and we want local authorities to address it in their
transport planning. Local authorities have said time and time again in
my discussions with them that they see transport as a critical way of
supporting the local economy, but at the same time they want to ensure
how transport policies will be paid
for.</div>

							<a name="08042315000387"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The Minister has fallen into
the trap that I was worried about. She talks about having regard to
local economies, which is clear and vital, but that is not necessarily
the same as having an economic transport policy. To someone else that
might mean value for money, how much is being spent, and what people
get out of the policy. I have proposed a probing amendment to ensure
that local authorities are given the correct guidance about exactly
what the Government mean by economic. Does it mean that the policy has
to stand up to some value-for-money spending test or is it about
whether the policy supports the overall local economy? If the
definition is left imprecise, local authorities will have to grapple
with those important
matters.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000388"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> It is a mixture of both, and that flexibility
is important in local transport policies. When a local authority comes
up with a local transport plan, we want it to be clear about how its
plans will be paid for. Of course, those plans must be
economic&#151;it would be ridiculous for transport authorities to
come up with plans that they simply cannot pay for and are just a wish
list.</div>

						</b> Conservative authorities do
perhaps. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman believes that every day of
the week local authorities come up with unrealistic plans. I think that
they plan quite well in terms of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>policies that they introduce. However, it is also important that local
authorities consider the effect that transport will have on their local
economy. As I said earlier today on the Floor of the House, we issue
guidance to local authorities on drawing up their transport plans. We
review that information and consult with stakeholders about the
guidance we are issuing. Most reasonable people would understand what
we mean by first of all making sure that policies are economic in the
sense that they can be paid for, and they would also understand that
transport plans should aim to help to improve the local
economy.</div>

common sense actually. In legislation any word either has the meaning
specified in the relevant legislation or the ordinary, natural meaning
of the word. In this case, without a definition in legislation, the
ordinary, natural meaning of the word will be used, which is not
necessarily the same as a technical academic meaning. If we were all
being reasonable, we could understand what we mean by economic and most
people would accept that as a definition, as I have said. It means
ensuring that transport policies can be paid for and help the local
economy. The Committee should send the message that we want such a
pragmatic approach to be adopted by local authorities when they are
considering transport planning.</div>

straightaway to the Minister that I do not intend to define that phrase
in the Bill, but I am relying on its natural meaning to come across and

the fact that the Transport Act 2000 to which reference was made when
we discussed the previous amendment, required local transport
authorities to develop transport policies that are safe, integrated,

							<a name="08042315000402"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I shall happily do my best. The most significant
challenge that we face is climate change, so we must move towards a
transport system that minimises as far as possible the emission of
carbon. That is not the entire definition of sustainability. There are
other issues, such as whether to take up the countryside with new roads
and so on, but my primary objective in tabling the amendment and
amendment No. 153 is to deal with climate
change.</div>
					<a name="08042315000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention, I was saying that our
objective is to elevate the concept of the environment to the same
position of importance as the other criteria of safe, integrated,
efficient and economic. It is not appropriate merely to have the issue
placed somewhere else in the Bill. The Minister might come back to the
reference under clause 8(4)(2ZB)(b) to having regard to the
&#147;improvement of the environment&#148;. That is true, but it is
not placed in the same elevation as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>the four adjectives of safe, integrated, efficient and economic, which
it should be in these days of concern about climate
change.</div>
					<a name="08042315000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
moment ago, the Minister referred to the importance of transport
underpinning the economy. That is perfectly true. We must have a good
transport system to enable the economy to function. She will also
recognise that, when people move from A to B, there is an environmental
consequence. A footprint is generated by that movement&#151;more if
it is aviation, but less if trains are involved. When drawing up plans,
it is important that local transport authorities have such a matter at
the forefront of their thoughts to ensure that they taking it into
account when formulating their policies. It would not be a good
transport plan if it met the four conditions presently required of
safe, integrated, efficient and economic, but had total disregard for
the environment and a largely negative impact on carbon emissions, in
particular.</div>
					<a name="08042315000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will tell me that the Government are the first Government in
the world to introduce a Climate Change Bill, and many of us are very
pleased about that. The Climate Change Bill will require each section
of society that is responsible for carbon emissions to significantly
minimise those emissions by 2050. The Minister will also be aware that
the transport sector is responsible for about a third of the carbon
emissions in the country&#151;perhaps marginally less. Therefore,
what local councils do with their transport policies, with guidance
from central Government, is crucial if we are to meet the carbon
reduction targets that the Government have rightly identified to take
on the climate change challenge that we all face. The Department for
Transport will have to meet its own targets, which must be counted in
with the Government&#146;s efforts to try to cut carbon emissions. It
would be peculiar if, at the same time as recognising this huge
challenge facing society and the huge cut in carbon emissions that is
needed, we do not even mention, as one of the primary objectives in the
local transport plans, the question of environmental
sustainability.</div>
					<a name="08042315000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
153 goes even further. It recognises that we should be asking local
transport authorities to set targets for reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions from the activities in their area over which they have
influence. We are all going to have targets. We have national targets,
Government targets, and internal targets for each Department. Why
should the local transport plans not be proactive and help the
Government deliver their overall national strategic policy of carbon
cuts by having their own reduction targets? Without that specific
requirement up front, local transport plans will carry on very much as
they have done, delivering a mish-mash service with a bit of economic
development here, and helping people to get from A to B. The
traditional objective of the local transport plans will carry on.
Unless we highlight the environment in a way that has not been done
previously, I have no confidence that the local transport authorities
will respond to the climate change challenge that we all recognise
needs to be met. The Government will be in danger of having a national
target that is not being delivered locally because local transport
plans are not pursuing
it.</div>

town, for example, will have no more diesel-powered buses for the rest

measure is unenforceable because when the local transport authorities
draw up their plans, they will have consultations with a number of
bodies, as indeed they should. That will include bus operators. If my
amendments are accepted&#151;I think that the hon. Member for
Wimbledon has similar amendments&#151;they will include discussions
with the rail operators in a particular area. As part of the
discussions for fulfilling the contract, they can start specifying the
sort of buses that they wish to see. They could have influence over the
timetable and the frequency of buses. Through such measures, we can
realistically identify ways of reducing the carbon footprint in the
transport sector. I do not think that it is impossible. I agree that it
is not possible to tie it down to the last possible degree and say that
we will achieve it by 8.3 per cent. However, it is possible to
highlight environment sustainability in a way that is not presently
done and to try to hold some discussions that are not taking place now.
I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to my arguments and I look
forward to her
response.</div>

							<b class="B">Kerry
McCarthy</b> (Bristol, East) (Lab): I agree
to some extent with the sentiments that have been expressed by the hon.
Member for Lewes although I do not think that his amendments are
necessary to achieve the objectives that he espouses. I may be
pre-empting the Minister, but I think that the provisions in clause 8
outlining the new duties on local authorities with respect to the
protection or improvement of the environment will be sufficient. In my
constituency and in Bristol as a whole, there is incredibly strong
support for the sort of environmental objectives that he mentioned. I
probably get more letters on climate change than on any other topic.
Bristol aims to become the green capital of the United Kingdom&#151;a
laudable ambition.</div>
					<a name="08042315000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
particularly strong support for cycling in Bristol; apart from walking,
it is most environmentally sustainable system of transport. That is
already reflected in the local transport plans, but I hope that this
new provision will give greater impetus to it. Sustrans, which is based
in Bristol, has just won &#163;50 million from the People&#146;s
&#163;50 Million contest for developing a national network of cycle
paths.</div>
					<a name="08042315000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a slightly
more controversial note, the strength of support for cycling was
demonstrated when it was suggested recently that there might be a rapid
transport bus link alongside the Bristol to Bath cycle path. More than
10,000 people signed a petition and more than 1,000 marched in order to
demonstrate their support for that project. I am glad to see that
Bristol city council is working with Sustrans on developing schemes to
improve bus travel in the city and to improve cycling
provision&#151;although the former should not be at the expense of
the latter. When considering moving forward with the local transport
plans, that is the sort of partnership that we need.</div>
					<a name="08042315000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">While talking
about sustainable forms of transport, the Minister recently visited my
constituency and travelled on the showcase bus route, the second in the
city. I use this opportunity&#151;perhaps somewhat
audaciously&#151;to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>make a plea for her to release the further money needed for the third
showcase bus route and a bus lane on the M32. Now that that is out of
the way, I turn to the amendments.</div>
					<a name="08042315000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">As suggested by the right hon.
Member for East Yorkshire, it would be incredibly burdensome for local
authorities to have to meet specific targets. We are always being urged
to reduce the number of targets and to give local authorities the
freedom to decide how to operate and the flexibility to decide what is
best for the locality. With something like transport&#151;by
definition, it means moving in and out of local authority
boundaries&#151;I do not see how local authorities or integrated
transport authorities, which are responsible for everything that
happens within their boundaries, could be held to legally binding
targets. The Liberal Democrats support that in terms of the national
climate change targets, and I accept their good motives, but it needs
to be expressed as general guidance to local authorities rather
than something that ties them
down.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000406"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> As the hon. Member for Lewes
said, the provision places certain obligations on local authorities
under their local plans. He wants to place two more obligations on
them. The obligation of environmental sustainability seems sensible,
although I assumed that it was already there. One person&#146;s
definition of &#147;integrated&#148; and what it implies is another
person&#146;s mis-definition, which is why I thought it was probably
included. It is certainly there in clause
8.</div>
					<a name="08042315000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
would have overcome the definitional questions about which he was being
probed by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley if he had used the
words &#147;with respect to protection or improvement of the
environment&#148; as the criteria. None the less, I have spoken
several times today about the principle of including in the Bill a
clear interpretation so that mistakes cannot be made.</div>
					<a name="08042315000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would have sympathy with the
hon. Member for Lewes if he wished to press amendment No. 145 to a
Division. However, I agree with the hon. Member for Bristol, East about
amendment No. 153. First, a plethora of Government targets is already
imposed on local authorities. What she said about transport moving and
therefore being more difficult to capture in a discrete area is also
relevant. Although I have some sympathy with the aim of amendment No.
153, if the hon. Member for Lewes were to press it, I would not ask my
colleagues to support it. We may not vote against it, but we certainly
would not support it.</div>

							<a name="08042315000407"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> This has been a short but
instructive debate with lots of interesting observations. I am worried
about my speech because most of my points have been anticipated by
other members of the Committee, but it is important that we have
discussed issues relating to sustainability and the reduction
of transport emissions.</div>
					<a name="08042315000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I congratulate my hon. Friend
the Member for Bristol, East on cleverly raising the issue of the third
showcase bus route. I visited her constituency and I  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>was impressed at the enthusiasm for looking at other forms of travel,
particularly cycling. I managed to congratulate Sustrans on the work
that it has already done to promote cycling in the constituency. It is
something that my hon. Friend is very keen on and I know that she was
concerned about the other bus route and that cycling in her city should
not be undermined as a result. I am pleased to see that it looks as
though some accommodation has been reached on that.</div>
					<a name="08042315000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members have raised a
number of points about amendment No. 145. That would add an explicit
reference to environmental sustainability to the duty under section 108
of the Transport Act 2000 for transport authorities to develop and
implement policies on transport. The sustainability of present and
future transport arrangements in a local authority area is clearly one
of the most fundamental issues to be considered when drawing up
policies and plans. As was anticipated in the opening remarks, clause 8
already places a new duty on local authorities to take account of the
Government&#146;s
policies</div>
					<a name="08042315000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with respect to
the protection or improvement of the
environment,&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08042315000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also
requires those authorities to have regard to any guidance issued by the
Secretary of State in relation to that.</div>
					<a name="08042315000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such guidance, we would
expect to cover issues such as air quality, noise and climate
change&#151;matters that local authorities would need to address when
devising and implementing their transport policies and local transport
plans. That is further supplemented by the Government guidance issued
in September last year as part of the Climate Change and Sustainable
Energy Act 2006. In exercising any of its functions, every local
authority must have regard to that report, which includes guidance on
transport among a full range of other advice. In that light, I would
expect the environment and sustainability to be at the forefront of a
local authority&#146;s mind, both in developing and implementing its
transport policies, and in producing local transport plans. We expect
any guidance that we issue to address questions of sustainability and
the environment in relation to transport in local areas. I understand
the points raised by the hon. Member for Lewes&#151;he obviously
takes the issue extremely seriously, as do we all&#151;but I do not
think that there are any obvious gaps to fill in the existing duties
for local authorities as amended by the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08042315000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000408"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> There is indeed guidance&#151;I referred to it in
my opening remarks&#151;but the Minister has not yet given me an
explanation why, in respect of the four key words &#147;safe,
integrated, efficient and economic&#148;, which are elevated above
all others in the Transport Act 2000, there is no reference to the
environment. That is what concerns me. The environment is effectively
second-tier compared with those four
criteria.</div>
					<a name="08042315000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000409"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I have tried to explain the various other
duties, particularly those relating to the Climate Change and
Sustainable Energy Act 2006, in clause 8. We feel that there is
adequate guidance and instruction to local authorities to consider the
effect of any plans on the environment. Amendment No. 153 would create
a new duty on local authorities developing and  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>carrying out transport policies to reduce the total level of greenhouse
gas emissions from local transport in their area, taking Government
targets as the minimum standard to be achieved.</div>
					<a name="08042315000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course the Government seek
to reduce emissions across the economy and not just within transport.
The Stern report highlighted the need for flexibility to take action
where it costs least in order to ensure that the cost of mitigation is
manageable. The Climate Change Bill, which recently came to the House
from the other place, will provide binding legislation for this country
to meet its climate change obligations. It will also set a long-term
framework for cutting total UK domestic CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions by 26
to 32 per cent. by 2020 and by at least 60 per cent. by 2050.</div>
					<a name="08042315000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The transport sector will have
to make a deliverable, measurable and cost-effective contribution to
those targets. In October 2007, the Government published a new
framework document, &#147;Towards a Sustainable Transport
System&#148;, with the aim of delivering a transport system that both
supports the economy and reduces carbon emissions. We are discussing
our climate change challenges with stakeholders and will publish our
thoughts in a Green Paper later this year for more formal consultation.
We will also identify potential emissions reduction pathways for
transport, considering the full range of options for putting transport
on a less carbon-intensive path and including different types of
journeys and transport
modes.</div>
					<a name="08042315000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
understand entirely what the amendment is meant to achieve, introducing
such a duty on local authorities on a local level relating to transport
alone could prove counter-productive by reducing their flexibility to
contribute to the achievement of national targets&#151;a point that
was made earlier&#151;and preventing them from achieving the best
value reductions for their resources. I believe that the
Government&#146;s proposed approach offers a better way forward, and
I hope that, given that reassurance and the other commitments, the hon.
Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
				
					<a name="08042315000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000410"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> The suggestion that flexibility should be applied
is, on the face of it, entirely reasonable, but flexibility in this
matter all too often makes some people think that they have a licence
to carry on as normal and that others should make cuts to achieve the
Government&#146;s targets. Some will interpret flexibility as an
excuse to do nothing. Although industry has made significant cuts in
carbon emissions and they are even now being made in the home sector,
transport emissions continue to rise. I am sorry to say that the
Government&#146;s policies, particularly on aviation, suggest that
those emissions will rise significantly more, rather than being cut. I
am not convinced by the Minister&#146;s argument that flexibility
will necessarily deliver the overall cuts that she implied.</div>
					<a name="08042315000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is perfectly reasonable to
ask local authorities to consider not simply the totality of their
carbon emissions reduction targets, but what they are doing sector by
sector. Local government acts in silos, just as central Government do.
It is the natural function of government to behave in that way. If we
can get integrated government, great, but that is how people
behave.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>
					<a name="08042315000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question to the Minister is,
if she does not like amendment No. 153&#151;I freely accept that
there are difficulties with it&#151;what confidence can we have that
what she is putting in place will deliver carbon reduction targets from
transport locally, and that the impetus will be there for local
councils and others to take the movement forward to meet the
Government&#146;s national targets? I am not convinced that that
impetus is there, and the Government are in danger of having a national
target that they cannot enforce because, locally, the action has not
been taken to render it effective.</div>
					<a name="08042315000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other concern is on
amendment No. 145. The Minister can find arguments against amendment
No. 153 that are to some extent legitimate, although I do not think she
has come up with an alternative, but on amendment No. 145 she is on
more difficult ground. On that amendment, I have argued that
sustainability, however we wish to define it, is a key
issue&#151;there is no getting away from it. I have heard no argument
to justify the fact that it should not be on the same level as
&#147;safe&#148;, &#147;integrated&#148;,
&#147;efficient&#148; and &#147;economic&#148;. If she is
arguing that it is highlighted in other legislation as being central,
it is difficult to understand why the Government wish to be
inconsistent and exclude it from the list of criteria that apply under
the Bill. The reality is that the transport sector generally has not
been good at dealing with carbon emissions; it has seen itself as being
above and exempt from that, whether at local or national level. The
amendment is a way to highlight
that.</div>
					<a name="08042315000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fear that even
with the intentions referred to in clause 8, which I readily
acknowledge as a step forward, the Government are saying, &#147;Well,
let&#146;s make sure that your transport is safe; we must do that.
Let&#146;s make sure that it&#146;s economic, however we define
economic. Let&#146;s make sure it&#146;s efficient and
integrated&#148;&#151;most people think that buses and trains
together is the normal understanding of that word&#151;&#147;and
once you&#146;ve done all that, you can pay some regard to the
environment.&#148; It is a second-tier requirement and the Minister
has given no explanation of why the environment should not be a
first-tier requirement. I feel quite strongly about this issue, so I
shall ask the Committee to divide on amendment No.
145.</div>

Knight:
						</b> May I ask the Minister a specific question? What
would be the effect of not including paragraph 8 of schedule 1? Would
it mean that road user charging and workplace parking levies could not
go
ahead?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000427"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I hope not. Perhaps it would help if I started
by explaining a bit of the background to the
schedule.</div>
					<a name="08042315000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 1
will make a series of amendments to the Transport Act 2000 and replace
references to local transport plans in the provisions on buses and road
charging in parts 2 and 3 of the 2000 Act, with reference to local
transport policies. Under each of the existing references to the 2000
Act, a local transport authority&#146;s duty is linked to its local
transport plan. For example, at present, under section 139 of the 2000
Act, an authority must have regard to its local transport plan in
determining what local bus information should be made available to the
public. Similarly, a local authority can have a workplace levy parking
scheme only if it appears desirable in terms of the policies in the
authority&#146;s local transport plan. Also, an authority is able to
spend its revenue from a workplace parking levy or road user charge
only on directly or indirectly facilitating the achievement of policies
in its local transport plan.</div>
					<a name="08042315000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have made these changes
because we think local transport authorities should be able to start
implementing new policies once they have been agreed, rather than
having to wait until those new policies have appeared in a revised and
republished local transport plan. Having said all that, it is important
to recognise that for the revenue that would arise from either a
workplace parking levy or a road user charging scheme to be put into
policies in the local transport plan, it would have had to appear in
the local transport plan in the first
place.</div>
					<a name="08042315000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
removing paragraph 8, that paragraph makes only a very small adjustment
to the existing wording. However, that adjustment is necessary to bring
the provision made by paragraph 8 of schedule 12 to the 2000 Act within
the application of the new definition in section 108(5) made under
clause 7(5) of the Bill. I am very impressed with that explanation, as
I hope the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in
clause 8, page 10, line 31, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) to have
regard to any relevant plans and strategies published by any relevant
rail infrastructure
manager.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08042315000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will have noticed that amendment No. 36 and amendments Nos.
38 and 39 in clause 9, which I think we will have a chance to discuss
later on, are very
similar.</div>
					<a name="08042315000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
prior to lunch, the Minister was asking exactly how we formulated the
amendments and how much outside help we had received. I have to
acknowledge that here we are grateful for the briefing from Network
Rail. Only on these amendments and on one other group have we received
significant help and not managed to formulate the proposals ourselves.
The purpose of these measures is to ensure that when developing
transport plans and policies, local authorities have regard to the
policies and plans of those charged with operating the rail
network.</div>
					<a name="08042315000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concept is fairly simple. A significant proportion of travelling is
done by rail&#151;people and goods, travelling in and out and through
local areas, and within local areas, by train. The rail network
transcends local authority borders and in a number of examples is not
operated and managed by local transport authorities. However, at the
beginning and end of train journeys, users obviously rely on transport
services put on within and by the local authority. Those services are
partially governed by plans, so that represents integration. The new
integrated transport authorities, which I will come on to, will have an
obligation to consider integration across all modes of transport. It
makes sense, therefore, that local transport authorities should
consider that as well.</div>
					<a name="08042315000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would ensure that
local transport authorities had &#147;regard to&#148; the plans and
strategies provided by any rail infrastructure manager. My
understanding and reading is that &#147;rail infrastructure
manager&#148; also covers operators. The amendment would place an
obligation to consult or have regard; no duty would be placed in
respect of developing the whole plan or policy, or to put into the plan
what the rail network told them to include. I do not see the duty to
consult and to have regard as an onerous burden on local authorities;
it is a question of
consultation.</div>
					<a name="08042315000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that &#147;relevant rail infrastructure manager&#148; is
the right definition. It is defined in statutory instrument No.
599&#151;the Railways and Other Guided 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006&#151;which covers Network
Rail, train operating companies, both passengers and freight.</div>
					<a name="08042315000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
refers to &#147;relevant plans and strategies&#148;. I mean that
and I think that most people&#146;s common understanding of it means
Network Rail&#146;s route plans and utilisation strategy. Those set
out current capacity, passenger and freight demand, passenger and
freight demand trends, operational performance cost and projections as
to how the future requirements of rail users and funders should be met.
Therefore, those rail utilisation strategies should inform the thinking
and the consultation
process.</div>

Stringer:
						</b> I am listening to the hon.
Gentleman and I would be grateful if he explained further what
&#147;have regard to&#148; means. I am not playing games with the
previous questions to the Minister. The hon. Gentleman seems to be
saying that, in all circumstances, Network Rail&#146;s policies will
have priority over local integrated transport authorities. If that is
what he is saying and that is the definition he is using, I would be
grateful if was
explicit.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000447"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> No, that is not the definition,
nor do I understand the normal legal definition of &#147;have regard
to&#148; to imply that either. As I said a moment ago, there is an
obligation in the Bill on integrated transport authorities to consider
integration across all modes of transport, but the amendment provides
for an obligation on local transport authorities as
well.</div>
					<a name="08042315000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy to accept the Minister&#146;s correction as to exactly what
&#147;have regard to&#148; means&#151;my understanding and, I
guess, the common parlance and common-sense version is that, after
consulting, those involved must at least listen to what was said. If
they then choose to ignore what was said to them, that is satisfactory,
because they have consulted and had regard to it. I understand that to
be the normal meaning of what is put in Bills, but I am happy to be
corrected.</div>
					<a name="08042315000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
taking that intervention, I said that rail utilisation strategies are
the basis on which Network Rail operates its consultation with local
authorities and stakeholders&#151;a formal review process. The
amendment would make that process work both ways: just as Network Rail
consults local authorities on rail utilisation strategies, so the
authorities, when they put their local transport policy plans together,
should consult Network
Rail.</div>
					<a name="08042315000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand why
I am in the wrong, but I also understand that the Government might
intend to produce some guidance to local authorities on whom exactly
they should consult in the formulation of their local transport plans.
I am looking for the Minister to update us on that and to give us more
guidance.</div>
					<a name="08042315000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that local authorities and local people know their areas
better, although some local decisions have to be taken in a national
and regional context. It is the rail network that needs such context.
My amendment would put the appropriate requirement on local
authorities&#151;they should consult and &#147;have regard
to&#148; the response that they receive from the &#147;rail
infrastructure manager&#148;, which covers both Network Rail and the
operators, as well as the demands of both freight and
passengers.</div>

							<a name="08042315000448"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I shall be brief. I rise to
support the amendment. We have the renaming of passenger transport
executives as integrated transport authorities. We have bus strategies
being abolished. Quite clearly, the intention of the
Government&#151;sensibly&#151;is to integrate rail and bus. How
could it be anything other than sensible to accept the amendment tabled
by the hon. Member for
Wimbledon?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000449"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> When drawing up integrated transport plans,
which is what we want authorities to do, I know how important it is to
look across the different modes of transport in an area. One of the
points made by many of us as to why we want to take greater powers for
local authorities is that people get infuriated when they arrive by
train only to find that the bus left five minutes previously. I am sure
that, for many of us, that is a constant refrain from our
constituencies. We certainly believe that it is important to take a
truly integrated approach in local transport
plans.</div>
				
					<a name="08042315000324"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="08042315000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Wimbledon would put in place specific
statutory requirements for transport authorities to consider future
relevant rail schemes in their transport policies and plans.
Consultation is already an integral part of the development of the
local transport plan process. Local transport authorities consult
bodies, including Network Rail. That level of detailed consultation is
seen as vital in developing future transport policies. Similarly,
Network Rail consults local authorities extensively in the development
of its route utilisation strategies&#151;as the hon. Gentleman
mentioned.</div>
					<a name="08042315000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
9 requires local transport authorities to consult about local transport
plans, but the only consultees specified are certain other local
authorities and the Secretary of State. The clause also states that
local transport authorities must consult &#147;such other
persons&#148; as they consider appropriate. With a few exceptions,
under the Bill local transport authorities themselves will decide on
which individual organisations to consult and in many cases that will
include rail infrastructure managers, as we call them. Indeed, many
other important and relevant local, regional and national strategies
could be produced by other
organisations.</div>
					<a name="08042315000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
thinking of examples such as integrated regional strategies and, in
some cases, local crime and disorder reduction strategies, which could
be very relevant to local transport plans. When considering the
amendment, it is important that consultation between local transport
authorities and Network Rail works in both directions. A specific duty
on local transport authorities to have regard to Network Rail&#146;s
plans and strategies without a corresponding duty on Network Rail would
work in only one direction.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000450"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> As I explained, there is a duty on Network Rail
to have such regard in its rail utilisation strategies. It is doing
what the Minister wants it to do, which is to work both
ways.</div>

							<a name="08042315000451"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Rail utilisation strategies
can be quite different from the future rail management schemes to which
the hon. Gentleman referred. However, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>Government intend to develop guidance for local transport authorities in
the preparation of the next round of local transport plans. The matters
that local transport authorities would need to consider when drawing up
their plans, including rail strategy and proposals, could be covered by
the guidance. Because of my point that there could be other people and
authorities that it might be necessary to consult, we do not want to
pick out in the Bill particular bodies such as Network Rail, as opposed
to other integrated regional strategies or crime and disorder
partnerships that might be equally relevant when drawing up a plan. I
assure the hon. Member for Wimbledon that we shall be making sure that
it is clear in guidance that that is exactly the sort of body that
local authorities should consult. In the light of my reassurance, I
hope that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08042315000452"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The Minister has defended her position, but she
did not address some of the points raised by the amendment. One of the
reasons why the amendment is important is that rail infrastructure is
trans-local, regional and national in nature. As I explained in my
opening remarks, a key point is that the amendment would place exactly
the same burden on local authorities as National Rail has at
present.</div>
					<a name="08042315000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that local transport plans will need to consider the future
whereas route utilisation strategies do not, but that is exactly what
they do. She also said that she expected that local authorities would
include people in their consultation process. There was not a
categorical &#147;must&#148;. To rehearse our arguments about
consultation this morning during our debate on clause 3, if the right
hon. Lady tells me that on Report she wants to add the other people to
the statutory consultation, I should be relatively happy to leave
things unambiguous, but I am not sure that the people whom she
mentioned were in any way as relevant as the rail infrastructure
manager or the rail operator. As she rightly said, local authorities
will need to take some regard of such people when we want to integrate
bus and rail services.</div>

							<a name="08042315000453"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I have some difficulty with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about other bodies not being as relevant as
Network Rail. Many of the other bodies could be very relevant in
drawing up transport plans. I am prepared to consider the other bodies
that it might be necessary to bring in if a duty were introduced in
terms of Network Rail. I shall not commit to bring anything back, but I
am prepared to consider which other bodies might be brought in and
whether it would be unrealistic to try to define them in
legislation.</div>

							<a name="08042315000454"></a>Stephen
Hammond:

but she is including only what she thinks is necessary. In essence, she
is saying that she thinks those bodies are important&#151;they may or
may not be&#151;but that they are already covered by provisions in
the Bill. In that reassurance, she is telling me only that if I press
the amendment to a vote, she may be prepared to put the things that she
thinks are important into the Bill. That gives me no guarantee about
the particular person whom I think needs to be consulted in order for
there to be a proper consultation process, or that local authorities
will get their transport plans by speaking to the rail infrastructure
manager.</div>

for itself but I shall make a number of points about why I think it
should be added to the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08042315000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">In effect, the amendment would
alter clause 8 by giving a local authority in exceptional local

					<a name="08042315000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not a wrecking amendment. It says that in exceptional local
circumstances, where the transport authority feels that there is a good
reason to deviate from the national guidelines set out by the Secretary
of State, it would be able to do so, but only after making a
declaration in those terms. As I understand it, that declaration would
be open to legal challenge if it was made frivolously.

that at some point the Government may say that each town and city
should have a low emission zone, and that cars that cannot comply with
a certain level of emissions should either be banned from entering the
city centre or the owner should face a charge. Let me take the
Committee back a few years when the town of Corby depended almost
exclusively on its steelworks. When the steelworks collapsed, not only
did the majority of employed people in that town lose their job, they
also faced immediate negative equity. One could purchase a freehold
house in Corby at the time of the collapse for &#163;1,000. Imagine
if a similar tragedy happened to a local community and the Government
said that a low emission zone must come in and everyone who had an
older car suddenly found that they could not go into the city centre or

unreasonable decision in such circumstances. The key word in the
amendment is &#147;exceptional&#148;. I hope that the Minister can
see the sense of saying that where a local issue is so important that
it is regarded as exceptional by the local transport authority, the
authority should be allowed, in those circumstances, to deviate from
guidance that would otherwise be regarded as quite acceptable and the
norm. All my amendment seeks to do is to make that provision clear in
the
Bill.</div>

						</b> The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment
illustrates some of the controversial issues around environmental
policies. I am not sure whether he is supported by his Front-Bench
colleagues. The Government fear that the amendment would undermine the
steps that we want local authorities to take to contribute towards
improving our
environment.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08042315000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would enable a local authority to develop and implement
policies that could ignore Government policy and guidance on the
protection and improvement of the environment where it considers that
&#147;exceptional local circumstances&#148; applied, without any
real reference to what those circumstances might be. As a Government,
we are aware of the need for individual local authorities to take local
factors into account in drawing up and implementing their transport
policies. That is at the heart of our approach, whether those policies
concern tackling congestion, providing high quality bus services or
addressing environmental issues.</div>
					<a name="08042315000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
absolutely no problem in saying that individual circumstances will
prevail, but at the same time, we are all aware of the need to protect
the environment and to address climate change. That is why the Bill
allows the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>Secretary of State to issue guidance to local authorities on fulfilling
the new environmental duty introduced by clause 8. Interestingly, the
Committee has just divided, with the two opposition parties wanting a
greater emphasis and direct reference to the environment in the Bill.
The amendment would undermine what is happening in the Bill and what we
are trying to do.</div>

						</b> Protection of the environment is important. When
I first read the amendment I thought that it was otiose. Whether it is
necessary or not depends on how we define &#147;taking into
account&#148; and &#147;having regard&#148;. I would be grateful
if the Minister could expand on that, because the way in which she is
developing her arguments seems to be to interpret &#147;taking into
account&#148; and &#147;having regard&#148; as having to follow
the Government&#146;s policy, even if it is detrimental to the
area.</div>
					<a name="08042315000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000477"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> What we mean by &#147;have regard to&#148;
or to &#147;take account of&#148; an obligation is first, to give
attention to the matter to which the duty applies; secondly, to
consider the contents of that matter in relation to the proposal or
plans under consideration; and thirdly, to adjust those proposals or
plans to take into account the additional information provided or to
determine that no such adjustment need be made.</div>
					<a name="08042315000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
the Bill allowing the Secretary of State to issue guidance to local
authorities on fulfilling the new environmental duty introduced by
clause 8, we want to see such guidance cover issues such as air
quality, noise and climate change. Local authorities would need to
address those in devising and implementing their transport policies and
local transport plan and show how their local authorities will take
local factors into account. That is a sensible approach and it gives
authorities flexibility to reflect local circumstances without
undermining the importance of addressing the sorts of environmental
issues that I have already mentioned. In contrast, the amendment does
not explain what exceptional local circumstances&#151;something that
the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire thinks could justify an
authority taking a different approach&#151;might be. We believe that
it would leave a large loophole so that an authority could bury its
head in the sand were it minded to do so, and implement policies that
take little or no account of the importance of the environment or of
addressing climate change.</div>

							<b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Can
we be very clear about this, before we decide on the merits or
otherwise of the amendment? Is the Minister&#146;s case that, in the
circumstances described by my right hon. Friend the Member for East
Yorkshire, which could be described as exceptional, it would be proper
for a local authority to say that it has had regard to the Secretary of
State&#146;s guidance, but has decided not to implement it because of
exceptional circumstances? If that is the Minister&#146;s case, the
amendment may not be necessary. However, following on from the remarks
of the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley, it would be helpful if the
Minister could be clear that that is what she is
saying.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000479"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The difficulty is that the amendment is not
clear. We want to see local flexibility within the transport plans of
local authorities, but we also want it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>to be clear that we expect local authorities to take action. The problem
with the amendment is that it does not say what those exceptional local
circumstances would be, so it is difficult for Parliament to send a
message about that. The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire mentioned
the closure of a steel plant. Such things are is difficult to
anticipate. The right hon. Gentleman clearly wants to provide a way for
local authorities not to have to implement some of these environmental
policies. We believe that it is important that Government and
Parliament send a message that such policies should be taken very
seriously.</div>

						</b> I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way.
May I refer her back to her own legal advice, which she quoted to the
Committee earlier today? In the absence of any definition, the word
&#147;exceptional&#148; means what we all think it
means.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000481"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> That is the problem with it
being entirely within the legislation. Earlier we talked about the
definition of &#147;the economy&#148;. When I looked at the
lawyers&#146; interpretation, that is something that means what it
would mean in normal parlance. However, something like
&#147;exceptional circumstances&#148; is incredibly vague, and
exceptional circumstances for one authority might be entirely different
for another.</div>

							<b class="B">Ms
Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): In
support of my right hon. Friend&#146;s case, that defining
&#147;exceptional circumstances&#148; is very difficult and is not
defined in the amendment, I refer to the example given by the right
hon. Member for East Yorkshire. Sheffield suffered large job losses due
to the closure of steel plants back in the early 1980s&#151;no
thanks, let me add, to the policies of the Conservative party when it
was in power. In fact, the impact on car ownership would have been very
low at that time because many of the steelworkers would not have owned
cars. The lowest levels of car ownership in Sheffield were in the
steelworking areas. The variations according to local circumstances
would have benefited the citizens of the south-west of the city where
levels of car ownership were high and where job losses were at a
minimum. In fact, I do not think that the example works to justify the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000483"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> My hon. Friend is right. One of the
difficulties in interpreting the precise meaning of proposed new
section (2ZD) is that it is incredibly ambiguous. It could either be
interpreted as meaning that provisions or guidance can be ignored or
that the guidance as a whole can be ignored. Frankly, neither of those
would be desirable. We want local authorities to take into account the
policies and have regard to the guidance, but we then want them to make
up their own mind about how to take policies forward in terms of the
actions that they would take.</div>

							<a name="08042315000484"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The only trouble with the argument of the hon.
Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough is that my right hon. Friend the
Member for East Yorkshire was talking about a circumstance in another
city. Therefore, one cannot suddenly compare one with the other. If
there is the lowest level of car ownership in an area, one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>could say that that would not be exceptional circumstances under the
conventional meaning of the word &#147;exceptional&#148;. The
Minister is wriggling around in relation to what is a common parlance
view of the word &#147;exceptional&#148;. As the Minister said
about the meaning of &#147;economic&#148;, most people would have
little problem with the meaning of &#147;exceptional&#148;. The
Minister is wriggling around on that
point.</div>
					<a name="08042315000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">One thing that
I would like my right hon. Friend to clarify relates to the Minister
making the whole of the special local circumstances seem as if they
would be used in a completely anti-environmental way. There is nothing
in what my right hon. Friend has said that could be taken to be
anti-environmental, unless one chooses to read it in that
way.</div>

							<a name="08042315000485"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is being a bit naive in that
respect because it is perfectly obvious from the amendment that the
idea is to make it easier for local authorities to say that they do not
want to implement the measure. Frankly, I see the amendment as a way of
creating a loophole to enable local authorities to simply not carry out
environmental policies, if they feel like being a bit
difficult.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042315000487"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I hardly think that that is the point. We are
talking about putting together &#147;exceptional
circumstances&#148; without any definition of what that would be. If
the hon. Gentleman were to try to draw up what all the exceptional
circumstances could be, it would be
impossible.</div>

							<a name="08042315000488"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> When we went through this whole argument less
than an hour ago, the Minister tried to tell us that there was a
common-sense definition of the word &#147;economic&#148; and I said
clearly to her that there was not because there is a wide-ranging
interpretation of the word. The Minister is now trying to tell me that
there is a wide-ranging interpretation of the word
&#147;exceptional&#148;. The Minister is trying to have it both
ways; she cannot have it both ways. If she accepted the earlier
proposition, she should accept my
proposition.</div>

							<a name="08042315000489"></a>Ms

						</b> I could say the same the other way around. If
the hon. Gentleman does not think that there is an interpretation of
the word &#147;economy&#148; that most people would understand, how
on earth does he think that there is an accepted interpretation of
&#147;exceptional local circumstances&#148;. As he has said, that
is a whole phrase that covers a range of different circumstances. I
believe that the Conservative party is coming out in its true colours.
It does not want to see those environmental measures being taken, and
that is the point of its
amendment.</div>

said something like, &#147;where the local transport authority thinks
fit&#148;. In other words, no restriction would be placed on its
judgment. The amendment makes it clear that exceptional local
circumstances have to exist for a policy that deviates in part from
what the right hon. Lady set out in national guidelines to be

as &#147;must comply with&#148;. An authority must always make up
its own mind. To blindly follow guidance, whatever it was, would be for
the authority unlawfully to fetter its discretion. Of course, it has
discretion, but that is entirely different from setting out a whole
range of vague exceptional local circumstances that an authority could
just decide would apply to its situation. We have taken the exactly
