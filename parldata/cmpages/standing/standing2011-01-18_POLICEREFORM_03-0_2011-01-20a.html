wish to start by asking generally about the licensing provisions in the
Bill, about the perception that the Licensing Act 2003 was weighted
towards the trade, and whether the provisions in the Bill will redress
the balance. Will communities have more of a say about licensing in
their areas? Will panel members make some overall comments on those
matters?<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000031">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Perhaps I can make a start. As a ward
councillor as well as a more strategic councillor in Liverpool, I have
had concerns about the 2003 Act and how it has over-extended our city
centres. In particular, it gave us not as much control as we would like
in our district centres, often where drinking takes places next to
where people live and when they are trying to get their children to
sleep.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
for redressing the balance, I see the Bill as a step in the right
direction, but one that does not necessarily go far enough. For
example, we welcome the late-night levy but, in Liverpool, it will not
give us a police officer for a night. I like the idea of minimum
pricing for alcohol, but I do not think that it is set high enough.
There are some useful first steps to build on. I am not decrying most
aspects of the Bill, except police commissioners, which we might or
might not be dealing with. If the Bill is something that we can build
on, it is good. If it is by itself, it is no more than a first
step.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000033">&#160;</a>

not pay for a police officer for a night, but will it not act as a
disincentive for places of entertainment and places where alcohol is
being sold, and can be used to increase their security to pay for door
staff, for example, to prevent access to those already in drink when
they seek to enter the premises, and perhaps, in other ways, to improve
a business’s actions towards those who might be
disorderly?<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000034">&#160;</a>

that it will effect any real change in behaviour from licensees. On
rateable values, you might be talking about £4,000 from a big
property, if I have read the Home Office’s rules correctly,
which is perhaps the cost of another doorman for two or three nights a
week. If we want to address the way in which some licensees
behave—there are many good licensees, and I do not wish to be
too critical of them—frankly, it is a question of education and
of working with them and supporting them. With the turnover on a place
that can take 1,200 people a night, £4,000 here or there is
probably not going to effect much
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000035">&#160;</a>

houses have closed at the rate of 50 a week in recent years, and we
should balance out such aspects. The figure that the Bill currently
refers

problems of small pubs. If we look at this subject just as a financial
matter, we are doomed to failure. There are changes in society, in the
way our district centres work, in rural areas and in the way our
villages work—coming from Liverpool, I am not an expert on that.
We cannot assume that we can make fundamental changes by minor
tinkering with the costs of licensing. Some fundamental issues need to
be addressed, but it is fairly marginal as to whether that relates to a
village pub or a Yates’s

you will be aware of what city centres were like back in the
’80s and ’90s, and of how they have been transformed over
recent years, especially in the northern cities of Liverpool, Leeds and

city centre regeneration, and was it worth
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly,
the night-time economy is an important part of the offering of a city
or big town. Our concern is that, because city centres have become
over-alcoholed, that has had a good effect on licensed premises, but a
poor effect on other people wanting to use city centres. In Liverpool,
the Liverpool One development is a safe cocoon of activity, with nice
hotels and restaurants. People who go there and stay there do not
venture into other parts of the city, which is true of any city and not
just of Liverpool. For example, the idea of people going to the theatre
on a Saturday night and having a meal afterwards is probably not
happening in such cases, because of the association in people’s
minds with what happens between 10 and 12 o’clock. They have had
a nice visit to the theatre, but wonder what they will encounter when
they leave the restaurant at midnight. There have been good points,
which I am not knocking, but the idea of a 24-hour city is that you can
do everything, and not just drink, at 2 o’clock in the
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000041">&#160;</a>

Rawlings:</strong>
                           </em> To come back to the original question,
before the 2003 Act, councillors had little or no control over
licences. It is important to remember that that Act took away control
from magistrates and gave it to councils. The night-time economy was
not invented by that Act; it existed before. It was the only area in
which councils got involved, because they granted late-night licences
under the public entertainment licence system, which was subsumed into
the licensing system under the new Act. Councils had that control over
later licences, but not over the earlier
licenses.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000043">&#160;</a>

provide jobs and so forth. We could talk long and hard about trying to
solve the issues of

                           </div>town centres. Our association and others have done a lot of work,
particularly on business improvement districts, which have had massive
effects on crime and disorder. Our angst with the Bill is that there is
not enough recognition of what is going on. Best Bar None is a scheme
that we are involved in and which we promote around the
country—Purple Flag is another one. There are lots of things
going on that seek to address the problems in town centres in a
collaborative

would agree that some of the changes to the Act could be useful for
public representation. We do not have a particular issue with regard to
vicinity, except to say that the solution to that in the Gambling Act
2005 is rather better, because the provision as it stands means that a
local resident who lives on the other side of the street in a different
authority would be debarred from making a representation to a bar on
the other side of the street. That seems to be an oversight in the
drafting of the Bill. I am happy to answer more on that as we go

takes a long time to bed in, and there will be problems in how it does
so. We are now at a point where the majority of local authorities and
businesses around the country understand the Act and how it is used. It
is working well in most instances. There will always be instances of
local authorities having trouble with a particular area or premises.
There will always be rogue premises that need to be dealt with. Some of
the changes that are being introduced seem to be about tackling a very
small minority of businesses or local authority issues, and the risk is
that they impact on a whole range of businesses and local authorities
that do not need

the late-night levy, my main concern is that it has to apply to an
entire local authority area. If you are trying to sort out a problem in
a town centre, I am not sure why you are levying an extra tax on a
local pub 10 miles down the road. That is a risk. Also, you
have a whole range of licensed premises—hotels, restaurants and
shops with 24-hour licences—that may not be the target of local
authority action, but would be brought into a late-night levy scheme

                           </em> This is the fourth time in five years that
the Act has been revisited since it came in in 2005. We think that that
is rather too much. I would reiterate what Jeremy says: what is good
for business and for local councils is certainty. Changes that keep
coming are producing uncertainty in the market. You referred to 50 pubs
a week closing. I am pleased to say that that is down to 30 a week, but
that is still 30 pubs a week where jobs that are good for the economy
are going from this industry. You may have read in yesterday’s
papers about youth unemployment. This sector is a big employer of youth
in this country, and there is still big potential for that employment
to grow.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000053">&#160;</a>

is that there are costs involved. We should not be dismissive about the
way in which they could impact on businesses that, in the
Minister’s own words, are the vast majority, and the vast
majority are responsible businesses. We recognise that there are
irresponsible businesses. There were some 13,000 reviews of licensed
premises last year. It is not a huge number in a total of 190,000, but
it shows that the Act can work, and it is
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000054">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What
I think this and the previous Government have recognised is that there
is still some learning to do on enforcement. The Government had a
session last year going round telling people how to enforce the Act,
and they are doing it again now. There is clearly some work to be done
in that sense. If enforcement fails, you do not solve that by putting
more burdens on to the businesses of those who are being enforced,
because most people will do what they are told to do—small
businesses particularly.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000055">&#160;</a>

with potential conditions and laws, that can be difficult, particularly
for the small rural pubs—my daughter runs one, and I know how
difficult they are to run, particularly with a whole new raft of
legislation, that really does not apply. We know and identify that the
problems exist in town centres, and those should be addressed, but that
has to be done in the right way. Regarding your question on the levy,
we understand that it is drafted as it is because it is a local tax. It
cannot be right, therefore, to address a problem in a town centre by
taxing a pub that might be 50 miles away and that would get no benefit
from that

there is a different focus, which is based on hours. I shall ask the

needs to pay more money for policing, whether it needs it or not. Our
concern is that problem businesses should be tackled and should come up

penalty of closing itself for 48 hours, but closing itself
for a week has fairly serious commercial impacts, particularly for
small companies. If you increase that closure time and businesses
decide to fight the case in court, the risk is that you will have a

the 2003 Act is another remedy; it is an alternative, rather than a
replacement. Training orders work. If there is a failure in
enforcement—pubs, clubs and shops enforce the law, that is what
they are trying to do—giving them a training order to readdress
that and to get their staff to work better has to be the right way to
go.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000071">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
problem with the persistent selling offence is that it does not include
intent. There is a lot of difference between somebody on the staff who
makes a mistake, or, indeed, does it wilfully, and the owner of the
business. It is quite possible under the provisions for two members of
staff to fail a test purchase without the knowledge of the owner of
that business, who has no intention to sell, but falls foul of this
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000072">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
would like to see this taken as a remedial approach, because the
problem with under-age selling is a question of supply and demand. We
tackle the supply. We recognise the responsibility of that, and it is
reasonable that there are penalties, but the demand from young people
does not diminish. We looked at this a couple of years ago and did a
survey of our members, and our estimate was that 1 million people a
month were trying to buy alcohol. We think that has diminished
somewhat, but it is still
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000073">&#160;</a>

the young people, “No, do not try this.” Most kids
now—my youngest son is 22—cannot get a drink in my area
without an ID card, but, as Jeremy says, there are other places where
they can get drink. I understand that the Home Office is now seriously
looking at internet sales. There is displacement down the chain. You
take the alcohol away from pubs, bars and shops, then you take it from
the parks, where people will sell it to them, but it goes into internet
sales, which is a growing
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000074">&#160;</a>

open once after midnight to be caught by the levy. A lot of those pubs
will have new year opening, as a grandfather right from the old regime,
when the Government of the day decided they could open for 36 hours at
new year. They would be caught by the levy as the Bill stands at the
moment. Quite a few pubs will have extended opening hours at bank
holidays. There may be a dozen or so occasions where they have prior
permission to open.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000081">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I notice in
the Bill that that permission can be removed, so as not to fall foul of
the levy. However, for new year they would then have to apply for a
temporary event notice. That would greatly expand the temporary event
notice procedure, which would put a burden on councils. I do not want
to burden councils any more than they are, and we certainly do not want
to pay any more than we do—because that has a cost to it as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000082">&#160;</a>

different type of approach—a partnership approach—to
tackling these issues. Where we have seen local businesses working with
local police and local authorities on schemes, such as Best Bar None

businesses is finance and support for things that they believe will
make a difference to tackling the problems, working together.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000086">&#160;</a>

In response to that, what are the alternative proposals to
the late-night levy and the funding it will provide to go back into
policing costs, for instance? Why should the polluter not pay? Local
communities have to fund enormous sums of money for their police
officers to be deployed on Friday and Saturday nights, abstracting
officers from other duties. It is very burdensome on police forces and,
arguably, unfair to all other residents who are not doing the drinking
and enjoying of those premises. Why should the polluter not

the late-night levy should be set—if you are going to have
one—at a level which brings in enough money to do something. Our
suggestion, based on Home Office figures, is that the amount raised
will not do all that much. Collecting it as a levy, rather than
collecting it as part of the licence, just adds an extra administrative
burden. If you really want to achieve something, you have to set it at
a level that is worth while.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000098">&#160;</a>

to recognise that this is not just a late-night problem. In my own ward
we have pavement cafes. There may be an international match on, such as
Mexico v. Brazil. Those who want to support Mexico for the day go to
one side of the street, into a pavement café, and the ones who
want to support Brazil go to the other side. It takes three quarters of
all the policing from south Liverpool to deal with pavement cafes,
sometimes at 2 o’clock on a Sunday afternoon. If it is a
“polluter pays” principle, we have to go a lot further
than the late-night levy, and extract real charges that will reflect
policing and so

alcohol and young people in my constituency, for instance, is with the
peer group around the age of 18—some are under 18 and some
above. Because we are so efficient at keeping people under the age of
18 out of pubs, the under-18s go to a local convenience store and they
get drunk in the community. That problem is not addressed by a
late-night levy.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000107">&#160;</a>

sales are becoming the retail sector’s biggest issue, in terms
of how they tackle alcohol misuse. Where we have had significant
success in tackling that is through using community alcohol
partnerships, and the approach that has been adopted there. They
started looking at how you tackle young people drinking, and
particularly young people drinking in a public environment, such as
sitting in a park, when 19-year-olds have bought alcohol for
17-year-olds. The results from those projects that are rolling out
around the country—I think that we now have 37 of
them—have been very successful in local areas at tackling

reasons why. First, there are businesses out there that intentionally

the processes that the pub and retail sector put into place, around
challenge 21 and challenge 25, are to stop that from happening.
However, it still does happen. People make bad judgments about how old
someone is.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000112">&#160;</a>

long time to look at them in a shop or pub environment. You have quite
a short time in a busy environment to make that judgment, which is why,
for the retail sector, we have moved to challenge 25. I get more
letters of complaint about that than just about anything else now, from
25-year-olds who do not like to be asked for ID, but that gives us a
better ability to make a judgment about someone’s

Temporary event notices are not a speciality for us and our
organisation. I come across them more in my role on the parent teacher
association and seeing my mother trying to run her local village wine
club. We need a balance between ensuring that people do not abuse the
temporary event notice system—and tightening that up—and
not making life impossible or incredibly bureaucratic and difficult for
people who want to run a school fête or a village hall event.
That is the key to the balance, but, as I said, this is not an area of
expertise for us and our organisation. Martin is much more au fait with
the issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000121">&#160;</a>

Rawlings:</strong>
                           </em> To be honest, we do not have a lot to say
about temporary event notices. We understand where there should be
conditions, but in the main, particularly where pubs take on temporary
event notices, common sense would prevail and you would carry on those
conditions. If you normally have door staff until 12 am and you have a
temporary event notice until 1 am, you will not send the
staff home. If there are concerns about that, we understand them and we
do not have a particular issue with that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000122">&#160;</a>

except for what the notice has been applied for. The only thing I would
add is that it is

                           </div>a peculiar fact that a temporary event notice does not need an event.
You apply for it because you want 15 extra nights a year, so
you find reasons for doing it. We had a case recently of a Tesco store
that put its licensing application for a new store in late, so it
wanted to apply for four lots of four days of temporary event notices
to fill the gap. There was no event, just a reason for putting in a
quickie licence application, which is absolutely unchallengeable unless
you can prove criminal intent or particularly perverse consequences. I
do not think a temporary event notice should be a dodge round proper
licensing constraints.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000123">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The Local Government Association’s views
on police commissioners as a whole are well known: we think they are an
answer to a question that is not being put. There are conflicting
matters that the Government need to resolve, such as the relationship
between the police commissioner, or even a police authority, and very
localised matters. Another concern is the relationship between the
planning authority and the licensing authority, which are the same body
wearing two quasi-judicial hats. What happens if a licence can be given
under licensing law but, under the new community planning activity in
the Localism Bill, local people do not want it? Who is the arbiter
there? That is already a problem in some areas. For example, the pub
opposite me has a 1.30 am licence, but has to close at 11.30 pm because
we control that under planning law. It is very confusing to explain why
under one law the council gives a 1.30 am licence but under another law
an 11.30 pm one. If there was a pavement café, it
might get a 6 o’clock licence. Someone needs to bring
through all the elements of localism so that when I, as a local
councillor, go to my community, I have something that I can easily and
readily explain.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000127">&#160;</a>

living 15 yards from where people are having a smoke in the street.

Planning and licensing, with regard to licensed premises, go hand in
hand, because you have two different sets of constraints. To put it
crudely, one is the effect on the community, and one is the effect on
what happens inside the premises, but I know that it is more
complicated than that. There seems to be logic in trying to put two
Bills together, so that they align. At the moment, it is incredibly
difficult for me to explain to my constituents why I am saying
different things at different times, depending on which quasi-judicial
committee I am going to, about the same licensed premises. I would like
coherence, because that is the only way that I can explain that to my
constituents in a way that will allow us then to come up with the
neighbourhood plans required in the Localism

Rawlings has already said that drugs were much more of an issue than
alcohol, and drug-related crime is certainly a major issue for me in
west London. Given how fast science is moving—you are certainly
the expert to tell us about

right and, in terms of the process, get it happening as soon as
possible? Do you feel that the temporary class drugs order is
required?<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000164">&#160;</a>

Iverson:</strong>
                           </em> The council was fully consulted by Ministers
when the changes to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 were being drafted. We
discussed the proposals, we were able to give detailed comments back to
Ministers and we are fully supportive. The temporary class drug order
will have a useful place in the control of drug misuse, but we hope
that it will be used very sparingly. Any time a temporary order of this
type is imposed it will be incumbent on our council to do further
investigation and in due course recommend whether the drug should
become an illegal substance.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I see this as
a two-stage process. If you see something coming over the horizon that
looks as though it might be dangerous, you impose a temporary class
drug order. We hope that the Minister would
consult us and agree with us before taking such a radical step. Later,
the council would return with a more reasoned, evidence-based
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If I take the
example of mephedrone, which is a very good examples, the advisory
council first became aware of this entirely new chemical in July 2009
when it began to be sold at music festivals, first of all in the Isle
of Wight. We could see the use of the substance growing and it was
easily available; with a mobile phone and a credit card anybody of any
age could order mephedrone. By the end of 2009 we were sufficiently
concerned about it that we wrote to the then Home Secretary alerting
him to the possible dangers of the drug and telling him that we
intended to pursue a much more detailed review, which we did. In the
first three months of last year we took evidence from a number of
experts, and we came up with a recommendation at the end of
March—quite a short space of time—that this drug and a
range of related chemicals should be placed under the Misuse of Drugs
Act as class B substances.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The problem
was that we had already told everyone that we were going to review the
drug in detail and everyone, including the media, had
assumed—correctly, as it happened—that we would end up by
recommending that it be banned. Meanwhile, the availability and use of
mephedrone shot up astronomically in the first three months of this
year. You can tell that from the number of people contacting the FRANK
helpsite or the national poisons unit for help, and from admissions to
accident and emergency units. That was very serious, almost of an
epidemic proportion. Meanwhile, the drug was freely available at a
relatively low price; you could buy 1,000 doses for
£2,000 and sell each dose on for £10 or £20, so it
was a very nice little business. We suspect a good deal of stockpiling
occurred before the ban was later imposed. If we had had a temporary
class drug order, I am quite sure that we would have requested the
Minister to impose one. We should not assume that the temporary class
drug order will always come from the Government or the Minister,
because it may equally well come as a recommendation from the advisory
council as we do our horizon-scanning
activities.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So,
we are in favour of it. I have only two concerns about the temporary
class drug order. One is that we hope that Ministers would consult us
beforehand, but that has not been written into the Act. I am not
quite

                           </div>sure why, but it has not been. I am also aware that this will place an
extra burden of work on the advisory council in terms of assessing the
potential dangers and the societal dangers, which is part of our remit,
of such an agent. Many of these new drugs are wholly synthetic
chemicals that have never been seen before, on which there is no data
in the scientific literature, and we will be trying to assess them. It
will be a difficult job, and we have impressed strongly on Ministers
that we will need to do some research, or at least we will suggest that
the Home Office or some other body maintains a research capability in
order to do some simple research on these new compounds to facilitate
our evidence gathering.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000169">&#160;</a>

which at one point say that I have been neutered by the changes and
will not be able to have any say in the composition of the Advisory
Council on the Misuse of Drugs. The proposal is to remove the statutory
requirement for six members, which was laid out in the 1971 Act. Out of
those six, only one or two are scientists. The requirements are for a
chemist, somebody with knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry, a GP,
a vet and a dentist—that is where we
stand.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000171">&#160;</a>

move on, and the drugs scene moves on. We welcome more flexibility in
deciding what sort of new members we need. In the recent round, with
the new members announced yesterday, we have appointed social
scientists, psychologists, another judge and people dealing with drug
treatment. None of those are really scientists, but you could say that
a qualification in social science or psychology is in science. If I
count out the numbers at the moment, I would say that scientific
membership is already at about a third, and I cannot see any Minister
wanting to remove the scientific component from the group. Otherwise, I
do not know where the expertise to make any judgments is gong to come
from.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000172">&#160;</a>

protocol with Ministers on the working relationship between the ACMD,
drugs Ministers and the Department of Health. That will almost
certainly include some statement about areas of expertise that should
normally be included. However, that is not the position at the moment.
We have six statutorily required positions. If any of the people
filling one of those posts resigns, as happened in 2009, that leaves
the council inquorate and unable to make any legal recommendations. For
that reason, in the first several weeks of this year, we were
effectively neutralised and unable to offer any advice. I do not want
to see that happen again. It is an unnecessary and burdensome
requirement. Many Government advisory councils have no such statutory
membership requirements and seem to function perfectly. So I am quite
keen to see those statutory requirements go, although the particular
expertise may well be kept.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000174">&#160;</a>

legal highs that were still available from internet dealers. I do not
suppose that the Minister or I would ever contemplate issuing 40
temporary class banning orders. We have not quite got the solution to
the new problem of legal highs, and we may have to take more radical
action in the future to curb the new cottage industry. I do not know

allowed to talk about alcohol; it is not part of my remit. We need more
education of young people about the harm of psychoactive drugs,
particularly about the popular misconception that, because a drug
happens to be legal, it is therefore safe. There is then the whole
issue of treatment of those who become addicted to psychoactive drugs,
and again there is a great deal to be done in that area. The advisory
council working group on treatment outcomes is measuring how effective
the various programmes have been in achieving their objectives. That
report will be coming out in a few months’ time.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000186">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are also
looking at poly-substance abuse. As has been implied, drugs are taken
commonly in conjunction with alcohol. More than one drug might be taken
in one session and, as we know, some drug combinations are potentially
very dangerous. For example, when cocaine and alcohol are taken
simultaneously, the body manufactures a new chemical called
cocaethylene, which is a particularly nasty nerve toxin. We can provide
scientific evidence on such issues and, hopefully, push out the message
to the community. One of our jobs is the sending out of a public health
message.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000187">&#160;</a>

At the end of 2009, when we first alerted the Home Secretary to a
potential danger, we had no real indication of the impact that this
drug was going to have on UK society. What we saw subsequently was an
alarming increase in the use of the drug. As someone who has worked in
the pharmaceutical industry, I should say that these drugs have not
been subjected to any safety assessment. They have come straight from a
chemistry lab on to a website. That is potentially very
dangerous.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000197">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We measured
the societal harm of mephedrone in terms of what I was saying before:
that it was creating a whole new class of psychoactive drug users,
among people who were quite prepared to buy the legal drug but would
never dream of going down the back street to the illicit drug dealer
and buying cocaine or heroin. That is a societal harm, as very often
those people have got into the regular habit of using a psychoactive
drug. The next stage is that they cannot do without it. Societal harm
is very hard to assess in the short space of time we have available
nowadays, but we can make some informed
guesses.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000198">&#160;</a>

Iverson, I was interested in your comment that the Misuse of Drugs Act

particular problem that has arisen and, to be fair, I think it will be
an improvement. Given what we have been talking about—the role
of local authorities, the link with alcohol, the fact that the Act is
40 years old, the fact that something else will no doubt arise, the
need for public education and all the other issues, such as the change
of composition of the ACMD—do you think there is a need for a
broader look at the whole area of drugs legislation? This proposal may
be a welcome improvement, but it is a sticking plaster for one
particular aspect of the problem. There is a broader issue about what

                           </em> We have done it three times in the last
decade. You will remember that cannabis went from B to C and
the newspapers predicted that there would be an explosion of cannabis
use. Then it went back from C to B. If you look at the Home
Office crime survey statistics, which include drug use, you will see a
steady decline from 2000 to now in the declared use of cannabis. That
very steady decline is statistically highly significant and there is
not the slightest blip in that graph when it goes from B to C or C to
B. It is as if cannabis users either do not know or do not care. So we
need something other than criminal sanctions or in addition to criminal
sanctions.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000210">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The advisory
council does not deal just with class A, B and C recommendations. We
have had a number of working parties, including the “Pathways to
Problems” working group, which looked at the social aspects of
why young people get into drug use, usually through alcohol and
nicotine—the usual progression. We have also had a much wider
brief in alerting the public to the hazards of injectable drug use,
initially in terms of HIV/AIDS and subsequently and more recently, in
terms of hepatitis C. These are public health warnings, if you like. I
hope you do not have the impression that we are just sitting round
dealing with temporary class drug orders and classes A, B and
C.<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000211">&#160;</a>

effectively last for a year. Is that a sensible time frame? Do you

                           </em> That is a very good question. It is
something that we worry about. The onus will be on the advisory council
to conduct a review and produce some sort of recommendation. If you ask
the Home Office lawyers, they say, “It takes us six months to
enact the legislation so you’ve only got six months.” But
they showed in April this year that they can do it in about

right. I hope that the 12 months will not be too prescriptive. It
should be capable of being negotiated if the advisory council feels
that we need more

                           </strong> Professor Iverson, do you accept that the
criminal law can be an important way of directing patterns of
behaviour? We are looking at the temporary class drug order.
The experience of mephedrone suggested that because it was legal,
people equated that in some way with safety. There are issues as to how
people might view a drug. Do you think having the legal element there
acts as a stimulus to how people
behave?<a class="bkMark" name="11012052000214">&#160;</a>

                           </em> You are quite right that I overstated my
case a few minutes ago in saying that imposing criminal sanctions has
no effect. Of course it has an effect. As we said in the case of
mephedrone, whether a drug is legal has a major impact on large
classes, particularly of younger people, who would not want to take an
illegal drug. I suppose what I am criticising is the classification
system. Classes A, B and C tend to get blurred. Perhaps another look at
that system at some stage is needed, but that is not part of the
present
