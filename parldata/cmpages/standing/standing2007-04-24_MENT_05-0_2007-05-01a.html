							<b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD):
						I thought
over the weekend that we could perhaps rename the Bill &#147;Mental
Health (Fear of Psychiatrists) Bill&#148;, because amendment No. 59
is largely about what we fear psychiatrists might do, and what
psychiatrists fear that other psychiatrists might do, which is to
incarcerate individuals to vex and/or neglect them under the loosely
worded phrase &#147;appropriate treatment&#148;. The question
whether the fear of psychiatrists is a diagnosable phobia or a rational
suspicion also crossed my mind.</div>
					<a name="07050155000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the Lords&#146;
proposed amendment to the Mental Health Act 1983 would not strike out
&#147;appropriate treatment&#148;, it would define it as treatment
that is</div>
					<a name="07050155000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;likely to
alleviate or prevent a
deterioration&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">of a
condition. &#147;Appropriate treatment&#148; is seen simply as a
wider category; the proposed amendment seeks to narrow it
down.</div>
					<a name="07050155000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">From what I
have been able to gather, simple &#147;appropriate treatment&#148;
and treatment that is</div>
					<a name="07050155000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;likely to alleviate or prevent a
deterioration in&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>
					<a name="07050155000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">a condition are seen as different by those
on the two sides of the argument. Most accept that any treatment that
alleviates is appropriate, but that the converse does not follow. There
are two main reasons for that. First, &#147;appropriate
treatment&#148; may fall short of &#147;alleviating
treatment&#148; or treatment that prevents the worsening of a
condition; secondly, the reservation on the other side of the argument
is that &#147;appropriate treatment&#148; cannot always be
guaranteed to alleviate. The Mental Health Alliance argues that if
appropriate treatment falls short of being alleviating treatment, it
will lead to detention without therapy, medical purpose and, therefore,
justification. That is a strong and robust argument.</div>
					<a name="07050155000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Department of Health,
citing various examples, argues that if guaranteed treatment cannot be
offered, no treatment can be offered to those who otherwise meet the
criteria for compulsory treatment. I can cite one example myself. There
is a lad in my constituency who was knocked down by a police car that
was travelling at 70 mph. He would normally have died. He recovered,
but with significant brain impairment that left him without any real
sense of responsibility. There is effectively no treatment available to
him&#151;nothing that anyone can identify as a cure. The
manifestations of the impairment in his behaviour so far are that he
has endeavoured to set his family home on fire, exposed himself on a
train, jumped out of a top floor window and a range of other
things.</div>
					<a name="07050155000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
personally written to all of the agencies concerned with his care,
including the probation service, to ask what can conceivably be done.
They have responded by holding various case conferences, but it is not
obvious that anything can be done. I have had to say as much to his
father, and to write to everybody concerned to say that if something
happens, it will be of a severe nature and that I suspect that the
forces of law and order will necessarily and unfortunately be involved.
Cases such as that have to be addressed by those on both sides of the
debate.</div>
					<a name="07050155000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both sides
have made strong and seemingly opposite cases. The Lords&#146;
amendment is effectively in line with the 1983 Act and the treatability
test, although I accept that some would like to see that strengthened
substantially. On the other hand, the Department of Health argues that
untreatable patients are refused treatment not because they are
untreatable, but because they are treated as untreatable. That is one
of the arguments that the Department gives for its position, but it is
a slightly weak argument, because it is not against the test itself; it
is an argument against the application and interpretation of the test
and for better-trained psychiatrists, and it illustrates once more the
general fear of psychiatrists.</div>
					<a name="07050155000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Department of Health also argues that not all appropriate treatments
immediately alleviate or prevent the worsening of a condition; that
when a person is sectioned, they may deteriorate rather than improve.
That is also a weak argument. Many physical treatments have exactly
similar effects. Chemotherapy, for example, does not produce immediate
improvements&#151;treatments should be judged over the long
term.</div>
					<a name="07050155000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
supporters of the amendment have suggested that the Government&#146;s
definition of appropriate treatment includes things such as nursing
care, rehabilitation, symptom mitigation and so on, which apparently
fall short of the expected standard. However, in other fields 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>such treatments are all that is available for chronic conditions. In
physical medicine, palliative treatment is a defensible medical
activity in all circumstances. Fundamentally, do we not all have a
difficulty in describing a treatment that is not likely to alleviate or
prevent a condition worsening as medical care? What would that sort of
medical care look like? It is not obvious that it would be medical care
at all and would, therefore, not pass muster as far as the Government
are concerned. My guess is that the two sides are not as far apart as
it seems, although they differ markedly in how they feel psychiatrists
would use the legislation and the alternative
wordings.</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two further considerations that slightly muddy the water. The
Mental Health Act 1983, which we have lived with for 24 years, contains
different concepts of treatment. For urgent treatment, the standard is
reduced to what is acceptable. The Scottish legislation, which is
praised by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, allows treatment to deal
with the effects of a disorder. That is a very broad categorisation.
The narrowness of the gap between the two sides, together with the
variations in the discussion of treatment, suggests that one could, and
possibly should, believe that an acceptable compromise can be
reached.</div>

						<a name="07050155000408"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I am following the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument with great interest and care. Does he agree
that one of the difficulties&#151;which may be suppressed and not
always made explicit in the argument&#151;is that different
professionals may have a view on the treatability of an individual, but
feel that their professional reputation would be at risk if they sought
to treat, or claimed to be treating somebody, and there was no
improvement in that person&#146;s condition? Does that not further
complicate the
issue?</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000409"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> I agree, if that is empirically the case. The
interesting thing about the debate that we had on impairment is that we
all believed, and the psychiatrist said, that when applying the concept
of impairment to an individual, the same conclusion would be reached by
everybody. It is not obvious to me that they should not equally come up
with the same conclusions when applying a concept of treatability. Why
would they come up with different conclusions in the one case and not
the other?</div>
					<a name="07050155000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given my
belief that there is scope for some kind of dialogue, as opposed to
mutual campaigning against each other, I found the amendment tabled by
the hon. Member for Rhondda fairly helpful. I did not agree with it
wholeheartedly, but he tried to define legitimate
treatment&#151;treatment that is the basis for some degree of
coercion&#151; as having the intention of alleviating rather than
being &#147;likely to alleviate&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07050155000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Unfortunately
he is not here, but he was endeavouring to lower the bar as to the
treatments that are permissible, while seeking to outlaw anything that
cannot reasonably be expected to be efficacious. He was challenged by
my very acute colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey, on
precisely that point. He said
that</div>
					<a name="07050155000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;intention
must always include an element of likelihood, although likelihood is
not predominant... There is always an element of likelihood in any
degree of intention&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Mental Health Public Bill Committee, </i>26 April 2007; c.

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>
					<a name="07050155000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I guess he was saying that one cannot
honestly intend something that one has no reason to expect. The Liberal
Democrats, of course, intend to form a Government soon, which implies
that we have a reasonable expectation of doing so. To be wholly
acceptable to anybody, his amendment must explicitly incorporate the
concept of reasonable
expectation.</div>
					<a name="07050155000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Another
change that would help to move things forward in a positive way is to
incorporate a care plan, and a review of it, for anybody who is subject
to coercive treatment, as found in the Mental Health (Care and
Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. That would spell out what was to be
done and how it was to be monitored and evaluated, and could be the
basis for an appeal. There is further debate to be had&#151;this is a
big
issue.</div>

						<a name="07050155000410"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): In a genuine spirit of
considering the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about whether there is a
middle ground, I note that in the Mental Health Act 1983 treatability
is a test for two conditions, but not for two others. If we were to
return to focusing on benefit to the patient as the overriding aim,
rather than treatment that alleviates or prevents a deterioration in a
condition, might that be a potential way to reach the sort of
compromise about which the hon. Gentleman is
talking?</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000411"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> That certainly demands looking at, and we should
examine the 1983 Act further to see exactly what it says. Many of the
criticisms that I make of the Bill are also criticisms of the 1983
Act.</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000412"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b>
						I wish to take up the helpful
suggestion made by the hon. Member for Stafford and draw on the
concepts and principles of the Mental CapacityAct 2005, in
which the best interests principle is paramount, although not
exclusive. I do not wish to muddy the waters further, but the
suggestion that the action taken should be for the benefit of the
patient seems a reasonable filter against unreasonable
action.</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000413"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b>
						Well, again, I agree. It is
unfortunate that the Government did not accept statements to that
effect as a preamble to the Act or as a statement of principles. Had
they embodied a statement of principles right at the start, many of the
difficulties that we are now in would have been avoided. It is a big,
complex
issue.</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07050155000414"></a>
							<b class="B">Ann
Coffey</b> (Stockport) (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman agree
that there is also an element of confusion? When we talk about medical
treatment we have an idea of what it is&#151;basically medication for
illness. That is why a comparison is often drawn between treatment for
a mental disorder and treatment for a physical ailment. However, in the
1983 Act the definition of medical treatment is quite wide and includes
psychological treatment. Further down the line, that will probably
bring us to a debate aboutthe definition of a responsible
clinician, but I imagine that for a certain group of people a
psychological intervention can be more helpful than one based on
medication. The situation adds to the confusion about what the
treatment is designed to alleviate, because we necessarily make a
comparison with physical illnesses.</div>

							<a name="07050155000415"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b>
						We are unravelling a further level
of complexity that is well worth going into. Part of the problem is
that when people think of treatment for psychiatric patients, they
almost invariably think of medication or, worse still, surgically
invasive techniques of one kind or another. That has by and large been
the history of dealing with the more drastic cases confronting
psychiatrists.</div>
					<a name="07050155000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the complexity of the issue, which we have touched on and which has
been widely accepted in the Committee, I do not believe that it will be
resolved simply by the Government&#146;s gainsaying or reversing the
Lords amendments. The reasons that they have given for doing so are not
as persuasive as they ought to be for such a radical
move.</div>

&#147;Ah.&#148;] Wait for it. I fear that I am the only Opposition
member of the Committee from the 1997 intake, but the message of the
1997 election has never been more appropriate&#151;&#147;Things can
only get
better&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07050155000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
clause is one of the most crucial parts of the Bill on
therapeutic benefit, which was the key to the 1983 Act and has been
described as the linchpin of the way in which we apply medical
treatment provisions. When the then Under-Secretary of State for the
Department of Health and Social Security, Lord Elton, introduced the
Bill that became the 1983 Act, he stated that if he were asked to list
briefly the most important and beneficial provisions in the Bill, they
would be the requirement that except in particular
circumstances&#151;by which he was referring to learning
disabilities&#151;people should not be admitted to detention for
treatment in hospital if their condition was not
treatable.</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000371"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="07050155000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under section 3
of the Act, reasons for admission for treatment were classed in three
categories:</div>
					<a name="07050155000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;He
is suffering from mental illness, severe mental impairment,
psychopathic disorder or mental impairment and his mental disorder is
of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to receive
medical treatment in a hospital;
and</div>
					<a name="07050155000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) in the case of
psychopathic disorder or mental impairment, such treatment is likely to
alleviate or prevent a deterioration of his condition;
and</div>
					<a name="07050155000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) it is necessary for the
health or safety of the patient or for the protection of other persons
that he should receive such treatment and it cannot be provided unless
he is detained under this
section.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i>
That definition was all-encompassing for the protection of the
individual and for the safety of the public. It is for the Government
to make a case that those treatability criteria are no longer
appropriate. The burden of proof is on the Government to make the case
for changing what was in the 1983 Act, which has served us well in the
past 24
years.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Kidney</b>
							<b class="B">:</b>
						 I am sorry to shout at the hon. Gentleman
from a sedentary position. He said that the provision in the 1983 Act
was for the health or safety and the protection of other persons; I
point out that the Act actually said,</div>
					<a name="07050155000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or the protection of other
persons.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>
					<a name="07050155000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman is suggesting
that treatability is a test and that the Government are taking it away,
but his reading of the 1983 Act has just told us that treatability is a
test in the case of mental impairment or a psychotic condition, but not
for a mental disorder or a severe mental impairment. The present
position is balanced 50:50; surely he should make the case for
extending treatability to the other
classes.</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000418"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman misheard me or
if I misread the quote. The Act certainly says &#147;or&#148;, so I
was not trying to make any other case.</div>
					<a name="07050155000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government are trying to
make the legislation and it is for them to make the case. We will come
to the treatment of people with personality disorders later in the
Bill. The number of people subject to sectioning hit a record high last
year, so it is not as if people are falling through the net under the
existing legislation. More than 47,000 people were subject to
sectioning, which is nearly double the figure of 10 years ago. Of those
47,000, 20,000 were sectioned after voluntary admission to a hospital.
If the Government were saying that a whole load of people have escaped
who should have been sectioned for their own protection or that of the
public, they would have a stronger case, but the reverse has been true.
That is why I say that the onus of proof is on the Government to show
the need for what we think is such a drastic change. It has
implications not only for the mental health field but for the way in
which all health practitioners deal with their patients.</div>
					<a name="07050155000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">To remove the treatability
requirement, whatever the Government&#146;s intentions, is to permit
indefinite preventive detention and to change the law from a health
measure to one of social control. To remove a therapeutic benefit test
is to penalise and stigmatise the large number of mental health
patients who pose no threat to anyone other than themselves, in order
to ensure that a small minority who are dangerous but untreatable are
kept under lock and key. The Government have in mind a small group of
people, but there is nothing in the Bill to ensure that the provisions
are applied only to that small group. It is a classic example of hard
cases making bad
law.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000419"></a>Ann
Coffey:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has just said that the
provisions will mean that some people who are not a danger to
themselves or others will end up in detention, but he must accept that
the test of whether a person is a risk to themselves or others should
remain in the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000420"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> Yes, but the net has widened greatly. The terms
under which somebody can be taken into detention have widened. Perhaps
more damagingly, the impression and perceptions given to people mean
that they will now not present, on the basis that they could quickly
and easily become subject to a compulsory form of treatment rather than
a voluntary one. That is why the fears that many of us who are involved
with the Mental Health Alliance&#151;particularly those from black
and minority ethnic communities&#151;have about this part of the Bill
are so much greater than our concerns about other
parts.</div>

							<a name="07050155000421"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Ms Rosie
Winterton):
						</b> The hon. Gentleman talks about people not
presenting. Does he not accept that people with personality disorders
for which treatment is available are deterred from presenting
themselves if they continually receive from the mental health services
the message that they are untreatable? We know that that happens at the
moment; it is what the change that we are trying to bring about is
intended to overcome.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000422"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> The Minister has got to get her line straight.
In a speech a few months ago, her own mental health tsar said that
personality disorders could now be treated much more easily, and that
people would not be shrugged off and told, &#147;We cannot treat you,
so go away.&#148; The Lords amendments entail there being as wide a
remit as possible&#151;if treatment is available, people can be
subject to the order whether or not they agree to it. The
Minister&#146;s apocryphal story, which has not been backed up by any
of the experts to whom we have spoken, about lawyers hawking their
wares around Broadmoor and advising clients to refuse treatment on the
basis that they make themselves untreatable and can therefore do a
quick flit, does not apply. So long as the treatment is available in
Broadmoor, or wherever else they might be, it will be possible to
detain them under the terms of the Lords amendments. The scenario of
which the Minister warns does not apply.</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000423"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> The good news reported by the mental health tsar
is that there is a diminishing population of persons who are not going
to be given treatment. Does my hon. Friend agree that it automatically
follows from that that the population of people who would be covered by
the Government amendment will diminish year on year? If there has not
been a problem under the 1983 Act, except in one or two notorious
cases, why is there any suggestion that there should be a greater
problem under this legislation before it is amended by the
Government?</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000424"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> My hon. Friend is right. This is a diminishing
problem, thanks to the increasing availability of treatment. I received
a ministerial reply the other day about the number of people who would
be classified as having dangerous and severe personality disorder. It
is small compared with the number of people suffering from some form of
mental illness, the vast majority of whom are already subject to other
restraining orders.</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000425"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I just want to find out exactly where the
Opposition are coming from. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument is
that medical treatment must be available to suit the needs and
circumstances of the individual. That is a high test. However, he seems
to be saying that somebody who refuses to engage with psychological
treatment should no longer be in Broadmoor even if he poses a threat to
himself or others. Is he saying that somebody who makes himself
untreatable cannot be detained? I do not understand why he made the
comparison with people in Broadmoor. Can he
explain?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000426"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> It is a bit difficult to explain, because I am
not entirely sure what the question was. My point about the Lords
amendments was that &#147;appropriate treatment&#148; is the phrase
that the Government wanted to add. In the Lords, there was a great deal
of compromise to try to accommodate the Government. There was almost a
middle way, but in the end the Government did not go far enough. The
point is that appropriate medical treatment, which the Government are
trying to add to the 1983 Act, is available to the individual. It is
not that it will definitely work for him&#151;we know that there is a
balance of possibilities and probabilities&#151;or that it is likely
to work for him, but that it is available to him. That is the
Government&#146;s duty. If the Government are running the health
service properly, they have a duty to ensure that where treatment is
possible&#151;be it in physical or mental health&#151;it is
available. On that basis, the person who is in Broadmoor because
professional clinicians think that he should be will remain
there&#151;so long as all the criteria apply for keeping him
there&#151;whether or not he agrees to be treated, on the basis that
treatability is satisfied because the treatment is
available.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000427"></a>Ann
Coffey:
						</b> I want to go back to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
statement of widening the net, which takes into account some of the
recent discussion. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the effects and
symptoms of personality disorders can be improved by psychological
interventions, which is why we have got a definition of medical
treatment that includes psychological intervention? Why does he think
that it is a bad thing for people who have personality disorders, which
can be alleviated, helped or treated by psychological interventions and
who are a danger to themselves and to others, not to be
detained?</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000428"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> The answer to the first part of the hon.
Lady&#146;s question is yes. Clearly, all sorts of treatment
exist&#151;other than drugs or conventional psychiatric
treatment&#151;that can be deemed to alleviate or to contain
symptoms, and that includes psychological therapies. However, our point
is that this widening of the net which, whatever the Government say, is
a widening of the net and is very much perceived as that, is predicated
on a community of people with dangerous and severe personality
disorders, which amounts to 2,000 to 2,500 individuals in the prison
population, and some outside. This coercive legislation is being
targeted at an enormous constituency of people, based on the problems
that we may or may not have with a few thousand people with severe
personality disorders.</div>
					<a name="07050155000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that the Government
should apply separate legislation for those people that is not based on
a health legislation requirement because there is not automatically a
health benefit in every case. The pre-legislative scrutiny Committee
said that people with severe personality disorders are not an easy
constituency to deal with, and that they should be dealt with by Home
Office legislation. In order to contain them for crimes and offences
that they have not committed, and for dangers that they have not shown,
there should be a Home Office rather than a health measure, which has
an obvious therapeutic benefit.</div>

who are not necessarily a danger to other people, but who may be
self-harming and suicidal because of the terrible time that they have
had in their lives. They may have suffered physical, emotional or
sexual abuse. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that those people are
dealt with under Home Office legislation. How stigmatising and
discriminatory is that? I find it extraordinary that the hon. Gentleman
and Opposition Members could be going down that line. I would like to
know what would be in that legislation, which would take a particular
group of people with a personality disorder and legislate separately
for them in the Home Office. That is
amazing.</div>

					<a name="07050155000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						This will
happen on the basis of how one deals with a small number of people with
a severe personality disorder. The entire community of people with all
grades of mental illness, who would not necessarily have been caught in
this net before, will be highly stigmatised under the Minister&#146;s

						</b> I was only interested in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s opinion of psychiatrists. Does he believe that we
need to be protected from psychiatrists because left to their own
devices or under this legislation they will incarcerate hundreds of us
at a moment&#146;s
notice?</div>
					
					<a name="07050155000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000440"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> Perhaps it was a bit foolish to give way to
that. Of course we do not need to protect ourselves against
psychiatrists, but what psychiatrists and other mental health
professionals need more than ever is clarity from the legislation about
how they can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>deal with their patients. They need to know the parameters so that their
decisions will not constantly be hauled up in front of courts or mental
health tribunals and challenged. They need to know the limits of what
they can
do.</div>
				
					<a name="07050155000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also the safety first
danger: certain professionals will always seek the safer option of
subjecting people to some form of sectioning on the basis that if they
do not and their judgment subsequently turns out to have underestimated
the danger a person posed, they would carry the can. We need a balance,
and we need professionals to be able to exercise that balance. The
implications of what is being proposed, however, will drive people away
from contact with mental health services in the first place. The
professionals will not be in a position to make that balanced judgment
because people will have gone underground. That is our biggest fear of
all.</div>
					<a name="07050155000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
extending the net, the Mental Health Alliance
states:</div>
					<a name="07050155000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
scope of the appropriate test, being wider than the treatability test,
will bring within reach of compulsion many people who are not within
the current Act and should not be. Indeed the effect of placing this
test in the 1983 Act is to broaden it even further than in the 2004
Bill which had a higher threshold for admission to compulsory powers
for people at harm to themselves than does the amended 1983
Act.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society has
also
commented:</div>
					<a name="07050155000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
a matter of medical and legal ethics, mental health law should not be
used to lock people away because they are perceived to be dangerous but
for whom no beneficial treatment can be found. That is the province of
criminal law.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
the point that I was making just now. The Government&#146;s
appropriate treatment test, on its own and as it was before the
amendments were added in the Lords, is so vague that it gives almost
unlimited powers to clinicians and too little basis for a legal
challenge against a person&#146;s detention. That would be the field
day for lawyers and clinicians at tribunal hearings that the Minister
is always warning us about.</div>
					<a name="07050155000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Lords did
not try to wreck this part of the Bill. They endeavoured to find a
common way of proceeding and some compromise with the Government. Hence
the incorporation of the term &#147;appropriate treatment&#148;,
which was not originally envisaged by those opposed to what the
Government were trying to do. They want to keep the treatability test
for therapeutic benefit, but it becomes a test of what is appropriate
medical treatment that is available to the patient. It combines a
therapeutic benefit test with the Government&#146;s appropriate
treatment test. Those patients who refuse to accept treatment will now
still be covered, so the Broadmoor escapee test, which the Minister
keeps imposing on us, is catered for as well
there.</div>
					<a name="07050155000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Contrary to
what the Government allege, the test does not require a prediction that
a particular outcome will be achieved for the patient; it simply
requires a likelihood that the situation will improve or that the
deterioration will be prevented, which includes any symptoms of the
condition. It does not need to address the underlying disorder. I think
that that is a point that Lord Warner failed to grasp during the debate
in the House of Lords. A memorandum submitted by the Royal College of
Psychiatrists said that</div>
					<a name="07050155000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this level of predictability is
not so different from physical health and is no barrier to
detention.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>
					<a name="07050155000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Warner admitted in Committee in
another place that this is a less onerous test to satisfy than the
therapeutic benefit test that was proposed by the Mental Health
Alliance in its evidence to the joint scrutiny Committee. The
appropriate treatment test must be understood together with the new and
broad definition of medical treatment in the Bill. As the hon. Member
for Stockport said, medical treatment includes nursing, psychological
intervention, specialist mental health rehabilitation and
care.</div>
					<a name="07050155000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
move on to the treatability of people with personality disorder. Until
the development of psychological therapies, it was difficult to treat
people with personality disorders, because the services were not in
place. We have moved on a long way in the past 24 years, hence the need
for the Bill. Professor Lewis Appleby, in a recent speech that I
alluded to earlier, acknowledged that there is now evidence that many
people with a personality disorder can be treated and that the
appropriate services are now being developed. He has referred to the
fact that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is
considering turning the evidence into clinical guidelines. So it is a
shrinking constituency of people who pose a problem in this
matter.</div>
					<a name="07050155000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Joint Committee on Human Rights looked at this part of the Bill, it
said that just
as</div>
					<a name="07050155000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Joint
Scrutiny Committee concluded that a proper test of therapeutic benefit
was an essential component of the
law&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07050155000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">the JCHR criticised
the breadth of the test too. I should like to quote its original
comments on the draft proposals:</div>
					<a name="07050155000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whatever this
Government&#146;s intention, the wide definition of &#145;medical
treatment&#146; in the draft Bill would allow people to be detained
where the only treatment that could be offered was &#145;care&#146;
under the supervision of an approved clinician. The draft Bill does
not, in terms, say that the powers could be used only where
professionals believed that they could offer effective treatment in the
wider sense of a therapeutic programme with a reasonable chance of
mitigating the patient&#146;s
condition.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
recently, the Committee&#146;s report said
that</div>
					<a name="07050155000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
consider that the principal legitimate aim for which medical treatment
may be imposed under Article 8(2) is health, even if incidental
purposes may be the prevention of crime or the protection of the rights
and freedoms of
others.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a problem with the Government&#146;s approach. The Minister has
spoken before about the treatment-resistant patient. The Committee also
stated:</div>
					<a name="07050155000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
inherently unethical to permit people to be detained in hospital or to
otherwise have their lives controlled, because of their ill health or
their personality, when they do not obtain any benefit from

defensible for a Government to be able to say in response to Human
Rights Act challenges that mental health is one thing and is covered by
the mental health legislation, but that if there are cases that are not
treatable they are covered by discrete legislation that deals with them

their liberty or to force treatment on them against their will although
they have not committed an act that would be punishable in law at
present, it must be under Home Office legislation, which is subject to
judicial process. It must be for us, as parliamentary legislators, to
debate on the basis of Home Office legislation, rather than of
therapeutic benefit under Department of Health legislation. The hon.
Gentleman and I will concur on that conclusion, which the joint
pre-legislative scrutiny Committee came to without necessarily having
stipulated how it would be done. The principle of how it should be done
was clearly set down and we need to debate it, but we should not muddy
the waters by trying to raise the threshold for everybody with some

						I support my hon.
Friend&#146;s point about therapeutic benefit. Indeed, that is why it
is a condition in the Scottish legislation. The Minister prayed in aid
a conversation with Dr. Juli Crocombe, whom I visited on behalf of the
National Autistic Society. It is the case that there are people with
autism and Asperger&#146;s syndrome who need to be detained. However,
for those cases and, indeed, the one that the Minister referred to in
an earlier sitting about a person suffering from Asperger&#146;s
syndrome who lit what she described as little fires, the court would be
muddled about which disposal to take. If the due process of law has
been carried out in a potential criminal offence, the courts still have
the option of where to dispose of the person in question, whether it is
into the criminal justice system or a hospital. If therapeutic benefit
was outlined in the Bill, it would clarify the law and make it easier
for
doctors.</div>

59 has some attraction for us. I was slightly disappointed that the
Minister said in passing that she would have a look at it without, I
fear, attaching much optimism to that comment. The insertion of
&#147;intended to&#148;, as the hon. Member for Bridgend said,

						</b> Or chinchilla, as the hon. Member for Rhondda
said in one of his more amusing moments last Thursday. It would be
useful if the Minister could tell us formally whether she thinks that
that is a helpful amendment. If so, and if she is prepared to add
wording that will give extra assurances that the legislation on
sectioning intends to cover therapeutic benefit, that will give a great
deal of reassurance to all those who are so concerned about where this
legislation is going. It could be a basis for compromise.</div>
					<a name="07050155000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If
&#147;appropriate treatment&#148; were to become &#147;treatment
intended to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the
condition&#148;, that would be as close to keeping a therapeutic
benefit in the Bill as we could hope for. It would be no good if it
were to rely on the subjective view of a clinician, but it would be
acceptable if it were to introduce an evidence base. That would go some
way towards providing reassurance.</div>
					<a name="07050155000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have taken many
interventions, so this has been a longer debate than we intended, but I
have tried toset out why it is fundamental to the Bill to
retain the Lords amendments. They went a long way towards accommodating
the Government&#146;s position, and one of their key elements was to
retain a therapeutic benefit. If the Government cannot agree to that,
but are intent on overturning those amendments and going back to the
status quo ante, we cannot possibly accept that. However, if the hon.
Member for Rhondda or, in his absence, his colleagues are minded to
move amendment No. 59, we would like to give that the benefit of the
doubt as being a good
compromise.</div>

					<a name="07050155000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a desire to move on
from clause 5, because we still have a lot to discuss. I just want to
make a couple of points. I emphasise again the problem that has arisen
as a result of the treatability test. It has led to a culture in the
development of mental health services that has effectively excluded a
number of people from benefiting from the treatment they need. We have
talked a lot about personality disorders, but I go back to my meeting
with the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton and the psychiatrists she
brought along who specialised in learning disability and autism. One of
the things that emerged from that meeting was that many people with
autism have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>told that they are untreatable and have been turned away from services.
We want to change that. We want to do that by removing the treatability
test.</div>
					<a name="07050155000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
reassurance that I want to give challenges the assertion that the term
&#147;appropriate treatment&#148; is too vague. The
Government&#146;s proposed test is not merely that appropriate
medical treatment is available. It goes on to make clear what has to be
taken into account, namely</div>
					<a name="07050155000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;treatment which is appropriate in
his case, taking into account the nature and degree of the mental
disorder and all other circumstances of his
case.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear that
the treatment has to be there and it has to be appropriate to the
individual.</div>

							<a name="07050155000476"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> Entirely in the spirit of the Committee&#146;s
concern to make progress, would the Minister like to tell us whether
the &#147;all other circumstances&#148; are medically relevant
circumstances or anything
else?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000477"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Some of them might well be social
circumstances. The individual clinician might want to look at the
patient and decide what is appropriate for them in their particular
circumstances. It is about what has led the individual to have a mental
disorder and whether anything needs to be done to address those causes.
It is about taking a clear view of the individual&#146;s needs and
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07050155000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
official Opposition have suggested that we have a Home Office Bill to
deal with people who have personality disorders who have not committed
an offence. If the implication is that they do not require medical
treatment, I would challenge that and say that it goes completely
against the grain of what we are trying to achieve in the Bill, which
is to ensure that appropriate medical treatment is available for people
with personality disorders and other disorders. I am taken aback by the
idea that this should become Home Office legislation.</div>
					<a name="07050155000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition suggest that
amendment No. 59 could provide the possible basis for a compromise. The
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked me to be a bit more
forthcoming after my earlier comments. I absolutely agree that
amending</div>
					<a name="07050155000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;likely to

					<a name="07050155000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
&#147;intended&#148; to do so, copes with some of the perverse
incentives that we believe are there, particularly the possibility of
patients saying that they are untreatable and asking to be released by
tribunals.</div>
					<a name="07050155000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
potential drawbacks, which is why I ask the Committee to bear with me.
I cannot support the amendment, but I have said that I will be prepared
to reconsider the matter. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda
acknowledged, the amendment would not in its current form make explicit
the fact that treatment can be for the symptoms or the effects of a
disorder on a person&#146;s thinking, behaviour and so on, as well as
directly for the underlying disorder. For example, it might not be
possible to cure a personality disorder, but treatment can control the
extent to which it leads to self-harm or violence. It is important to
get that
right.</div>

						In the case of somebody with

person. The effect would be that she stops eating as a result. We want

deal with the symptom&#151;what is happening to the individual and
what they feel&#151;but also with the effect of that feeling, in this

						Where does the Minister stand
on containment being seen as treatment in respect of personality
disorders? The evidence in the briefing that we have all received from
Professor Nigel Eastman, professor of law and ethics in psychiatry at
the university of London and consultant forensic psychiatrist
atSt. George&#146;s hospital,
states:</div>
					<a name="07050155000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Because
personality disorder is a &#145;whole person&#146; disorder, it can
easily be suggested therefore by those in favour of using mental health
legislation&#148;&#151;</div>

							<a name="07050155000483"></a>Ms

						</b>
						I believe that the hon. Lady
refers to the debate in the House of Lords, in which it was stated that
appropriate medical treatment could consist of nothing more than
containment of a patient in hospital. We disagree with that. Simply
detaining someone in hospital is no more treatment than detaining them
in prison.</div>
					<a name="07050155000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer the
hon. Lady to the case of Hutchison Reid, in which the House of Lords
considered the treatability test and sensibly observed that the meaning
of medical treatment under the 1983 Act was wide enough to cover cure
or containment of a patient&#146;s mental disorder or its symptoms.
The Lords did not say that containing a patient&#151;simply detaining
someone in hospital&#151;was treatment; nor do we, and nor does the
Bill. If the court had said that, the treatability test, which the
Opposition want to retain, would allow such treatment.</div>
					<a name="07050155000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point relates to a
matter that the hon. Lady raised. The amendment would not require that
treatment be appropriate to the individual patient&#146;s overall
circumstances, and we want to ensure that a holistic view of the
patient is taken and that the treatment is individually
based.</div>

Pugh:

						I do not want to spoil the
Minister&#146;s flow, but she is moving away from a previous point,
and I want briefly to return to it. One of the better arguments 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>identified by the Government was the case of an engineered refusal, in
which a person tries to engineer their release by claiming that they
will not co-operate with treatment. The Government view was that if
they refused and there was appropriate treatment available, they should
stay; the view in the Lords was that if there was a refusal and there
was appropriate treatment that was likely to alleviate or to prevent a
worsening of symptoms, they should also stay. They amount to the same
thing unless a court judged that were a patient not to co-operate it
could not plausibly be claimed that the treatment was likely to
alleviate or stop the worsening of symptoms. That is a fine legal
point; I do not know which way lawyers would judge it, but it would be
useful for the Committee to get as much independent advice as possible
on whether it can plausibly be claimed that where a patient refuses,
none the less treatment is available that is likely to improve their
condition.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000485"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on the
point. At present there is a perverse incentive for people not to
co-operate with treatment, as we argued earlier.</div>
					<a name="07050155000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I conclude my
remarks by making it clear that courts would not think that Parliament
meant two different things because the word &#147;purpose&#148; is
used elsewhere in the Act and not &#147;intention&#148;. There is a
delicate shade of difference between the two in that
&#147;intention&#148; might be read as more subjective than
&#147;purpose&#148;. If one were to say that the
&#147;purpose&#148; of the treatment should be to alleviate, to say
&#147;intention&#148; instead of &#147;purpose&#148; might be
considered weaker. I want to ensure that we have a very clear look at
that with a view to strengthening what my hon. Friends might want, not
in any sense weakening it. We do not want clinicians to be confused
because one part of the Act mentions &#147;purpose&#148; and
another &#147;intention&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07050155000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that reassures my
hon. Friends. I give them a clear steer that I am more than prepared to
look further at their amendment, which does not achieve everything that
they want. I hope that they will therefore support the Government
amendment.</div>

						</b>
						The Government oppose clause
6 standing part of the Bill. Our policy is to introduce
&#147;responsible clinicians&#148;, to bring the legislation in
line with current practice. We want to remove the rigid demarcation of
professional roles in favour of an approach that ensures that
clinicians with the right skills, expertise and training can use them.
If we can achieve that, frankly, we can reflect modern NHS practices,
which have moved more toward a competency-based approach to roles and
responsibilities.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>
					<a name="07050155000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to look at how
the work force has changed since 1983. Things were different in 1983 to
today. In 1983, the emphasis was on in-patient care and medication in
large mental hospitals. There was a greater focus on the medical model
of treatment, which meant that doctors made most of the decisions.
Since then, there has been a widely welcomed shift to psycho-social
interventions and more treatment in the community. Hon. Members on both
sides of the Committee have so far celebrated the fact that those kinds
of changes have taken place, and they have recognised in their
contributions the fact that patients have a wide range of needs that
require the specialist skills of the range of professionals on the
multi-disciplinary teams. As a result of the multi-disciplinary
approach, the professions, whether psychologists, nurses, occupational
therapists or social workers, have developed interventions. Those
professionals are taking on more functions and adopting leadership
roles. As I said, up until now, all hon. Members have celebrated
that.</div>

							<a name="07050155000530"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> It is right to say that we have increased the
ability of professionals to take on more responsibility, and that that
has led to an increase in the training. An example of that is the fact
that we now have nurse prescribing, something that was almost unthought
of when I was working for the Royal College of Nursing. Over time, we
have come to know that nurses and others can take on roles that they
would not have taken on before. The example of nurse prescribing is a
good one.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000531"></a>Ann
Coffey:
						</b> It is completely understandable why we should have
someone with medical training to oversee a course of treatment for
someone with schizophrenia, for example, which involves difficult
medication, with possible side effects. However, it is not easy to
understand why we would need someone with physical training to oversee
a course of treatment that involves intensive counselling given by
someone who has trained as a clinical
psychologist.</div>

Winterton:
						</b>
						My hon. Friend is absolutely
right. That is the position that we have been trying to get to via the
changes that we have made by generally developing roles among
professionals. I am thinking particularly of nurse consultants, whose
role did not exist in 1983. Today, a nurse consultant could be
responsible for a 14-bed in-patient rehabilitation unit, teaching,
providing clinical leadership and conducting research. Nurses,
occupational therapists and psychologists can manage multidisciplinary
teams or in-patient wards, or they can provide clinical care for a
patient. Social workers can often be care
co-ordinators.</div>

						When
we are talking about the Government&#146;s proposal regarding
responsible clinicians, I want to be absolutely clear that only highly
qualified and experienced mental health professionals will be able to
become approved to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>become responsible clinicians. It is worth reminding ourselves of the
type of people whom we are talking about. A disturbing attitude seems
to have evolved both in the other place and among Opposition Members
about the proposed changes&#151;I presume that Opposition Members
will be supporting them today&#151;around the view that we somehow
have to revert to a situation in which doctors take all the decisions.
After all the work that has been put in, in conjunction not only with
the Royal College of Psychiatrists, but with the other royal colleges
and professionals working in the field, there is an attitude that they
cannot be trusted to make such decisions. There is a real problem about
turning the clock back. We are trying to achieve new ways of working,
which we have spent many years developing, but the amendments inserted
in the House of Lords with the support of the Opposition turn the clock
back to a unacceptable state of affairs for those professionals, who,
frankly, feel that they have been slapped in the
face.</div>

					<a name="07050155000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within a
multidisciplinary team that is established to look after a patient, as
they are nowadays, the responsible clinician is the psychiatrist,
because the patient in those circumstances needs the kind of
intervention that my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport has talked
about. The effect of proposed paragraph (aa)(ii) is that if the
psychiatrist is not there, the responsible clinician in those
circumstances would have to go to somebody who was a doctor&#151;the
hon. Member for Southport is a doctor&#151;who may have no knowledge
whatever of the individual patient, because they have to consult
another approved, registered medical practitioner. That means that if
the person on the team who has been working with the individual cannot
go to the registered medical practitioner within the team, they will
have to go somewhere else. That means that somebody who has not been
involved with the care of the patient at all would have to be involved
and approving. It is the stamp of approval that Opposition Members are
endorsing that we find objectionable, because with the high standard of
approved mental health practitioners that we have talked about, we do
not see why it is necessary to consult another doctor in order for
detention to be renewed.</div>

surrounding the renewal of detention, the matter would rely on a
medical person, which is the point that we are making. Again, the
Minister has not answered my question. Why does she think it
acceptable, therefore, that the decision about the original detention
should be taken only by a medical person, but six months down the line,
when we are looking at a possible renewal of detention at a time when
it might be rather more difficult to form a judgment on
somebody&#146;s condition&#151;they might not be in the agitated
crisis state that they were in at the time of the original
detention&#151;it can be taken by someone else? Why is it appropriate
for a medical person to make the decision at the beginning of the
process, but not at the time of the renewal? That is the inconsistency
that the Minister must
address.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000540"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Not at all, because the medical practitioner is
more likely to be trained in making the original diagnosis. They will
have a broader training in that area. Let us examine what we are asking
the original medical practitioners to do. We are asking them to decide
whether somebody has a mental disorder. It may then fall to a
psychologist to talk about the treatment of that person. If that
treatment includes providing community treatment, it may fall to a
community psychiatric nurse, who is looking after the individual. That
point&#151;we are talking about the renewal of detention&#151;is
where we are saying that it is the psychologist, for example, or the
community psychiatric nurse, who will have been in contact with the
patient during that time and will surely be able to make a decision as
to whether detention should be renewed.</div>
					<a name="07050155000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the difference, because
we are talking about whether the treatment continues to be suitable
andnot about the original diagnosis, which is about
establishing whether somebody has a mental disorder. Opposition Members
are saying that when that treatment is under way with the psychologist
providing it, the psychologist must go back to a psychiatrist, but
under proposed paragraph (aa)(ii), if the psychiatrist is not on hand
in the multidisciplinary team, that person must go somewhere else. The
relevant words
are</div>

					<a name="07050155000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">An entirely new psychiatrist or
doctor would have to be brought in to examine a patient whom they may
have had nothing to do with. The Government believe that it is
important to trust the judgment of professionals. Let me say again how
highly qualified they are. To take away from them responsibilities that
we have tried to develop is, as I said, a slap in the face. For
example, the community psychiatric nurse whom Unison brought to see me

is to incorporate a range of professionals, it seems very odd to set
one criterion&#151;examination by a registered medical

responsibility without having to revert to a doctor who may have had
nothing to do with the individual.</div>

						The Minister said two
contradictory things. First, she said that the issue was about
treatment, which my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry pointed out was
not the case. Then she said it was about the renewal of detention,
which it is. Will she stop trying to impose a hierarchy on the matter?
As I have said, the person who comes first and who would normally be
expected to make the decision is the registered medical practitioner.
It is only if that person is not there that another medical
practitioner, who has not been closely involved, can be called in. That
practitioner can take advice from a whole range of other professionals.
Will the Minister acknowledge that after six months of compulsory
treatment, other medical conditions can arise&#151;perhaps resulting
from some of the drugs&#151;which makes a medical practitioner the
best person to decide whether detention should be renewed and in what
form?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000551"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> There may not be medical interventions if
somebody is not on medication. We have made it very clear that the
appropriate person is the one who is responsible for the treatment
course that somebody is undertaking. That is what distinguishes what
happens in the initial phase, which is detention, sometimes for
treatment but very often for assessment. The decision that has to be
made by the first two doctors is the broad diagnosis. It is then up to
individuals who are most experienced in that person&#146;s care to be
able to say, &#147;This is the experience over the past six months.
We believe that the appropriate treatment is still available because I
am administering that treatment. Therefore the treatment is
right.&#148; The psychologist is able to say, &#147;We have made
good progress.&#148; We need to recognise how teams work nowadays,
because there is a multidisciplinary rather than a one-person
approach.</div>
					<a name="07050155000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham mentioned clinical interventions.
In reality, the approach taken is to have multidisciplinary discussions
about the individual. Like everyone present, I would expect that any
physical side-effects, such as those from medication, say, would be
dealt with during those discussions. That does not mean that somebody
who is under detention and who is being looked after by a psychologist
is never considered by any other team member&#151;that is not how
practice operates, nor should it. The person to have responsibility
should be the person who is the most appropriate person for the
individual&#146;s needs; that is how psychological therapies and
increased incidence of prescribing by nurses have been
developed.</div>

I am sure that they want to that to happen, but if that is their honest

&#147;New Ways of Working&#148;, and we have involved the

subvert the new ways of team working, because clearly they are
sensible. However, let us consider the case of a patient who has been a
voluntary patient for a number of months and who has worked with a
number of professionals&#151;not necessarily a clinician or a
registered medical practitioner. It might have become apparent to the
other professionals or clinicians that that person needs detention.
What is the logic of the Minister&#146;s position that that detention
following a period of voluntary treatment must be approved by a
registered medical practitioner in the first instance, when on her own
analysis there might well be other people in the team who are more
familiar with the individual concerned and therefore in a better

					<a name="07050155000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
want to preserve the situation on initial diagnosis as it stands, and
we believe that our proposals provide a clear framework for what should
happen when someone is detained for the first time. There might be
instances in which someone has had no contact with mental health
services, and we believe that the broader diagnostic skills of a
medical practitioner should be brought into play in such cases. We want
to preserve that procedure in situations of voluntary treatment so that
there is consistency at the initial point of
diagnosis.</div>
					<a name="07050155000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s scenario, if a person had been having psychological
treatment and his condition had deteriorated to the extent that
detention was important, it would also be important to ensure that the
diagnosis was right. However, if it emerged thatthe person
giving the psychological treatment was the person who was going to be
in most contact with the patient, and that that person knew the
patient&#146;s needs and had reached the high standard that we have
set for being an approved professional in such circumstances, it would
be right for him to continue in that role and to undertake renewal of
detention if that were considered the most appropriate
course.</div>

Gidley:
						</b> In her opening remarks, the Minister made a strong
case for interdisciplinary working, and she mentioned consultant

that they do not have sufficient expertise to make the initial decision
on detention?</div>

							<a name="07050155000555"></a>Ms

						</b> I am saying that it is fair to ask whether that
person can make that detention. We considered the issue of voluntary
patients in the way that has been described. We also considered whether
we could allow the approved clinician to agree the initial detention
for voluntary patients. The problem was that that could lead to
difficulties in legislation, because there would be exceptions.
Therefore, we felt that it was better to keep the status quo in terms
of diagnosis, but beyond that to give greater powers and
responsibilities to the approved clinicians.</div>
					<a name="07050155000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon. Lady is going to
support us, she might wish to say that we have not gone far enough. We
would be open to that point. However, it is a bit of a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>reassurance to say that we will agree to keep the same system in respect
of the initial detention of people who have not previously been
voluntary patients. Beyond that, as legislators, what we can do is to
ensure that the legislation enables us to put into practice all that
the Committee is hoping for, including giving staff more responsibility
and the development of psychological therapies. We are trying to put
that into legislation so that the people who have spent years
developing new ways of working can have their just rewards.
Itis beyond me why the Opposition want to take that
away.</div>

takes the decision to commence compulsory detention or to continue it,
the criteria for mental disorder will be the same and the diagnosis
will be made on exactly the same
basis?</div>

met remain the same. The responsible clinician, if not a registered
medical practitioner, will not work to a lower set of criteria as to
whether to detain people. That would be unthinkable.</div>
					<a name="07050155000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I want to
move on, because I hope that I have made my point. However, I want to
give one further reassurance to the Committee. Let us consider
carefully what we are talking about. Nurse consultants typically have a
masters qualification, and most have specific post-registration
clinical skills training in areas such as cognitive behavioural therapy
or psycho-social interventions, in which psychiatrists tend not to be
trained. They should also be experienced in clinical work, consultancy,
research and supervision. Consultant nurses are often independent nurse
prescribers, which means that they are qualified to diagnose patients
independently and treat them with
medication.</div>
					<a name="07050155000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
consultant clinical psychologist typically has an undergraduate degree
of at least 2:1 grade and at least two years&#146; experience in the
NHS before being accepted on to a three-year doctorate in clinical
psychology. It is not until they have six years&#146; experience that
they may be considered for consultant status. I draw hon.
Members&#146; attention to the document that we have circulated to
the Committee on relevant competencies. They cover the ability to
identify the presence or absence of mental disorder and its severity
and to</div>
					<a name="07050155000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;undertake broad
mental health assessment and formulations incorporating biological,
psychological, cultural and social
perspectives.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clinician must have a broad understanding of</div>
					<a name="07050155000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all mental health related
treatments, i.e. physical, psychological and social
interventions&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div>
					<a name="07050155000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an

case.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are the levels that we are setting for the responsible clinicians whom
we want to bring in. I find it difficult to understand why the
Opposition would want to remove what we have been working at for many
years. Perhaps I am anticipating the Opposition&#146;s remarks, but
that was certainly the position that was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>put in the House of Lords. We want to ensure that highly qualified,
highly motivated professionals get the recognition that we are trying
to give them in the

						</b> In some respects, the debate is unhelpful as it
appears almost to be setting one health professional against another.
We seem to have lost sight of the patient. If patients&#146; liberty
is to be deprived, surely many of them will want the person with the
greatest overview, who makes the initial decision, as the Minister has
accepted, to be involved in any renewal of detention. Who has asked the
patients?</div>

						</b> Exactly. That is absolutely the point. The hon.
Lady could not have put it better; that is exactly what we are trying
to achieve. The responsible clinician&#151;let us say it is a
psychologist&#151;who has been treating the patient is, as she says,
absolutely the right person to renew the detention. Maybe she does not
realise what the effect of the changes that she supports would be. By
supporting the changes made in the House of Lords, she wishes to remove
that ability to someone else who has not been directly involved with
the patient.</div>
					<a name="07050155000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
renewal of detention should be done by the person who is most
appropriate to the patient&#146;s individual needs and is delivering
treatment. That is exactly the point, and that is why we are opposing
the changes made in the House of Lords, which will set key
professionals back by many years. Our position is not anti-doctor, it
simply recognises that there are now others who can make a contribution
in the relevant circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07050155000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Frankly, it
is better for patients to know that the person who is looking after
them the most closely is involved in renewing their detention, because
they know that that person will have their history. The hon. Lady
suggests that it should be sent to someone who might have no knowledge
and is brought in at the last minute to examine the patient and renew
their
detention.</div>

					<a name="07050155000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I have a
number of questions for the Minister, which she might want to answer in
her response. She pre-judged what we were going to say; she came to the
debate with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>pre-conceived notions and prejudices about the attitude of Conservative
Members before we had even talked to our amendments or stated our
position on the clause.</div>
					<a name="07050155000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not understand her
insistence on speaking to clause 6 as if proposed new paragraph
(aa)(ii) takes priority over subsection (1). It is clearly stated that
the preferred route on decisions of renewal of detention must be that
the medical person who is familiar with the case should have primacy in
making that decision. Only if that person is not available would
someone else who has not had a close familiarity with the case be
brought in to make that important assessment. It must be a person who
has passed all the medical criteria to be able to make a medical
judgment at an important and difficult juncture&#151;that is, the
renewal of detention.</div>
					<a name="07050155000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no doubt that all sorts
of people working within the multidisciplinary teams, which we wholly
support, have enormous expertise, experience, dedication and
sensitivity to their patients. Clause 6 does not seek to undermine the
job that those people are doing, but it is a matter of
appropriateness.</div>
					<a name="07050155000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
worried me that the Minister said that the just rewards of the
psychological therapists, whom the Government fully support&#151;we,
too, want many more of them to work in the health service in areas in
which their expertise is appropriate&#151;should be to have the power
to decide whether somebody should have their detention renewed. I am
not interested in just rewards for psychologists, consultant nurses or
anyone else; I am concerned primarily about the patient and whatever is
in their best
interests.</div>

few years to ensure that we can expand the roles that we are discussing
so that the people in them can do exactly what is best for the patient.
Thousands of psychologists and community psychiatric nurses have worked
to develop those roles and we are trying to recognise that in

their work, but their work is good for patients
too.</div>

when the patient&#146;s treatment might have involved strong
medication. She is saying that such nurses should have the power to
judge the efficacy of that strong medication and to decide whether the

question is always asked: &#147;Who&#146;s in charge?&#148; If
the consultant psychiatrist was involved in the admission of that
patient, surely it should be up to them alone to nominate who takes
over such responsibilities. I agree with the Minister: others, such as
psychologists and consultant nurses, have a big role to play. However,
someone has to be in charge, and if responsibility for a
patient&#146;s care is to be devolved, the consultant should be the
one who nominates to whom it is devolved. If we take away those powers
and say that anybody can do it, who decides&#151;the psychologist or
the nurse? It is very

						On numerous occasions in the
Committee, the hon. Gentleman has referred to evidence received in the
scrutiny Committee. I am sure that he recalls evidence received about
clinical teams. Some who gave evidence were not in favour of
psychiatrists making all decisions on a patient&#146;s
treatment&#151;they were not criticising psychiatrists themselves.
They said that patients often expressed a preference for another member
of the team&#151;a clinical psychologist, for example. My daughter is
a clinical psychologist, but that is not relevant&#151;I thought that
I would mention it in case anyone here knows it and brings it up.
However, clearly patients often prefer someone whom they see regularly.
It has to be said that often a busy consultant psychiatrist dips in and
out of hospitals.</div>
					<a name="07050155000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
conscious that you are looking at me, Mr. Cook, but may I
make one further point? It has been argued that that person would have
considerable training in the discipline. However, under the Lords
amendment, a graduate, having left medical school six months
previously, could be a qualified medical practitioner. That would mean
that they could pronounce on someone whom they do not know, and who has
never received treatment from them, because, as the hon. Gentleman
says, they know more about the clinical aspect of things. Actually,
someone who has treated the patient for six months, and been with them
during their psychiatric illness, would know a lot more about
them.</div>

the same token, under his suggestions, some people without that degree
of medical training could make those decisions as well. I refer him
back to the clause, which says that the preference is for the decision
to be made by a medically trained person familiar with the case. That
should be the norm. If the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>are providing a service that is fit for purpose, we should not be having
this debate. The medically most extensively trained person should take
the buck and make the decision, having taken advice from others in the
multidisciplinary team, many of whom might disagree among themselves as
well. It is not an exact science, which is the whole point of our
deliberations. The consultant nurse might have an entirely different
view to the psychologist of what treatment a patient should receive,
which very often
happens.</div>

Whether to continue a person&#146;s detention is a very serious
matter, but the Minister has not pointed out any obvious process. She
nodded in agreement with my hon. Friend when he suggested that the
person making the decision could be a nurse, a consultant nurse or a
psychotherapist, but somebody has to decide. Who decides in any one
individual case? Will it be that a psychotherapist comes in on Monday
and finds that a nurse decided to not to renew detention on the
previous Friday? When a psychiatrist arrives on the following
Wednesday, they might find that somebody else has made a totally
different decision. The process involved in individual patient care

the good work that the Government have done on new ways of working and
encouraging multidisciplinary teams. That has to be right not only for
mental health care but for all sorts of physical health care. The most
important point is that the patient should receive the most appropriate
care from the best qualified professional. Hopefully, and preferably,
that person would be the medical person mentioned in the Lords
amendments. That means that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>the psychiatrist should preferably be central to mental health. The
psychiatrist has been central to all previous mental health legislation
on account of their highly specialised training&#151;as I said, the
training takes13 years. The amendments do not intend to
undermine the skill and dedication of the other relevant
professionals.</div>

						The
relevant amendment was introduced by Lord Carlile and had cross-party
support. Some passionate speeches were made in favour of the changes.
The Minister is now proposing, according to my documents, that some
approved clinicians would be eligible to become responsible clinicians
and then have overall charge of the patient for the duration of the
detention in the hospital or secure unit. Therefore, it is entirely
conceivable that for some patients there will be no medical input at
all unless the responsible clinician, who is not a doctor, makes the
necessary referral. Is it not an anomaly that once detained, a
patient&#146;s care will be transferred to a psychologist or nurse,
say, without any medical input to their continued detention other than
at a time of renewal or on appeal to the mental health review
tribunal.</div>

						</b> Given what the hon. Gentleman has just said, it
is appropriate that I should read out the
following:</div>
					<a name="07050155000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
be responsible for the overall management of a detained
patient&#146;s case and then to have to seek the agreement of a
consultant psychiatrist to renew a section of the Mental Health Act
significantly devalues the role for non-medical
professionals.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
comes from one of the letters to which he just referred and is written
by two consultant psychiatrists, one of whom is Christine Vize, the
second most senior psychiatrist in the Avon and Wiltshire partnership.
I know her well and I know her work. She is a fellow of the Royal
College of Psychiatrists and she is in favour of new ways of working in
mental health that go directly against what the hon. Gentleman
argues.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000582"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> Perhaps in response to that I can quote a letter
sent today from Sheila Hollins, who is the president of the Royal
College of Psychiatrists. She
writes:</div>
					<a name="07050155000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am
responding to a somewhat misleading letter sent by Drs Vize
and Humphries to the recipients of the
email&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07050155000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">which I
think the hon. Gentleman might have
seen&#151;</div>
					<a name="07050155000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and to the
national press about the role of the RMO. They purport to represent the
views of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Drs Vize and Humphries
have a training role connected to New Ways of Working but have not
discussed their views with myself or made representations to the
Central Executive of the College. College decisions are reached
democratically as I explain below.</div>
					<a name="07050155000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">In the College&#146;s view
the issue of who has the competencies to fulfil the RMO role is still
to be determined. Their letters may serve to undermine their work to
introduce NWW&#151;an important initiative which as yet does not have
the complete confidence of the
profession.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050155000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Gentleman is not going to try to pull the trick that
the Minister does of suddenly pulling out a letter from certain
individuals claiming to represent the views of one of the professional
bodies who happen to be part of the Mental Health Alliance because,
pre-empting the Minister, he has fallen for it. I asked right at the
beginning of this Committee stage whether the Minister or other hon.
Members would try 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>not to use isolated bits of correspondence to suggest that it represents
the views of a body of professionals overall. The hon. Gentleman said
that these were psychiatrists, and there was a suggestion, therefore,
that in some way the psychiatric profession and the Royal College of
Psychiatrists were not in favour of these changes. That is not the
case, which I hope he now
acknowledges.</div>

							<a name="07050155000583"></a>Dr.
Naysmith:
						</b> Of course I acknowledge that, and I never said
that, as the record will confirm. The pointI was making was
that this was a psychiatrist whom I know and whose work I am familiar
with. Although she deals with the Wiltshire side of things, she is part
of the Avon and Wiltshire partnership which is in charge of mental
health in my area. I am quite familiar with many things that go on with
the Avon and Wiltshire mental health partnership. Christine Vize is a
very competent psychiatrist. I am not saying that she represents the
views of the college because the hon. Gentleman has been getting little
bits of paper about that all morning, but she is someone in whom I have
confidence.</div>

							<a name="07050155000584"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> I do not disagree with anything that the hon.
Gentleman has said. I am sure that Christine Vize is terribly good, but
let us be clear about this. The Minister has already hauled up a
registered nurse to support her case. We have all received submissions
from the RCN. We have had submissions from the British Psychological
Society, which has been prayed in aid even more than any other member
of the Mental Health Alliance. Presumably its membership will be
benefiting enormously. I made it quite clear that there are people who
do not agree with that position, which is why the alliance is not
taking an official position on
this.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000585"></a>Dr.

							<a name="07050155000586"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> As it stands, the alliance is not taking an
official position on it, albeit that many of the component
organisations of the alliance support the Lords amendment.</div>
					<a name="07050155000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that I have dealt with
all the interventions, for a change, and now come to the anomaly that I
mentioned. The Government presumably recognise the anomaly as
potentially hazardous to patients, because they proposed an amendment,
prior to Report in the Lords, in an attempt to offer some medical input
to the patients&#146; care by ensuring that the non-medical
responsible clinician should consult with a psychiatrist at the time of
section 20 renewal. However, the legal status of such a consultation is
dubious, because there would be no compulsion on a non-medical
responsible clinician to act on the recommendations and no authority
for the psychiatrist to oversee his treatment plan. That could lead to
interdisciplinary conflict, as well as unco-ordinated patient care. Why
did the Government find it necessary to introduce a medical angle when
the measure was going through the House of Lords? They cannot have it
both ways. Either they think that a medical input is of great
importance, or they do not. They have come up with a halfway house
which is flawed and leads to more
confusion.</div>

Winterton:
						</b>
						We were trying to give some
reassurance in those circumstances. As the hon. Gentleman should know,
the working of the arrangement would be that, of course, the
responsible clinician would consult others on the multidisciplinary
team. That is what happens at the moment and it is what will happen in
future. We simply wanted to give some reassurance that there would be
consultation with the doctor. I think that perfectly reasonable; it is
the way we sometimes engage in discussions in this place. The provision
is meant to be helpful, but it is what happens now anyway: there are
discussions with a medical
practitioner.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000588"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> The thrust of all that the Minister has said,
backed up by her hon. Friends, is that if she had things her way there
need not be a role for a medical practitioner in the process, because a
consultant nurse, registered social worker or clinical psychologist
would be sufficiently familiar with the case to make decisions about
the renewal of detention without reference to medical opinion at that
stage; thus it is just a bit of an annoyance that it was necessary to
accommodate some medical reference in the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000589"></a>Dr.
Gibson:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that each hospital
has a protocol, under which there is a responsible clinician or group
of people, in tune with the patient, and that that information would be
in medical records and freely available? That is how things happen in
practice. I think that difficulties are being found when in fact
hospitals associate the care of a patient sometimes with a named nurse,
sometimes with a responsible clinician, or sometimes with both. That
varies a lot. There is no real
problem.</div>

Loughton:
						</b>
						 I am sure that there are very
good ways of working that happen now, but, ultimately, decisions are
made by a medically qualified person. We are talking about a decision
on renewal of detention. What I am saying in no way detracts from the
effectiveness of the work of various disciplines within a
multidisciplinary team, and I stress that it should not be seen as
intended to undermine that relationship. However, many people have
raised serious legal problems in connection with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>what the Government are trying to do in overturning the clause. The
Joint Committee on Human Rights
stated:</div>
					<a name="07050155000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Initial
detention under the Act as amended will still be based on objective
medical expertise, in the form of reports from registered medical
practitioners. However, renewal of detention will be carried out by the
responsible clinician, who need not be a doctor, furnishing a report to
the managers of the hospital that the conditions justifying detention
continue to be met. If initial detention must be based on objective
medical expertise to be compatible with Article 5 ECHR, there is an
argument, following Winterwerp&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07050155000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">the case mentioned in my amendment, which
I shall come on
to&#151;</div>
					<a name="07050155000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the same
should apply to its
prolongation.&#148;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050155000591"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I point out to the Committee that there
has been a lot of discussion this morning about bits of paper and I am
aware of the quantity of paper that has been submitted to us&#151;I
think that we are officially on to submission No. 58. Some of the
submissions are 85 pages long, and I have to approve them before they
are distributed to you. I hope that I am not the only person who reads
them&#151;<i class="I">[Laughter.]</i> I am not joking.</div>
					<a name="07050155000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
submissions have been available to everyone, on the table in the
corner, all day. They come from a range of professional disciplines,
from different representatives within those disciplines and other
people, who have a vast range of opinions. There will, therefore,
inevitably be disagreement, and it is the Committee&#146;s task to
examine the legislative proposals line by line to try to distil the
best possible answer from that range of opinions. That may require the
Committee to dance on the head of a pin, as the hon. Member for
Bristol, North-West put it, but it is important that we do so using the
weapons of logic, clarity, patience and tolerance, and that we reject
any suggestion of ridicule. I ask all members of the Committee to bear
those points in mind.</div>
