<P>
(Except clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 and schedules 1 and 2)  
<P>
<H5>10.30 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): On a point  of order, Mr. O'Hara. It falls to me to issue the courteous  and conventional but none the less heartfelt welcome  to you as Chairman of the Committee. We wish you well,  and I am sure that the Committee will help you in your  task in every way that it can.  
<P>
I raise a point of order on the implications of the  Committee being unable to sit during the short recess in  February which was announced by the Leader of the  House. The matter was touched on briefly at the  Committee's previous sitting.  
<P>
The Committee already has constraints on its time, the  Bill is large and our sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays  are already truncated, if not to say leisurely. Surely it  would be the wish of the Committee to provide additional  time to make up for the time lost because the Committee  will not sit on a Thursday in February. I was assured that  a proposal would come forward in the fullness of time,  so I raise the matter again. I do not expect a response  immediately, but I would like reassurance that the  Committee's time will not, yet again, be reduced and that  all Back Benchers on the Committee will be given the  chance to scrutinise the Bill properly.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am advised that the Committee could  sit at the time in question, but it is not a matter for the  Chair to decide it is a matter for discussion between the  parties. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman's point  has been noted and that it will be given appropriate  consideration by the parties' business managers.  
<H4><center>Clause 20 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Disqualification from being the Mayor or an Assembly  member </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and  Bermondsey): I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page  11, line 37, leave out `or appointments' and insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`of profit under the Crown'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the  following amendments: No. 233, in page 11, line 37, after  `appointments' insert `(except for elected offices)'.  
<P>
No. 144, in page 12, line 15, at end insert   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) A person shall be disqualified from becoming (whether by  election or otherwise) or remaining Mayor of a member of the  Assembly if he holds a politically restricted post under any local  authority whose area, or any part of it, lies within Greater London.  
<P>
(2B) For the purposes of subsection (3) above, "politically  restricted post"	 and "local authority"	 have the same meaning as in  Part I of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989.'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I,  too, welcome you Mr. O'Hara, to the Chair. Although  amendment No. 232 is the lead amendment, I shall also  speak to amendment No. 233, which was also tabled by  the Liberal Democrats, and amendment No. 144, which  was tabled by Conservative Members. However, I will  refer to the Conservative's amendment only in passing.  
<P>
We are examining the part of the Bill that determines  how people can qualify to stand either as mayor or  members of the assembly. Our amendment would ensure  that individuals who are paid by the Government except  those who have already been elected to office would not  be able to stand for election as members of the assembly  or mayor. Clause 20 states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person is disqualified from being elected...if   
<P>
(a) he is a member of staff of the Authority"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
  
<P>
 that is self-evident and is perfectly proper and  unarguable and if  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(b) he holds any offices or appointments for the time being  designated by the Secretary of State in an order as offices or  appointments disqualifying persons from being the Mayor or an  Assembly member"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>   
<P>
We have two objections to the way that the clause is  drafted. The Bill should set out who should be  disqualified; it should not be left to the Secretary of State  to decide. We call all contemplate the fact that, if we leave  that power to a Secretary of State, it is open to him or her  to decide not necessarily this year or next year but in  the future to rule out certain categories of people. We  must resist I appeal now to Labour colleagues on the  Committee giving such power to the Secretary of State.  
<P>
Labour Members may think that the current proposal is  fine and that the Secretary of State in power is cuddly,  likeable and absolutely pluralist in his attitude. However,  the Secretary of State may change, Labour may be in  opposition and there may be a Secretary of State who may  act against the interests of what is now albeit  temporarily the majority party. It is important that  Secretaries of State are not allowed to behave in that way.  
<P>
For example, if the power remains, the Secretary of  State could decide that no peers could stand for election.  That would be completely unjustified if it had not been  the view of the Committee or Parliament. The Secretary  of State could decide that no former members of the  Greater London council could stand, which would be  completely unacceptable and illogical. The Secretary of  State could also decide that non-Labour councillors could  not stand.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): That sounds  better and better.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am receiving plaudits from the west end  of London, if not the west end of the west end.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Pound:</B> The hon. Gentleman is confused about  my end.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I never know whether the hon.  Gentleman's constituency is Ealing, North, South, East or  West, but I know that it is in west London. For those of  us who live in the real London, it is certainly far out west.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): rose   
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and  Westminster): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Of course, but later and after I have given  way to my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and  Surbiton (Mr. Davey). First, I must say that it is  unacceptable that powers will be given to the Secretary  of State to decide irrespective of logic or natural  justice who shall be excluded from standing.  
<P>
I am aiming to start the new day with a sense of  conciliation and of consensus politics something  proposed for London in the Government's White Paper  although we think that co-operative politics are more  appropriate than consensus politics. We will shortly ask  Labour members of the Committee to gently agree with  us. They must begin to flex their muscles in Committee  and tell their Ministers that they will not give the  Secretary of State one power too far.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> My hon. Friend is talking about how the  Secretary of State might abuse the powers set out in the  Bill. Will the Secretary of State be able to disqualify  someone who on one day gives a loyalty pledge to the  Prime Minister that he will work with the Government if  he is elected mayor, and the next day   
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is  introducing extraneous matters into the debate.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We defer to you, Mr. O'Hara.  
<P>
I am not sure, but it is possible that my hon. Friend's  suggestion could be true. More realistically, it is possible  for any category of people to be excluded. Subsection (1)  (b) refers to the  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"offices or appointments disqualifying persons"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
If offices or appointments are the criteria for exclusion,  any office or appointment that a person holds unless  such posts are better defined could be covered by the  provision.  
<P>
I shall make one more point before I give way to the  right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster  (Mr. Brooke). Conventional in drafting, as I remember  from past legislation, is the inclusion of a suggestion such  as that in our amendment. Amendment No. 232 refers to  offices  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"of profit under the Crown"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That is entirely proper. When my predecessor, the late  Bob Mellish, was considering whether he should resign  from the House having already resigned from the Labour  party in protest in the early 1980s, he was also considering  whether he should accept nomination for the vice-chair of  the London Docklands development corporation. When  that body existed, it was specified as being an office of  profit under the Crown, and there are others. Such offices  are appointments made through patronage by the Prime  Minister. It is true that many are in the gift of the  Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the  Regions and of other Cabinet Ministers, but the majority  are in the gift of the Prime Minister.  
<P>
It is better and, of course, right that there should be no  one on the Greater London Authority, either as mayor or  in the assembly, who has what may be a conflict of  interest. Such conflicts of interest should exclude him or  her from participation on that body. I now give way to the  right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving  way. Although the moment has passed, he will recall that  he was not wholly complimentary to an area of my  constituency I am referring to the west end. I offer him  a pact: if he desists from insulting my constituency, I will  desist from revealing to the Committee the price paid by  the Corporation of London for Southwark in an earlier  century, as well as the reasons why that price might have  been paid.  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I think that the Committee would like  that information. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman  will manage to provide it without the Chairman noticing.  I was not at all rude about the right hon. Gentleman's  constituency. He and I, and the Under-Secretary of State  for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Vauxhall  (Kate Hoey) plus a few others in the Committee  represent real London. Other members of the Committee  represent the suburbs, or constituencies halfway to France.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): I am a little concerned,  as no doubt others will be, about the idea that according  to the Liberal Democrats "real London"	 does not  include constituencies outside the central area. I hope that  the hon. Gentleman will either change the Liberal  Democrats' policy towards outer London or make it clear  that they realise that the Bill covers all those living within  the Greater London area.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman  recognises that I am wearing a Middlesex county cricket  club tie, indeed a Simon Hughes benefit tie, given to me  by my great namesake a much greater Simon Hughes  than I during his halcyon days at Lord's.  
<P>
I have not only enjoyed but appreciated outer  London but it is not the same. I used to work a lot in  the hon. Gentleman's constituency. I appeared frequently  at Uxbridge magistrates court [Interruption.] fortunately  in a representative rather than an indicted capacity. The  other Liberal Democrat Members on the Committee  would be unhappy if I suggested that the Surrey parts, or  the Middlesex parts, of London were not valid in their  own right. I have made many speeches saying that there  is the traditional old London, and then there are the  counties that make up Greater London. The hon. Member  for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) represents part of one such  county, not in the middle but out on the edge of London.  It is none the less valid for that, and equally to be  incorporated in the Greater London authority.  
<P>
The Bill is not clear about the Government's intention  relating to people who have been elected to public office,  and whether they should be entitled to stand as members  of the assembly or as mayor. At present, people elected  elsewhere can stand for local government; Members of  the House of Lords and Members of the House of  Commons can be local councillors. I believe that my hon.  Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)  is still a local councillor, although only someone so  capable as he is can say how he manages to fulfil his little  constituency obligations and do his parliamentary duty.  
<P>
It has always been the case that people from all tiers of  government Members of the European Parliament,  Members of Parliament from both Houses, and  councillors can stand for other representative bodies. In  the legislation relating to Scotland, Wales and Northern  Ireland, it was accepted that people could have a dual  mandate that is, that they could stand for two bodies.  Our amendment seeks to make it clear that that will be  possible under the Bill.  
<P>
I shall leave it to the hon. Member for Croydon, South  (Mr. Ottaway), or one of his hon. Friends, to deal with  politically restricted posts, and my hon. Friend the  Member for Sutton and Cheam may also wish to speak  on that matter. I hope that the Government will be positive  and accept at least the spirit of the amendments. I hope  that they will take them away and, if necessary, redraft  them. [Interruption.] The Minister is suggesting that they  will not. I am unhappy about that, and I hope that he will  not defend the Secretary of State's having the power to  make an order. That is another example of giving a power  to an individual, against the best interests of the people  of London.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call other hon. Members in  the debate, I remind the Committee that while I have  generously allowed various hon. Members to stake out  their pitch during the introductory speeches, the title of  the clause is  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Disqualification from being the Mayor or an Assembly member".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): I should like  to associate myself with the traditional words of welcome  to you in your capacity as Chairman, Mr. O'Hara. I shall  be brief. Under the draconian timetable, we have to get  through 100 clauses, and the amendments tabled to them,  in the next six sittings.  
<BR>
   
<P>
Clause 20 provides the same safeguards against twin  tracking as were introduced by the previous Government  under the local government regime. However, we feel that  they should go further and cover people operating in  politically restricted posts in local government boroughs  inside London. Our amendment strictly follows the  wording of section 2 of the Local Government and  Housing Act 1989. We believe that there is justification  for introducing safeguards against a clash of political and  public interest, and that should also apply to the authority. 
<P>
<H5>10.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): I also  associate myself with the warm words of welcome to you  as Chairman, Mr. O'Hara. 
<P>
I support amendments Nos. 232 and 233 tabled by the  Liberal Democrats and, of course, amendment No. 144  which stands, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member  for Croydon, South. As our consideration of the Bill  unfolds, we see that the Government wish to enshrine a  pattern of intrusive behaviour in the statute designed to  establish the authority. The clause could permit the  Secretary of State to disqualify a particular individual by  virtue of any undefined appointment that he or she may  hold. I find that provision fundamentally undemocratic  and offensive to the House. 
<P>
If the Government have any such potential list of  appointments for which they would seek  disqualification, that ought to be spelt out in the  legislation, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North  and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) made clear. It ought to  be spelt out, first as a matter of equity so that persons  who harbour aspirations for elected office, either as a  mayor or an assembly man, do not find themselves  disappointed, but secondly, so that the general public  know what the criteria are. In earlier debates, we saw  that the Bill permitted political parties unnecessary  power over the selection of candidates; now the  Secretary of State has the potential to interfere in  matters that must be made clearer. 
<P>
I believe that the category in amendment No. 233  exemption for elected offices is wholly sensible and  right. The mayoralty and the assembly could both benefit  from the experience of personalities elected to other  offices. For example, on Second Reading the  Conservative party explained that it wished to see  borough council representatives on the assembly. We  argued that point long and hard, because we felt that  individual boroughs' points of view would not get across  sufficiently in the assembly unless there were such a  provision. The amendment would explicitly and clearly  prevent there being any question of an elected  representative a borough councillor within London, for  example being disqualified either from the assembly or,  conceivably, from the mayoralty, although I doubt  whether a person could hold both mandates. 
<P>
Amendment No. 232 would deal with offices 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"of profit under the Crown"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The tradition of our parliamentary process has been to  seek the Chiltern Hundreds, because if we take up such  an office, the conflict of interests is clear and  unacceptable; so it should be for the assembly. There  should be no question of any person being able to be  bought by the Government through his or her acceptance  of an office of profit under the Crown. Again, I welcome  the clarity that the amendment spells out for that category  of exemption. 
<P>
Amendment No. 144 has a clarity of definition that is  wholly to be welcomed. It accords with previous local  government legislation, and I support it. 
<BR>
   
<P>
We must return to the point because it is fundamental,  especially now, when a Prime Minister has voiced an  opinion on who might be suitable for the post of coach to  the England football team and so much the more when  it comes to politics. We have seen how sensitive the  Government are over the choice of candidates for office.  They will be particularly keen to see appropriate people  chosen. Therefore there is a danger of intrusion by the  Secretary of State, unless we amend the Bill in the manner  set out by the Liberal amendments, Nos. 232 and 233. 
<P>
<B> The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick  Raynsford):</B> I too welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, to the Chair  of the Committee. You are the third Chairman that we have  had in as many sittings. That, perhaps, is a sign of the  arduousness of the task. I welcome the crisp and  business-like way in which you have addressed your  responsibilities during the first few moments of the sitting. 
<P>
I cannot accept the amendments, and I will spell out  why. The concern that appears to lie behind them that  the Secretary of State would use his or her order-making  powers to disqualify sitting Members of Parliament,  councillors or others whom he or she chose to finger, from  standing for election either for mayor or for membership  of the assembly is entirely misplaced. I can assure hon.  Members that we have no intention of doing any such  thing. 
<P>
We intend to apply rules that are the same as, or  broadly similar to, those that currently apply to local  authorities. Under those rules, a person is disqualified  from being elected as a member of a local authority if he  or she holds any paid office or employment with a body,  appointments to which are or may be made, or confirmed,  by the authority. That would mean, for example, that  members of the board of Transport for London or the  board of the London development agency other than  where we have made specific provision for elected  members who will be appointed by the mayor, and their  senior employees, could not stand for election either as  mayor or as assembly members without first resigning  from those positions. I am sure that all members of the  Committee will recognise that that is clealry sensible  and necessary. 
<P>
Senior officers of the GLA are already disqualified if  they hold politically restricted posts. The other categories  of office holders that I would expect to see included in an  order made under the provisions of clause 20(1)(b)  include some of those listed in the House of Commons  Disqualification Act 1975, such as civil servants, acting  returning officers, full-time police officers and members  of the regular armed forces. I am sure that all members  of the Committee will recognise the good sense of those  measures.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> If that is the Government's  intention, why does the Bill not say that? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will surely  recognise after his many years of experience in the House  of Commons, those matters are already specified by  procedures in existing local government legislation that  the Bill parallels. If the hon. Member wishes us to rewrite  all legislation that applies to local government for the  purposes of the Bill, he would have us in Committee a  great deal longer than we expected. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am sorry to dissent, but the Minister is  wrong on the first point. He listed two categories. One is  dealt with under the House of Commons Disqualification  Act; he is correct about that. A reference could be made  in the Bill specifically to the categories mentioned in that  Act. The other category is not mentioned elsewhere in  legislation. As he has often said, the assembly will be a  unique body. He has defined those who might have an  interest because they work for or are engaged by one of  the agencies. Provisions covering them could be written  into the Bill without difficulty. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman,  who has been in the House for many years, will appreciate  that although it is possible to cover posts such as those  that I have mentioned in the LDA or Transport for  London it is not possible to cover bodies that may come  into existence that may have a relationship to the GLA  analogous with that that Transport for London and the  LDA will have. Any measure such as the one that he  proposes would be unsatisfactory as it would subsequently  require the amendment of primary legislation rather than  any amendment to order-making powers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes rose  </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman has detained the  Committee for a great deal of time already. I will give  way to him for the last time. 
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I hear what the Minister says. However,  that can be defined either by the Bill or by reference to a  specifically defined order under the Bill. This part of the  Bill does not limit those who are disqualified to the two  categories that he mentioned, the first of which consists  of those who are linked to the GLA. It could do so,  however, and I still have not heard an argument as to why  it should not. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is pushing his  luck by proceeding again and again on the same tack. I  have made it clear that his point flies in the face of  existing provision for disqualification in respect of local  government, which properly takes account of the fact that  one cannot change primary legislation for every body or  post that is created. 
<P>
As regards the hon. Gentleman's paranoid fears about  the Government's intentions, I should make it clear that  any order that is made under the powers in clause 20 will  be subject to the affirmative resolution in both Houses of  Parliament and will, therefore, be subject to proper and  full scrutiny. In the circumstances, I ask the hon.  Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment No. 144, which was tabled in the name of  the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway), is  unnecessary. Clause 57(1) already specifies that the GLA  shall be treated as a local authority for the purposes of  sections 1 to 3 of the Local Government and Housing  Act 1989 the provisions that govern politically restricted  posts in local authorities. Section 1(1) of the Act states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person shall be disqualified from becoming (whether by election  or otherwise) or remaining a member of a local authority if he holds  a politically restricted post under that local authority or any other  local authority in Great Britain"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Any person who held a politically restricted post in a  London borough would, therefore, already be prohibited  from being elected or serving as mayor or as an assembly  member. Indeed, the prohibition extends to holders of  politically restricted posts in local authorities outside  Greater London. That is the normal local government  regime. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman not to press  his amendment. 
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. I  would like to give him the benefit of the doubt, but the  doubt is so excessive in this case that I cannot do so. He  declared that he intended his successors to use the powers  in clause 20(1)(b) in an entirely responsible manner.  Obviously, we would not malign the Minister's own  intentions, but his reassurance is not sufficient for me.  Nor should it be sufficient for anyone who wants the  assembly to be established in such a way that there is no  possibility of any future Government misusing their  powers to disqualify a person from office as mayor or as  an assembly man by virtue of any appointment that he  might hold. If the Government were benign in their  intentions, they could spell out the categories of potential  restrictions much more clearly in the Bill. The question  of elective office is important. Any possibility of  disqualification for Members of Parliament, peers,  Members of the European Parliament and, perhaps above  all, borough councillors should be clearly excluded. 
<P>
The Minister's argumentation is deficient. We are  discussing an important point of principle. Furthermore,  there has been an implicit argument throughout that we  must get on. That is because the timetable, which the  Government themselves set, is so inadequate. It seems  that we must give the Bill insufficient and hasty scrutiny  because we have to gallop on. We must stop that  galloping and reflect on matters so that we ensure that  the assembly is properly constituted and that there are no  loopholes that future Governments can abuse. I therefore  support the amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> First, I did not hear the Minister  deal explicitly with the point about the dual mandate. If I  misheard him or was not attending when he did, I  apologise. It would, however, be helpful if he could  comment on the matter. My understanding is that the  Government agreed to dual mandates in Scottish, Welsh  and Northern Irish legislation. The only exception is that  one cannot be a member of the Scottish executive and of  the British Cabinet, but that is a more particular point,  which does not relate to the general issue. Will the  Minister clarify the matter? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am happy to make it clear that we  have no intention as we have already said of using  order-making powers to prevent people from standing for  membership of the Greater London Authority or as mayor  of the authority while they hold other political posts for  example, as Members of Parliament or as councillors.  That is entirely up to those concerned. There are obvious  questions as to whether people can reasonably do two  exacting jobs, but we do not intend to prevent from  standing people who wish to do so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is very helpful, Mr. O'Shea. The  Minister's clarification is consistent with what the White  Paper in parts implied. I hope that the Government will  consider incorporating it into the Bill by agreeing to the  relevant amendment. I do not propose to press the  amendment, but it would helpful for the matter to be  elaborated. 
<P>
I shall, however, seek to press amendment No. 232 to  a vote. The Committee has heard the exchanges. I believe,  as does the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr.  Wilkinson), that it is important for Parliament to take  control of the list of exempted and disqualified categories.  I hope that Labour Members will agree. The list should  not be left to a Secretary of State, however well  intentioned he or she may be. I hope that the Committee  will agree to the amendment because of that.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in  page 11, line 45, leave out `or'. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to  consider amendment No. 17, in page 11, line 45, after  `Man', insert `or elsewhere'. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall be brief. First, I should apologise,  Mr. O'Hara. My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and  Cheam (Mr. Burstow) has just told me that I may have  referred to you as Mr. O'Shea. If I did, I apologise. The  only O'Shea I remember is a woman of fiction who has  dubious characteristics. I apologise unreservedly, and  stand corrected. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> She probably lives in Southwark. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> She may, but I do not think so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I do not think that  the hon. Gentleman has dealt with the matter of O'Shea  properly. A very serious offence occurred in the House  not much more than 100 years ago, in relation to the Irish  question and Parnell. O'Shea featured in that matter  considerably. I should be much obliged if the hon.  Gentleman would be a little less flippant when referring  to the name. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I think that I was referring to the  captain's wife of that name, who had some discourse with  the monarch of the time, but I may have got my history  slightly confused. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B>  Kitty O'Shea. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman, as ever, is erudite  in exploring such byways. For the record, "He knows his  adultery"	 seems to be the appropriate phase. 
<P>
I hope that the Committee will be positive towards the  amendments. They are simple, and they seek to extend  the clause to ensure that the people it defines are  prevented from being elected as mayor or as members of  the assembly. Currently, disqualification applies to people  who have been convicted of an offence in the United  Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man and who  have served a term of imprisonment because of it. The  provisions should be extended to include offences  committed elsewhere. 
<P>
Quite rightly, legislation has recently been passed in  this country to ensure that there can be trials and  convictions of people who have committed offences  elsewhere I am thinking primarily of child abuse  offences in eastern Europe and the far east. The Bill  contains a loophole whereby a person who has served a  sentence of imprisonment for an offence in this country  will be disqualified, but if that person has committed an  identical offence in France or Belgium, or further afield,  he will not be disqualified. That is unsatisfactory.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I understand the sentiment behind the  amendment, and have sympathy with it. However, does  not the hon. Gentleman agree that the way in which it is  worded might imply that someone who has been  convicted of an offence in a country that has a doubtful  regime that is, a person who we would not regard as a  criminal but who has been justly imprisoned would be  ineligible to stand for the assembly? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is a good point, and I would be  happy for us to seek agreement about it at a later stage of  the Committee's proceedings. I am trying to flag up an  apparent loophole. However, I should not like improper  trials and convictions, which often take place abroad, to  be included in the scope of the Bill. 
<P>
In a way, the amendment is personally relevant to me.  Soon after I was first elected, an election took place in  Southwark. We discovered, after the close of nominations  and the withdrawal date for nominations, that one of our  candidates had committed an offence that rendered him  ineligible for election to the local authority. We never  mentioned his name again in our literature we referred  only to two candidates in a three-person ward.  Nevertheless, much to our embarrassment, that person  was elected. The mayor had to shake his hand knowing,  as we all did, that he would not be able to take his seat.  When he went to the first group meeting, he was told by  the chair that he would not be able to continue because  he was legally ineligible. All Liberals in Southwark  remember his rejoinder: "I thought you believed in  proportional representation here, and there are lots of us  in Southwark who have been inside."	 I do not argue that  he should have been able to stand, but I do not believe  that people who have committed similar offences abroad  should be eligible to stand either. 
<BR>
   
<P>
I suggest that further consideration of the drafting may  be possible, but, will the Minister respond positively to  the purpose and import of the amendment? 
<P>
<B> The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda  Jackson):</B> One of our previous Chairmen said that he was  overwhelmed by the amount of welcome that had been  heaped on his head. I would not wish to create such a  response in you, Mr. O'Hara, but it is a privilege to be  serving again under your chairmanship. 
<P>
I listened intently to the points raised by the hon.  Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.  However, I am not convinced by his argument that there  should be, exclusively for GLA elections, even further  conditions imposed upon candidates. The provisions in  clause 20(1)(d) simply replicate the provisions that are  applied to local authorities by section 80(1)(d) of the  Local Government Act 1972. I can see no reason why the  GLA should be treated differently, in that respect, from  the London borough councils. I thought that the point  made by the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)  was especially pertinent. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and  Bermondsey neglected precisely to define what he means  by "elsewhere"	. It would be grossly unfair if a prospective  candidate were to be burdened by a legal system under  which a foreigner could have been mistreated for purely  political reasons or through a miscarriage of justice. If the  hon. Gentleman wishes to change our perception of the  matter, he will have to define what he means by  "elsewhere"	. Furthermore, the amendment would require  unanimity among the many varied legal systems  throughout the world. On those grounds alone, I ask the  hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall be brief. I understand that one  must have consistent legislation, and I understand the  point made by the hon. Member for Uxbridge. 
<P>
I am seeking to make some progress on this issue and  reach agreement on it. Will the Minister for Transport  in London or the Under-Secretary of State for the Home  Department at least tell the Committee whether the issue  could be referred to the Home Office for consideration?  The Minister for Transport in London indicated the other  day that a ministerial colleague in the Home Office  responsible for electoral matters, who is not on the  Committee, was looking at a range of revisions for the  system. If the hon. Lady or her hon. Friend could tell me  that the matter will be taken and fed into the system, to  avoid people who have committed a gross offence  elsewhere being eligible to stand, I should be happy not  to take the matter further. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am pleased to hear that partial  assurance from the hon. Member for Southwark, North  and Bermondsey. We need absolute consistency in our  electoral arrangements. No one could accept an  amendment of the kind currently drafted by Liberal  Democrat Members. It would, prima facie, exclude people  such as refugees from the Nazis who had come a cropper  under that regime, Soviet dissidents, or prisoners of  conscience in all parts of the world. I think that the  Government are correct in this matter at any rate, if not  in much else. 
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> On grounds of astonishment alone, I am  grateful or what the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood  has contributed to our debate. 
<P>
I must tell the hon. Member for Southwark, North and  Bermondsey that it would not be appropriate for the Home  Office to examine this amendment or, indeed, the thrust  of what the hon. Gentleman is attempting to clarify, for  reasons that I have already given. First, the hon.  Gentleman has not defined what he means by  "elsewhere"	. Secondly, we do not live in a world where  every legal system is exactly the same. There are cases of  gross miscarriages of justice under other systems and of  the power of the state being used against people who have  been deemed criminal for actions that have nothing to do  with anything other than their political or religious  believes. 
<P>
I do not wish to mislead the Committee by saying that  the Government will reflect further on the issue. Again, I  ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand the arguments made by both  the Minister and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood  about regimes elsewhere. The word "elsewhere"	 was  intended to have its normal definition, to mean outside the  United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. 
<P>
I recognise that there are wider considerations. It would  be wrong for me to ask the Minister for Transport in  London to make a commitment when it would need  discussion with her ministerial colleagues in another  Department. I can pursue that matter with them, and it  may come within the subject of electoral reform in  general. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the  amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the  Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I briefly express the hope that any  clause that retains powers and prerogatives for the  Secretary of State that could be subject to abuse or  misapplication is fully criticised, exposed, argued against  and, if my right hon. and hon. Friends agree, voted  against. 
<P>
I find the clause wholly deficient, for the reasons that  were set out in the debate on amendments Nos. 233, 232  and 144. Those amendments were not incorporated, and I  still regard clause 20(1)(b) as according to the Secretary  of State powers that could be subject to abuse. Therefore,  I hope that the clause will not be accepted; I shall be  shouting against it. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall be equally brief. Liberal Democrat  Members have the same concern. We have just dealt with  the second group of amendments on the selection list; we  were not happy with the outcome on the first group of  amendments, except for the assurance about the dual  mandate, which was helpful. My one reflection on that is  that the Government seem to be of the view that the  electorate should be allowed to decide whether someone  who is a councillor, for example, would be an appropriate  member of the GLA. One could reasonably use the same  argument about whether someone aged 19 or 20 should  be able to be chosen as a member of the GLA. The  Government's argument, both last week and this, is  inconsistent. 
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, Liberal  Democrat Members are very unhappy about the Bill's  repeated but unnecessary references to the Secretary of  State's powers. We have offered the Government a way  forward. 
<P>
In conclusion, we are not happy with the clause. If it is  pushed to a vote, we shall vote against it. 
<P>
<H5>11.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> it has already been made clear to the  Committee that clause 20 provides for candidates being  disqualified from being elected to the posts of mayor or  assembly member. It is based on part V of the Local  Government Act 1972, which applies to local authority  membership. The clause also applies to the selection of a  person to fill a vacancy among the London candidates. 
<P>
Clause 20 further provides for the Secretary of State to  designate by order offices or appointments that disqualify  a person from being mayor or an assembly member. It  does not relate to local authorities, but it is similar to  provisions made in respect of the Welsh Assembly and  Scottish Parliament. It might be used, for example, to  designate certain public appointments, the holder of which  would be disqualified from standing for mayor or  assembly member. 
<P>
The arguments that have been partly restated by the  hon. Members for Ruislip-Northwood and for Southwark,  North and Bermondsey were put to the Committee in  respect of the previous group of amendments. My hon.  Friend the Minister for London and Construction covered  all the points that were made, and the Committee's verdict  was that the amendments should not be accepted.

Receipt of a valid petition by  the Greater London returning officer, will result in the publication  of notice of a new election for the Mayor, which will not preclude  the candidature of the former incumbent, provided that he remains  qualified to stand in that election.'.

<P>
(6) If the mayor is removed from office the provisions of section  16 will apply.'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> This is an important new clause, and I hope  to persuade the Committee to support it. It is simply drafted,  and would allow the people of London, or an overwhelming  majority of the members of the London assembly, to decide  that the mayor had gone so far beyond what was generally  regarded as acceptable that the wider electorate should have  an opportunity to decide whether the mayor should  continue in office. The Bill as drafted contains no such  provision. Specifically, under the new clause a mechanism  would be triggered whereby if 90 per cent. or more of the  assembly 23 out of the 25 members or 10 per cent. of  those entitled to vote in a London election decided that they  wanted a re-election, a re-election would be held.  
<P>
That is not an idea dreamt up by me and my colleagues  over a pint on a cold London night; there is good  constitutional precedent for it in a large number of places  which have directly elected mayors. There is not just  constitutional precedent but regular usage of that power,  for very good reason. For example, let us imagine that a  mayor became as ill as President Yeltsin appears to be.  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): He is better.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Member for Harrow, East  (Mr. McNulty), using the hotline to the Kremlin which  I had always suspected that he had, has information  that has not been shared with us to the effect that  President Yeltsin is better. We will look to the hon.  Gentleman for regular updates on the matter in London  Labour briefings in future.  
<P>
However, the example is serious. If someone were as  ill as President Yeltsin has been even if he is better  today or may be in the future, it would probably be  inappropriate for him or her to be responsible for running  a city such as London.  
<P>
In recent times, mayors in the United State have ended  up in prison, under what I hope that the Minister for  Transport in London would regard as an acceptable legal  regime, for criminal activities that I also hope she would  regard as deserving imprisonment. The mayor of  Washington is the most famous recent example.  
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> He was re-elected.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Indeed he was. The provision does not  mean that the electorate cannot decide that they want a  mayor who is in prison; it means that they are allowed to  question whether a mayor who has been imprisoned,  perhaps after conviction for one or more serious offences,  should continue in office.  
<P>
Someone may, through no fault of his own become  seriously mentally or physically ill, but not able to decide  to stand down. Would it really be good for London for  someone who had been committed as mentally ill, for  example, and was in a long-term institution, to remain as  mayor? The responsibilities that the Government will give  to the Greater London authority rest largely with the  mayor, not with the assembly. Would it be appropriate for  such a person to remain in office for up to three and half  years, without the electorate having any power to remove  him? My colleagues and I believe that it would not.  
<P>
The Government have decided that most of the power  of the Greater London authority will reside in the mayor.  Not to provide for any means of getting rid of the mayor  appears to put it simply bananas. It is not sensible to  give so much power to one person and no power to  anyone else to do anything about it. It is not like, for  example, the period under a recent Tory Administration,  when the last but one Conservative Prime Minister was  prevailed on in various ways by her colleagues to  withdraw. That happened because she was dependent on  her parliamentary colleagues for her position as Prime  Minister.  
<P>
The Hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone)  has argued, as we often have, that the mayor should come  from the assembly and be accountable to the assembly. if  the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition were  to lose the confidence of their parliamentary colleagues,  they would go, but under the Greater London authority  there is no such power. A mayor could lose the confidence  of all his or her ruling group or the group of the same  colour on the assembly but he or she could stay on. We  therefore think that this timely and appropriate power of  recall ought to be in the Bill.  
<P>
There are many precedents around the world for giving  voters the power, when things go wrong, to sack local  bosses whom they have elected. My colleagues and I have  heard no argument as to why Londoners should not have  those same powers. To put it succinctly, no one can  legislate to stop a mayor going off the rails, but we can  and we must legislate to stop a runaway mayor driving  our capital city off the rails, too. I should like to give the  Committee a couple of examples of where that happens  at the moment.  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I may be pre-empting the hon. Gentleman,  but is he going to give us details about how the  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"10 per cent. or more of those entitled to vote"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
submitting a petition would work? Would he rely on an  informal mechanism of people collecting signatures,  which would no doubt include the usual Mickey Mouse  and Napoleon Bonaparte? If so, how would he verify the  procedure and how much would it cost? If, on the other  hand, he envisages a more formal mechanism, how would  it be triggered? In other words, how would someone  initiate the potentially very costly process of gathering a  verifiable 10 per cent. of the electorate?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The right hon. Gentleman asked a  perfectly proper question to which there is, I hope, an  entirely appropriate answer. We cannot have a Mickey  Mouse system; it must be set down. I am happy to make  a copy of the rules for the city of St. Louis, for example,  for the right hon. Gentleman. He is a great lover of the  United States, which is appropriate, given the variety of  that country and the democratic education that it can give  us. I have here the articles in the St. Louis city charter  which set out exactly how a petition can be called and  how the names are to be verified. It is done using an  electoral returning officer process. All the procedures are  clear, and the declaration as to whether sufficient numbers  of people are registered and have been confirmed to be  appropriate petitioners is agreed.  
<P>
As I understand it, the process is the same for all the  other major cities of the United States. Washington D.C.  uses the same system. I have a copy of its arrangements,  which take up only four pages.  
<P>
I have a further copy of the arrangements for a smaller  town, Waterville in Maine, where the procedure has  recently been used. I had not heard of it, the town,  although I am told that it is famous as the place from  which Edmund Muskie came and where George Mitchell  was born. According to the Boston Globe, it is also a  town where  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"local politicians occasionally behave less than statesmanlike.  Since 1980, Waterville has seen three of its mayors convicted of  drunken driving, disorderly conduct, and felony embezzlement"	,  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
so the town uses the system relatively often and feel that  it is useful.  
<P>
Importantly, I also have a three-page copy of the rules  that have been and contrive to be used in San Francisco,  a large American city where the power of recall exists.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I look forward to receiving the detailed  information that the hon. Gentleman offered. As he rightly  said, I am an admirer of the United States and of much, if  not all, of what goes on there. Nevertheless, I am curious  because the great cities that the hon. Gentleman  mentioned are nothing in size compared with Greater  London. The cost element therefore surely arises. Perhaps  the hon. Gentleman will tell us how much the power of  recall costs the Americans so that we can extrapolate from  his figures to get an idea of the scale of costs here. More,  importantly, will he tell us whether there is a mechanism  to prevent vexatious repetition of the process, which could  end up being extremely costly for the people of London?  We should at least be aware of that before we vote on the  hon. Gentleman's suggestions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Several questions arise from what  the right hon. Gentleman said. One is, "What is the cost?"	  First, the recall could be triggered by a vote of 90 per cent.  of the members of the assembly, which would cost nothing.  That would trigger an election, and the usual costs of a  London-wide election would be incurred. The Minister  gave us a rough estimate of the cost, and I defer to him in  terms of accuracy. Of course, a cost would be involved. One  could, however, argue that it would be less than that which  resulted from a corrupt mayor abusing his power and doing  entirely inappropriate things.  
<P>
The electorate would have to take the cost account. If  there were a process that triggered a new mayor's election  to the assembly, there would be a great debate in London  about whether we wanted the costs of a further election.  Clearly, it would be a three-stage process. The assembly  or the people would trigger it. There would then be a  referendum on whether the existing mayor should go. If  that succeeded, there would be an election.  
<P>
Secondly, there would of course be a cost for properly  administered petition gathering. I do not have a figure for  London because we have not had a UK experience and I  have not transposed the cost from an American city. I  should, however, tell the right hon. Gentleman that  although some of the American cities concerned are not  as big as Greater London, they are large metropolitan  conurbations St. Louis and San Francisco are hardly  small cities. Waterville, Maine is not a great conurbation,  but some of the other cities are. I accept that there is a  cost issue.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Edward Davey:</B> My hon. Friend will have noticed  that the new clause that the friends of the right hon.  Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) tabled  suggest that a petition would require one fifth of  Londoners to sign. The costs of verifying such a petition  would be larger than those of the recall petition that we  propose.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The right hon. Gentleman will want to  argue his alternative, which is a perfectly proper one to  put on the table. It will, however, also have a cost  implication if it triggers a process.  
<P>
I shall make two final points. First, all the examples  that I have found have a 10 or a 20 per cent. trigger in  terms of the electorate. My hon. Friends and I have  suggested a 10 per cent. trigger. The 10 per cent. would  not force the mayor out of office; it would trigger the  referendum that would force him out of office if a  majority of those voting wanted that. Ten per cent. of a  city as large as London would be 600,000 people. That is  not an insignificant number when one has properly to  attest and verify that those concerned are adults who may  vote and who are on the electoral register and that they  are not Mickey Mouses, Benjamin Disraelis or whoever.  
<BR>
   
<P>
We have included the alternative of a large majority of  the assembly voting for recall this is the debate between  the right hon. Gentleman and us, at least on paper  because we need unanimity. Let us take one example and  depoliticise it a bit. Let us imagine that, next year in  London, we elected a mayor who was a member of the  Green party, as happened only a couple of years ago in  Rome. Let us imagine that there was only one Green party  member in the assembly. It would therefore be possible  for a coalition to trigger, if it were so minded, the removal  of the mayor. If one asked for 100 per cent. agreement  among the assembly, every member would need to be  involved. I accept that if the mayor was from a minority  party, or was an independent, a figure of 90 per cent.  would allow a coalition of his political opponents to  trigger the process. They would not enter into that lightly.  
<P>
In a moment, my hon. Friend the member for Kingston  and Surbiton will speak to the other new clause that we  have tabled. That deals with the way in which the  assembly, if it were to choose to exercise the power that  we are discussing, would need to work out the  implications for itself.  
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman, in the course  of his research, found reference to any American town or  city that invokes its council men or board of councils  whether by 90 per cent., 35 per cent. or any other  percentage to go down the road of getting rid of its  mayor without a recall petition? I doubt that he would be  able to find such a place.  
<P>
Furthermore, does he accept that the absolute norm  for recall petitions in the United State of America is  25 per cent? California is exceptional in using the low  proportion of 10 per cent. British Columbia, the only  state or province of Canada in which the process is  followed, uses 40 per cent.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I did not know about the last of the hon.  Gentleman's facts.  
<P>
I have not asked the American embassy to give me a  comprehensive survey, but I understand that the figures  vary. In the United States, the percentage can be as high  as 25 per cent. or 20 per cent. Some of the larger cities  use 10 per cent. St. Louis, for example, has a process  whereby three quarters of the board of aldermen must vote  to remove, followed by a well-publicised public hearing  like an impeachment hearing during which the mayor  may call defence witnesses. That is followed by another  vote by assembly members. The rules list categories of  reasons that can trigger removal. The mayor can be  removed for  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"crime or misdemeanour in office, for grave misconduct showing  unfitness for public duty, or for permanent disability"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I am not saying that that way must be our way, or that  it is the only way. The Committee, or one of the Houses  of Parliament, could take the view that a 20 per cent.  trigger, or even one of 40 per cent., would be preferable.  Liberal Democrat Members believe that there should be a  trigger, and that it would be better to have a trigger at a  higher level than to have no trigger at all.  
<BR>
   
<P>
I hope that we are giving the Committee the  opportunity to consider an important power that is  normally found in other places with directly elected  mayors. This is the first time that there will be a directly  elected mayor in the United Kingdom. As the right hon.  Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) hinted,  he or she will not just be any directly elected mayor, but  the mayor for our largest conurbation. We believe that the  Committee should consider the issue, and agree to a way  forward that facilitates the provision of a power of recall.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I shall follow the substance and the thrust  of the hon. Gentleman's comments. He rightly pointed out  that my modest contribution to the debate comes from the  same stable. That is because the Bill proposes a radical  new constitutional arrangement for the governance of our  capital city. Serious thought must be given to what we are  doing, why we are doing it and where we are going.  
<P>
The radical break, in this respect, is that leaders, at local  and national levels, have always emerged from, and been  accountable to, their peers. Council leaders come from  the ranks of council members and Prime Ministers from  Members of Parliament. We understand that process, and  are familiar with it. The hon. Member for Southwark,  North and Bermondsey referred to the tragic demise of  Lady Thatcher, which many of us still find shocking and  regrettable. Nevertheless, it happened. The hon. Member  for Brent, East who I hope will contribute to the debate,  may well give us inside information on certain events that  occurred soon after the election of the GLC, of which he  was such a distinguished member. It is yet another rather  distant example, but appropriate.  
<P>
So we are well used to mechanisms of accountability,  whereby leaders are accountable to, and removable by,  their peer group the other elected representatives.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> The men in grey suits.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Men in whatever colour suits. As I look  round the room, I see that there are not too many grey  suits. The hon. Member for Ealing, North is not wearing  one; perhaps he is making a political statement.  
<P>
For the first time, there exists the possibility of electing  a chief executive in his or her own right, separately and  independently. Do we want to have a mechanism of  accountability and removal during that person's term of  office? I am with the hon. Member for Southwark, North  and Bermondsey in his contention that as a safety  mechanism, a reassurance to the people of London,  especially in the early, experimental phase of this radical  constitutional departure, we should provide them with a  mechanism whereby a chief executive, elected in his or  her own right, could be removed if, as I suggest in new  clause 9,  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the actions of the Mayor are deemed to be harmful to the  interests of the people of London."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
In using that wording, I confess that I contemplated  using terms such as "high crimes and misdemeanours"	.  However, I thought that that might be tempting fate. I  also wanted to distance this argument from personality or  personal behaviour. One of the difficulties that Americans  have got themselves into is trying to distinguish in their  minds and, indeed, in their impeachment mechanism  between the personal aspects and the constitutional or  administrative aspects of their president's behaviour.  
<P>
I thought that it would be useful to try to identify the  grounds on which removal would be contemplated and  legitimate. I deliberately drafted my new clause broadly  to explore that opportunity. We must ensure that such a  removal would be made not on the basis of personal  proclivities or behaviour, but on the judgment of what the  elected mayor is or is not doing for the people of London.  That would be the criterion.  
<BR>
   
<P>
There is also the important issue, on which the hon.  Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spoke at  some length, of the mechanism for removal. Although I  yield to few in my admiration of the United States, I am not  always prepared slavishly to copy what goes on there. If we  did, I would look to the excellent practice in many of the  smaller states where the state legislatures meet only briefly,  and once every two years. That would do the people an  enormous favour. I wish that I had had the foresight to table  amendments that would constrict the meetings of the  Greater London assembly to six weeks once every two  years. That would be the biggest favour we could do the  people of London. I fear that the proposed mechanism will  get seriously out of hand, but that is another debate for  another day. Indeed, that has given me a rather good  thought to which I will perhaps return on another occasion.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am interested in the right hon.  Gentleman's point about not wanting legislatures to meet  very often, when he seems to want this Committee to sit  the whole time. Can he explain that inconsistency?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Yes, indeed. I would be perfectly content  if this Parliament were to meet very rarely and therefore  had very few opportunities to legislate. Unfortunately, as  the Government have initiated a legislative process, I am  interested in scrutinising it and slowing it down as far as  possible. I think that I am reasonably consistent in that  regard.  
<P>
My fear is that the more assemblies we create, the more  possibilities will exist for excessive legislation. The  people of Scotland will learn that to their cost, I believe,  and I fear that the people of London may do the same.  However, in comparing the mechanisms proposed in my  new clause and in that of the hon. Member for Southwark,  North and Bermondsey, we are examining the feasibility  and workability of various approaches to holding the  mayor to account. I am uneasy about the approach of the  hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey,  which is derived from the practice of the United States. I  can see the likelihood that the mechanism could be very  expensive, especially where it requires a petition to be  signed by 10 per cent. of people entitled to vote and so  on. It was interesting that the hon. Gentleman was unable  even to estimate the cost of the process. I am sure that it  was an oversight, but he also did not answer my question  about vexatious or repetitious resort to the mechanism,  which could be extremely expensive.  
<P>
<H5>11.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
My approach is more simple and much less expensive.  I believe that assembly members should have some role  and some locus in the process, to enable them to decide  whether the mayor has taken actions that are, in the words  of my proposed new clause,  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"harmful to the interests of the people of London."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
They would be able to decide whether a process should  be initiated to decide upon removal of the mayor.  
<P>
I have proposed two thresholds. The initial resolution  should have the support of at least nine assembly  members. I have specified that deliberately, to try to  remove any vexatious elements such as a small minority  of members who wish to harass the mayor. I have  suggested that the high threshold of approximately two  thirds of the membership be required to pass the motion  in favour of removal. If assembly members were to agree  to such a motion, they would have to be aware that they  would be held to account if they were acting frivolously  or in a manner that was not fully justifiable. They would  be held to account at the next election if they were to  involve the people of London in a gratuitous or  unnecessary re-run of the mayoral election and in all the  expense that goes with it.  
<BR>
   
<P>
That series of hurdles and accountability is built into  the proposed mechanism. Such a mechanism is very  necessary. I hope that the Government and Ministers will  think long and hard about the proposed new clause before  they impose or inflict on the people of London even the  remote possibility of a mayor becoming a danger or a  liability. the hon. Member for Southwark, North and  Bemondsey suggested reasons why that might occur, such  as mental incapacity. It could occur for many other  reasons and be worse in ways that we can scarcely dare  to contemplate. The fact is that the possibility exists. The  Committee is considering how best to provide a  mechanism to ensure in-term accountability of a directly  elected mayor, over and above what has been  contemplated until now.  
<P>
The principle is the important thing, and I do not wish  to get too bogged down in the exact mechanism. I am  uneasy about the petition approach, and I do not want to  fall out with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and  Bemondsey about thresholds in the assembly. I am sure  that something can be worked out along the lines that I  have suggested. The figure of 90 per cent. is perhaps too  high, and may well be unachievable, but I recognise the  point that the hon. Gentleman made about that. I shall not  stand absolutely on the detail.  
<P>
New Clause 9 involves no collusion. I can rarely be  accused of colluding with the Liberal Democrats, and I  am rarely accused of colluding even with my own Front  Bench. It is instructive that the great minds of the hon.  Members on the Opposition Front Bench and myself have  independently concluded that something must be done. If  the Government were to agree in principle, we could reach  a broad agreement on the mechanisms. Surely, at this  early experimental stage of a radical departure in  governance, such a mechanism is the least that we should  provide to give assurance to the electorate of our great  capital city of London. They must be assured that there is  not the slightest risk that they could inadvertently inflict  on themselves a mayor who could do great damage to the  city. We must avoid that, which is why the new clauses  are so important.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> New clause 7 proposes that the mayor  resign if one fifth of the London electorate or 1 million  voters sigh up to a recall petition. The Committee has the  luxury of having on offer all three possible options for  recalling the mayor. My right hon. Friend the Member for  Bromley and Chislehurst ably proposed an assembly-only  option. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and  Bemondsey moved the assembly and referendum option,  and I am moving the referendum-only option. My right  hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst  made the important point that whichever route we go  down, there must be a mechanism for recalling the mayor  if the circumstances so demand. It is the principle that  is important.  
<P>
If the leader of a local authority runs amok, his own  group will remove him. Here in the House of Commons,  if for any reason the Prime Minister should lose the  confidence of the House, because his party enjoys a  majority in the House of Commons the definition of the  Prime Minister is the man who can command a majority  in the House of Commons the Prime Minister can be  removed. It does not matter what are the rules of each  individual party if the Prime Minister's party wants to  remove him, it can. Wherever we have a democratic  organisation under the present structure, in which the  Executive and the Legislature are merged, that state of  affairs exists.  
<P>
Here we have a new form of government. It is a unique  form of government, a pilot scheme for this country and  one heck of a pilot scheme at that. Here we have a clearly  defined separation of powers between the executive and  the legislature. The mayor is not dependent on the  assembly for his authority. If the assembly votes against  him on day one, that is irrelevant and meaningless; the  mayor can ignore the wishes of the assembly. The mayor  had his own mandate; he can campaign on his own  manifesto and programme. If that were what actually  happened, that would be fine.  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B> Mr. McNulty:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that  somehow schedule 5 is misleading? It says clearly that  the mayor must accept a budget suitably amended by the  assembly. The assembly has controls over the budget,  which I would have thought to be crucial.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes my point  for me. Let us suppose that the assembly decides what the  budget is to be. Will the mayor have to resign? No, he  will not; he will remain. There is absolutely nothing that  the assembly can do to remove the mayor. That is the  important point.  
<P>
Rightly, the Government have included controls over  the budget in the Bill, because the budget is the be all and  end all. What if the mayor takes leave of his senses? What  if he does as the Liberal Democrats did in the Isle of  Wight when they said that they wanted their own  currency? What if the mayor calls for London to become  a republic and claims independence? What if he loses  touch with reality? Those are not stupid questions; the  example of the Isle of Wight is genuine.  
<P>
This is the premier capital city of the world, and we do  not want it to be made a laughing stock by a mayor who  loses touch with reality. We need a mechanism to restrain  the mayor if sufficient people think that he should be  restrained. Our new clause does not call for the mayor to  be sacked; it calls for him to resign. He can submit  himself for re-election; if he gets a mandate, so be it.  However, there must be a clear limit to his powers. As  the hon. member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey  said, such a procedure is in common use in the United  States.  
<P>
I anticipate that the Minister for London and  Construction will deploy the issue of cost in his defence  against the new clauses. Substantial cost may indeed be  involved. For example, checking a recall petition of a  million voters will be a long and complex procedure. But  what is more important: that the mayor of London has  taken leave of his senses or that the Government are not  prepared to fund the true cost of democracy? Any  democratic process must contain checks and balances. We  have a balance on the budget, but nowhere else; we need  such a balance. All three new clauses provide different  scenarios, but their fundamental principle is that the  power of the mayor can be checked if it is appropriate to  do so.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Livingstone </B>(Brent, East): I share many of  the concerns that we have heard. The issue was largely  my initial objection to the creation of the post of mayor.  We will create a single powerful figure in a way that is  completely alien to all the normal practices of British  politics. Under those practices, if a leader whether a  Prime Minister or a council leader loses the confidence  of his or her colleagues, he or she can be removed. My  worry has always been that we will create a post into  which someone can be locked for four years, with very  few checks and balances. Initially, assembly members  were not even going to be paid a salary, but that has been  rectified so that there will be a more impressive assembly  to hold the mayor in check.  
<P>
What will happen if the mayor goes bad, in a variety  of ways? What if Londoners, having elected a mayor,  found out a few months later that there were some  extremely dubious practices in his or her background, but  that the legal process might take several years? What  would have happened if Lady Porter had been elected  mayor of London a few months before all the shenanigans  in Westminster and the 27 million that was  misappropriated to help the Tories get re-elected came to  light? With her money, Lady Porter has already been able  to protract the case for more than a decade. She could  have served the entire term. There would be no  mechanism to remove someone like that.  
<BR>
   
<P>
I have not the slightest doubt that, given the structure  of votes on this Committee, the new clauses will be  defeated, but we are discussing a fundamental weakness  in the Bill. I assume that it will receive a lot of attention  in another place and that it might come back altered to  reflect these concerns.  
<P>
Given the size of London, there are particular problems  with a referendum for a recall. It would be easier to hold  such a referendum in a smaller area. The process is not  frequently used. I am aware of only one removal in recent  years of a large governmental figure in America the  governor of the state of Utah or Nevada, but then he had  gone completely mad and become openly racist and  anti-semitic. Those views became apparent only after the  election. Most of the instances that we are talking about  are quite small.  
<P>
A more realistic and speedier option for checking the  mayor would be to have a fixed proportion of assembly  members able to remove him or her; but when I argue  about that with my colleagues, they point to what is going  on in Washington at the moment, where, on a purely  partisan basis, the concept of high crimes and  misdemeanours has been reduced to the level of fellatio.  It is absolute nonsense.  
<P>
Given the partisan nature of our politics, it would be  easy to assemble perhaps a two-thirds majority,  particularly if there were one or two disgruntled people  whom the mayor had upset by not putting them on the  foreign travel circuit or something. Perhaps we should  consider requiring a two-thirds majority amongst the two  main parties, so that there would be a much more  bipartisan approach.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that,  although my attempt may not have been ideal, an effort  should at least be made to include a criterion for removal,  which might remove the personal elements that have  bedevilled the impeachment process in the United States?  The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey  suggested a threshold of 90 per cent; but, as has often  been said in Committee, it is likely that no party will  command even a simple majority in the assembly that we  all envisage. If, however, a threshold is set of even two  thirds, a number of parties would have to club together  even to get near it, which would provide a safeguard  against the situation that worries the hon. Member for  Brent, East.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> There is no suggestion before us that  completely encompasses the issue. That is why I assume  that something might appear at a later stage. We must find  an answer.  
<P>
Reference was made to the removal of Andrew  McIntosh from the Greater London Council. That is a  classic example of how our party system works to its best.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury):  He did not think so.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> He wouldn't would he?  
<P>
When a party leader has lost the confidence of his Chief  Whip, of his deputy leader and the majority of the  members of his shadow Cabinet, it is not likely that he  will survive for long. That is the simple reality. I do not  think that the McIntosh incident came as a surprise, given  that the Evening Standard headlined it day after day  throughout the campaign. The only person who seemed to  be surprised was Andrew McIntosh.  
<P>
<H5>12 noon  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John McDonnell </B>(Hayes and Harlignton): I do not  wish to recount the history of Andrew McIntosh I shall  save it for my memoirs.  
<P>
The argument against introducing a mechanism that is  solely dependent upon the assembly or on party caucuses  is made on the grounds that the mayor's authority is an  executive authority derived from the people. The authority  of the assembly is one of scrutiny, and is also derived  from the people.  
<P>
One way of overcoming that argument would be to  provide that if, for example, a two-thirds majority of the  assembly wishes to exercise a recall power, the power  should go back to the people. In other words, the assembly  and mayor should both go back to the people for  re-election, to decide whether a mandate for both is  renewed. That would overcome the argument that the  people's role is undermined.  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> My hon. Friend is pointing towards  the best way out of the dilemma, by suggesting that a  resolution to remove the mayor should trigger an election  for everybody. That would concentrate the mind against  frivolous nonsense. I doubt whether members of the  House of Representatives who have been voting for  impeachment would be quite so keen if they had thought  that they were about to trigger an election in four or five  weeks' time.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman reflect  on another strong reason why such a proposal might be  the way forward? If the decision were left, as he suggests,  to the majority of the two major parties or whatever else,  there would always be a danger that an independent  mayor, a Green party mayor or a mayor who was not from  a major party could regularly be threatened by the larger  parties saying that they are about to trigger the process.  That, too, would be unsatisfactory.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> I am loath to get into too many  hypothetical examples. It is highly unlikely that an  independent candidate would be elected to the post of  mayor, although I understand that the Labour party  machine has commissioned an opinion poll to examine  the possibility. Why that should be the case, I have not a  clue, but there we are.  
<P>
It should also be borne in mind when discussing recall  petitions that the old Labour GLC managed to get more  than 1 million signatures on a petition against its  abolition. That was a vast undertaking, the organisation  of which cost the GLC a considerable amount of money.  Many staff were occupied with the petition, as were a  huge number of supporters across London. It still took  months, however, and such an undertaking is not easy in  a city of this size.  
<P>
I am rather inconclusive about the matter. I do not like  voting against my party; I think that I am working my way  towards a fighting abstention. I apologise, Mr. O'Hara, for  not welcoming you to the Committee, but I am always so  disturbed when I find myself at odds with my party that  it is hard to focus my thoughts.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> My welcome to you, Mr. O'Hara,  is truncated but none the less warm.  
<P>
So far, two aspects of the new clauses have been  debated. One aspect is the principle, which all of the new  clauses share, that the Bill should contain some power to  check the executive and to enable the dismissal of the  mayor. That is surely the ultimate exercise in  accountability, and should be contained in the Bill. My  hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and  Bermondsey mentioned the need for such provision in  case the mayor is ill. Other examples have been given.  
<P>
The principle has been well expressed, and reflects  historic conventions in this place and elsewhere in British  politics, whereby votes of no confidence in councils and  in Parliament have been the trigger for holding the  executive to account. Votes of no confidence in the  council chamber, on the Floor of the House of Commons  and in party caucuses have been the way in which we  have traditionally held leaders and executives to account.  
<P>
The new form of government introduced by the Bill  needs a different kind of system. That is why the  Government should consider the various options before  them and choose one. As the hon. Member for Croydon,  South said, there are three families of option forms of  recall, votes of no confidence and impeachment  proceedings. Various factors should be weighted in the  balance when choosing between those three options. One is  how they link back to the electorate. I share the view of the  hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell)  that any trigger for holding the executive to account should  have a direct link back to the voters of London.  
<P>
There is also the issue of cost, which the right hon.  Member for Bromley and Chislehurst mentioned. The  process needs to be efficient, partly because we want to  ensure that the threat to the executive is a real one, and  likely to be triggered if needed.  
<BR>
   
<P>
Another factor to be borne in mind when making a  choice is whether the option will be workable in terms of  the relationship between the mayor and the assembly.  Would it allow the normal workings of the assembly and  the mayor the budget process and debates on the  mayor's strategies and policies to take place without  gridlock? My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark,  North and Bermondsey referred to that point. Would it  ensure that there was no partisanship, so that party politics  would not get in the way of effective government? That  is a problem that I envisage with the impeachment option  under the new clause tabled by the right hon. Member for  Bromley and Chislehurst. As we have seen in the United  States, it is possible for partisan politics to come into play  during an impeachment process.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> May I interject a note of caution?  Surely the whole point of party is that it can effectively  focus attention on abuses where they occur. Per se, there  is nothing wrong with partisanship it needs to be judged  on its merits. Therefore, there is a role for parties acting  together in the Assembly.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's  remarks but, as we have seen in the United States,  partisanship can be taken too far. I ask the hon. Gentleman  to reflect on the authors of the federalist papers when they  set up the constitution, and the impeachment process  within it. The papers clearly state that the impeachment  process was designed to try to prevent partisanship; but  the intentions of the authors of the federalist papers are  being overridden, as we can see from current events.  Partisanship has become powerful, so potent a force,  possibly because politics today are geared by the media.  
<P>
We need to be concerned about the abuse of  partisanship. That is why Liberal Democrat members are  worried about a process that relies only on the members  of the assembly, even given a qualified majority system.  New clause 2 tries to get around that problem by ensuring  that if members of the assembly voted by a qualified  majority to remove the mayor, they would have to face  the consequences of that vote and go back to the  electorate. Such a system is in place in another capital  city. The major metropolitan authority in Tokyo, whose  population is similar to London's, operates that system. I  am grateful to the Japanese local government centre,  which faxed me with regard to the operation of votes of  no confidence and council dissolution in Tokyo.  {Interruption.] It is in Japanese, but I have translated it  for the Committee.  
<P>
The process is simple. If a governor or mayor cannot  reach a compromise with the council on an issue sharply  dividing them, the council can declare a vote of no  confidence. To do so, a two-thirds quorum is needed, and  at least three quarters of those present must support the  motion. Once that is agreed, as a counter measure, the  governor or mayor is entitled to dissolve the council and  call for a local election to resolve the matter. If there is  no dissolution order within 10 days of the vote of no  confidence, the governor or mayor must resign.  
<P>
That process ensures that a vote of no confidence is not  used frivolously, but only for serious purposes. It ensures  that there is a tie back to the electorate because the  assembly has to face re-election. Such a system strikes a  balance between the factors that I outlined. It ensures that  there is effective government and a link to the electorate  and that costs are kept to a minimum.

<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> The hon. Gentleman relied on the Tokyo  example and said that a three-quarters quorum must be  present and that a proportion of it must vote in favour.  That must result in a much lower figure than the 90 per  cent. for which his colleague, the hon. Member for  Southwark, North and Bermondsey, argued not long ago.  For which level of threshold is the hon. Gentleman  arguing a proportion of a proportion or 90 per cent.?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The new clause tabled by my  hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and  Bermondsey, which I support, is one of two options  whose merits we need to debate. My hon. Friend's new  clause is linked to a recall petition. It is, therefore,  probably more appropriate for it to contain a higher  threshold. The new clause to which I am speaking is  linked to the re-election of the whole assembly. The issues  are not directly comparable; one must not confuse apples  and pears.  
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman </B>(Chipping Barnet)): I have read  the hon. Gentleman's new clause with great care and  attention. Will he tell us whether, in the event that it is  accepted, the new elections will be for the remaining,  unexpired term for a full four-year term? If it is the latter,  does that not conflict with clause 3(2), which states that  the second and third ordinary elections to the assembly  will be held by order of the Secretary of State on the first  Thursday in May?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for that intervention, which  allows me to clarify our intention, which is that the  election should be for the unexpired term.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I am intrigued by the Japanese example,  but does not the hon. Gentleman agree that he has proved  the reverse of his argument by quoting Japanese  municipal and national legislatures? Those have, with the  greatest respect to fellow parliamentarians in Japan, been  a byword for nepotism, self-aggrandisement and  corruption since the McCarthy reforms in 1946. Is not it  the case, therefore, that one can have a perfect system  with a highly imperfect consequence? What is proposed  in the Bill is far more realistic and goes with the grain of  human experience. The Japanese model might be perfect  theoretically, but the practical consequences have been  utterly disastrous.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I agree that the reasons for nepotism in  Japanese politics are numerous, but they do not extend to  the city of Tokyo. [Interruption.] If Labour Members will  hear me out, I will explain. Nepotism is rife in the  Japanese Parliament, but it is less so in the municipal  authority in Tokyo. I urge Labour Members to think about  how well the city of Tokyo is run, about its transport  systems and about how clean it is. In my previous job, I  had the pleasure of visiting Tokyo, and I was extremely  impressed by how easy it was to get around the city and  by how clean it was. That system of government has  something to recommend it in its practical outcomes.  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> To finalise his response to the  hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman), does  my hon. Friend agree that if a vacancy arose during the  mayor's term of office, an election would not quite  reasonably, I hope be expected within six months of the  original election or in the last six months of the mayor's  term? Clearly, one cannot have elections back to back.  The precedents elsewhere in the world exclude the first  and last six months. We are talking about when we are  sure that somebody has gone off the rails rather than about  when we think that they might have.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that  clarification. It helps me now that I am coming to the end  of the current part of my contribution.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): I am intrigued by all  the Japanese references. I understand that the ruling party  in Japan for many years, which was responsible for the  corruption to which my hon. Friend the Member for  Ealing, North referred, was a liberal democratic party.  Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that that is the case?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> What is in a name? New Labour, old  Labour, socialist parties, labour parties I think that the  hon. Gentleman is on dangerous ground.  
<P>
The options for holding the mayor to account that are  before the Committee range from an extreme version of  recall, whereby a hugh number of petitions would be  needed to trigger the recall, to the milder form proposed  by Liberal Democrat Members a no confidence vote,  followed by the re-election of the assembly to another  extreme, the impeachment process. My hon. Friends and  I considered all these options before we tabled our new  clauses, which contain reasonable proposals that are in  line with the British political system. New clause 2, in its  link with the vote of no confidence, echoes a recognisable  feature of our system. The options in our new clauses  have more merit than the other two options that have  been proposed.  
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
I am concerned that the Government have failed to  produce their own option for holding the mayor to account.  I wonder whether that relates to other aspects of the Bill.  Clause 27(10(b), for example, refers to the Secretary of  State's power to overturn anything that the mayor or the  assembly wishes to do. Apparently, the Government want  to prevent the mayor and the assembly from taking  measures that would be disliked by the people of London  by giving that power to the Secretary of State. That is not  democratic it does not give the people of London the final  say. Unfortunately, that is typical of the Government's  approach. They do not want to increase democracy in  London by giving Londoners the power to hold the mayor  to account. I hope that Labour members, having heard all  the arguments, will reflet on that. The Bill should build in  procedures for the proper accountability of the Executive. I  hope that Labour members of the Committee will have the  courage of their convictions and vote for better  accountability.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I have intervened only once this morning,  during the speech of the hon. Member for Southwark,  North and Bemondsey. As interventions should always be  short, Mr. O'Hara, I did not welcome you to the Chair on  that occasion, but I am delighted to do so now.  
<P>
The figures in the new clauses tabled by the hon.  Member for Kingston and Surbiton and by my right hon.  Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst  approximate almost exactly to the figure that is currently  required in the United States Senate for the removal of  the President of the United States.  
<P>
I shall not dwell on that coincidence, although I remark  in passing that the charge of perjury, which the President  faces, removed the only two Privy Councillors who have  had to resign their Privy Council offices since the second  world war namely Jack Profumo, for a statement that  he made to the House of Commons, and my constituent  Jonathan Aitken. Perjury is, therefore, a serious charge.  
<BR>
   
<P>
Members of the Committee may have forgotten that the  option of impeachment still exists in this country. It was  last taken up in the early years of the previous century. I  shall not test your patience by going into immense detail,  Mr. O'Hara. The motion was put down against Melville,  who was in Pitt's Cabinet. The vote resulted in a dead  heat. The Speaker of the day argued, using a certain  interpretation of the convention, that the motion was the  original proposition, and that the Government amendment  to the impeachment motion followed on from that. The  Speaker therefore voted for Melville's impeachment, and  that later took place in the House of Lords. In fact, in the  fullness of time, he was acquitted.  
<P>
I remark absolutely in passing that the Prime Minister  of the day, Pitt, was led from the Chamber in tears. There  are widespread grounds for thinking that the impeachment  hastened his death, which occurred at the beginning of  1806. I include that detail because it tells the Committee  that were a mayor to be removed from office in London,  the Prime Minister of the day might find his demise  hastened by that event. We can think of particular mayors  who might cause that. We wish no human being ill,  including the present Prime Minister, so that consideration  must remain at the back of our minds.  
<P>
The principle of impeachment is totally properly rooted  in our constitution. There was a passing reference to  illness earlier. The hon. Member for Harrow, East made  an extremely well informed intervention about practice in  the United States and referred to the health of President  Yeltsin. I remind the whole Committee of the legendary  lines penned by the then poet laureate about King Edward  VII on his deathbed:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Across the wires the electric message came: `He is no better, he  is much the same.'"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
Mr. Alfred Austin was also responsible for lines  concerning Mafeking. I must say in a low voice that the  Minister for Transport in London was surprised that I had  not introduced Mafeking into a recent debate. I therefore  also offer the Committee the following couplet about  Mafeking:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"They did not know what blench meant, They stayed in their  entrenchment"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That is so bad a couplet that I am entirely careless whether  it is applied to the Government or the Opposition  members of the Committee.  
<P>
It is sensible to include in the Bill a provision along the  lines of the new clause proposed by my hon. Friend the  Member for Croydon, South, or of the new clauses  proposed by other members of the Committee. The  novelty of the office should prompt action on our part.  
<P>
We all know the stories of Tammany Hall; we all know  the stories of Boss Prendergast of Kansas City. You would  rule me out of order, Mr. O'Hara, if I dwelt on that other  Irish-American city boss who, on returning to Dublin and  building the present British residence in Dublin, which  the Government are seeking to sell, was involved in a  bizarre story involving the burial of his Cherokee princess  wife and his favourite racehorse a story worthy of the  late constituent of the hon. Member for Regent's Park  and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), Mr. Sherlock Holmes.  However, I will not dwell on that, except to say that  municipal potentates are capable of eccentric behaviour.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I am extremely  grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way. While he  is speaking of municipal potentates, will he bear in mind  the case of mayor Jimmy Walker of New York, whose  affairs had afterwards to be tidied up by Mayor  La Guardia? Mayor Walker was perhaps epitomised by  his own claim: "Who wants to be President when you can  be Mayor of New York?"	  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am aware that given the collective  wisdom of the Committee, any number of American  instances could be cited in support of our new clauses.  
<P>
I acknowledge that the detail of the new clauses needs  to be debated. I must express surprise that the Government  have not afforded us the opportunity for such a debate by  tabling an appropriate provision themselves.  
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> As is customary, I welcome you to the  Chair, Mr. O'Hara. Hopefully, you will not be called on  for too many sittings we will be, but with your three  colleagues, you can share the load more than we can.  
<BR>
   
<P>
I note that both the right hon. Member for Cities of  London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) and the hon.  Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked why the  Government did not have a proposal. Our proposal for a  balance between the assembly and the mayor is the Bill  and all the checks and balances therein.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> That is not enough.  
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that it is not  enough, which is an entirely reasonable point. However,  I have to say that apart from fatuous incantations of a  mantra that there should be a referendum for a recall  because there should be the case has not been well made  by either Opposition Members or the odd dissenting  Labour Member.  
<P>
People go wrong when they invoke the notion of what  exists thus far in Britain. The post of mayor is an  individual, elected, executive post. It is not akin to that of  Prime Minister, nor to that of the leader of a party or a  faction within an executive or legislature. It is a separate,  distinct and individual position. Therefore, whether it is  McIntosh versus Livingstone or Thatcher versus the many  grey suits or white coats, the examples are not germane  to the particular configuration of governance that is  before us.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> That is the point.  
<P>
<B> Mr. McNulty:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to  intervene, I will let him, but he should not be so rude as  to intervene from a sedentary position.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway rose   </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman  can allow the Chairman to keep the Committee  sufficiently in order. I understand that he has given way  to the hon. Member for Croydon, South.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for  giving way. Is not what he was saying exactly the point?  There is a separation of powers between the mayor and  the assembly and there is an imbalance. The examples  that he gave are drawn from situations where there is a  method of containing the excesses of the leader of  whatever organisation it is.  
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I apologise to you, Mr. O'Hara, for  foolishly trying to do your job.  
<P>
Someone mentioned apples and oranges earlier, which  is entirely the point: the hon. Member for Kingston and  Surbiton is trying to compare apples and oranges. We are  not talking about the titular or otherwise head of a faction  in a group of elected people within an institution of  governance, we are talking about separate, individual post  which we contend is more than adequately accounted for  in terms of checks and balances by clause 14, which  prescribes that disqualification can occur under the Audit  Commission Act 1998, as a result of a conviction under  our criminal law, or for breaches of part II of the  Representation of the People Act 1983. Further  disqualifiers are the number of meetings the mayor can  miss in the course of his or her term a point that we  discussed ad nauseam a la the number of angels who can  dance on a pin head and the budget restrictions in  schedule 5, to which I have already alluded. Hon.  Members pooh-poohed the latter as a minor point, but, in  the end, the assembly can, by a two-thirds majority,  amend and determine the consolidated budget with which  the mayor will have to run. That is not a small point.  
<P>
Finally, the notion of fixed terms is just as much an  element of accountability. From the way that some  Opposition Members have been speaking, one would  think that we will be electing mayors for life or at least  for 15 or 20-year terms, rather than for four years.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway :</B> To take the example cited my right hon.  Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster,  if the mayor is found to have committed perjury, does the  hon. Gentleman think that he should remain in office?  If he elects to remain in office, will the hon. Gentleman  acknowledge that there is no way of removing him?  
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> In such a case and also in the case of  Shirley Porter, who was mentioned by my hon. Friend the  Member for Brent, East the law must take its course.  The hon. Gentleman is saying, "Never mind the law, we'll  get rid of the individual who happened to be elected  mayor, regardless of whether they are subsequently found  innocent under law."	 That is not appropriate and does not  accord with natural justice.  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B> Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am surprised that the hon.  Gentleman can even begin to persuade himself of the  merit of his argument. Is he really saying that the people  of London should have no say for the rest of a four-year  term, no matter how off the rails the mayor goes, no  matter whether he is locked up, awaiting trial, convicted,  physically or mentally incapacitated, cannot do or does  not want to do the job, or lives in the Bahamas? Is he  really saying that it should not be possible to throw the  mayor out?  
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> For the best part of the past hour and a  half, much of what the hon. Gentleman has said has been  either fatuous or tortuous, and his last comment comes  close to being both. Much of what he just said is covered by  what I read out regarding the Audit Commission Act 1998  and the Representation of the People Act 1983. If a mayor  is committed and incapacitated under law, he will no longer  be able to pop along to six meetings int he period provided  for in the relevant clause. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is  trying to tell me that the mayor will get a day pass; perhaps  he is saying that if the mayor is committed to the Royal Free  under the relevant portions of the Mental Health Act 1983,  he might get a dispensation to pop along to the monthly  meetings of the Greater London assembly in some capacity  or other. If the hon. Gentleman can show me the relevant  section of the Act, which says that those elected to  executive, London-wide positions, who go a bit doolally  and are committed can get a dispensation to pop along to  Greater London assembly meetings. I will happily concede  the point.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?  
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> You can try again, but please do not be  fatuous this time. I am serious. I accept the legitimacy of  what the hon. Gentleman said, but not the principles or  that the case was well made. His last point was, however,  entirely fatuous. If his next one is, I will not let him  intervene again.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman  was not accusing me of being fatuous in the introductory  part of his statement.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman was  not accusing anybody of being fatuous.  
<P>
I want to put a specific case to the hon. Gentleman.  The current Prime Minister of Sri Lanka is a lady in her  eighties. She is in a wheelchair and is brought to the  meetings of Parliament. She remains in office by the grace  of her daughter, who is the President. She plays no  significant or substantive role in the government of the  country. None the less, she attends Parliament and can  vote, although her health is extremely frail. A Labour  Member gave the example of Roosevelt. Is the hon.  Gentleman really saying that the people of London should  not be able to bring pressure to bear on somebody not to  continue in his post when he has such seniority of office  and runs the city?  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B> Mr. McNulty:</B> I apologise for even remotely  suggesting that you were fatuous, Mr. O'Hara. I was, of  course, not doing so. I was, however, happily suggesting  that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and  Bermondsey was fatuous, as he invariably is.  
<P>
We are talking about four-year terms. I hope, for the  individual's sake, that the example that the hon.  Gentleman gave of the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka did  not arise three, six or nine months after an election. I  would have hoped that someone would have spotted that  the woman concerned was an 82-year-old who was a bit  debilitated and not an appropriate choice.  
<P>
The hon. Gentleman gave an unfortunate example when  he was speaking about a tangential point in the American  context. He mentioned Muskie, who came from Maine.  He was hounded out of office by precisely the sort of  vexatious rumour mongering that might now be  institutionalised and formalised by the recall referendums  that have been proposed. Sometime in his dim and distant  past, Muskie had electrotherapy for a bout of depression  and was hounded out of the vice-presidency nomination  for his party because of that. Colleagues I nearly said,  "Comrades"	 might remember the tears in his eyes as he  was hounded out of office.  
<P>
None of the new clauses even that tabled by the right  hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, who spoke  about the trigger point of nine members does anything  to allay my fears about vexatious attempts to get rid of  the mayor. That is certainly the experience in America.  
<P>
Anyone can play silly little "What if?"	 games, and I  suppose that some hon. Members will do so frequently in  this Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give  way?  
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Go on then, for entertainment, if for  nothing else.  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I am extremely grateful for the gracious  way in which the hon. Gentleman gave way. While we  are on the subject of Edmund Muskie, am I not right in  saying that he was not hounded out of office? Perhaps  the hon. Gentleman is thinking to Tom Eagleton. Edmund  Muskie stood unsuccessfully for Vice-President and then,  as I recall, resumed his role as senator for Maine. He  subsequently became a member of the Cabinet.  
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not  hear me. I said that he was hounded off the ticket, not  hounded out of office. If we dwell as I think is  appropriate on some of the American examples, they do  not stand much scrutiny, not least for some of the reasons  suggested by Opposition Members in defence of their  little new clauses.  
<P>
In some cases the quorum, or trigger floor, in terms of  recall balance, is woefully low. I will bore the Committee  in a moment with the example of British Columbia  because it is a useful device for examining some of the  other points made by Opposition Members. 
<P>
In California, the quorum for a recall is effectively 12 per  cent. not 12 per cent. of those registered on the voting roll,  which is in itself a dubious figure in the American context,  but 12 per cent. of those who voted the last time that that  particular official was voted into office. In many cases, the  figure required in referendums on recall is 12 per cent. of  the 25 per cent. of people who had bothered to vote in an  election, which is a woefully small number. That will lead,  as most recall referendums do, to vexatious and spurious  attempts to obtain recalls in that fashion.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, in the  new clauses that he is speaking against, there is a  dichotomy between the theorising and the practicalities?  For example, in Washington, Marion Barry was a mayor  who, by any reasonable interpretation, could be described  as having completely lost the plot. None the less, he was  re-elected by a massive majority.  
<P>
The comparable situation in Chicago was the  administration of the second mayor Daley Richard  Daley Junior which was characterised for many of us by  an endless and constant flow of recall petitions that  paralysed the administration of the city. The situation was  characterised for many of us by the large sign apparent  during the Richard Daley recall campaign, which said  something like, "women of Chicago want their Dick  Daley."	 Very little business was done by the  administration. Does my hon. Friend agree that here again  we see the dichotomy between the ideal and the real  worlds?  
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I certainly agree with the substantive  point made by my hon. Friend, if not with some of the  detail. A close look at some of the north American  experiences, which are the most appropriate examples,  will show how in reality, behind the overall figures for  the use of recall ballots, recalls are not the wonderful  democratic tool of accountability that has been suggested.  They are used, more often than not, by the embittered and  the vanquished.  
<P>
Recalls are used at all levels in the American context,  so overall cumulative figures are meaningless. To suggest  that there have been 185 or 200 recalls in Georgia since  inception, or 80 recalls from 1974 to 1981 in Oregon,  misses the point. More often than not, those recalls are at  small-town level, and although they involve more than  the dog catcher or the registrar of births those examples  perhaps over-simplify the matter they often do not  amount to much more.  
<P>
There have been attempts to recall five of the last seven  Californian governors, but the petitions failed because  they require more than one million votes. They were  almost exclusively partisan generated. Regan's  republicans were against Brown, and vice versa when  Regan was in office. To suggest that the new clause  proposes an acute tool or device for the people of London  does not stand up to scrutiny.  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument  that the recall powers have been tried but have not  succeeded is not an argument against the new clause, but  an argument for it. Giving people the power to see  whether they could get 10 per cent. of the electorate,  properly defined, on their side, would at least provide  them with an opportunity to succeed. If they could not,  they would realise that the public were not going to  support what they were doing.  
<P>
<B> Mr. McNulty:</B> No, I do not accept that. That seems to  be the opposite and equal case that anywhere that a recall  referendum succeeded, it would have succeeded for  legitimate reasons. That is not the case at all.  Referendums are devices that in many instances  although not all, with the increase of single-issue politics  in the United States become simply another device in  the partisan process.  
<P>
We may therefore reach a stage I shall come to this  shortly when discussing some other clauses where, for  example, in May 2002 there could be a Lib-Lab, or  non-Tory, two-thirds majority in the assembly and the  Conservatives could have managed to get their  shoplifter-cum-insider-trader elected. In that context, it  would be possible for entirely malevolent reasons that  are not in the interests of the people of London to get  rid of poor, dear old Jeffrey before he had had a chance  to exercise what he has paid so much to exercise now.  
<P>
According to new clause 2, so unably moved by the  hon. member for Kingston and Surbiton, the mayor could  be removed not by a two-thirds majority of the assembly,  but under the rules set out in clause 45 governing a  quorum by as few as seven people voting to get rid of  him. The new clause does not require an absolute  two-thirds majority of the 25 members of the assembly; it  simply requires a two-thirds majority.  
<P>
The Government are, quite rightly, not setting out in  detail the internal mechanisms and standing orders of the  assembly. As clause 45 states, it is a matter for the  assembly to set its quorum. However, the Tokyo example  quoted by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton is  not that far from the proposal in new clause 2, because of  the sloppy drafting of that new clause. If we assume that  40 per cent. is a fair and reasonable level for a quorum,  that would translate into about 10 members of the  assembly. Therefore, on a vote of seven to three, under  the new clause, seven individual assembly members could  overturn what up to five million people had voted for in  the first place.  
<P>
We have heard all that cant and nonsense about  Opposition Members being democrats at heart, and all this  being about accountability; well, it is not. The only  absolutely honest speech we have heard in terms of  sincerity rather than accuracy was that of my hon.  Friend the Member for Brent, East. His position has been  entirely consistent: he does not want a mayor. He said  that to start with, and in the context of such a  conflagration between the mayor and the assembly, this is  exactly the sort of reason why he did not want one in the  first place.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give  way?  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> No, I do not think so.  
<P>
I contend, not least because of the American model,  that both the referendum and the recall would be  profoundly undemocratic. There is a body of  misunderstanding on the Opposition Benches as to how  distinct those two franchises are. It is not in the gift of the  assembly to determine what direction the mayor should  take, or for how long the mayor should survive in office;  nor is it in its gift to treat the mayor's executive position  like that of the leader of the local club, or, indeed, of a  Prime Minister.  
<P>
I shall give some figures to highlight the difficulties  involved in holding a referendum. British Columbia has  just had its first recall petitions. As the right hon. Member  for Bromley and Chislehurst pointed out, in British  Columbia it is not permissible to mess around and call a  recall referendum willy-nilly. First, one needs the support  of 40 per cent. of the registered voters not 40 per cent.  of those who voted last time and the proposers of the  recall petition have to be fully armed with details of how  they, not the state, are going to pay for it. There are limits  on how much they can pay for it and a process to  determine the expenditure limits.  
<P>
It is instructive to spend a little time considering the  limits. In British Colombia, there is a place called Prince  George North a delightful place, I am sure with 22,271  registered voters. The limited expenditure to secure 8,908  of those voters 40 per cent. of them is 28,000  Canadian dollars. The British Colombian authorities then  have 42 days to verify the signatures of 8,908 voters. That  might be a generous allocation of time, but will there be  sufficient time to verify each of the 504,000 signatures  required under new clause 1, given the current electorate,  or the 1,000,080 under the new clause proposed by the  hon. Member for Croydon, South?  
<P>

</P>
<P>
The weakest argument for all these sixth-form new  clauses is cost. It is fine if democracy costs a fortune.  However, to verify properly and to give all the due notice  outlined in the new clauses and to fit them in with the rest  of the Bill would take about two years.  
<P>
We have a scenario on which we have wasted the best  part of two hours where the mayor is elected, he or she  goes ga ga after about six months, after 30 days or after  whatever period the right hon. Member for Bromley and  Chislehurst suggests, and we have 35 days to call an  election under clause 16. There is no provision for the  verification process, or for who is going to pay and why,  and neither is there any provision for the period allowed  to verify the signatures. However, if the process is carried  out properly, I would contend not with a smile on my  face, but seriously that from start to finish, assuming  that the mayor has gone ga ga after only about six or nine  months, the process would take about two years.  
<P>
More often than not the process would run straight into  the six-month block that prevents an election either for  the assembly or for the mayor within six months of the  next election. Such a process would have nothing to do  with democracy or accountability, and to suggest such a  process is fundamentally to misunderstand the nature of  the relationship between the mayor, the assembly and  their respective franchises. That would be an honest  position to take if one were against the idea of a mayor  from the start, which is the entirely reasonable position of  my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East. In all other  circumstances, however, it is fatuous sixth-form nonsense  and should be slung out without further discussion or  encouragement in Japanese or any other language  from the anoraks.

<B> Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): Listening to  the comments of the hon. Member for Harrow, East, it  struck me forcefully that any of us could read out the  arguments of Ministers and then receive a speech from  the hon. Member for Harrow, East telling us why they  could not be supported. It seems that yet again he has  displayed his ability to argue that black is white and white  is black but he has done very little more.  
<BR>
   
<P>
We need to return to what the debates are about: the  deficiency of accountability in the institution and how we  go about rectifying that problem. It is clear from earlier  debates that the Government are not willing to concede  any changes in the balance between assembly and the  mayor. Therefore we must look at how we ensure that the  people of London have at their disposal a means to  remove the mayor in the circumstances that my hon.  Friends the Members for Southwark, North and  Bermondsey and for Kingston and Surbition described  earlier.  
<P>
The configuration of the mayor and assembly in the  Bill does not as the hon. Member for Croydon, South  said earlier put the assembly in the role of the legislature  that we have in this place. It puts the assembly in the role  of poodle to the mayor in that it is not given any means  to act as an effective check or balance. Those who are  now scrutinising the measures outside this place are  beginning to recognise that.  
<P>
I will share with the Committee concerns that have  been expressed by a number of constituents. Two weeks  ago my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and  Wallington (Mr. Brake) and I held a consultation meeting  with local voluntary organisations, including churches,  schools, and residents' associations in our two  constituencies to discuss the Government's proposals. To  be as fair as we could, we used the Department's briefing  material to structure that presentation, and we detailed the  relationship that would exist between the mayor and the  assembly under the Government's plans. We answered  questions, constantly referring to the Government's  briefing to ensure that we did not colour the presentation.  The Minister for London and Construction is laughing,  but there were many people there of his persuasion.  
<P>
The question that came back very forcefully from  people was, "How do we get rid of the mayor?"	 The  answer was that they could get rid of the mayor only after  four years, or by fulfilling the specific legal requirements  in terms of audits and so on. That horrified people. Some  people commented that, had they been aware at the time  of the referendum that that was the balance of power  being struck between the assembly and the mayor, they  would not have supported the referendum. Time will tell  whether that is a view that will be held widely in London.  
<P>
If the Government are not prepared to strike a better  balance between the assembly and the mayor, we need to  make sure that the mayor is more clearly accountable to  London through recall procedures. That is at the core of  the new clauses.  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a most  important point. The Committee will have benefited from  the allusion to his constituents' responses to the lack of  accountability in the mayoralty. Might the referendum  result not have been different if the people of London had  been able to vote on the mayoralty separately from the  assembly? Perhaps they wanted the assembly, and cast a  blind eye to the deficiency of accountability within the  mayoral office.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right.  I will not stray too far into a debate about the framing of  the referendum question because we have had that debate  ad nauseam. However, the point is a fair one that needs  to be made now.  
<P>
The mayor can have his policy and his capital budget  without the assembly's being able to change them. He can  have his revenue budget without the assembly having any  genuine scope for changing it. Given that, it seems to me  that we need to make sure that there are other ways in  which the mayor can be held to account. That is why  we have attempted, in the new clauses, to reflect genuine  concerns that exist outside this place about how the mayor  will be accountable through his term, not just at the  beginning and end of it. For that reason I support new  clauses 1 and 2, and urge the Government to give serious  consideration to them.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): I, too, welcome you to  the Committee, Mr. O'Hara.  
<P>
In the first few sittings of the Committee, the Liberal  Democrats and Conservatives focused their minds on  various issues relating to electoral arrangements and to  constitution. In my view, they did so without taking into  account the broad package the raft of measures  contained in the Bill. The mayor will be elected with a  powerful mandate, because of the supplementary vote  system that we will adopt. It would seem wrong to do as  the new clauses suggest and give the assembly power to  remove the mayor's powerful mandate soon afterwards.  
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East has  already referred to the assembly's powers, but it is worth  repeating them for the balance of the argument. Clauses  49, 50, and 51 give power to require attendance, power to  review and investigate, and proposals by the assembly   
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman has just referred to  powers to investigate, but what will be the results of such  investigations? The assembly has not been extended any  powers to do anything once it has concluded its  investigations.  
<BR>
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> The hon. Gentleman denies the powers  that assembly members will have in such situations. They  will act as scrutineers, having been elected to perform that  duty. If I were a member of the assembly, I would  scrutinise what the mayor does in that way and with those  powers. The hon. Gentleman's point is entirely wrong.  
<P>
There is also the important power in clause 72 and  schedule 5 in relation to the budget, and the power to  require the attendance of the mayor at meetings. In  addition, there is the power of disqualification granted  under the Audit Commission Act 1998 and  disqualification because of a conviction under the  Representation of the People Act 1983. Many of the  points that have been made seem to ignore the provisions  of the 1983 Act. Section 72 of the Local Government Act 1972 deals with proceedings for disqualification and  the courts have powers in individual instances. For  example, if a mayor acts ultra vires, the powers exist to  go to court and they will not be taken away. The assembly  could pass a vote of no confidence and the implication of  such a vote should not be ignored.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman spell out  the implications of a vote of no confidence?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> Yes. A vote of no confidence would be a  public issue.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We are waiting.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> Please let me develop the point. If the  assembly passed a vote of no confidence, the whole of  London would be aware of that. I fail to see how a mayor  could continue with his policies while ignoring such a  vote.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Why not put such a provision in the  Bill?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I do not think that that is necessary. The  ability to pass a vote of no confidence is inherent in the  powers of the assembly.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> If we tabled an amendment proposing  that the mayor would have to go if the assembly passed a  vote of no confidence, would the hon. Gentleman  support it?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> The mayor would have to take such a vote  into account in his actions. The hon. Gentleman ignores  the executive power of the mayor. If we gave the  assembly the power to remove the mayor with just a vote  of no confidence, that could be used as a challenge to  the mandate of the mayor. It would be wrong to do that.  [Interruption.] However, as my hon. Friend the Member  for Harrow, East suggests, if we oppose the election of  the mayor, we can have this argument with justification.  If, as we propose, the mayor is to have executive powers,  it is wrong for us to curtail those powers given the other  checks and balances that will exist.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I ask the hon. Gentleman the question  that I asked the hon. Member for Harrow, East. If the  mayor were found to have committed perjury, does the  hon. Gentleman think that the mayor should resign. Will  he acknowledge that, if the mayor refused to do so, there  would be no mechanism to remove him from office?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> If the mayor were convicted of perjury,  he would be disqualified under the provisions of the Bill.  A prosecution could be brought for perjury, and the mayor  could be disqualified if the case was that serious. The  power is clearly included in the Bill. I hope that that  answers the point.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has answered the  point in a deeply confused way. If the clear majority  we can argue about the percentage of members of the  assembly, in the exercise of their critical faculties on  behalf of constituency and London-wide electors, feel that  the mayor is acting wholly in dereliction of his duty to  Londoners as set out in the Bill, they will not have a  mechanism to remove him. Would the hon. Gentleman be  satisfied if that were the case in any democratic assembly?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> If the mayor was acting ultra vires, as  the hon. Gentleman implies, the power exists, through the  courts, to remove the mayor.  
<P>
The recall procedure would be expensive. In  democratic terms, the proposal is defensible. However,  the difficulties of validation of a petition in a city of 8 million or 9 million people are so complicated   
<P>
