morning, Mr Brady. I hope that the motion will be one of the less
contentious elements of the day. As the Committee will be aware,
Tuesday 19 July is the last sitting day of the House before the summer
recess. In the event that the House decides to run Wednesday hours
rather than the usual Tuesday hours, if we do not change our sitting
times we will be sitting well beyond the rising of the House. Much as I
would be happy to do that, not everyone else might be, so in the event
that the House decides that its sitting hours will be as per a
Wednesday, as a concession I suggest that we amend our sitting hours as
set out on the amendment

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Erith and
Thamesmead for tabling new clauses 6 and 10, because they give us the
opportunity consider the important issue of charges. I am sure that the
hon. Lady will be with us soon. She made some important points, as did
the hon. Member for Leeds West, about how charges can have a big impact
on the pensions that people receive. Indeed, it is little understood
that a seemingly innocuous charge—what is 1.5% between
friends?—cumulated during 40 years of a pension can 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 262<a class="bkMark" name="Column262">&#160;</a>
                  </div>take a large slug of the final pension. Therefore,
even relatively small differences in charges can make a big difference.
Given that, ideally, we want as much money as possible going into
pensions not charges, it is entirely proper that the new clauses were
tabled. I do not believe that either of them would do what it says on
the tin or would achieve what they are meant to achieve but, in the
spirit in which they were tabled, I shall respond
positively.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 6 suggests that, when the employer is choosing a scheme for
auto-enrolment, he should take into account the level of charges.
Obviously, we hope that employer would do that anyway. The practical
impact of the new clause is not clear— what the penalty would be
if they did not do that; whether we would fine employers who did not
take account of charges. However, I agree that the level of charges is
important. Likewise, new clause 10 refers to the stakeholder terms and
conditions. That is partly to do with charges but, if we were to accept
the new clause, we would have to consider issues such as lifestyling
and transfers, which are part of the stakeholder terms and conditions,
so it is much broader than only the issue of charges. However, as I
said on Tuesday, I am keen to respond positively to such important
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Broadly
speaking in respect of charges, the Government have ensured that there
is a low-cost, good value-for-money provider in the market, which is
NEST. Its charging structure is a contribution charge on the way in of
just below 2%, and a 0.3% annual management charge. It is estimated
that, on average, that will work out at about a 0.5% AMC over the
lifetime of a pension, which is clearly well below stakeholder levels
and many of the products in the market. However, it might not be the
lowest and obviously employers will want to examine charges when
considering how best to fulfil their duties under
auto-enrolment.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Department for Work and Pensions has down its own research on such
matters, but at present the market is already operating below the 1.5%
stakeholder price cap. In fact, a stakeholder cap set at a 1.5% level
would rarely bite. The Department’s charges survey conducted in
2009 showed that the level of charge for workplace personal pensions is
lower than 1% for more than half the schemes and, in regard to default
options in occupational pension schemes, our research found that most
AMCs were between 0.4% and 0.6%, and no charges higher than 0.9% were
recorded.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have referred specifically to default funds, and they are an important
part of the charging debate. In other words, auto-enrolment inertia
means that most people will not be making active choices. They will be
put into a scheme and will stay there, because they will not get round
to getting out. As for which fund and set of charges that they face,
many people—most people, according to evidence on auto-enrolment
around the world—will end up in the default fund, because, by
definition, not being in the default fund depends on an active choice.
The characteristics of the default fund are therefore
crucial.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Department is in the process of issuing guidance on what default funds
should look like, and it specifically says that we need transparency in
relation to charges. We anticipate that there will be a very
competitive market, certainly for the larger firms. We already know
that the staging process brings in the largest firms first, and there
will be a lot of competition for this new growth 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 263<a class="bkMark" name="Column263">&#160;</a>
                  </div>in the pensions industry. We anticipate that the
presence of NEST in the market will bring charges down, which is
welcome. Therefore, we do not think there is a particular issue on
charges with the larger
firms.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
question then is whether the smaller or medium-size employer is
vulnerable to high charges. It is important to remember that part of
the reason why the market has not hitherto provided for such firms and
their employees—at all in many cases—is because they are
not profitable. Going to a one-person engineering firm in
the west midlands and trying to sell it a pension is a very expensive
thing to do. If that one employee is not particularly well paid, the
charges or the percentage of a low wage are not very much at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
therefore unlikely that an individual small employer will have what
someone described to me the other day as a man in a shiny suit turning
up and saying, “I’ve got this wonderful pension”
and so on. It could happen, but we think that the smallest firms will
get the letter from the regulator and they will see NEST flagged. Those
who are not very interested in all this pensions stuff will go for NEST
or will make a relatively simple choice. On the whole, because of the
costs involved, they will not have a sales force turning up and
spending time selling them a product. Therefore, we think the risks of
people facing high charges in practice are limited. Importantly, we
have powers under the Pensions Act 2008 to cap charges that are
excessive, and the industry knows that we have such
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
principle, we believe that competitive forces will bring charges down,
certainly for the larger firms. Many smaller firms will end up with
NEST, and the costs of selling to such firms will mean that a high-cost
provider is unlikely to spend money sending a salesman to them.
However, it is important that we are not complacent. I therefore
welcome both new clauses, which put the issue on the
agenda.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000026">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
issue of what are charitably called active member discounts or deferred
member penalties was raised on Tuesday. That is to say, once the firm
is no longer interested in me, because I work for somebody else, it
jacks up the charges. I heard recently of a leading member of a
financial institution, who had only just discovered how much the active
member discount or deferred member penalties were on his own pension.
He had not realised, since he left the firm that he had worked for, how
much the charges had gone up. Again, we insist on transparency of costs
and charges in default fund guidance. Our power to cap charges relates
only to active members in qualifying schemes, but there is an issue
about whether charge-capping powers should also extend to deferred
members.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000027">&#160;</a>

about transfers in and out of NEST in later amendments. However, if we
were able to transfer money into pensions, into NEST, we would get
round some of the problems of deferred member surcharges. We would not
have to endure the high fees, because we could transfer the money into
a lower-fee, lower-charging pension. I wonder whether we could think
about the two amendments together in that

                  </strong> The hon. Lady is entirely right. The issue of
charges is tied up inextricably with the issue of transfers into NEST
specifically, but transfers more 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 264<a class="bkMark" name="Column264">&#160;</a>
                  </div>generally. For example, in some countries when someone leaves a firm,
the default position is to either transfer the money into a new scheme
or into some other product, or they actively choose to remain in the
old scheme. That might be one way of addressing the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Earlier
this year, the Department issued a call for evidence on regulatory
differences between defined contribution trust-based and contract-based
pensions, focusing on short service refunds. Under current rules, in
one sort of pension someone who has worked for a firm for a short time
and has a small pot can get that money back, but in another sort the
money remains stuck. The question is whether that is right. Our
response is that we should do something about short service refunds,
because that money is taken out of pensions, but disentangling that bit
of the puzzle raises wider issues about transfers, including transfers
into
NEST.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
propose to publish in the autumn a document about transfers that will
partly deal with the issue of deferred member penalties, because, as
the hon. Lady said, if we can do something about transfers, the issue
of people becoming stuck with a previous employer and having their
charges jacked up will be much less significant. We will come on to
NEST shortly, but I will continue to reflect on the issue of deferred
member penalties, which the Department is considering in the context of
its wider work on
transfers.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
might ask why we do not just have a charge cap, but going straight in
with one is not as straightforward as it sounds. New clause 10 implies
using the stakeholder cap, but the difficulty is that that cap relates
only to annual management charges, whereas actual charges might be a
contribution charge—as for NEST—and the annual management
charge. Thought would therefore have to be given to how the cap applied
to schemes with different combinations of charges, to how those charges
were converted to a standard metric and to how charges are sometimes
higher because they relate to payment for a
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Someone
with a more sophisticated pension—raspberry ripple rather than
vanilla, in my description—might pay more for it, but might
receive a knickerbocker glory at the end. The analogy is slightly
tenuous—we will come on to frozen assets in a minute. It should
be possible for someone to choose a product that is more expensive,
provided they are aware of that, to get back something that they want,
such as active management. We would not therefore want to ban charges
above a certain level, but such charges would be applied only to
default funds. I could continue about the many permutations of how
caps, such as the simple version in new clause 10 of using the
stakeholder cap, would work in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000033">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There
is evidence that the stakeholder charge caps have had a downward impact
on the market, and we think that NEST will do the same. As I have said,
the Government specified that the stakeholder cap applied 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 265<a class="bkMark" name="Column265">&#160;</a>
                  </div>only to annual management charges. The difficulty with auto-enrolment is
that people will be auto-enrolled into existing schemes, as well as
into new ones, that have a variety of charging structures. For example,
if we are not careful we might set an AMC cap, but if people have only
the AMC, NEST would fall foul of that, because NEST includes a
contribution cost. We would have to think about how to convert a
contribution charge into an AMC, which might create new
rigidities.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
thrust of what I am saying is that I am very sympathetic to the points
raised by the hon. Members for Erith and Thamesmead and for Leeds West.
I will certainly reflect further, not least as part of our work on
transfers, on what they have both said about active member discounts,
but neither new clause would achieve quite what is
intended.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I said, possibly before the hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead came
in, the danger of new clause 6 is that it would put a duty on firms to
have regard to charges. That raises questions about what to do with
firms that do not have regard to charges and whether they would be
fined for going into high-cost pensions, as the fear is that they might
go into high-cost pensions unwittingly. Therefore, I am not sure that
new clause 6 would have the desired
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 10 proposes the stakeholder model, but that does not read across
neatly to auto-enrolment, because the stakeholder cap is only about
AMCs, and the auto-enrolment world has different
combinations of charges. The stakeholder cap has several other
characteristics, such as lifestyling and rules on transfers, which we
do not necessarily want to transfer lock, stock and barrel into
auto-enrolment. New clause 10 is therefore probably too
prescriptive.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000039">&#160;</a>

that my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead and I raised
was the fear of mis-selling. What would happen to the credibility of
automatic enrolment—not NEST—if people were enrolled into
schemes that were not suitable for them because much of their
contributions were eaten up by charges? Have he and his Department
considered that matter in relation to the importance of some sort of
CAP?<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000040">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thought I had addressed that point—the risk
is small. On the whole, many people will be beating a path to the doors
of the big firms, trying to offer them the best deals. Such firms will
have access to the best advice and so on. However, trying to sell a
pension to a firm that has only one or two employees is an incredibly
expensive thing to do. On average, workers in small firms are more
likely to be lower-paid, because of the auto-enrolment population. With
the commission that the pensions industry gets, even with several per
cent. on a low wage, it would take an awfully long time even to recoup
the costs of the hours spent selling the product, the journey to the
factory and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000041">&#160;</a>

said on Tuesday that I would press new clause 6 to a vote, but in light
of what the Minister has said, I am quite reassured. As has been said,
the amendments relate to fees and consumer protection. One
of my themes in our discussions is my concern about the reputation of
the pensions industry. There is inertia when people have to opt in to a
pension scheme. They might feel unsure about whether pensions are for
them and whether they can be trusted, and that is one of the barriers
that stop people making that leap. Auto-enrolment is one way round that
problem, but increasing confidence is another, and the more open fees

relates to transfers in and out of schemes, which has been discussed
before and is a concern to everyone. New clause 9 is probing, because I
wanted to amend provisions relating to contribution limits somewhere in
the Bill, but could not find anywhere suitable, so I proposed the new
clause in this part. I am aware, however, that if it were
accepted, and it amended the Pensions Act 2008, that would result in

remove the annual contribution limit for NEST from 2017. The
recommendation said that it should be clear in the legislation that

			Column number: 267<a class="bkMark" name="Column267">&#160;</a>
                  </div>happen, but it is not in the Bill, which is why I am trying to include
new clause 9, so that we can discuss the Government’s thinking
on the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
would like to see the cap on contributions removed for a number of
reasons. It would mean that more people will save more money for their
pension, which is exactly what we are trying to achieve. That has to be
good. Especially in light of our earlier discussions about the increase
in the women’s state pension age and the burden on future
generations, which I heard described yesterday as
“intergenerational fairness”, if we are trying to
encourage people to save more for their pensions, a relatively low cap
would work against that. We should encourage people to save as much as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other problem with the cap for NEST is that anyone who wants to make
contributions slightly above that limit would have to find another
vehicle in which to put money. That would be the time when they come
across the man in the shiny suit. Which? has told us that research
found that 52% of people would be more put off saving by that barrier
and the hassle of opening a secondary pension
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
cap would also make it more complex for consumers, employers and the
NEST scheme. If people had a one-off bonus or another source of income
that they want to put into NEST, they might breach the limit. That
would make the situation more complicated for the rest of the year, and
there would be extra admin hassle for employers.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I understand
that there was quite a bit of pressure on the Department regarding that
issue, particularly from the Association of British Insurers. I believe
that a number of us have seen an e-mail from the ABI that says that the
Department feels under pressure to look at the NEST contribution limit.
The annual limit is designed to focus NEST on its target market of
individuals who the existing industry currently finds difficult to
serve. It also says that the Department is concerned that the limit
will not be as effective as it could be in achieving the policy
intention. The ABI says that it would like feedback. I am interested in
what the Minister has to say about that, because many people are
concerned. There could be thinking that a solution to that will be
found in time, if not now. That is why I have tabled new clause
9.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000056">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 7 is about transfers in and out. Regarding whether there should
a waiting period of three months, two months, one month or no month and
whether the earnings limit should be lower, many of the
Minister’s reasons for not reducing the waiting period or the
earnings limit were because we would end up with tiny amounts of money
and it would be unworkable. However, if people have an ability to
transfer in and out of NEST, all those arguments would
dissipate.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000057">&#160;</a>

with them as they move employer, so that by the time of the 2017 review
the more general issue of pension transfers has been addressed and NEST
is able to receive transers in and pay transfers
out.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000158">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
Bill is trying to get NEST up and running. Once that is achieved, and
people can see that it runs well and the industry adjusts to NEST being
a player in the industry, it may be easier to make those
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is
resistance to NEST in the industry. It is seen as a
Government-sponsored player, which will create an unfair playing field.
As I said earlier, industry as a whole has been uninterested in the
people and small employers we are discussing, but that does not mean
that the Government should also be uninterested—in fact, those
are the very people and businesses in which they should be interested.
Not being able to transfer small amounts of money—NEST’s
target audience are people who will have small amounts of money, given
the nature of their earnings—will make that target audience
think that saving in NEST is not worth while.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The fact that
people will talk to each other will make it more difficult to encourage
them to participate in the scheme. People will be in a pub, and someone
may say that they are about to be auto-enrolled into a pension scheme,
and someone else may say, “It’s not worth it. I worked
somewhere for a little while and I have just seen that it is only worth
this much. I wish I hadn’t done it; I could have done more with
that money.” That sort of negative story will sweep through
communities and work forces, and will mean that more people than we
would hope opt out.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We want
everyone to automatically enter the scheme. If people can be
auto-enrolled and then opt out at a later date, they may later have a
chat with someone who says, “It’s not worth it;
I’ve got this pot from my previous employer but it is worth
nothing. I would rather have had that money for Christmas.”
People might start opting out, and that will put a burden on employers.
I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on the
matter. I know from what he has said previously that he is sympathetic
to my point, but it is about whether there will be an announcement
after the Committee has finished its deliberations, or whether we might
hear an announcement now.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000064">&#160;</a>

                  </span> Both issues about
NEST—which are linked—are important and I appreciate what
my hon. Friend said about wanting to get answers rather than a
definitive decision at this stage. The importance of NEST is, was and
hopefully will be to enable people who have not had the opportunity to
contribute to a good pension scheme over many years to be covered. For
obvious reasons, a lot of pension providers have not been particularly
interested in the customer group that we are discussing, and to a large
extent one can understand that. It is not a particularly profitable
activity; it is more complex administratively 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 269<a class="bkMark" name="Column269">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and the return is not particularly great. Had the
industry been able to deal with that client group, no doubt it would
have done so because it is always looking for new business.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000065">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have
probably said this before, but I will say it again: my experience of
paying into some of the products offered by insurance
companies—such as when I became at least technically
self-employed within a law firm—was that the product was not
very good. We need NEST, and we want to make it possible for people to
get the best out of it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I was struck
by the fact that the Johnson review, which we have talked about in
relation to other issues and which has been relied on by the
Government, made a specific recommendation about the contribution cap.
It recommended not only that we consider lifting or removing the
contribution cap, but that the Government should legislate to remove it
now. That is rather more specific than we might have expected, and I
presume there was a good reason for thinking that it would be wise to
legislate now, rather than wait to see how things work out towards 2017
and do something about it then. The review does not require the cap to
be removed at this stage, but that would allow us to be clear about
what will happen in the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As Which? and
the report have said, there are administrative difficulties for
employers with the cap. It might create a situation where somebody
found that they were in danger of exceeding the limit in a given year
and so might have to suspend contributions so that they did not exceed
the limit. That is an unnecessary administrative complication, which
could be avoided if there was not a cap. If someone had a
higher level of earnings for a particular reason in a particular year,
removing the cap would make it possible for those additional
contributions to be made, because contributions are limited under the
cap to £4,271, which is not a large
amount.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000068">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Of
course, many people who are in a position to make larger contributions,
and whose employers are in a position to assist them with that, will
already be in adequate pension schemes. Indeed, they will be the ones
that will not even be considering using NEST. There may well be
employers in the middle who do not want to set up a scheme, perhaps
because they only have a few employees, but who might in any given year
be paying someone slightly more than the
cap.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000069">&#160;</a>

all that they need to save to get a decent pension in retirement? In
reality, if someone is earning £35,000 or £40,000, to
have anything like their standard of living they would need to be

recommendations. It clearly has not been the Government’s
intention—otherwise it would have been in the Bill—to
take up that recommendation. It would be interesting to know why and
what the future intentions are. Does the Minister, in
principle, agree that we should remove the contribution cap when we

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
transfers, there is a long history in pensions of the vexed question of
small amounts of pension that are accrued in various places. I take on
board the points that the Minister made in response to the previous set
of amendments on looking again at whether it is desirable for people to
be able to take out money on a short-service basis. In the past, it was
much easier than it is now for someone to take their superannuation if
they had one. It was extremely commonplace for women to do that, not so
much if they were getting married, but if they were leaving employment
when they had their first child. It is attractive to get a lump sum at
that
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000072">&#160;</a>

from the Work and Pensions Committee, the hon. Member for Erith and
Thamesmead, for tabling these new clauses, which will lead to an
interesting discussion. Does the hon. Member for Edinburgh East agree
that the fundamental issue of NEST is that it is a state-subsidised
competitor in a well-established industry in the United Kingdom? We
support it, because it deals with a market failure. However, some of
her arguments would encroach on what is already a
well-established
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000073">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> As the hon. Lady said, there is indeed market
failure. The contribution cap is slightly more relevant than transfers
into competition with other parts of the industry. Widespread concerns
have been expressed about the market and whether it really does offer a
product and a facility for the lower-paid. We would not support NEST if
we did not agree that the market has failed in that respect. If people
were covered by NEST but wanted to make other savings and find another
product, the complications that would accrue would be unduly complex
and could lead to their not sourcing such facilities. They might not
have the confidence to take such action or they might decide that the
effort was not worth while. Moreover, fees and charges could be
affected if a person had some provision through NEST and then took up
an additional provision elsewhere. Such a system is not particularly
efficient for a relatively low earner and, as a result, a relatively
low
saver.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
for transfers, in the past people used to take the money. It was an
attractive option, especially for many women at that time in the lives.
However, later they had a big hole in their pension provision. People
were then prevented from taking such action so easily. Having bits and
pieces all over the place is not necessarily the best means of being
aware of what the pension cover will be in later life or being able to
access it at the
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000075">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> One problem is that people do not know what their
pensions will be when they retire. The complexity of both the state
pension system and occupational pensions means that money comes from
different sources and has been accrued in different 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 271<a class="bkMark" name="Column271">&#160;</a>
                  </div>ways. One of the results of people changing their
jobs is the different pots of money and the fact that there is no one
statement to say how much they have saved. Does my hon. Friend agree
that if money could be transferred in and out of NEST, people could
accumulate one pot of money? There would be better clarity about what
is put aside for retirement and people would know what more needs to be
done if they want to realise the standard of living they are looking
forward to in
retirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000076">&#160;</a>

agree that it would be more straightforward for people if they could
organise matters in that way. However, NEST might become an
unreasonable competitor in the sector. As people’s working lives
become more stable and they have an opportunity to enter a
better or more consistent pension scheme not through an organisation
such as NEST, they might want to take out their NEST contributions and
put them into the new
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000077">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As
other members of the Committee get their family involved in the debate,
I must say how interesting it is when something esoteric is related to
ordinary people, although whether my family is ordinary is another
matter. It has been seven years since one of my sons graduated, and he
has not had a permanent job. I am pleased that he has not lain in bed
watching daytime television because that would be extremely
disappointing. He has had several different jobs, such as agency work,
sometimes over lengthy periods—nearly a year in some cases. He
worked for an MP for six months. He has worked in a school for the past
two years, and he is about to go back into training, hopefully to
become a qualified teacher. In that seven years, therefore, he has done
various different jobs and through the work in the school he has had a
bit of pension contribution, but only in that two-year period. If he
had been accruing bits and pieces in NEST through his previous agency
work, he would have had that as well, and it would have been helpful to
consolidate
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000078">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
my son achieves his ambition and not only completes his teacher
training but gets a job—which is not always guaranteed, in my
recent experience of people qualifying—then had he had those
bits of pensions, it would make sense to bring them
together. That need not be in NEST, but they ought to be brought
together—he could take what he might have accrued in NEST into a
teachers’ pension scheme, and bring them together in that way.
So it can work in both
directions.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000079">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">A
lot of young people are in a similar position to my son, which is quite
concerning, because I worked out that at that age his father had
already been contributing to a pension scheme for six years, and he has
been in that scheme throughout his working life. To be in a stable job
for all that time is either very boring or very fortunate, but it is a
considerable difference from approaching your late 20s and being
unprovided for—that is a matter of concern, which is why all the
provisions are so
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000080">&#160;</a>

might increasingly affect not only the unqualified or less qualified

thank all my hon. Friends for their contributions this morning but, in
particular, my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead for
tabling the new clauses, which are to do with the operation of NEST.
With the roll-out due to start next year, it is important to let NEST
get under way as currently designed, but it is also important to debate
the two issues currently earmarked for the 2017 review. I support the
hon. Lady in principle on both new clauses: the first would allow
transfers into and out of NEST, and the second would remove the
existing cap on contributions into
NEST.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000086">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">NEST
is not currently set up to facilitate transfers into and out of the
scheme. As my hon. Friends the Members for Erith and Thamesmead and for
Edinburgh East said, people can end up with a number of small pension
pots which, individually, are too small to buy a meaningful annuity.
The Johnson review
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000087">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Facilitating
transfers is, in our opinion, critical to the success of the reforms.
In a world where automatic enrolment makes pension saving a norm,
including for low earners and people who move jobs frequently, there is
a much higher risk that an individual’s pension savings becomes
fragmented in a number of small pots. The inability to easily see a
complete picture of the extent of pension saving could act as a
disincentive to save more, and having pension saving spread
into…small pots may make it more difficult for an individual to
access their savings on
retirement.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000159">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">During
the debates on other aspects of auto-enrolment, we talked at length
about the average number of jobs that people hold during their working
life. We heard again this morning some stories about the propensity of
people to move jobs. We know that the median number of jobs is 11 and
that around 25% of people will change jobs between 11 and 15 times in
their working life. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham South has
emphasised that the number of jobs is likely to increase rather than
fall in the future. Of course, some people will change jobs more than
15 times. Depending on the rules of individual schemes and how long
people are required to work before they can join a scheme, it is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 273<a class="bkMark" name="Column273">&#160;</a>
                  </div>likely that low-paid and part-time employees and people who move a lot
in the first five, 10 or 15 years of earning will build up pension
entitlement in different
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000089">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
us look at the example of a woman on £11,000 a year, which is
half of women’s average earnings. With a typical
defined-contribution scheme, that woman may have between £1,000
and £1,200 a year in a pot for each year in a job. If she has
five or six different jobs, she could have between £1,000 and
£3,000 built up in each pot, depending on the rules of her
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000090">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The question
is what happens to those different pots of money. Without being able to
transfer them, if the woman cannot trivially commute and she is
handling pots of £3,000 each, she will get something between
£1 and £4 a week from each of those small pots in
retirement. They are what the pensions advisory service refers to as
orphan assets, because it is often difficult to turn them into pensions
later. Hypothetically, a woman may end up with £20,000 or
£25,000 in her NEST pot, and then have three, four or five other
pots of £3,000, £2,000 or £1,000, and either lose
all those small pots, or at least not be able to turn them into a
pension because she cannot bundle them together and get a
meaningful
annuity.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000091">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
accept that NEST was designed in that way—I hear the points made
by the hon. Member for West Worcestershire—to ensure that it
does not unduly impact private pension schemes. Indeed, some argue that
there might be an exodus of funds out of insurance company-run pension
schemes, which could have a detrimental impact on employees remaining
within non-NEST schemes. No one would want to see that happen, but
there are real reasons, as we have discussed previously, why NEST is to
be created. There is some sort of market failure, which means that the
people who most need pensions are often not provided for under the
functioning of the current market. Savings, even those that are too
small to interest pension companies, are swept up in all that. It is in
no one’s interest, whether insurance companies, employers or
employees, for individuals to have many small pots of money. Data from
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs indicate that 10 million
individuals own personal pensions and annuities. Around 40% of people
have £10,000 or less saved in personal pension plans, which is
often insufficient to buy a meaningful
annuity.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000092">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Johnson review noted that respondents have commented that the cost of
administering a pension pot of ex-employees did not vary much with the
size of the pot—one respondee said that administration costs
were around £15 a year, regardless of the size of the
pot—and that over time, the cumulative cost would eat into the
value of a small pot in a way that it does not for a larger one. Money
in small pots is likely to be eroded at a greater pace than money in a
larger pot. The key priority must now be to allow NEST to get under way
in 2012, but I support the Johnson review’s recommendation
that<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000093">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Government
and regulators should review as a matter of some urgency how to ensure
that it is more straightforward for people to move their pension pot
with them as they move employer, so that by the time of the 2017 review
the more general issue of pension transfers has been addressed and NEST
is able to receive transfers in and pay transfers
out.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000160">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
is important, and builds on the intervention by the hon. Member for
West Worcestershire that the issue is not just about money going into
NEST. Transfers will be able to come out of NEST, and the money can
move 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 274<a class="bkMark" name="Column274">&#160;</a>
                  </div>with employees as they move between jobs. Some of
those jobs may have automatic enrolment of employees into NEST, but
others may have occupational or insurance-based schemes. It would not
necessarily mean money flowing just into NEST; it would mean money
moving the other way as well, especially if the industry rises to the
challenge of designing pensions for people with a variety of
backgrounds and career
paths.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
turn to new clause 9 and the cap on contributions. As my hon. Friends
the Members for Erith and Thamesmead and for Edinburgh East said, the
Johnson review recommended that the Government should legislate now to
remove the limits for NEST from 2017, but that recommendation is not in
the Bill. Will the Minister explain the decision not to take forward
that specific
recommendation?<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
we know, contributions into NEST are currently limited to around
£4,721 a year at today’s prices. That was to ensure that
NEST is focused on employees with low and medium incomes. However, I
accept Consumer Focus’s argument that the practical implications
of the limit, coupled with the minimum contributions of 8%, could deny
people on modest incomes access to NEST on the full range of their
salary. Consumer Focus argues that the existence of a hard
limit on contributions means that employees whose qualifying earnings
fluctuate —my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh
East made this point eloquently—and might exceed that
limit may be automatically enrolled into an alternative scheme to avoid
risk of non-compliance, even if the employee and employer would prefer
to use NEST. The alternative is to automatically enrol them into NEST,
not on their full earnings, but just on the band of earnings. Consumer
Focus says that<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the only option
open would be to enrol the higher-earning employee into NEST and into a
second top-up scheme for earnings above the NEST
cap”.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000161">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Beyond
that, the cap has the potential to deter people from saving more
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Which?
research has shown that 52% of people would be put off saving more by
the hassle of finding and opening a secondary pension plan if they
reached their contribution limit. Overall, 70% of the people surveyed
agreed that there should be flexibility about how much can be paid into
NEST. Which? is making compelling arguments for removal of the cap, and
indeed the intention has always been that it will be removed in
2017.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000098">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Johnson review concluded that<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000099">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the cap is
probably appropriate whilst NEST is being established and employers are
making their initial choices about pension provision. However, once the
reforms are bedded in, we feel very strongly that the cap should be
removed to facilitate greater flexibility for
savers”.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000162">&#160;</a>

<div class="columnNumber">

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
new clauses raise two issues. The first is the rules on transfers in
and out of NEST. For the record, it is not strictly true that no
transfers are permitted in or out. Transfers into NEST are permitted
for pension credit members, which is not-for-benefit pension credit
when there is pension-sharing on divorce. Split pensions on divorce can
be transferred into NEST. Transfers in are also permitted for what are
delightfully called pre-vested rights when someone has not worked for
an employer for long and wants to consolidate pension saving. Such
transfers are allowed in limited circumstances, just as there are
circumstances in which transfers out are permitted in certain
situations. It is fair to say, however, that in general such transfers
are not permitted under the rules.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000103">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Indeed. As I said a moment ago, in the autumn we
plan to produce a broader document on transfers. Broadly speaking, the
goal has to be to have “one big pot”, to use the phrase
of the hon. Member for Leeds West. There is much rich
jargon—orphan assets, stranded pots and so on—but the
idea is to enable people to consolidate their pension assets, be aware
of them and get best value for money. Doing that in as painless a way
as possible has to be the goal.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As always
with pensions, the more this issue is considered, the less
straightforward it becomes. I will give one example. Suppose there was
a presumption that a person’s money always followed them, and
that they would gradually built up a bigger and bigger pot. What would
happen if they moved from a firm with a relatively low-cost pension
scheme to one with a high-cost scheme? It might be in their financial
interest not to consolidate their previous pension into the new scheme,
because even with active member discounts and so on the previous
pension may still do better than the new one. Should there be a default
system for moving, or a system of advice? We will have to wrestle with
such matters, but I agree with my hon. Friend and with the hon. Member
for Leeds West that ideally, the goal must be not to have lots of
stranded pots, but to have one big pot, good value for money and an
awareness of pension savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000106">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I understand that point, and in some instances, if
a person has been in a good pension scheme it might make sense to leave
the money in that. Does the Minister agree, however, that it would be
better for people to at least have the option to either leave their
money in the original pension scheme or take it with
them?<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000107">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Well, in general, people have that option except
with regard to NEST—we will come on to that because NEST is a
special case. Although people do, in general, have that option, they
often choose not to use it or the amounts involved are below the limits
required. Although there is no legal barrier, a scheme might refuse to
accept a transfer in of a very small pot.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000108">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I am delighted
that the hon. Lady now endorses the findings in the Johnson review, but
we must bear in mind that its remit was quite narrow. It was about
making auto-enrolment work, not about the whole pensions landscape or
transfers as a whole. One of my worries about picking out a little bit
from that, such as short-service refund or transfers into NEST, is that
we may suffer from what I call the curse of incrementalism. We do
everything with the best of intentions and fiddle with a bit of the
system in a way that we think will make it better, but we do not think
through the knock-on effects on the rest of the system. In our autumn
paper—which I am bigging up; I know that my officials are
looking forward to delivering on the promises I am making—we
will try to look at the system as a whole, including NEST and its place
in the wider pensions universe. We need something that works across the
system as a whole and that is what I am trying to achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend the Member for West Worcestershire rightly pointed out, NEST is
a very special creature. It would not exist if the market worked, and
it has been created to ensure that when we place a duty on firms, they
have somewhere to fulfil it. It is, however, a state-subsidised
competitor to private enterprise, and under EU legislation we have to
justify subsidising a competitor to the private sector. We justify the
subsidy principally on the basis of the public service duty—NEST
has to accept people for whom it will make a loss, and that is a
justification for subsidy. One way we were able to give reassurance
that state aid was justified was by NEST being constrained in terms of
transfers and the contribution cap. One option would be to immediately
lift both those things, but we would potentially face a legal
challenge. I know it is not the proposition, but if we lifted those
constraints straight away, at the very least we would be challenged in
the EU on a state aid case, because we would essentially have
subsidised a competitor with unlimited transfers in and unlimited
contributions, and we would be vulnerable.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000110">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
option suggested by Johnson is that we announce and legislate now that
in five years’ time the caps will go. However, that brings me to
my point about not wanting to pre-empt our wider decisions about the
transfer infrastructure, not only for NEST, but for trust-based DC,
occupational DC, group personal pensions, defined-benefits and so on,
and about how all those interact. Rather than pick a bit
out—legislate for a bit in the Bill—we want to take a
broader look at the whole thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000111">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> There is a famous internet acronym, IANAL, which
stands for “I am not a lawyer”; I preface my remarks with
that. However, my understanding is that the state subsidy to NEST is
based on the loan being at the rate at which the Government borrow
rather than at market loan rates. I understand that the loan will take
the best part of two decades to pay off. Lawyers might argue that other
forms of subsidy are implicit—that, for example, the regulator
will mention NEST in the letter. Once we are out of the loan period, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 277<a class="bkMark" name="Column277">&#160;</a>
                  </div>if we argue that NEST is simply another competitor, other competitors
might say, “Well, you can’t mention NEST in your letters,
because that’s not fair.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In principle,
my hon. Friend is broadly right. The key point is the public service
duty, which, as it stands, will go on for ever. NEST will always be
obliged to take anyone, including loss-making people, and it will be
the only one obliged to do so. Future Governments may want to deliver
the public service duty in another way. My hon. Friend is right,
however, that the key point is that the loan is subsidised—that
is the state aid. The quid pro quo for that is the public service
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">NEST has a
specific purpose, and benefits have arisen from the constrained
environment in which it operates. The fact that it knows that it is
aiming at its target market has caused it to innovate for that market
in a way that the financial services industry has not. For example,
because almost one in four people whom we auto-enrol will be
twenty-somethings, NEST has had to think far harder than anyone else
about what the right pension regime for such people looks like. We
might imagine ex ante that young people would be comfortable with risk,
saying, “Stick it all on Bolivian futures. I don’t care
if it goes up or down because it will be 40 or 50 years before I retire
and it’ll all be right by then.” But NEST has carried out
a lot of market research and found the opposite; if we take money off a
22-year-old, and when they come back the actual cash amount has gone
down, we have lost them. It is very damaging. Perhaps
counter-intuitively, NEST’s judgment on the lifestyling and
profiling of its investments is that in the early years its staff will
be cautious with the investment, to get it going so that a return can
be seen. Then they will go for higher-risk, higher-return before easing
off again later on.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">NEST has had
to be constrained and focused on its target market, so it has
innovated. The iPhone app and so on, focus on the new market. Because
of the cap, it has had to work out how to deliver for the smallest
firms, which will make up a large proportion of the number of
employers, if not necessarily the total proportion of businesses.
Although I have no doubt that if NEST’s chief executive, Tim
Jones, gave evidence to the Select Committee, he would reflect on the
constraints and frustrations that NEST faces, such constraints have had
beneficial effects for society, consumers and the trust’s target
market. Those have been very
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
point is that the scheme is not quite as binding and constrained as it
appears. The constraint was £3,600 in the contribution limit; it
is now £4,200. People might be earning £58,000 and
contributing 8% above the floor, and only just be hitting the
cap—obviously, if people are in schemes that put in 10% or 12%,
the wage figure will come down.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some of the
Labour party’s comments have related to people on average wages,
and on £30,000 or £40,000. However, when considering
auto-enrolment, it is important to remember that such people are not
the principal focus of the policy. When we were discussing waiting
periods and thresholds, we were talking about people on £8,000,
£9,000 and £10,000. For those people, the concept of
putting £4,000 into a pension scheme is beyond the dreams of
avarice. It is worth keeping the matter in
perspective.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000118">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> In thinking about the employer who is choosing
which scheme to automatically enrol employees into, as most firms
employ people on a variety of different wages, are we in danger of
creating too much complexity for employers in saying that they should
automatically enrol some of their staff into NEST but that that will
not be suitable for the rest of the staff? Some employers will have to
make two decisions—one for higher-paid and one for lower-paid
members of
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000119">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I do not dispute that there is an element of truth
in that, but there is a risk of overstating it because, on the whole,
people on higher earnings in the firm will be more likely to have
pension arrangements. From talking to the financial services industry,
our sense is that many companies see themselves as partners with NEST.
Although some see NEST as an upstart rival, there are quite a few
others that I would describe— at the risk of being sued;
no, I cannot be sued in Parliament—as the more mature players in
the market, and they see NEST as a
partner.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000120">&#160;</a>

X might go to a firm and say, “You have existing pension
arrangements for some of your workers with us. Do you want to
complement that with NEST, perhaps for newer employees or lower-paid
workers? Perhaps we could also progress employees from NEST into our
scheme.” Having two sets of pension arrangements might therefore
become more common, and that might be what firms go for to fulfil their
auto-enrolment duties. It is worth bearing in mind that many people who

                  </strong> I recognise what the Minister is saying about many
pension providers seeing themselves as partners with NEST. Employers
might say that for the first two years they would automatically enrol
lower-paid members of staff into NEST, and the lower-paid members of
staff would hope to become higher-paid members of staff and the people
who have worked for the employer for a year or two would hope to
continue to do so for a long period. However, because of transfers in
and out, coupled with the contribution cap, there is an issue about
people who are in NEST for a while and then move into an all-singing,
all-dancing scheme, in that there will be different pots of money. That
could be avoided if everyone went into either one or the
other.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000122">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The hon. Lady risks being inconsistent. She has said
that she understands the need to have caps on NEST, at least during the
transitional period, but the problem that she has just described will
happen, because of the policy that she supports. The idea of having a
cap on NEST is not ours; it is a Labour policy, because the 2008 Act
provided for a cap on NEST and a ban on transfers. I am confused about
what she is now saying, because we are hearing the opposite of the
arguments that we heard at the time of the 2008 Act, and it feels as if
it were a Government
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000123">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady is fond of talking about consensus, and she regularly accuses
me of breaking the consensus. Auto-enrolment was designed to keep
employers, employees, the financial services industry and consumer
groups on board, and it was a very delicately put together compromise, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 279<a class="bkMark" name="Column279">&#160;</a>
                  </div>as she has said. Part of the deal was that the financial services
industry should co-exist with a state-subsidised competitor, and the
understanding was that, despite being subsidised, it would have its own
market niche. Our position is that that arrangement should be kept in
place during the
roll-out.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000124">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have no problem with our having a statutory duty to start a review by
2017, and I am very sympathetic to the Johnson review’s
suggestion that, at that point, we should have a hard look at the
issues of caps and transfers. Transfers should be seen in the round. It
is not just a NEST issue; it is a much bigger issue. We shall consider
transfers and publish our thoughts later in the year. A contribution
cap would be very unsettling for the market. The hon. Lady regularly
quotes Turner, but that report was seven years ago. If I stand up in
Committee and say, on the brink of auto-enrolment coming in, that we
will knock the caps off in a few years’ time, one can imagine
the bedlam that would be created. We want to get auto-enrolment going
now and to have a period of stability, and that is the challenge that
we
face.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Transfers
and the cap are important issues. On transfers, I should flag that the
Secretary of State already has the power, under section 71 of the 2008
Act, to amend the transfer restrictions for NEST. We are concerned that
an additional power, as in new clause 7, which seems to do the same
thing, could lead to confusion and ambiguity. Leaving aside the point
about NEST’s core market, my principal point is that we want to
look at transfers in the round and not just tweak NEST. In terms of the
cap, in my judgment the focus on the target market has been right. The
cap will be reviewed and we will certainly look at whether it should
go. However, at this stage, we do not want to unsettle the whole
process. We want NEST to focus on its target market. We want to get
auto-enrolment going and we want to make it a success. Further changes
to the rules around NEST probably would not help. I am grateful to the
hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead for raising both issues, but I
urge her not to press the new
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000126">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank all the Committee members who have
contributed to this debate—it is important—and I thank
the Minister for his reassurances. As I said at the beginning, I was
quite aware that new clause 9 did far more than I ever would want it to
do, but I needed to get it in somewhere so that we could talk about it.
I am therefore happy not to press new clause
9.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000127">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
new clause 7, I was interested in what the Minister said about NEST
being a Labour Government policy. Although the shadow Minister and I
were not part of the previous Government, we are both proud that it was
a Labour policy. We have said repeatedly throughout our debates that we
think on the whole it is a good idea, but the point of this Committee
is to try to make it the best idea it could possibly be. That is why
the amendments have been tabled.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I was also
interested in what the Minister said about NEST being quite innovative
and about thinking things through in a different way. One of the things
that came up when we visited was our assumption that a young person in
NEST would automatically be in a more risky fund, and it would not
matter if the fund dipped, because they would have longer for it to
rise again. That is what anybody who is familiar with pensions would
look at. However, the people at NEST were quite firm 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 280<a class="bkMark" name="Column280">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that it would do exactly the reverse. As the Minister has said, a young
person in NEST can actually be put in a low-return, low-risk fund. The
thinking is that if a 23-year-old in the fund looks at it a year later
and sees that it is not doing very well because it is a high-risk fund,
we will lose them for ever. The point about NEST is to get people in
early to save for a long time and to encourage that attitude. When we
went to NEST, it was very interesting to hear that. It shows that we
must not have preconceived ideas about any of this, because it is all
completely
new.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
understand completely what the Minister says about state subsidy, but
one of the most important things about NEST is to make sure that it
does what we intend it to do not just for the sake of future
pensioners, but because it is funded by Government loan. The issues
that we have been talking about this morning are important, because the
biggest threat to NEST is insufficient membership. If people cannot see
that NEST is of benefit to them, it could have insufficient membership,
which would put at risk not only the Government loan but
people’s faith in the scheme in future. That is my concern, and
for that reason it is important to be able to move pots of money in and
out. I very much look forward to the autumn statement. The Work and
Pensions Committee might report on some of these issues, so I will meet
fellow members of that Committee again. I am happy not to press new
clause 7 to a Division, and I look forward to the statement in
the autumn, which I hope will give us some
satisfaction.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000130">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 8 is relatively simple and will not take a huge amount of
debate. One of my concerns, which I have raised on a number of
occasions, is that to get people to do something that they had not
considered doing—for example, go into a pension
scheme—they need as much information as possible. People need to
have misconceptions swept away, and the way to do that is to have clear
information. It is not only about the employees; it is about the
employers as well, because in the future there will be—I am sure
we will get them—numerous letters in our postbags from small
employers who see this as a problem for them. The more information that
can be given to people and the more it can be made clear that this is a
benefit for employees and employers and good working relations between
the two, the better.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000136">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">One
of the reasons I tabled the new clause is because, although people are
auto-enrolled at three months, they can enrol from day one if they
wish, but I am concerned that people will not be aware of that. If, at
some future 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 281<a class="bkMark" name="Column281">&#160;</a>
                  </div>point, pots of money can be moved from one fund to another—I hope
that will come to fruition—it will be important for people to
enrol as soon as possible. I am worried that they will not be told that
by their employer, or that they will not know, or that they will get
wrong information from their friends in the pub.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For those
reasons, I want to see the Government ensure that there is an
easy-to-understand single place where all that relevant information is.
It could be web-based. I am impressed with the NEST website, which is
all in plain language, simple to understand and has examples of types
of people, so that everyone can look and see someone similar to them
and how it will affect them. NEST, as has been said, is only one player
in the field. We need to build on what has happened there. The
Government need to have something, whether it is part of DirectGov or
something else, to ensure that people have the right information, so
that they do not hear things from their friends in the pub and get
convinced that this is not for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000138">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and
Thamesmead for tabling this new clause, which raises the issue of
communicating auto-enrolment and NEST to employers and employees. I
know that the Federation of Small Businesses has raised the issue of
ensuring that employers, particularly small and micro-businesses, which
have little experience of pensions, have the information that they
need, particularly given the level of fines for non-compliance. The new
clause would particularly benefit the smallest of businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government and the Pensions Regulator must ensure that small employers
in particular are aware of the new requirements on them that the Bill
creates. To make auto-enrolment work, what funds will be available to
ensure that the proper scale of communication and guidance is in place
for employers and employees in advance of auto-enrolment being rolled
out? Who is principally responsible for getting that information out
there: is it NEST, the Pensions Regulator or the
DWP?<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000141">&#160;</a>

spent such an enjoyable time together in this room going through the
Bill, I know that we are all well versed in auto-enrolment, state
pension ages, Pensions Commission reports and the Johnson review. We
also know that many people outside this room, despite clamouring to get
copies of <em>Hansard</em>, are less aware of the subject, particularly
small businesses which are more interested in making widgets than
providing pensions. It is important that we do everything we can to
make it as simple as possible. Communication is an important part of
that, if we are to achieve the objectives of auto-enrolment, which
intends to get some 7 million people saving who are not currently doing
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000142">&#160;</a>

new clause discusses “a single place” for relevant

auto-enrolment, as well as the time scale over which it will be carried
out, will be clearly publicised to relevant employers and employees?
Clearly, the roll-out of auto-enrolment means that it is big businesses
that will be automatically enrolled first, so we have a chance to get
to the smaller businesses and the
micro-businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000143">&#160;</a>

visit his constituency to help them. That would benefit small
businesses in all our constituencies. The NEST website, and its
communication, is excellent, but people need to know that the site is
there and relevant to them in order to visit it. Automatic enrolment
will not impact small businesses for a couple of years or more. In
time, hopefully some small businesses will go to the NEST website to
find out what it has to offer, but how can we be more proactive in
telling them? Road shows and so on are a good way to do that, but I
wonder what other ideas the Minister has about how to be as effective
as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000145">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
highlighted, in relation to clause 1, the confusion that some people
have about their state pension age and the impact of the changes in the
pipeline. Given the vast changes that automatic enrolment brings, the
onus is on the Department. I recognise the difficulty of changing
departmental websites and so on. However, how can we put all the
information people need in a single place, and how do we signpost
people to that information?<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000146">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Looking from
an employee perspective, how do we ensure that people are aware of the
three-month waiting period proposed in the Bill, and that individuals
have the right to opt in during the first three months when their
employer operates the waiting period? How do we ensure that that right
is meaningful? In order for it to be so, employees must know that they
can opt in and have full information available so that they can make an
informed decision on whether it is in their interest to opt in during a
waiting period. If they think it is in their interest they must have
the information to enable them to exercise that right. How does the
Minister envisage communication with employees—informing them
about automatic enrolment, whether it is the best option for them and
how they can exercise the right to enrol voluntarily during a waiting
period—will take
place?<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000147">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
believe that a single hub of information could be an important step in
ensuring that the right to opt in is taken up by as many jobholders as
want to. Obviously not all will, but if they are given the information
they can make a more informed
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11071456000148">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">To
sum up, we have had a useful debate about making automatic enrolment
and NEST work, and about ensuring that employers and employees get the
information that they need. I think a hub of information would be
beneficial, but if we proactively target small and micro-businesses and
employees with little experience of pensions then automatic enrolment
could be the success that it should be. It could also build the
confidence of small businesses that do not have much experience of
pensions and are perhaps worried about complying with legislation
