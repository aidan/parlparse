<H2><center>Standing Committee E</center></H2>
<H4><center>Thursday 20 January 2000</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Roger Gale in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/008/1000008.htm">Transport Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning. You will have noticed that I have asked to have the Room slightly reconfigured. We do not have a crowd this morning, but some sections of the Bill may attract a certain amount of interest. Given the size of the Room, it seemed appropriate to create slightly more space for those people attending professionally and for others wishing to attend.
<P>
I make it plain now to Committee members and others who may be listening that while members of the public may use the seats on one side, the green seats are reserved for members of the press. It is not permissible for advisers or commentators of any sort to pass notes to and from members of the Committee or engage in conversation with members of the Committee in the Room. If Members and/or professional advisers wish to have conversations, they must do so outside the Room.
<P>
I have also asked to have the centre door opened; it was not on Tuesday. That door is for the use of Members only. If and when I call for the doors to be locked for a Division, the centre door and the Chairman's entrance will be locked. Any member of the Committee entering by the door at the far end will be deemed to be not in the Room. I should be grateful if hon. Members would advise colleagues who may arrive later.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Secretary of State's general duty</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [18 January]: No. 1, in page 1, line 10, at beginning insert `Subject to subsection (5) below),'.
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 2, in page 1, line 11, leave out `in the manner he thinks best calculated'.
<P>
No. 4, in page 1, line 28, leave out `in the manner he thinks is reasonable'.
<P>
No. 5, in page 2, line 4, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) Before exercising any powers under this Chapter and prior to each subsequent year that this Chapter remains in force, the Secretary of State shall lay a report for the forthcoming year before both Houses of Parliament for approval by each House, setting out the manner in which he shall exercise his functions under this Chapter, including—
<P>
(a) a full explanation of the manner in which he intends to exercise his functions;
<P>
(b) the calculations he has used to arrive at his conclusions;
<P>
(c) the objectives he is seeking to achieve by the exercise of his powers; and
<P>
(d) the decisions he will make during the year in question to achieve those objectives.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should say now that it has been indicated to me that the Opposition wish to call a Division on amendment No. 2. The Minister has the floor.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> The wording to which Conservative Members object in amendments Nos. 2 and 4 has many precedents in legislation that their colleagues introduced and they supported when in government. Mention was made on Tuesday of one or two other examples, but with the benefit of the adjournment I can now refer the Committee to section 3 of the Telecommunications Act 1984, section 2 of the Water Industries Act 1991, section 4 of the Gas Act 1986, section 3 of the Electricity Act 1989 and sections 4 and 5 of the Railways Act 1993, which all contain wording either identical or similar to that to which the Opposition are now objecting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I confess that I have not done the research on those other Acts—[Hon. Members: ``Oh dear!'']—I do not have the same number of civil servants as the Minister. Do those sections of the Acts that the hon. Gentleman mentions refer to the manner in which the Secretary of State carries out general duties or functions, and are those general duties or functions integral to the on-going operation of the Act, or are they about establishing new frameworks? The present Bill is about setting up an on-going framework and those general duties will be incumbent upon the Secretary of State for all time, whereas in the cases that the Minister mentions they may be for initiating certain changes and, therefor, much more temporary in nature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> They do and they are. I appreciate that Conservative Members may find it boring to have their own legislation quoted back at them. I anticipate that during our lengthy deliberations that will happen on many occasions because, although some of my hon. Friends may not be entirely happy with the fact, that part of the trail that we are travelling down is one that the Conservatives blazed. We are grateful to them for the all the work that they did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We note that the Under-Secretary's party has few ideas of its own.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I should make it clear that this is not old-style privatisation. Public assets are simply rooted: it is a partnership and the state will retain a hefty interest. There will be no fat cats of the sort that emerged previously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Is the hon. Gentleman referring to an hon. Friend on the Back Bench?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> No. The entire purpose of clause 1 is to set out how the Secretary of State will exercise his functions under chapter I. The Secretary of State should have discretion in balancing the weight of one requirement against another. He should also have discretion in resolving any conflicts that may arise between the requirements under his general duty and the interests that he should consider when performing that duty. To ask the Secretary of State to consider his requirements and the interests to which he is bound without the ability to consider reasonably the weight of one against the other would put him in a position where, by complying with one duty, he would be failing in another. That would be unworkable.
<P>
I turn to the amendments that relate to an annual report and set out the manner in which the Secretary of State will exercise his functions under chapter I of the Bill. Opposition Members have said that the Secretary of State must know how he intends to exercise his duty and be able to write it down. We have clear ideas about how that duty will be exercised. The Committee will no doubt discuss those at length when talking about the licence, the nature of the planned exemptions and the way in which the special administration regime will operate. I would be surprised if, by the time we have finished debating chapter I, the Committee did not have a pretty clear view of the way in which the duty will be exercised.
<P>
After the granting of the initial licence and exemptions, there will not be any great change, year on year, in the manner in which the Secretary of State exercises his functions. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Don Foster) for recognising that. The licence will remain in place for a good many years. Applications for new exemptions will be considered as and when they arise, but we do not expect frequent changes and it will not necessarily be possible to foresee them at the beginning of any calendar year. In the same way, enforcement of the duties of the licence holder or conditions of the licence would, by their very nature, be dealt with as necessary and, except in unusual circumstances, would be unlikely to be foreseen much in advance. I therefore invite the hon. Member to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister concluded his remarks with a remarkable paradox. He said that he did not expect any changes in the manner in which the duties would be exercised and that there would be no need to report to Parliament regularly, but in the next breath he said that he will not know from one year to the next how he expects the Secretary of State to exercise the details of the functions.
<P>
Apart from the unhappy situation that the Minister is effectively saying that everything that is said in the Committee is an assurance for all future Ministers for all time about the manner in which the duties shall be exercised, he has set himself up for an inexplicable paradox. That is unsatisfactory. There is an issue here. We are happy to withdraw the amendment and may return to the matter later.
<P>
Let me turn to amendment No. 2 and the amendment that echoes it, No. 4. It is questionable whether a provision that gives such wide-ranging powers to the Secretary of State should be allowed to remain in the Bill, because it is a catch-all that is designed to protect the Secretary of State from judicial review. If he is challenged in court, all he has to say that he regards that as the best way in which to exercise those powers; that is all the evidence that the court needs to be satisfied. An annual report to Parliament or, as the hon. Member for Bath suggested, a report to Parliament each time a licence is issued, varied or amended, might provide a reasonable degree of accountability.
<P>
It is typical of a sort of modern legislation about which I have been uneasy ever since becoming a Member of Parliament. The boot was on the other foot when the Minister was on the Opposition Benches: at that time, he might then have expressed concerns similar to those I now raise. We should not allow the perspective of office to blind us to the realities of increasing discretionary power being passed to the Executive, which is what the clause represents. That provision does not exist in the relevant parallel Act, the Civil Aviation Act 1982. The section echoed in the clause referred to the Civil Aviation Authority, not to the Secretary of State. It referred to a simple regulatory regime, rather than to the business of licensing and the other complicated matters that we were discussing earlier. Therefore, Mr. Gale, with your indulgence we shall press amendment No. 2 to a vote.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 1, line 11, at end insert—

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I belatedly welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale. Like many other hon. Members, I have not served under your chairmanship before but, based on what we saw on Tuesday, look forward to what will undoubtedly be many pleasant hours in the Committee Room. Reference was made the other day to the pen portraits that are being circulated. We have now all received copies, as the Minister promised. If your pen portrait is anything like as accurate as mine, Mr. Gale, perhaps there is scope for a class action for damages against the BBC.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the pen portrait to which he referred describes me as ``a cheerful, aggressive right winger''? I wish to put on the record that there is nothing cheerful about me at this time in the morning.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I welcome the hon. Gentleman's intervention. He has spent a long time in the Labour party and I do not care to speculate how he has moved during that time.
<P>
We would assert the primary duty of the Secretary of State to ensure safety. As drafted, the provision in clause 1(1)(c) to secure that licence holders will not find it unduly difficult to finance activities authorised by their licences comes before the first reference to safety in 1(2)(a). In the case of a conflict between safety and cost, as set out in 1(2)(b)—by ``cost'' we can infer profitability—the Secretary of State must exercise his functions:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the manner he thinks is reasonable having regard to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) as a whole.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That wording undermines the primacy of safety and, if the Bill is not amended, the Deputy Prime Minister's comments on Second Reading that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Air traffic control is all about safety, which must be paramount. . . . I am happy to assure the House that safety will continue to be the overriding priority'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will ring hollow.
<P>
As we know from our debates so far, the potential for conflict between safety and profit under the model proposed by the Government is at the heart of the concerns of employees, pilots and many others. Where the income of NATS is substantially capped, there is little scope for efficiency savings and improvement in profitability unless there is an ability to drive down costs. That is an inherent conflict in the regime proposed.
<P>
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell) quoted Gerald Corbett, chief executive of Railtrack, who, on a television programme had said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is impossible to keep everybody happy at the same time. It is actually at the moment unmanageable. We cannot . . . keep shareholders happy at the same time as fulfilling our public service obligations,''—[Official Report, 20 December 1999; Vol. 341 c.536, 584]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important to put safety back at the top of the agenda. Late yesterday afternoon, we received a copy of the first draft of the operator's licence. As I read it— I am sure that if I am wrong I shall quickly be picked up—so far it contains no condition that relates to safety. A covering letter from Lord Macdonald to you, Mr. Gale, talks about discussions still going on with interested parties—a term that is not defined—on a number of issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): My hon. Friend was concentrating on the details of his speech, but when he referred to the absence of safety in the draft licence he said that he might be wrong and that if he was it would be pointed out to him quickly. He was not perhaps aware that while he was speaking, the Minister had to look for guidance on that point. Whether or not my hon. Friend was right or wrong, the Minister himself was uncertain about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution. To quote again from Lord Macdonald's letter, he says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Discussions are still continuing with interested parties on a number of issues—of which the perpetuation of the existing safety regime is a key example— . . . ''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We should like to know who the ``interested parties'' are. Why has it not been a priority so far to introduce the safety conditions? Are there real difficulties in specifying them and building them into the operator's licence? It is essential that the regime that follows the present system ensures certain basic standards: volumes of air traffic must be kept at safe levels, supervised by the Safety Regulation Group, whose work will have to be reviewed and strengthened before any new company takes over air traffic control. Overload reporting schemes should be guaranteed under any new ownership. Procedures for setting minimum vertical and horizontal distances between aircraft will need to be strengthened, and the present procedure used by National Air Traffic Services for monitoring separations must be retained. Under the new arrangements, we shall need also to ensure that there is a credible mechanism to handle relations with military air traffic control.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 37, 42 and 43 seek to ensure that the interests of safety are primary. The amendments highlight the need to maintain safety levels and protect those who use aircraft or live beneath a flight path.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 37 and 43 would change the wording, which includes ``further'' and suggests a mindset that has more to do with financial or corporate interests, to ``protect'', which reminds all those involved, not least the Secretary of State and the Civil Aviation Authority that their first duty is to see to it that airline companies, airport owners and managers, passengers and freight users are properly ``protected''.
<P>
Amendment No. 42 is more complex, but achieves a double function, going beyond Conservative amendment No. 4, which we have just debated. We agree with Conservative Members that the Secretary of state should not be granted the discretion to decide between the conflicting demands of profitability and safety. Subsection (3) looks ahead to possible conflicts between, for example, ensuring that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``licence holders will not find it unduly difficult to finance activities''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and ``interests regarding safety''. Not only do we wish to remove the discretion granted to the Secretary of State, but make it clear that his duty is to come down on the side of safety. All told, he must exercise his functions under this chapter so that safety in air traffic control is not compromised.
<P>
On the other amendments tabled by Conservative Members, we cannot support amendments Nos. 3 and 6. Promoting competition is not in the interests of NATS. Under our proposals for an independent, publicly owned company, there would be no competition, Amendments Nos. 110 and 115 are aimed at placing a duty on the Secretary of State to consider the ``burden of administration'' when seeking to further the interest of operators. We await further clarification of what that might be.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I open the debate to the Floor, the hon. Gentleman said in his opening remarks that he was seeking to move a number of amendments. Although I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware of this, I remind the Committee that we move and debate the lead amendment. If hon. Members wish to move other amendments, whether or not they are in their name—once they are on the amendment paper in this form they become the property of the Committee—they may move them, but I should appreciate the courtesy of advance notice if they wish to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): First, may I thank the Government? On Tuesday, we asked for documentation. The first document that we requested as a matter of urgency was the draft licence agreement, which we received on Wednesday. I am sure that that sets a good precedent for the rest of the Bill. As we go through it, we shall need information. The provision of the draft licences is extremely useful and will save the Committee considerable time because we can see much more clearly how the regime of this public-private partnership will work.
<P>
In his covering letter, Lord Macdonald acknowledged that other key documents, such as shareholder agreements and articles of association of licensee companies are being worked at and will be forthcoming in due course. It is always better to argue from a position of fact rather than to do so like a jelly or blancmange, and the provision of that information will be very useful.
<P>
Clause 1 is important because it sets out the general duties of the Secretary of State, who is responsible to Parliament. Safety is a concern that goes all the way through the proposal, and rightly so because safety must be part of the culture of the new regime and system. It is important that we ensure that that is the case. Both Opposition and Labour Members have shown their concern about the wording. We are trying to get the right wording and to ensure that first principles are correct.
<P>
Under the Civil Aviation Act 1982, the Secretary of State's general duties are the promotion of safety and efficiency. That wording is not particularly controversial. The Bill mentions ``efficiency and economy'' and ``minimum restrictions'' as points of debate.
<P>
On amendments Nos. 3 and 6, to be honest to the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore), I am not entirely sure that ``competition'' should be inserted, having looked at the matter within the context of this debate. The amendment is intended to find out what the Government's thinking is on this matter. It is important to get the wording right. An efficient regime is also a safe regime, but the word ``economy'' is sometimes misinterpreted. It depends how it is interpreted with regard to general duties.
<P>
We seek from the Minister a general description of the meanings of those categories and, as the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale said, an explanation as to how to reconcile subsections (1) and (2), which set out the duties and then tack safety on, rather than putting safety at the beginning and tacking the other duties on.
<P>
I am sure that we shall return to many of the issues as we proceed through the Bill. The wording is clumsy, even though our wording is not particularly elegant. Will the Minister tell us a little more about the meaning of those terms in subsection (1)(b) and (d)? What are ``minimum restrictions''? One does not want to overload the CAA with too many regulations, but it would be useful if the Minister would elaborate about the Government's thinking.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It is worth expanding a little on the relationship between profit and safety, which is central to our amendments and those of the Liberal Democrats. It is worrying that the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale said that there was a potential conflict between safety and profit. At this stage in our consideration of the Bill, it might be worth focusing on whether that conflict exists.
<P>
The truth is that there is at present no risk at all. The RAF safety record in the United Kingdom is probably better than that almost anywhere else in the world, including the United States. Our air proxies as they are known—that is, proximities—are lower than ever. There have been no fatal accidents within living memory in British airspace—I believe I am right in saying that, although I stand to be corrected—or a minimal number at all events. Safety standards are, of course, as high as they could possibly be within the United Kingdom.
<P>
The implication behind some of the comments made this morning is that those very high standards might be compromised if either the public-private partnership went ahead or if there were any more extreme form of privatisation. It might be worth thinking about that. All precedents for privatisations of organisations that have safety implications have demonstrated that safety standards have improved. Such arguments were used at the time of the privatisation of British Airways. I remember people saying, ``Oh we can't possibly privatise the airlines because they'll want to make a profit. Isn't that dreadful? They'll do two things: first, hammer the workers and, secondly, compromise safety.''
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Nothing could be further from the truth. British Airways is the safest airline in the world: far safer now than it was then. Its standard—if not its safety—used to be rather below that of Aeroflot. The same applies to the British Airports Authority, British Gas and, more recently, to the privatisation of nuclear power, which the Labour party opposed on safety grounds—it eventually realised that privatisation was correct and that safety standards would increase and improve because of it.
<P>
Many potentially dangerous organisations that were, for years, run by civil servants are now run by business people making profits. There has been no suggestion at all from the Labour party that the safety standards of any of those industries and organisations have in any shape, size or form been compromised. The truth is that safety standards are higher in those businesses now than they were before privatisation. There is no evidence to show that civil servants, bless 'em, who are so good at so many things, are good at providing high safety standards in such organisations.
<P>
The implication behind the amendments is that somehow or other, if we allow profit to come into all of this, safety will be compromised. I know of no evidence—I am willing to listen to examples if there are any—to show that any such compromise exists anywhere within the United Kingdom. Indeed, what business can make money out of allowing its passengers to be killed? We will come to similar arguments when we discuss railways. It is often said, ``We mustn't allow Railtrack to compromise safety standards,'' but the same argument applies in that case.
<P>
The whole principle behind privatisation and even behind the limited PPP that is being proposed is that there is no suggestion at all that safety will be compromised by the introduction of the profit motive. The profit motive is a good thing, although it sticks in the craw of—
<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith (Vale of Glamorgan):</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify a point for me? Is he speaking against the amendment tabled by the Conservative party?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Indeed I am not. The principle behind both sets of amendments is a good one. The Secretary of State must have a view on safety and, after privatisation, as before, safety must be paramount in the way in which NATS, which will then be an independent company, is run.
<P>
Of course that is a good principle. I was dealing with the thought that lies behind it. There was an implication that somehow or other—we heard it during the speech of the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale—the profit motive may undermine safety. There is no such implication and I again challenge anyone to point to anywhere in Britain where it could be demonstrated that the profit motive has undermined safety; it has not.
<P>
While I was certainly supporting the amendments and the principle that the Secretary of State should be responsible for safety and of course, safety must be paramount in all air traffic control, none the less at this early stage in our consideration of the Bill it might be worth trying to lay that ghost—the ghost that lurks at the back of Labour minds, which instinctively dislike profits. I think that the Minister is protesting that it is Liberal Democrat Members who dislike profits. I suspect a similar schizophrenia exists in most Labour minds. They believe that the word ``profit'' is bad—if a company makes a profit there must somehow be an implication that safety standards will be reduced. I thought it was worth laying that ghost.
<P>
I believe that the opposite is the case—that by bringing the profit motive into these businesses, one is likely to increase safety standards. I therefore wholeheartedly support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends on the Front Bench, but not those proposed by the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It is a Liberal Democrat amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Minister protests. The point of my remarks was to make it plain that, while supporting those amendments, it is important that safety is paramount by the winding up of—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> For the benefit of the Committee, will the hon. Gentleman give some clarification? He said that he does not support the amendments moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, notwithstanding the fact that his hon. Friends on the Conservative Front Bench have said that they do. Are we seeing evidence of a split?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It is a split on the finest detail. The Liberal Democrat amendments go too far and place too great a responsibility on the Secretary of State by saying that he will be responsible for any air accident or compromise of safety. We say that the Secretary of State's duty is to promote and further safety rather than be responsible for it. It is a fine point. The principle that I was trying to establish was that, while all members of the Committee believe that safety must be paramount in the mind of the Secretary of State and of the privatised NATS, as I like to think of it, safety will not be compromised by the public-private partnership. That is the important principle of which the Committee should not lose sight and on which I thought I had laid down a marker during our earlier consideration of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith:</B> I agree with some of the sentiments behind the Liberal Democrat amendments. Safety is an extremely important consideration, but not because we have a bad safety recommendation, even though some of the comments by the one-dimensional hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) are patently absurd. There are examples of fatalities in air space and it is nonsense to say that there are no examples in this country of commercial interests having overridden safety interests. One has only to think of the dreadful Hebden Bridge disaster, where the community was devastated by the effects of asbestosis. We all agree, however, that in responsible companies that pursue legitimate profit there should not be any conflict with safety considerations. We should remember that every employer and commercial organisation in the United Kingdom and most other industrialised countries has statutory safety obligations in the pursuit of profit and for good reason.
<P>
I am not concerned that safety is not adequately covered by the Bill, nor am I convinced by the argument that we should rephrase the wording. The very essence of this part of the Bill, which would separate safety regulation from the provisions of the service, has to be the single most important safety factor that is being proposed.
<P>
There is a great deal of public concern—real or imagined—about the safety of air transport. I know that because of the recent incident that affected a plane that took off from Cardiff international airport in my constituency and crashed in Gerona. The accident created enormous public concern in my part of the world among the people involved. Although, miraculously, no one was killed in the incident, someone died afterwards, possibly due to the crash. During the passage of the Bill, we should bear in mind the public perception of air transport safety.
<P>
An interim report on the Gerona crash was published last Friday by the air accidents investigation branch of the Civil Aviation Authority. The crash undermined people's confidence in the air safety record and the ability of the CAA to inspire full confidence in what it is doing. The report was scant on detail. It looked as though it was attempting to make a scapegoat of the pilot. A great many questions remain unanswered, including the role of the Spanish air traffic control. The report does not explain fully why there was a delay of up to an hour and a half before emergency services reached the aircraft, or why the plane disappeared off the air traffic controllers' screens.
<P>
There is a lack of confidence in the CAA's ability to carry out such investigations. I do not say that they are not being carried out properly, but there is public concern. One thing that the Bill will do is reassure the public that the Civil Aviation Authority will be exclusively responsible for safety—not for providing the services that it is investigating.
<P>
I do not support the amendment, but the Bill needs to deal with the growing public concern about air transport safety, even though the facts do not show that the situation is becoming any worse.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I make no apology for tabling an amendment about safety. Safety is one of the issues of paramount concern in the operation of National Air Traffic Services. Safety is the business of NATS. Its job is to maintain the safe separation of aircraft in our airspace. If its job were not safety, it would not exist. I accept that our amendment is to a certain extent superfluous, but it would have been strange not to have sought to provoke a debate on safety when it is one of the issues of such paramount importance.
<P>
I spent the days before Christmas monitoring closely the tragic accident at Stansted, talking to the people at the airport, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Secretary of State himself. Stansted is very near my home and quite near my constituency. Immediately, all the concerns about what had caused the accident kicked in. It is instructive to learn from the way in which the civil aviation sector responds to such tragedy; Everyone instantly knows what to do and how to behave. There is watertight secrecy around the investigation and it is only later that we learn the causes of the accident and we now have the report. It was not an air traffic control issue, and was most likely to have been some maintenance failure.
<P>
The key concern that was expressed to me locally was that recently the flight paths had been changed by the Civil Aviation Authority and therefore pilots were programming new automatic routes into their flight computers, so there may have been some failure of the air traffic control system. That always seemed to me an extremely long shot. I have visited both the London Air Traffic Control Centre in West Drayton and the new national en-route centre at Swanwick and I have seen for myself the extraordinary dedication and professionalism of air traffic staff. The first thing to say about safety and air traffic control is that anyone who believes that privatisation of NATS will compromise safety is questioning the professionalism of air traffic controllers who do their job. You will find no air traffic controller on the floor of the London Air Traffic Control Centre or working in the Swanwick centre who believes that he, or she, will allow any compromise on safety.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman so early in his speech, but does he accept that the many hundreds of air traffic controllers who do not work for National Air Traffic Services, but who are equally concerned about safety, share those sentiments?
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am sorry, but which sentiments? Does the hon. Gentleman mean the sentiments that they will neither compromise safety themselves nor allow the profit motive to do so, any more than the driver of a bus would on behalf of himself, or herself and the passengers?
<P>
By quoting the chief executive of Railtrack saying how difficult it is for him to balance his public service obligations, shareholders and commercial discipline, the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale is being a little disingenuous. I do not believe for a moment that Mr. Corbett was referring to safety. The safety culture in all our transport industries is paramount. If anything, the railway has something to learn from the safety culture of the civil aviation sector. Lord Cullen's inquiry into the North sea oil industry learned from it and it will be interesting to see whether his inquiry into the Paddington crash also does so. I believe that it will.
<P>
The aviation safety culture developed the principle of the safety case, which analyses not simply which bits of equipment are necessary to make airlines and air traffic safe, but probabilities and all the human factors, to ensure that the mechanics, and also the training and procedures are correct.
<P>
Confidential reporting procedures have been mentioned. These were invented in the civil aviation sector. If one visits the air traffic control centre at West Drayton, one sees confidential, human, incident reporting—CHIRP. It applies as much to the air traffic controllers as to the pilots and ground staff. It is part of the culture and we are dealing with a very fragmented industry. People often say that the fragmentation of an industry compromises safety. You could not find a more diverse and complex industry than aviation. It is regulated internationally by many different domestic national regulatory regimes, but there is a great sense of community in the airline world and a common purpose to improve and monitor safety, so a confidential incident reporting system works.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): I am pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I worked in the railway industry during the privatisation as a professional engineer. I had to go out to incidents to pick up the pieces and deal with problems caused by mishaps. Is it not the case that the fragmentation of that industry, which the hon. Gentleman so clearly itemised in terms of air traffic control and civil airlines, is what the Bill is about? We have to make good some of the problems that the country was left with following the privatisation and fragmentation of our railway industry. We went from central control to many companies. We had, and still have, committed professionals, whose priority is the safety ethic that the hon. Gentleman identified and acknowledged.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind all hon. Members that interventions should be brief. While we are on the subject, I understand why the hon. Gentleman raised the point, but we are discussing very specific amendments. I would not wish to go too far down the road of re-investigating rail privatisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I fear that you may have to suffer a certain amount of that as we get further into the Bill, Mr. Gale, but I am grateful for your indulgence of the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Lawrie), who is making a sincere and heartfelt point. I look forward to discussing rail safety later.
<P>
My argument is that fragmentation of an industry, or the private ownership of an industry, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire was saying, should not be any impediment to safety. The regulatory regime and the culture that exists in the organisation are the guarantee of safety, not who owns it, who profits from it, or who is responsible for the capital investment. Those are separate issues.
<P>
At the risk of straying again, the day after the Paddington crash the Secretary of State made it clear that he did not think that privatisation had anything to do with the causes of the crash—I accept that a great many Labour Members feel that it did. We will come to that later
<P>
There is already a strong safety culture in air traffic control, with mandatory occurrence reporting and the regular reporting of airprox incidents—what are known colloquially as ``near-misses''. That is an issue that the newspapers love—it is easy to sensationalise. My constituency is under what is known as the Clacton sector. I believe that the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson) will also wish to comment on this matter. When one reads in the newspapers that there has been a ``near-miss'' in the Clacton sector, people in Clacton imagine that a jumbo jet was about to land on their heads. A crash such as the one at Stansted airport over Christmas reinforces that concern.
<P>
In fact, an airprox is when two aircraft stray closer than is regarded as the natural safety limit. They may be miles apart. They might be on different levels but have crossed one above the other, or one might be too close behind another. The idea that our skies are increasingly full of aircraft swerving to avoid each other at the last moment is completely false.
<P>
Not only are all those voluntary and mandatory procedures available to our traffic controllers, but there are automatic collision avoidance systems in the cab of every civil aircraft, which would cause alarms to go off. It is impossible for anything approaching the risk of a collision to occur without several things having gone wrong.
<P>
It is important to understand this about the safety culture of civil aviation: any accident is highly improbable. Any failure that might lead to serious injury or loss of life has to have a probability of 10 to the minus nine. That is a chance of one in a thousand million.
<P>
To ensure that the probabilities are so slight, trip wires are built into the system. Several things would have to go wrong before there is a risk of catastrophic failure. It is necessary to go through several stages of failure before something catastrophic actually happens. The accident at Stansted, for which we have had the official report, was not just failure of communication in the cab or maintenance failure. Several factors would have built up to create a catastrophe.
<P>
The aircraft whose controls were frozen over the Atlantic last week is an example of a minor failure. The industry tries to keep those to one in 1 million. The idea is that one can have several one in 1 million failures without the loss of life. It is that sort of rigorous analysis—not merely of mechanics, but of human factors—that enables the industry to be safe. We have not only a collision avoidance system in the cab but also automatic mandatory occurrence reporting and overload reports. When an air traffic controller is not entirely happy about the aircraft on his screen and feels that he has too much to do, he can go to his supervisor and say, ``I wish to report that I think I was in overload''.
<P>
I asked about the coincidence of people reporting overloads and airprox incidents. They said, ``Funnily enough, airprox incidents occur more often in lightly populated radar areas than intensive ones''. Clearly, when someone's adrenalin is running and they are under pressure, they perform better. When they think that they are in a relatively relaxed situation, their attention may wander. The screens are in groups—two people look at a screen, with a supervisor wandering around behind. The possibility of a serious air traffic control mistake is low.
<P>
A film was made in the 1950s about air traffic control in the United States—it was about pressure and people chain smoking. Air traffic control is not like that: the environment is very relaxed, thoroughly professional and mutually supportive. In the railways, the Secretary of State is trying to get rid of an adversarial culture that long pre-dated privatisation. We need to ensure that we teach that co-operative and consensual safety culture. It is a supportive safety culture, in which one can say, ``I've got problems at home. I'm under terrible stress. Will you give me some time off?'' That culture exists. Privatisation will not compromise it. There is every prospect that privatisation will strengthen people's determination, because they will want to ensure that that positive culture in the air traffic control system, does not change.
<P>
I make no apology for tabling our amendment. We cannot consider this to be a major issue in the Bill and we will not press the amendment to a vote, but it is important to debate safety, which I daresay will come up at various stages in the Bill.
<P>
As a coda, may I say that this part of the drama is rather like Hamlet without the prince. This issue preoccupies the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang). His concern is that this is unlike any other privatisation, because National Air Traffic Services is a business of fixed income and has a fixed area of operations. It is a static business—it cannot expand like telecoms or electricity. It is a less dynamic business—more of a sub-contract to an operator, than the privatisation of a business. I should have been interested to hear the Minister's response to that argument, had the right hon. Gentleman been in this place.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael Portillo </B>(Kensington and Chelsea): If I have read the supporting documentation correctly, it is envisaged that there will be opportunity to win foreign contracts. Allusion has been made to the way in which airspace is managed over other European countries. We think it is not as well managed as airspace in Britain and, therefore, there is a possibility of expanding. From the point of view of profit and shareholder value, if the organisation compromised safety over the United Kingdom, what chance does my hon. Friend think it would have to expand its business abroad? If it developed a poor reputation for safety on account of having cut corners for short-term commercial gain, would it stand a good chance of wining contracts abroad? Would it be in a good position, therefore, to make higher profits and increase shareholder value?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My right hon. Friend is asking exactly the right question, but my purpose in posing my question to the Minister is to find out what he says. Do the Government intend this business to go abroad and win contracts overseas? The argument of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh is that that will compromise safety. He says that management should concentrate on the great challenge of managing United Kingdom air traffic control and improving it in co-„operation with our European partners—there is a whole agenda to discuss later on that—but trying to get overseas business will itself be a distraction and that will itself compromise safety. I tend to agree with the implication of my right hon. Friend's question that, for the business to succeed, it will have to succeed in the home market and be the best in the world, as it is today, in order to succeed abroad.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Again, it is an insult to the professionalism of the management of NATS to say that it will somehow be distracted, either by the process of privatisation or by the process of expanding its business overseas, from the core business of managing the safety of our air traffic control system. One of the great benefits of the proposal will be that NATS will not only be able to obtain the capital that it needs by privatisation—the lack of capital is compromising safety at present—but the ability to expand its operations overseas will improve the safety of passengers across the world. It will be especially interesting to see how it contributes to the safety of air traffic control in Europe.
<P>
What happens when the pressure is on at the air traffic control centre at West Drayton? The answer is surely that the aircraft sit on the tarmac. That is the ultimate safety mechanism. If too many aircraft come into our skies, some aircraft miss their slots and have to wait until there is space. The Bill is about improving air traffic capacity because better equipment and better air traffic control mean that the standard separation in the skies can be reduced. At the moment, Britain manages its air traffic so well and safely that we are managing substantial volumes of European air traffic through our air space. Air traffic control systems on the continent are utterly chaotic compared with ours. That is a tribute to the professionalism of our air traffic controllers and management, and a reason why every Committee member can have confidence in the safety of Britain's air traffic control as we move the business into the private sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale. I immediately declare an interest. As hon. Members may know, I own a travel company and a company that sells airline tickets to that company. I want to make that abundantly clear.
<P>
This part of the Bill is about safety in so far as it is about pumping into NATS through the private sector the money that it needs to equip itself for the new millennium with all its new complexities, which, as air traffic growth is about 6 per cent. per annum, will be needed on an ongoing basis. It is important, therefore, to support it.
<P>
Secondly, it is worth bearing in mind that, while we all care very much about safety, and safety is our business, safety is still a cost. We cannot simply say that safety is important without debating the relationship between that, commercial success and the commercial objectives of when and whether the new NATS will move into the European marketplace to take control of that. Those commercial decisions will be tempered by the need to manage costs and to maximise safety. To suggest that there are no examples of cases where those balances have been clear is wrong.
<P>
I remember a headline in the transport press that Railtrack had said that a new signalling operation did not make business sense. Railtrack simply meant that, as the situation was then, it was not prepared to make that investment, although it clearly believed that it was satisfying the safety obligations laid down. It has to be recognised that there are balances and that there are more and less expensive ways of doing things.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that safety is an additional cost. It is important to understand that those in civil aviation do not think that. They would never get into the ghastly argument of the cost of saving lives. If they start talking about the cost of saving life, they feel that they have failed, because their aim is managing safety, not offsetting safety against cost. Safety is the business of air traffic control; it is a commercial gain. The safer the skies, the more aircraft can be carried through the skies and the more profit will be made. That is the reverse of the relationship on which the hon. Gentleman insists.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to be goaded into my famed irascibility. We must try to keep interventions reasonably brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
That was an interesting speech. Obviously the business of NATS is safety—it is not an add on—but at the same time NATS is a business and there are commercial decisions to be made. The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) rightly made the point that, if the new NATS does not get safety 110 per cent. right, it will have much less chance of gaining new contracts in foreign markets. For instance, if the amount of investment and the way it is done increases safety innovations above and beyond statutory requirements, that may give it a competitive advantage in moving into other markets, such as that of South America.
<P>
Seeing safety as a possible saleable product in the international marketplace and its relationship with commercial decisions also has some bearing on an understanding of the different culture of the new NATS, although safety will be its foundation. It is therefore of paramount importance that statutory obligations are clear and that there is a separation between the operation of safety and the regulation itself. Again, that is a fundamental part of the Bill. Safety is paramount and the Bill seeks to bring in the extra cash needed to deal with the increasing volume and complexity of airline traffic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We have had a good debate on this extremely important issue and I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) and his colleagues for the responsible way in which they have approached it.
<P>
The Government takes safety extremely seriously and, as the hon. Member for North Essex said, there is a safety culture throughout NATS that will not only be preserved but, hopefully, enhanced. Clauses 1(2) and 2(2) make it clear that safety is a most important consideration, and clause 8(1)(a) proposes that a licence holder
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must secure that a safe system . . . is maintained''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
no ifs, buts or qualifications. The hon. Member for North Essex enumerated some of the existing safety mechanisms, and we have no intention of changing them. I shall not repeat them, but he is right in everything that he says.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale—I usually forget the name, but it is one of the most beautiful constituencies in the country—is mistaken. The purpose of the licence is economic regulation. There are references to safety in it, as I am sure he will see when he has had an opportunity to look at it.
<P>
The safety regime is laid down in the Civil Aviation Act 1982 and the Air Navigation (No. 2) Order 1995 and nothing in the Bill is intended to change that. That regime is not going to be diminished by the Bill. We are going to enhance safety by separating regulation from service provision. It is something that all those who are seriously interested in the industry have been advising Governments to do for a long time. We have had discussions with all interested parties—the unions, management and the safety regulator—about how to further enhance safety during this process. We will be coming to some conclusions about that soon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> What does the hon. Gentleman say to the charge that, because NATS is already effectively a safety regulator—it is regulating the skies—it is forced to split one regulator from another because it is in fact itself a regulatory function? I do not share that view, but it is something that he should explain on the record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Regulation is a matter for the Civil Aviation Authority and that is going to remain in the public sector. We are going to separate safety regulation from operations. Most people in any industry where safety is important recognise that that is a sensible thing to do. It is going to have to be done in the railway industry too in due course.
<P>
On the speeches made by other hon. Members, I cannot go as far as the hon. Member for North Wiltshire in saying that there is never a conflict between safety and profit, but he made many sensible points—although I do not expect to agree with him often during the course of this Bill. It is true to say that when the airlines were privatised some years ago, many of the same arguments were deployed and, with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that they were nonsense.
<P>
It is a little-known fact that air traffic control is already provided privately at many local airports. I do not pretend that that is a large proportion of the entire business, but it happens at a significant number of local airports—to and from which hon. Members no doubt fly without even knowing that it has been privately provided for some years. Precisely the same safety regime applies to those airports as to the rest of the business.
<P>
Nevertheless, I agree with the hon. Member for the Vale of Glamorgan, who pointed out that there had been cases, not necessarily in the aviation industry, where safety and profit have been found to be in conflict. He mentioned the asbestos industry and I am sure that we can all think of others. I cannot, therefore, go as far as the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, but many of his arguments were sensible.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex asked me to deal with the hypothetical argument that might have been made had my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh been here, but I thought that his right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea dealt with that point. The hon. Gentleman is right. It is expected that there will be foreign business to be obtained, provided that we can create an air traffic control system in Britain with state-of-the-art technology that will maintain the extremely high reputation that our system already has.
<P>
It is inevitable that the number of centres from which air traffic control is managed will diminish dramatically with the technological changes that we can expect. At the moment in Europe, there are 31 state-owned air traffic control operations with 49 different centres. In due course, we are expected to come down to four or five, and we want British air traffic control to be one of those four or five. Therefore, there is considerable business to be had. There is also business to be had outside Europe. The hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea is right. It is wrong to suggest that there is no basis for expansion.

<P>

<B>Mr Portillo:</B> Many of the arguments that we now hear from at least some Labour Members are different from those that we used to hear three years ago and more. There are few consolations about being in opposition. One small one is to hear a little more sense from Labour Members and rather less nonsense than we used to hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman knows, I have not been on the Front Bench long, but in the 11 or 12 years that I spent on the Back Benches I believe that I talked common sense all the time. I have not changed because I have suddenly metamorphosed. Indeed, I challenge him to find that I said anything contrary to what I have said today on these issues during those 11 or 12 years. Had the right hon. Gentleman turned up earlier, however, he would have heard his Front-Bench colleagues arguing the opposite of what they used to argue in government. They have certainly seized some of the opportunities afforded by opposition to which he refers.
<P>
On that slightly light-hearted note in what is a serious debate, I shall conclude by repeating that safety is fundamental to NATS. That will not change; if anything, it will be enhanced. I invite the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> First, I apologise, Mr. Gale. No discourtesy was intended in my opening remarks. I put it down to the early start this morning. You may wish to put it down to other reasons.
<P>
As the Minister said and the hon. Member for North Essex said before him, this has been a useful debate. We have had a good discussion about safety—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a limit to the number of conversations that I can listen to at any one time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The spirit in which the debate has been carried out has been very constructive. May I briefly pick up two or three points? Essentially, the decision about safety comes down to a matter of judgment and the Liberal Democrats may have a different judgment about the interface between the two. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire and others referred to previous privatisations—the airlines and BAA. In our judgment, those are different types of privatisation, not least because the scope to increase revenues and, therefore, to increase profitability has been far greater for the likes of British Airways and BAA at Heathrow alone, never mind elsewhere, than would be envisaged for NATS.
<P>
We understand that it is the Government's intention, with the official Opposition's support, that NATS should in due course be able to expand its business overseas. We are not wild about that idea and we believe that there will be serious problems with achieving that. It remains to be seen how willing overseas countries are to have their airspace, or en-„route air traffic, controlled from the United Kingdom, although we may be proved wrong and others may be proved right. On balance, our view at present is that the scope for improving and increasing the turnover of NATS is fairly restricted within the current regime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms:</B> The hon. Gentleman should be aware that we currently control some of the southern Irish airspace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I was about to point out that I, like the hon. Member for North Essex, have spent some time at NATS facilities. I was particularly impressed by the one at Prestwick. I am aware that there are international agreements such as the one with Ireland, but it is a question of the scope for extension and our judgment is that it is more limited than others believe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> If the hon. Gentleman's thesis is that because there is no room for expansion, safety has been compromised, what does he think about nuclear power, where there is no room for expansion at all?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> Tempted as I am, I shall observe your earlier strictures to keep to the point, Mr. Gale, and I shall not go down that route.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I have done so several times. I want to make progress.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex suggested that we were impugning the integrity of those who work at NATS, especially the management. That is not our intention. We acknowledge that NATS provides a world-class service, and that it is staffed by highly professional and respected air traffic controllers—people with the finest reputations anywhere on the globe. We accept that and do not challenge it, but it is crucial to recognise that the unions and the bulk of NATS staff are extremely anxious about these proposals. They do not support the Government and they deserve to be listened to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Of course we should listen to NATS employees, but I ask the hon. Gentleman the same question that I put to the hon. Member for North Essex. Is there any difference in the commitment to safety demonstrated by existing traffic controllers—those who work for NATS—those who are privately employed and work for scores of airports throughout the United Kingdom?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I welcome that intervention. The balance between private and public sector is important, but I do not denigrate the efforts of those working in the private sector; nor do I expect that, under a private regime, current NATS employees would change their ethos. They believe that the current ethos helps them to do their job to the best of their ability—and we should seek to maintain that.
<P>
The Minister talked about the licence reflecting economic regulation. That does not necessarily contradict our view that up-front, serious reference should be made to safety. We have had a useful debate and we shall, no doubt, return to air safety later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I rise to speak to all the amendments standing in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. Amendments Nos, 122 and 123 were tabled by the hon. Member for North Essex.
<P>
The vast majority of the amendments would ensure that the Bill refers only to a single licence holder or a single company. New clause 3 contains the nub of our argument and is the most crucial of our proposals, because it sets out our alternative to the current organisational structure of NATS. It calls for the establishment of an independent publicly owned company, often referred to as an IPOC. Amendment No. 48 would ensure that, if new clause 3 were accepted, a single IPOC would cover the current UK-managed area and any other areas that are negotiated subsequent to our recent debate.
<P>
During the relatively brief time that the Committee has been sitting, it has become clear that none of the political parties represented on it are arguing for the status quo for National Air Traffic Services. My understanding of the different positions will probably be accepted by everyone: the Government are now in favour of a part privatisation, the Conservative party favours full privatisation and, as is clear from the amendments, Liberal Democrats want an independent, publicly owned company.
<P>
My hon. Friend and I made clear our support for an IPOC during the Second Reading on 20 December. At the end of that debate, we all enjoyed the purple prose of the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) but, sadly, it substituted for any rational summing up of the debate. I should like to remind the Committee of part of that speech. The Minister stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``From Liberal Democrat Members we have had the usual defence of the status quo: it should all be paid for out of the public purse or by public sector borrowing.'',—[Official Report, 20 December 1999; Vol. 341, c. 624.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Had he listened to my speech and that of my hon. Friend instead of chortling through his ``here's one I prepared earlier'' speech, he would have known that he had got that wrong I hope that, having studied our amendments, the Minister now acknowledges that the Liberal Democrats are not proposing the status quo for NATS, but that we believe that something more than the status quo is needed.
<P>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee agree on the need for change. There is probably also considerable agreement on why we need change and what the objectives of any change should be. Moreover, we all agree with the hon. Member for North Essex, the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale when they acknowledge the tremendous work of both management and staff of National Air Traffic Services. I hope that we all acknowledge that it has been a particularly successful public-sector enterprise in both commercial and safety terms.
<P>
We know that NATS operates in a number of areas. Some 85 per cent of its income comes from providing en-route to terminal area and oceanic ATC services, with 15 per cent from the provision of approach services and airport air traffic control services. It is worth remembering that the latter are obtained under straightforward contracts on an open-market basis. Despite having to compete in the open market, NATS has become a market leader. Some people, who may not fully acknowledge NATS' commercial success, have been critical and suggested that, given the current charging mechanism, there has been a lack of incentive to reduce costs and charges. The reality is very different. Prices have been cut: between 1994 and 1999, the NATS element of UK en-route charges has fallen by 17 per cent.
<P>
NATS has had to borrow money to invest in new capital equipment. It has borrowed approximately £800 million from the Treasury over the past decade, but has repaid all of it with interest. There has been no cost to the taxpayer. Having done all that, it has quite significantly increased its operating profits before interest and tax: for example, it had an operating profit of £46 million before interest and tax in 1997–98, rising to £64 million in 1999. Under current arrangements, it is a successful public enterprise.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, since the early l990s there has been much talk of a need for some sort of change in that structure, so as to achieve a number of objectives with which I hope the Committee agrees. The first objective is one we all desire: to give NATS freedom from inclusion in the public sector borrowing requirement, while continuing to meet its need for significant financial investment. Members of the Committee will recognise that there is a time lag between the point at which capital is raised for investment and point at which increased income is recovered from charges. NATS estimates that it needs about £1 billion of investment over the coming decade—it needs £250 million for the Prestwick centre alone—or approximately £100 million a year. That is not a great deal of money compared with, say, the £800 million a year that the Government now get from their airport duty tax alone; nor is it a great challenge when one considers the scale of NATS' current operating profit. I am sure that hon. Members agree that it makes sense for that investment, however modest it is by comparison with other investment, to fall outside the PSBR.
<P>
Secondly, we agree that there is considerable benefit in giving NATS freedom from having to compete with other Departments for public investment funds. Thirdly, even though, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale said, we are somewhat less sanguine than many about this, we agree that any new organisation or model for NATS must be able to have access to new markets and should not be prevented from involving in NATS, at both management and operational level, people who have significance expertise from the private sector. It should also have, within a clearly established regulatory framework—the Minister has already spoken of the importance of the economic regulatory framework, but there is also the commercial regulatory framework to consider—freedom from inappropriate interference by either civil servants or politicians.
<P>
Finally—although I should perhaps have mentioned this first—we agree, as our earlier debate made clear, that safety should be paramount. I hope, although I was not wholly sure from earlier discussions, that we all agree that there is considerable merit in separating safety regulation—whether through the safety regulation group, or some other body—from the safety regulation regime, however much the operational side is based on the safety culture.
<P>
We agree that change is needed and that it should achieve several objectives. Therefore, the broad question is what is the best way to achieve those objectives. Some form of privatisation, whether in whole or in part, is clearly an option that has been considered several times before.
<P>
I am sure that all members of the Committee have seen the excellent Library research paper No. 99/102, which refers to the early history of the consideration of the possible privatisation of NATS. I shall not refer to that paper in detail, because I am sure that all hon. Members have studied it closely. Suffice it to say that, when the previous Conservative Government first considered privatisation in 1994—primarily for financial reasons, as they admitted—the idea received a very frosty reception in many quarters. Indeed, the then Conservative-dominated Transport Committee did not back the idea and, in February 1995, recommended that the Government should publish a detailed explanation of why they did not favour the alternative—converting NATS into a profit-making public sector company, which is the option that we propose today. It must be remembered that, in the chill of that frosty reception, the Government decided not to press on with their proposals and introduce legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman ever given a privatisation proposal anything but a frosty reception?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Without going beyond the bounds of your strictures, Mr. Gale, I must tell the hon. Gentleman that I would have to look at the record, because I cannot remember one way or the other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Allow me to assist the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Certainly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be grateful when I remind him that, when the then Labour Opposition voted against railway privatisation, the Liberals were to be found in the Lobby with the Conservatives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am most grateful to hon. Gentleman for helping me out. I have an exceedingly bad memory. For good or ill, the hon. Member for North Essex now has an answer. However, I might check the record of that debate.
<P>
The important point is that the proposition for some form of privatisation is not new. When privatisation was first proposed in 1994, it received a frosty reception, not least from the then Conservative-dominated Transport Committee. It also received a frosty reception from the then Labour Opposition. It is worth remembering the now oft-quoted passage of the speech made by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) now Chief Secretary to the Treasury, at the 1996 Labour party conference, in which he used the now infamous phrase, ``Our air is not for sale.'' How quickly the Government seem to have forgotten.
<P>
I am not surprised that the Conservative party proposes a privatisation model, given its history. No doubt, it is looking for a catchy title for the privatised NATS—perhaps ``Skytrack'', or something similar. However much I disagree with Conservative Members, I acknowledge the consistency of their ideas, even though they fly in the face of best advice and of the evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I note that one of new clause 3's objectives is 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to achieve a commercial rate of return for the Crown''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the Airline Group's likely bid for the PPP suggests a non-commercial rate of return, as that would encourage greater investment in safety?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Yes. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's reminder, as I shall refer to the Airline Group's proposal later. My hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale is keen to mention it too, Mr. Gale, if he catches your eye.
<P>
Without straying beyond your strictures, Mr. Gale, I remind the hon. Gentleman that two proposals were made in relation to the national lottery: Camelot proposed a structure with a commercial rate of return and Richard Branson proposed a not-for-profit system. Which proposal would, ultimately, provide a greater rate of return was debated, with the then Government deciding on the evidence, that it would be offered by the commercial operation. Such differences may therefore be debated.
<P>
I am not surprised by the Conservative party's consistency. However, I am extremely surprised by the inconsistency of the Labour party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Surely not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The right hon. Gentleman may say that, but one sometimes says things with tongues and cheeks adjacent to one another.
<P>
We all agree on the objectives. Is the Bill's model for achieving those objectives the best and most sensible one? We think not, and we are not alone in reaching that conclusion: pilots and other industry professionals have expressed anxiety about the proposal; and more than 100 Labour Members of Parliament have publicly opposed the Government's plans. As has been said, nine leading airlines have formed an action group to attempt to take over the licence if the proposal goes through, because they are fearful that it may fall into the wrong hands and that safety could be compromised by commercial imperatives. The Institute of Professionals, Managers and Specialists, which represents air traffic control staff is opposed, as is the British Air Line Pilots Association, representing pilots.
<P>
On Second reading, the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), who chairs the Transport Sub-Committee, told the House:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I am totally opposed to the sale of NATS''.—[Official Report, 20 December 1999; Vol. 341, c.553.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the same debate, the former Transport Minister, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang)—who is absent from Committee because of ill health—argued powerfully against the Government's proposals.
<P>
Most significant of all, however, is the fact that, when the Tories proposed the privatisation, the Transport Sub-Committee—then dominated by Tories—came out against it. Now that there is a Labour proposal for part privatisation, the Labour-dominated Sub-Committee has expressed significant reservations about it. Indeed, its third special report points out that other countries have solved the dilemma in several different ways and concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government should examine the experience of other countries m restructuring their air traffic control organisations with a view to adopting one of these models or adapting one of them to UK conditions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the Sub-Committee's response to a suggested privatisation is to propose some form of IPOC—the very thing proposed in our amendments.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Why have so many people concluded that an IPOC would be a better model and that the Government's proposal is neither the best nor the most sensible? There are many arguments, but I shall mention only three. Let us examine the sale of 51 per cent. of NATS. I will not use my figures, but those on page 40 of the explanatory notes that have been given to all hon. Members. They state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Income from the partial sale of NATS to a strategic partner could raise in the region of £350 million. Against that, NATS has outstanding loans of around £300 million which will need to be settled''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That will leave just £50 million. However, the notes go on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The . . . cost of establishing a public-private partnership for the provision of air traffic services will be approximately £35 million.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 So £350 million minus £300 million leaves just £50 million; take from that the £35 million needed to set up the scheme, and the net proceeds of this smash-and-grab raid, according to the Government's own figures, are just £15 million—[Interruption]. The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) laughs, but they are his figures, not mine.
<P>
Then there is the issue of investment—
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I will in a moment, but I want to make a crucial point about investment first.
<P>
One of the key objectives of the Government's proposals—and, indeed, of ours—is to enable NATS to make critical investment in the order of £1 billion over the next 10 years; but how much will that investment cost? The hon. Member for Croydon, Central will be well aware that the Government currently require a rate of return of 8 per cent. on money that they put up front for investment in new equipment and so on; NATS meets that requirement. Bonds issued under our IPOC proposal would require a rate of return of a few per cent. above the prevailing interest rate, so we acknowledge that it would be marginally more expensive than the current arrangement. However, under the Government's proposal, a private-sector partner would expect a much higher commercial return. I understand, for example, that SERCO, which is one of the prospective bidders, currently records a figure of 24 per cent. return on equity—considerably higher than 8 per cent. or the marginally more than 8 per cent. figure that we propose. The Government's model is therefore a significantly more expensive solution to the question of investment.
<P>
The debate on the previous group of amendments dealt with safety. Given the charging caps and charging structure that will be in place, the real question is how NATS can foot the bill for the significantly increased investment costs associated with the Government's proposal. We contend that the savings that would be necessary would have a major impact on both service delivery and safety. On Second Reading, the Deputy Prime Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Air traffic control is all about safety''.—[Official Report, 20 December 1999; Vol. 341, c.535.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the requirement to make literally tens of millions of pounds extra to cover the increased cost of borrowing means that safety will be compromised, not because of the actions and change in attitudes of individual air traffic controllers—we do not claim that for a minute—but because the number of air traffic controllers, their equipment and their operational organisation will have to change to enable the newly privatised NATS to make the increased profits necessary to meet the return that will be required of it by commercial money lenders.
<P>
None of those problems arise from the IPOC proposal. The Government, not least in their evidence to the Select Committee, have tried to ridicule that proposal, but failed to convince either the Select Committee itself or the Liberal Democrats. If my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale catches your eye, Mr. Gale, he will explain exactly why. The IPOC proposal meets all the objectives that I have outlined and avoids the problems. It is a model that has been adopted in many other countries in one form or another and it has the support of many people working in the industry. In short, it commands far greater support than the Government's proposals for a smash-and-grab raid that offers very little return and gives rise to real fears about future safety.
<P>
The Minister of State, who is not with us today, made it clear on Tuesday that the Government might not have got all aspects of the Bill right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Of course I will give way before I come to my patch of purple prose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that the Minister of State is not with us. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), who has recently been ill, has a hospital appointment today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for telling us that. I also thank his hon. Friend the Minister of State who told me that that would be the case. We all wish him a speedy recovery, so that he can join us in our lengthy deliberation.
<P>
As I was saying, the Minister of State acknowledged that there were aspects on which the Government may have got it wrong. I believe that this is an example where they have and this is an area where a u-turn would be welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am trying to wind up, but I of course will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that the IPOC model would give NATS less freedom and less chance to extend its opportunities to the European arena, which it must do in view of the current evolution in air traffic? As a model it is already obsolete in terms of solving the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No, I do not agree. I turn once again to the Under-Secretary's wind-up speech on Second Reading. It was a patch of purple prose. He said that we were not suggesting anything other than the status quo and added that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Liberal Democrats are stranded among the flotsam and jetsam, high on the shoreline of history.''—[Official Report, 20 December 1999; Vol. 341, c. 624.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The self-satisfaction he displayed at that passage was unbelievable to behold. I merely wish to end by telling him that he is absolutely wrong. The Liberal Democrats—and here I must be fair and point out that someone in my office wrote this bit, just as someone wrote his bit—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that hon. Gentleman is not reading a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I have learnt this bit by heart—it is well worth hearing. The Liberal Democrats have zoomed in a hi-tech hovercraft up above the shorelines of history, and on into the bright sunlit uplands of a radical solution.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that with almost a straight face. I call Mr. Syms.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> It is always a pleasure to follow an epoch—or IPOC—making speech.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) has clearly decided to set out early in proceedings on the Bill his party's proposed alternative for the future of National Air Traffic Services. He told us a little about what the Government and other parties stand for. The Government are for PPP, the Liberal Democrats favour IPOC, and the Conservative party want a fully privatised NATS. However, if we had been wholly enthusiastic and dancing in the streets about it, we probably would have done it during 18 years in office. There are problems, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said following a question from the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh.
<P>
There are a few differences between NATS privatisation and others. A past example is the BAA, which, with its shopping in airports and its capacity to expand, was in a far better position. International agreements and fixed fees make it much more difficult for NATS to raise income. Nevertheless, provided that the CAA's regulatory regime is correct, we still think that there is no reason for NATS not to be wholly owned by the private sector.
<P>
We have some concerns about timing. It is inconceivable to us that an agreement of any sort could be reached about private sector investment before the Swanwick centre comes into operation in spring 2002. Swanwick is critical to NATS' future. Because of price and many other issues, it would be too early to come to an agreement with the private sector until the Swanwick centre comes into operation. We shall get best value when that system is up and running and when we have switched people from West Drayton, and overcome the problems of ensuring both that there are sufficient staff to transfer and that the system is working properly. In principle, we favour privatisation, but timing is an issue the Government must take on board.
<P>
Another of our concerns is national security. We need to be reassured about that as the Bill progresses. We also have concerns on the grounds of security about the implications of foreign ownership after privatisation. Nevertheless, with 49 per cent. of the company still owned by the state, we do not necessarily regard that as a fundamental problem—provided, of course, that the regulatory regime set out by the CAA is robust in both the management of safety and the economic management of NATS.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath raised an important question, but we have not yet got to the bottom of it. We have read the explanatory notes to the Bill, which are there to explain and to shed light on precisely how much the Government will receive. The hon. Member for Bath rightly said that they give a figure of £15 million. We received a letter from Lord Macdonald which stated that more would be got, but we have not yet had a proper explanation of that. Perhaps the Minister will expand a little more on how additional moneys will come in, both in terms of the capital of the company and the sum that the Government will receive for the sale of their shares. It is certainly not clear to me from reading the newspapers, and it is obviously not clear to the hon. Member for Bath. The issue continues to come up and I know that it frustrates Ministers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the elimination of debt is real money? It is absurd to say that there is a bit of a debt and a bit left over. Elimination of the debt would enable the new company to borrow more money, whereas if it was carrying more debt, it could borrow less. Is that not obvious?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Yes, the elimination of debt will be advantageous to the PSBR and to the Treasury. If the benefit to the Government is to be £15 million plus the elimination of debt, the Minister should make that clear. I know that the figure is illustrative because no negotiations have taken place with the strategic partner and different figures can be produced. There is a caveat in that the value of the business may be different when Swanwick comes on line and is working robustly. The Transport Subs Committee has produced reports on Swanwick, whose history goes back to the previous Government. Dates have been given for Swanwick coming on line, but they keep being pushed further forward: I think that the most recent date given was spring 2002.
<P>
The Opposition understand that the Government cannot be precise, but we need more precise information on the value they will receive. Perhaps the value of the future investment—a minimal sum in Treasury terms—may offset the greater benefit of a more efficient company expanding into Europe. We need more explanation of those issues. The letter from Lord Macdonald did not explain those issues any further. [Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] Some of my hon. Friends think the same.
<P>
We do not support the amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats, but we respect their point of view as they have been consistent about the matter. Amendment Nos. 122 and 123, which we tabled, would change the wording from ``a licence'' to ``the licence''. The Government have used the words ``licence'' or ``licences'' throughout the Bill. We want to know whether there will be one licence. The hon. Member for Bath wants to amend the Bill because he envisages having one licence for the IPOC. We tabled our amendments because we had presumed that there would be only one licence; yet the Bill is constructed so that multiple licences may exist. I cannot understand why that is.
<P>
Under clause 3, the Government will have general powers to introduce restrictions on services, and clause 4 provides for exemptions. The official Opposition want the Government to explain whether one licence will be granted to NATS. Do they envisage a regime in which several licences will be granted to NATS or other parts of the air traffic control system? Will the airports that the CAA regulates be brought into the regime? The Bill contains no restriction on doing that.
<P>
The helpfully provided draft licence clearly differentiates between the en route United Kingdom area and the oceanic area—the Swanwick area, which extends to 30@ west. The licence implies that they are being treated as two separate entities, the charging regime involves two separate entities and the licences could be revoked separately. I should be interested to hear the Minister tell us whether there will be one licence. The term ``a licence'' is used at beginning of the draft licence, so will there be two licences for two important aspects of NATS—the United Kingdom en route area and the oceanic area? Does the Minister envisage that the licensing regime will expand beyond that?
<P>
I cannot understand the use of the word ``licences'', plural. Why is the word ``licence'' not used throughout the Bill? We want to understand the Government's thinking on the matter. There is a substantial difference between a regime issuing one licence—which, according to the draft licence agreement, would last for 30 years, with 10-years notice to revoke it, outside emergencies—and one issuing multiple licences. That is the critical matter raised by our amendments.
<P>
Will the Minister provide a little more detail about financial arrangements relating to the PPP? Will NATS be issued with a single licence? Will the UK en-route centre and Swanwick oceanic centre have two separate licences within that agreement? That may be so, as Swanwick oceanic centre dates back to a 1946 international treaty. Is it being treated separately because of a separate international obligation and charging regime? Will the licence regime expand beyond that?
<P>
A question mark hangs over the words ``licence'' and ``licences''. If one licence is to be issued, let the Bill say so. However, if more than one is to be issued, we deserve an explanation about who is to have them all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> Debates on the future of NATS—this morning's and others outside Committee—seek to reconcile the significant investment required over the next 10 years and the safety issues remaining paramount. As we have seen, parties make their proposals in good faith.
<P>
As we said in previous debates, NATS must stay in the public sector if safety is to remain paramount. Given the fact that the Government cannot, or will not, find resources to fund NATS, we are proposing an independent publicly owned company, as set out in new clause 3. I shall examine the benefits that the Government are claiming for their own scheme and demonstrate how the IPOC matches them. I shall also ask whether Government expectations should be questioned.
<P>
A recent Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions information bulletin, sets out concisely the objectives and benefits of the Government's scheme. It states that the private-public partnership will improve safety by separating the provision of air traffic services from the regulation of them. Our proposal would do the same by ensuring that NATS is not subject to the direction of the CAA and that the safety regulation group would be separate from it. We have argued for an independent safety body for all transport sectors—an issue to which we may return later.
<P>
The DETR bulletin also states that the PPP will improve safety by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``giving NATS access to private capital''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to fund essential safety investment. Similarly, under our scheme, the issue of bonds would achieve access to private capital. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bath said, the return would be less demanding than that demanded by equity shareholders; at the same time, control would not be ceded.
<P>
The bulletin says that the PPP will improve safety by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``bringing in project management skills''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to bring the investment in on time. That is also possible under the IPOC, but would be a matter for its board. We envisage that the Secretary of State will appoint private sector representatives to the board, thus ensuring a good spread of expertise.
<P>
Swanwick highlights the fact that the private sector has not always got it right. The essence of repressed capitalism is that, sometimes, things go wrong. We need a balanced approach to the private sector, but our proposed model would involve it fully.
<P>
The bulletin continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The public interest will be protected: with Government Directors, a Shareholders' Agreement and a Special Share''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Similarly, under our proposals, the Secretary of State would control the board as he or she sees fit. However, there would be no concerns about control or any need for a special share. We are also told that the public interest will be protected by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``powerful legislation and a robust licence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall doubtless return to debates about the licence, brief references to which have been made this morning. We contend that safety aspects should be built directly into the licence. Staff concerns are also addressed in the bulletin:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The staff will be protected: with a fair deal on pensions and employment terms''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists has examined the Government's proposals in detail and it represents large chunks of the work force at NATS facilities. Despite the invitation to members to acquire shares, it was made clear that current arrangements and deals were preferred. Overall, people stressed that they wanted a fair deal in future. Under our proposals, existing terms and conditions would be maintained and there would be scope for including employees on the IPOC board.
<P>
The second string to the Government's argument about protecting staff interests is an employee share trust. As I said, the submissions of unions and employees to various committees as well as to members of this Committee make it clear that they are unimpressed and unpersuaded. In doing so, the staff are setting aside the chance of personal financial gain.
<P>
The final part of the Government's concise information bulletin refers to ``other key benefits''. It claims that the public-private partnership will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``free NATS from Government financing constraints''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our IPOC proposals would also achieve that and would free the Treasury from the constraints of future investment. It claims that PPP would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``introduce broader management skills and best practice''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is interesting to note that the Government have been silent on the current management's future. The Minister's reply may offer some informed speculation and help to resolve the dichotomy between congratulation, for bringing the organisation thus far, and implicit criticism, for failure to manage existing large-scale infrastructural proposals. I have already noted that the private sector could be brought on to the board under our proposals and key projects could be managed or subcontracted to the private sector. Nothing makes the Government scheme any better than ours.
<P>
The third benefit claimed in the bulletin is that PPP would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provide strong incentives and disciplines for efficiency''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The new clause also makes central the efficiency and good management of the IPOC, though monitoring of its five-year plan. The next benefit claimed for PPP is that it would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``subject charges to robust regulation''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Similarly, with our proposal nothing will be lost. Unlike with the existing regime, we envisage the licence for the IPOC setting out transparent and clear terms for charges.
<P>
We debated the possible overseas expansion of NATS earlier. We made it clear that, while we accept that that is a possibility, we are not particularly happy about it. We do not envisage the IPOC becoming some sort of rampant takeover vehicle, although we do not rule out of the possibility of it being involved in joint ventures and the like.
<P>
The Government seek to promote the different interests by establishing a stakeholder council. Under our proposal, the discretion of the Secretary of State in establishing a board would achieve much the same effect. As I said, we would certainly want to keep both stakeholders and employees involved.
<P>
Finally, the bulletin talks about allowing the public
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to continue to share in the success of NATS''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Absolutely—who could disagree with that? We envisage that happening under our proposals. The financial plans and objectives and the return to the Crown that we would expect mean that the IPOC would achieve that, too.
<P>
Our model would achieve the Government's objectives while maintaining the primary emphasis on safety. In particular, it would help to keep public confidence. In their evidence to the Select Committee, the Government made similar points to those in the information bulletin, but with an important addition—something that the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) has raised in previous debates. In paragraph 27 of the Library research paper on the national air traffic services aspect of the Bill, the Government talk about establishing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``genuine private sector efficiency drivers at the outset''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a fair phrase, although it is in danger of being so much management gobbledegook. The Under-Secretary must like it, however, because on Second Reading he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We do not believe that an IPOC . . . would offer the real efficiency driver''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We beg to differ and reject the idea that the private sector cannot be involved. It can be involved through, for example, the board, joint ventures and sub-contracting.
<P>
I shall contrast the Under-Secretary's assertion on Second Reading with his remarks in the same debate in response to an intervention from the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter). He said at column 625:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There is nothing to stop NATS management or a not-for-profit group submitting a bid.''—[Official Report, 20 December 1999; Vol. 341, c. 625/626]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
According to his own arguments, that would surely remove the efficiency drivers—although his words give NATS management rather more credibility than the Government have given it thus far.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We saw that statement as a sort of balletic, pre-arranged intervention to try to buy off a rebellion. As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree, we need an explanation, not about what it means but about whether it means anything. It is difficult to understand what type of organisation the Minister was referring to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes his point well. The Under-Secretary may care to respond in due course. From the words that I quoted, it appears that efficiency drivers can be there whether or not NATS is sold off.
<P>
As we have said all along, we do not believe that the part privatisation of NATS is necessary. The IPOC that we propose can meet the Government's objectives and it is clear that the Under-Secretary also supports that view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I have only a few brief comments. First, I should like to pick up on the Liberal Democrat hovercraft that was going to leave the beach and take off over the sand dunes of illogicality and head into the forests of obfuscation, or whatever it was. The hon. Member for Bath set out a clear case for privatisation. He said that it made sense to invest outside the PSBR and to make sure that the investment that NATS would have to make would not be in competition with other demands on public finances. He argued that it made sense to have a new model that could enter new markets and that the management needed to be free from inappropriate interference.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was setting out a case for privatisation. He seemed to be headed relentlessly towards that destination when towards the end he swerved off and reached a different conclusion. Even if he cannot remember how his party voted on past privatisations, he knows that it cannot be seen to support privatisation in this case. I might add that most of us cannot remember how it voted on past privatisations either, so we are not much more interested than he is in his party's views.
<P>
It seemed to be an extraordinary piece of ideology to make sure that he avoided the conclusion of his remarks. As for whether Liberal Democrats are being washed up on the beach of history, the arguments that he made were ones that we made 20 years ago. Almost 20 years ago was I was a Treasury special adviser, and British Airways, which was then in public ownership, was seeking to invest in 747 400s, arguing that if it did not, it would simply be out of the global game and unable to compete. Those things had the most enormous price tag even in those days, and BA wanted to buy large numbers of them. Buying 747 400s would compete with spending on social security, health and education, which was nonsense.
<P>
On the basis that there is more rejoicing over one sinner who repents, I welcome the remarks of the hon. Member for Bath today because after 20 years he appears to have reached the low water mark on the beach. We wish him well as he advances through these dry or wet sands, whatever they may be. The Government seem to be in a rather similar position. They now understand the arguments perfectly well but they cannot possible recommend privatisation because that is what the previous Government recommended and everything must be different. They have to buy compromise with their Back Benchers.
<P>
In contrast, the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) were spot on. He spoke with great modesty and frankness. He said that these are difficult matters and that if privatisation had been simple the previous Government would have done it. We still favour privatisation. I favour it because the Government model will give us a strong likelihood of foreign ownership. I would have favoured the establishment of a new plc with a flotation and a distribution of shares to the general public and a new opportunity for the general public to invest and to create a great British company. Now we run the strong possibility that this will be a foreign owned company. I am sorry that it is likely to go that way. My hon. Friend was right to speak in those modest, non-strident, non-ideological tones.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> In the case the right hon. Gentleman describes, what would there be to stop shareholders simply selling their shares and the company becoming foreign owned, as has happened to the water companies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Of course, it could happen, but it might well not. The Government are creating a situation in which that is the strong likelihood. We would like a better explanation from the Government today of why they have chosen this route. Although I do not think much of the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Bath, as I may have betrayed, the Government dealt with them pretty shabbily in their response to the consultation. In a few brief sentences they say that the Canadian and other foreign examples and the Post Office model will not do for us. That explanation is pretty inadequate.
<P>
I do not say that there is not a case to be made against what the Liberal Democrats have suggested, as there is a strong case to be made, but the Committee deserves a full explanation of why the Government have chosen this course. Given that some of the respondents to the consultation were very well informed bodies—
<P>
