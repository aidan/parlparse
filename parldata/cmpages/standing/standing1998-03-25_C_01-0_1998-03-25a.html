<H4><center>Wednesday 25 March 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Frank Cook in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/162/1998162.htm">Energy Efficiency Bill</a></center></h3>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed, I remind the Committee that adequate notice of amendments must be given. If the Bill does not complete its Committee stage today, I do not intend to call starred amendments in future.
<P>
I shall explain the procedure that we will follow. The selection list shows that debates on the principle of each clause are linked with the new clause or clauses that would replace it. That will avoid undue repetition. However, decisions on existing clauses and the proposed new clauses must be made in the usual sequence. The Committee will be asked whether each existing clause should remain in the Bill. When that has been done, and if the clauses have been negatived, the new clauses will be moved formally in the order in which they appear on the amendment paper. I hope that that is clear.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Energy efficiency surveys of dwellings</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take new clause 1--Energy efficiency report--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `.--(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, it shall be the duty of any person in whose favour a mortgage of any legal estate in a dwelling is granted (in this Act referred to as ``the lender'') to ensure that, if any qualifying survey of the dwelling has been undertaken by him or on his behalf in connection with the mortgage--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) a report on the energy efficiency fo the dwelling (in this Act referred to as ``an energy efficiency report'') has been prepared by or on behalf of the lender in accordance with regualtions under section (Regulations) on the basis of the physical inspection undertaken for the purpose of the qualifying survey, and<P>

 (2) In determining for the purposes of this section whether the borrower has suffered loss as mentioned in subsection (1) and, if so, the amount of that loss, a court--
<P>
(a) shall assume that the borrower would have taken every measure that would have been recommended in a report complying with section (Regulations),
<P>
(b) shall have regard to the cost that would be likely to have been incurred in taking those measures if they had been taken immediately after the grant of the mortgage,
<P>
(c) shall determine the likely expected life of each measure and apportion that cost rateably over that life, and
<P>
(d) shall calculate the savings that would have been made during the relevant period if the measures had been taken.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon):</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Cook, for chairing the Committee and for the assistance that you and the Clerk have provided. I am also grateful to the Minister and her officials, with whom we have discussed the Bill over a long period of time.
<P>
The Bill requires mortgage lenders such as banks and building societies to carry out an energy efficiency survey as part of any survey they require before lending money on a house. The Bill aims to provide information to house buyers about the energy efficiency of their home and methods of improving that. We expect that showing the cost-effective measures that canbe undertaken will lead house buyers to carry out improvements, especially as people are more likely to improve their new homes at present. That will reduce the energy needed to heat homes and thus create financial and environmental benefits.
<P>
The Bill does not impose onerous duties. It applies only when a surveyor is already inside the property. The additional time required for the energy efficiency aspect of a survey is likely to be five to 10 minutes. It will add &#163;5 to &#163;15 to the survey's cost. That is a modest price, which could easily be repaid by savings from undertaking the work that the survey recommends. It is a small amount compared with the large cost of moving house, which is usually several thousand pounds.
<P>
The Bill received an unopposed Second Reading in February and was warmly welcomed by the three main political parties. Indeed, I believe it was welcomed by all parties, including the numerous Northern Ireland parties. The Government agreed to provide drafting assistance and all amendments apart from amendment (a) to new clause 5 were drafted by parliamentary counsel, to whom I am also grateful.
<P>
New clauses 1 to 4 would delete the Bill that was discussed on Second Reading. [Interruption.] As the Division bells are ringing, Mr. Cook, may I ask your guidance as to what happens now? Do we abandon ship and then return?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I ask for the Committee's patience. There is doubt whether a Division has been called, as we are not expecting one and the annunciator is not displaying a flashing bell. I see that the annunciator is now showing that there is a Division, so I will suspend the sitting for 10 minutes.
<P>
<H5>4.35 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I shall go through the new clauses as swiftly as I can. New clause 1(1) puts a duty on the mortgage lender to prepare an energy report in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State and to make that report available to the borrower. Subsection (2) makes it clear that the report need be produced only for purchasers of residential properties. It does not apply to multiple dwelling purchasers, but only to dwellings being purchased for owner occupation.
<P>
New clause 1(3) would allow the mortgage lender to take account of the cost of the energy efficiency report when deciding how much to charge for the survey. The fact that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the duty in subsection (1) arises whether or not the borrower has paid, or agreed to pay, any such additional costs'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
means that even if a borrower should refuse to pay for the energy efficiency report, the mortgage lender would still have to prepare one. That blocks a loophole that could otherwise exist should a customer refuse to pay the extra cost. It will not be a burden on mortgage lenders, as they will refuse to carry out the survey or produce an energy efficiency report unless the borrower has agreed to pay for it.
<P>
New clause 1(4) defines a ``qualifying survey''. The energy efficiency report will need to be produced only as part of a qualifying survey, which means that it will be required only if a surveyor can inspect both the interior and exterior of a building. Surveyors would thus not need to make a special trip to produce an energy efficiency report, which would be time consuming and onerous.
<P>
New clause 2 would exempt houses less than three years old from needing an energy efficiency report. New clause 3 would exempt properties if a report had been prepared and provided to the borrower during the previous 12 months. New clause 4(1) provides that an energy efficiency report would not be required if the lender was a member of the borrower's family or the trustees of a family trust. Subsections (2) and (3) define exactly what the Bill means by a member of a family.
<P>
New clause 6 provides for compensation to be paid for a failure to give a copy of the report. The new clause is the result of advice from parliamentary counsel that a sanction should be included in the Bill. Subsection (1) would entitle the borrower to compensation if a lender failed to provide a report. Subsection (2) sets out what compensation a borrower would be entitled to. The loss is to be calculated as the savings that would have resulted had the measures that should have been in the report been carried out. Subsection (3) defines the period over which that loss should be calculated, which is six years at most from the granting of the mortgage. That time would be reduced if, first, energy efficiency measures had been taken earlier than the end of the six-year period; secondly, a report had been produced by the lender later than the granting of the mortgage but before the end of the six years; thirdly, the borrower had ceased to own the property; fourthly, the borrower had died; or, finally, the matter had been brought to court for arbitration.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Angela Eagle): May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. We have not met like this before; I hope that this is the first of many such occasions.
<P>
On Second Reading, I made clear the Government's support for the principles that underlie the Bill. The measures proposed by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) have the potential to make a valuable contribution to improving energy efficiency in the home and thereby to help us reach the targets on emissions savings that we signed up to at the Kyoto climate change conference.
<P>
I also explained on Second Reading that we saw difficulties with the original drafting of the Bill, which is why we have tabled the new clauses. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon for his co-operation as we worked out how best to achieve the principles and aims of the Bill. I am grateful for all the co-operation that there has been in the interim and I believe that we have come up with a good rendering of what the hon. Gentleman wanted to achieve in the Bill.
<P>
Clause 1 requires the lender to provide the borrower with information on the energy efficiency of the dwelling--``dwelling'' is defined in clause 3. As I said on Second Reading, the Government do not want the Bill to apply to all dwellings. The Bill will apply when there is a survey or valuation in connection with an application for a mortgage, for example, to assist with the purchase of a single dwelling for owner occupation. That would be the most obvious and convenient time for the work to be done. We propose that the Bill should apply to mortgage applications from prospective homeowners and mortgages and re-mortgage applications from existing homeowners. It should apply, too, to mortgages enabling a leaseholder to purchase the freehold of his house, or to a long leaseholder to extend his lease or to purchase a new one.
<P>
The Government do not want the Bill to apply to surveys or valuations in connection with applications for mortgages or re-mortgages for the purchase of residential property by a landlord which is, or will be, let for occupation by tenants. That includes cases when a group of leaseholders purchase the freehold of a block of flats under part I of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.
<P>
It is necessary to exclude dealings with the Landlord's interest in residential property for several reasons and I shall take a little of the Committee's time to set them on the record. Leases will usually give the landlord or his agent, a right of entry for limited purposes only, in connection with the lease, for example, a right to enter and inspect in connection with a landlord's repairing obligation. Section 11(6) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 provides that a landlord has a right of entry only in connection with a landlord's repairing obligation imposed by that section. If the Bill applied to dealings with the landlord's interest, a right of access to a tenant's home would be required for a surveyor or valuer, instructed by a lender to a potential purchaser of a landlord's interest. The Government do not intend to legislate to give a lender's surveyor such a right of access. Further, in the case of leases granted for a term of 21 years or more, a landlord would not usually have a right of entry to carry out work on the property identified in an energy report.
<P>
As drafted, clause 1 would require an energy efficiency report to be prepared whenever a lender requires a survey or valuation, which is defined in clause 3 as meaning
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any physical inspection of the property''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could be expensive because the ``physical inspection'' could consist of a brief inspection of the exterior of the dwelling, leading to a special visit to obtain the information required for the energy efficiency report. The new clause makes it clear that the report should be prepared only when the survey or valuation would require a physical inspection of the interior and exterior of the property and provides for the energy efficiency report to be based on that inspection. That will ensure, as far as possible, that the provision of the information on energy efficiency will not be excessively costly. The Bill should not require costly special visits to the dwelling to obtain the information required. I know that there is widespread agreement about that.
<P>
Clause 1(2), as drafted, will exempt mortgage lenders from providing an energy efficiency report if the dwelling is less than three years old at the time of the survey or valuation. That is helpful as it will exempt properties under the Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 1994, which have increased energy efficiency requirements significantly. In future, the more recently built properties will be exempt because it is expected that they will be close to the then prevailing energy efficiency requirements. We want to put a duty on those who are purchasing properties only when it is necessary.
<P>
To avoid confusion, new clause 2 clarifies the detail of clause 1(2) as drafted. It makes it clear that the provision relates to dwellings created by conversion, as well as those that are newly built. The three-year period will start on the date of the application for the loan to which the mortgage relates.
<P>
The Bill would exempt mortgage lenders from providing an energy efficiency report if the borrower had equivalent information, which was prepared within the previous 12 months. We agree with that in principle. If the borrower had the up-to-date information required under the Bill, there would be no need to prepare a new energy efficiency report. For example, the borrower might have applied to another lender for a mortgage on the same property. In addition, an option being considered under the Government's housing transaction study is the possibility of the seller providing more information, perhaps including information on energy efficiency, at the start of the process.
<P>
New clause 3 clarifies the meaning of the Bill. It makes it clear, first, that the information must relate to the dwelling in question and, secondly, that the report must comply with regulation prepared under the Bill. It also makes it clear that the 12-month period starts on the date of the application for the loan to which the mortgage relates.
<P>
Clause 3 would exempt from the definition in the Bill of a mortgage lender an individual or individuals acting as such or as a family trust. The meaning of that is unclear. For example, the exclusion of ``an individual'' would exclude some professional money lenders. New clause 4 clarifies that issue by restricting the exemption, first, to loans between members of a family where the loan is not made in the course of business and, secondly, to loans made to beneficiaries by the trustees of family trusts.
<P>
New clause 4 clarifies the meaning of the term ``family trust'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a trust created by an individual for the benefit of members of his family and their descendants''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and defines those who can be counted as family members.
<P>
It is important that any law is enforceable. Therefore, we are concerned that the Bill contains no sanction against mortgage lenders that do not provide borrowers with an energy efficiency report. New clause 6 would remedy that shortcoming by setting out the arrangements for compensating the borrower should the mortgage lender fail to provide an energy efficiency report as required under the Bill. The new clause specifies that the borrower is entitled to compensation if he suffers loss because of the failure of the mortgage lender to comply with the duties of the Bill and deals with the way in which the courts should determine whether the borrower has suffered a loss and, if so, how the amount of that loss should be calculated.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall not put the Question. [Interruption.] I must explain to the Committee that it is whether clause 1 should stand part of the Bill. If clause 1 remains part of the Bill, new clause 1 cannot become part of it.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
<P>
Clause 1 disagreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Guidance issued by the Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government new clause 5--Regulations--and as an amendment to the new clause, (a), in line 8, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and (c) an energy rating of the property concerned.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Subsection (1) of Government new clause 5 will oblige the Secretary of State to draft regulations setting the requirements that mortgage lenders must meet in drawing up their energy efficiency reports.
<P>
Subsection (2) states that such regulations may require a report to include details of what energy efficiency measures are specified and a statement recommending the measures that could be taken to improve the energy efficiency of the property.
<P>
Subsection (3) will allow flexibility in the regulations. Subsection (4) will ensure that reports will rely only on that which is readily observable, ensuring that they can be carried out quickly and cheaply.
<P>
Subsection (5) will exclude the common parts of buildings containing flats from the surveys. Subsection (6) will require the Secretary of State to consult mortgage lenders and others before drawing up the regulations.
<P>
Subsection (7) will require the Secretary of State to have regard to the cost of survey. Subsection (8) sets out how the regulations will be made. Subsection (9) defines the terms to be used in the clause.
<P>
Before I speak to the amendment I apologise to you, Mr. Cook, because it does not follow the drafting already set out by parliamentary counsel. Although I understand that I cannot amend it now, the amendment should read
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an energy rating of the dwelling.'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and not
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an energy rating of the property concerned.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the proposal, if accepted, can be amended on Report.
<P>
Amendment (a) would add an energy rating to the list that the regulations may require. The background is as follows: parliamentary counsel have recommended that a detailed specification of the report should be set out in regulations, not in guidance, to which we referred on Second Reading. I understand that it is not possible to set out minimum criteria in regulations in the way in which, on Second Reading, the Bill set out criteria for guidelines. That is because the regulations must be passed by the House; setting minimum criteria would anticipate the House's consideration of those regulations. For that reason amendment (a) would only result in regulations that may include an energy rating. I should like that to be tougher but I understand that it cannot be.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I said, we want three limbs in the regulations: first, an energy rating which, without my amendment, will not even be in the Bill; secondly, a list of measures that would improve the energy efficiency of the home; and, thirdly, details of the cost and the pay-back period of such measures. The two latter points are in the Bill, but my early-day motion included the energy ratings provision and has been signed, I believe, by 267 Members so far.
<P>
The Minister stated that she wanted those three matters to be included, but new clause 5 does not include an energy rating. At the national home energy rating conference last year, the Minister asked if legisaltion was necessary to deliver, ``Tailored, reliable, energy efficiency advice, along with a rating and estimates of likely costs and savings and the likely cost of improvement measures.'' The Minister said on Second Reading that she supported rating, but she explained in column 1394 that she wanted to consult on whether energy rating should be included in the information provided. We are told that having new clause 2(c) in the regulations will require an energy rating, that is, that the new clause will make an energy rating a fait accompli. That could not be further from the truth; the words are not mandatory or even precatory. There is no moral obligation, let alone legal obligation, to have an energy rating. The wording in my amendment is clear; it would flag up the Minister and her successors that energy ratings at least should be considered in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Ms Joan Walley </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, North): I am having difficulty, not in following the argument for the amendment, but with the flawed part of the wording. Given his introduction to the amendment, will my hon. Friend say whether we will be able fully to consider the amendment as drafted? How valid is it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. For the purposes of our discussions, the amendment must be as drafted on the face of the Bill. It will read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an energy rating of the property concerned.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Nevertheless, I want to flag up the fact that if the amendment is accepted subsequently we shall have to make only an insignificant change to the drafting. I hope that that assists my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Ms Walley:</B> I seek some clarification here, Mr. Cook. If this were put to a vote could we vote for what is on the amendment paper when what the hon. Gentleman has just explained to us applies to something slightly different? I do not wish to be provocative in raising this point. I genuinely seek some clarification.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If it goes to a vote today, hon. Members will vote on the text on the amendment paper. Any change would have to take place on Report. Is that clear?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Absolutely, Mr. Cook. If my amendment is accepted, the only amendment that will be made on Report will be a cosmetic drafting amendment. The principle will go forward. We will have a new paragraph (c) which will read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an energy rating of the property concerned.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what we shall vote on today. I am nevertheless flagging up the fact that as a matter of cosmetic drafting only, it will have to be changed to an energy rating of ``the dwelling''. The important point is that the principle will be accepted that an energy rating features on the face of the Bill, not in mandatory or precatory terms, but so that it may be presented to house buyers.
<P>
We have watered down our proposals, such as those for SAP ratings on the grounds of expense. Many smaller surveyors will not have the equipment easily to provide SAP ratings. I understand that the Minister must consult, and she has undertaken to do that. Furthermore, I understand the necessity for the Bill to be flexible. Ratings will evolve as know-how improves. Nevertheless, ratings are very important to the Bill. They are educative. People should know how energy efficient their houses are, just as they know how many miles per gallon their cars do. My amendment provides the Minister with complete flexibility.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Thank you for your clarification earlier, Mr. Cook. These amendments and new clause 5 would delete the clause as drafted which deals with guidance issued by the Secretary of State and replace it with a new clause which would require the Secretary of State to specify the requirements to be met by the lender in regulations.
<P>
I shall take a little time to deal with new clause 5 because, following advice from parliamentary draftsmen, we find ourselves in a slightly different position from the one we were in on Second Reading. It is important to explain to the Committee why. I said then that the form of advice to be offered would be the subject of statutory guidance from the Secretary of State and that we see no need for primary legislation to specify in detail what that guidance should contain.
<P>
On reflection, we have concluded that the advice should be included in secondary legislation. That is partly because of a code of practice which those who draw up legislation for us issue to ensure consistency between different statutes. It appears that if the criminal or civil law is involved in enforcement, it is always seen as better to have a statutory presence rather than simply guidance.
<P>
Regulations would effectively replace guidance on the face of the Bill which is what new clause 5 does. They would be made by statutory instrument and they would have two advantages apart from ensuring that the legislation was in keeping with similar Acts and conformed to what is almost a house style. First, they would be readily available to the public at large. Secondly, they would be more appropriate to the circumstances than guidance. That is because the guidance would place specific legal obligations on mortgage lenders rather than simply explaining or supplementing the Bill's provisions. In that instance, it is the current form to ensure that they are regulations rather than issued guidance.
<P>
Where specific legal obligations are imposed, breach of which leads to civil liability, the legal obligations will be spelt out in secondary legislation. Subsections (1) and (2) set out the duty to make regulations and give an example of the items that the regulations may require, but they do not tie the Secretary of State to a list of items that must be included in the regulations.
<P>
As I said, we see no need for primary legislation to specify in detail what the guidance should include. We want flexibility over time as technologies change, so that our understanding of how energy efficiency can be better achieved can be properly reflected in subsequent regulations.
<P>
Subsections (3) to (7) contain a number of safeguards to ensure that the regulations are flexible and do not impose undue burdens on mortgage lenders, or undue costs on borrowers as both factors play an important part in the Bill's success. Flexibility is provided by subsection (3) which allows regulations to make different provisions for different cases and different areas. I do not see how we can be more flexible.
<P>
Burdens on mortgage lenders and costs for borrowers are limited by subsections (4) to (7). Subsections (4) and (5) restrict the information to be provided on a dwelling to that which is readily ascertainable without undue difficulty on a visual inspection of the building and may exempt the common parts of a building containing a flat from the requirements of the Bill.
<P>
Subsections (6) and (7) require the Secretary of State to consult before issuing regulations and to have regard to the cost of preparing an energy report in making those regulations. Those are sensible safeguards to ensure that the Bill stays focused on its primary intention, which the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon explained well on Second Reading.
<P>
Subsection (8) provides that the regulations should be made by statutory instrument subject to negative resolution. Subsection (9) clarifies the preceding subsections by defining the terms used in them.
<P>
I have some comments about amendment (a) as drafted and as the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon would have preferred it to be drafted. There is little difference between the two draftings, and I should not want us to get too hung up on the differences between the wording, because the Government's answer to either version is the same. We have difficulties with the idea of putting this reference directly into primary legislation. I do not disagree with anything that the hon. Gentleman said about the desirability of having a rating system. Indeed, as he insists on quoting it wherever he goes, I referred to that in my speech at the conference he mentioned. We support home energy rating and we want systems that are easily understandable and applicable throughout the country. However, that is not an argument for writing them into primary legislation. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the primary legislation that set up building regulations, for example, he will not find a reference to energy efficiency. I hope that he will agree with me that changing building regulations to improve standards of energy efficiency over the years has had a significant effect on the energy efficiency of the houses that are built now, which is why we are exempting them from the Bill. The situation could not be improved by having a reference in primary legislation.
<P>
We are trying to achieve the same thing, but we are coming at it from different angles. My worry is that we will put inflexibilities into the Bill in primary legislation, which would be difficult to remove because that has to be done by subsequent primary legislation. Building regulations are a perfectly reasonable way of ensuring--on a rolling basis and over time--that we can improve energy efficiency in building.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. However, new clause 5 proposes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The regulations may . . . require a report to include''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said earlier, it is not mandatory or precatory; it is optional. I should be grateful if the Minister would address that point. We want the provision in because it flags up the point, not only to a Minister who is sympathetic to these matters but to her successors in title. The educative process is one of the pillars of the Bill. Enabling people to understand more about energy efficiency and ratings is part of that process.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It may seem surreal and bizarre that a Bill dealing with energy efficiency, which will almost certainly involve ratings if it is to be effective, should not mention the word ``ratings'', but that is usual in legislation, particularly primary legislation. It is clear from the principle of the Bill and from our debates that we want to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, much as the buildings regulations have done without mentioning energy efficiency or rating levels.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon says that including the provision is entirely optional. The problem with putting anything mandatory into primary legislation is that it is then mandatory. The word ``must'' means that it has to happen in all cases. The word ``may'' gives us flexibility; it does not mean that the Government are intent on avoiding energy ratings. We want to consult those who must work with the Bill on the sort of energy rating we want. Having a great deal of experience of working these things through in legislation, we do not believe that including this phrase in the Bill will help us to reach conclusions about the best way to measure energy and to ensure that house purchasers understand the meaning of future energy ratings. We do not want to prejudice the preparation of an energy rating by writing it rigidly into the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Stunnell (Hazel Grove):</B> Does the Minister accept that those of us with professonal experience of the building regulations find what she is saying virtually incomprehensible? Amendment (a) would add a third option to what the regulations may contain. I draw her attention to clause 2(2)(a) and (b) as the other two options. Can the Minister explain why she is so resistant to including, among those options, what would appear to be the principal purpose of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is because we want to put the provision in secondary and not primary legislation. I hoped that I had got that across. We believe that primary legislation is too rigid a way of approaching something that will evolve over time and may look quite different in years to come. Primary legislation is harder to change and harder to make flexible. We may well include references to some form of energy rating in the secondary regulations, but we want to consult the affected parties and to agree on the most appropriate rating in this case.
<P>
I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunnell) that there is very little between us, but the difference between putting something into a Bill and putting it into secondary regulations is that the regulations are often more effective because they can be more easily changed and are more flexible. The Bill will work properly only if we can reach agreement with those who will have to understand and use it. To do that, we want proper consultation and we want to put references to energy rating in the appropriate place--in secondary legislation.
<P>
Also, it is unclear what the term ``energy rating'' in amendment (a) means. We could either define the term exactly in the Bill so that it is a set rating, but that would be too inflexible and would render the Bill less useful over time, as different and perhaps more accurate systems were developed; or, we could include a phrase like ``energy rating'', which must be left entirely to the definition of the court if a dispute arises. We believe that we must consult on what is required and on the most appropriate course. If we conclude that an energy rating is necessary, we will need to define it clearly in the light of that consultation. We can then put it into secondary legislation. I firmly believe that it would have the same effect there, but we would retain more flexibility than by including it in the Bill without consultation. That would be less flexible, less effective and likely to alienate some of the institutions that will have to accept and work with the measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister for giving way. I am sorry to be persistent and perhaps a little ungenerous in my intervention, but she made a splendid argument for deleting paragraphs (a) and (b) from new clause 5 and substituting a new paragraph (a) providing that the report should include ``anything that the Minister thinks is appropriate at the time''. I hope that the Minister will take a hard look at the matter and give what assurances she can that my fears are unjustified.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> There is a great deal of good will on the Government's part in taking the Bill so far. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has decided that that good will has run out and that I am conniving to make the Bill ineffective, but if so, he is wrong. I hope that he will take at face value what I have said about the benefits of secondary legislation and consultation.
<P>
Perhaps, when the Bill is on the statute book, the hon. Gentleman and I can have a conversation about who was right. I assure him that this is not some awful Government plot to render the Bill ineffective; we simply believe strongly that this is a more effective way of achieving what I know is the goal of all members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Ms Walley:</B> I have been listening carefully to what my hon. Friend the Minister is saying, because I want the strongest possible commitment from the Government on an energy rating, which is part and parcel of what the Bill proposes. It is important to have a Minister's words on the record in Hansard, so will my hon. Friend clarify her opinion of the desirability of such a rating?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I have said that we must have a system, whatever it turns out to be and however it changes over time, that is readily understandable and easily communicable between people who are buying houses and those who are selling them. It will be rather like a labelling system, so that people looking to purchase properties can begin to take their energy efficiency into account.
<P>
However, we do not yet know precisely what that system will be and we cannot therefore put it into primary legislation. We are all trying to achieve the same thing. I have said that it is the Government's strong opinion that such a system is better achieved through secondary legislation, after proper consultation. I certainly do not want to pre-empt any such consultation by giving, off the top of my head, my opinion about which system is better or how the issue might develop.
<P>
I repeat that the Government support the aim of the Bill. Clearly, it is important to have a system that people can understand and identify with easily, but the best and most flexible way of achieving that is by secondary legislation, which is more easily changed.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chaytor </B>(Bury, North): Would it be fair to describe my hon. Friend's comments as an assurance that ratings will be included in secondary legislation and to say that the only area for debate is the precise form of the rating?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I think that I am being led into treacherous alleyways. I do not intend to pre-empt the results of the consultation. I might have an opinion on the matter, but we will have a consultation and we will announce the results. We all agree with the ideas behind the Bill and its aims. However, we need to examine how those aims can be achieved technically.
<P>
The Government support the principle of increasing energy efficiency and people's awareness of the energy-efficient status of the buildings that they are about to buy. I have made that perfectly clear. I cannot say anything further on the matter at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her constructive comments on my interventions and on those of other hon. Members. I realise that she does not seek to emasculate my Bill; indeed, I have received great encouragement from her throughout its progress. I highlighted my anxieties earlier. They involve not only the Minister, but other Ministers and other Governments. Nevertheless, the Minister's views are on the record and I hope that I am not stretching a point--perhaps, she will tell me if I am--when I say that I believe that she supports energy ratings, as proposed in the Bill, but through secondary legislation, subject to consultation and a sensible means of rating. I am prepared, therefore, to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> New clause 8 allows the extension of the provisions to Northern Ireland. There has been much support for the Bill from hon. Members from Northern Ireland. Will the Minister tell the Committee when the Northern Ireland Office will take action on the Bill?
<P>
New clause 9 would impose a duty on the Secretary of State to make regulations and for the corresponding provisions for Northern Ireland to come into force on the passing of the Act. It would mean that work can begin on the regulations immediately, and that is welcome. The remainder of the Act would come into force on a day decided on by the Secretary of State. Subsection (5) extends the provision only to England and Wales, although Northern Ireland is covered by new clause 8.
<P>
The Bill does not cover Scotland, although the Scottish Office has written to me, supporting the Bill. The Minister with responsibility for local government and housing in Scotland, Mr. Calum Macdonald, wrote to me on 20 March 1998. I shall quote from the first and last paragraph of his letter. In the first paragraph he states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I have now concluded that the terms of your Bill to promote home energy efficiency are not appropriate for Scotland and so we are going, somewhat reluctantly to have to withdraw from it. However, we fully support the broad aims of the Bill and intend to introduce arrangements which will serve the same purpose in Scotland.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Later in the same letter to me, the Minister says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``But we shall actively consider how best its''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
meaning the Bill's--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``aims might be achieved here''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The amendment and two new clauses would replace clause 4, which deals with the short title, commencement and extent of the Bill. The two new clauses would clarify the commencement arrangements and deal with the difficulties relating to its extent, which were set out rather broadly by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
New clause 8 would allow corresponding provisions to be made for Northern Ireland by statutory instrument. The new clause effectively replaces clause 4(5) of the Bill as drafted. We are keen to ensure that the provisions of the Bill can also apply to Northern Ireland. However, the approach used in the Bill as it stands is not appropriate. I am sure that the Northern Ireland Office will be pleased to keep the hon. Gentleman informed of progress.
<P>
New clause 9 covers the remaining subsections of the present clause. Subsection (1) of the new clause provides for the same short title as that proposed in the present clause 4. Subsections (2) and (3) seek to clarify the commencement arrangements for the Bill. Subsection 2 provides for the clause to come into force on the day that the Act is passed, together with sections dealing with the preliminary arrangements for the Bill--namely the power for the Secretary of State to make regulations setting out the information to be provided under the Bill by mortgage lenders and the section relating to corresponding provisions for Northern Ireland.
<P>
Subsection (3) deals with the remaining provisions in the Bill. It provides necessary flexibility by giving the Secretary of State the discretion to appoint different days for different areas and purposes for the commencement of the remainder of the Bill. Subsection (4) gives the Secretary of State the power to include in any commencement order appropriate transitional provisions and savings, which may be needed in cases where a mortgage application is under way at the time of commencement.
<P>
The Bill is to apply to England and Wales and Northern Ireland, but we propose, under subsection (5), to exclude Scotland from the Bill. In my speech on Second Reading, I outlined our concerns about how the Bill might work in Scotland, given the different house buying procedures involved. Colleagues in Scotland have now looked at the position carefully and concluded that it would be appropriate for the Bill to apply in Scotland.
<P>
The system of house purchase in Scotland essentially involves blind bids around an asking price. It is not uncommon for a house hunter to have to make several bids for different properties or for one dwelling to be subject to several different bids. Each time a bid is made, a mortgage valuation survey will be carried out. Clearly, only one bid per house hunter and per dwelling can be successful, which means that the cost of the mortgage valuation survey can be lost on several occasions. The Bill will add an additional cost to each mortgage valuation survey and could add significantly to the costs of house purchasers north of the border. That is what concerns Scottish Members in fulfilling their commitment to the hon. Gentleman, as outlined in his letter--to ensure that the Bill finds appropriate expression in Scotland.
<P>
In England and Wales buyers sometimes have more than one survey or valuation, but multiple surveys are the norm in Scotland. Hence the Bill will impose a greater burden on Scottish house hunters which will be correspondingly more difficult to recoup.
<P>
Yesterday, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland announced that the Government would consult on improved home energy efficiency measures best suited to Scotland. The process is beginning there. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Energy efficiency is a priority for this Government. We must alert people to the benefits it brings through lower fuel bills and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. The good time to tell them is when they are moving home.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Speaking about the Bill presented by the hon. Member for West Devon and Torridge, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``While I firmly believe that the aim of the Bill is right we need to find a different solution or system. We will be working with the lending institutions, the Royal Insititution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland and Friends of the Earth and others to do so.''<P>

With that caveat, I ask the Committee to reject the clause.
