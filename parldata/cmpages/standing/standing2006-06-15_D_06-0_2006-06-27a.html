Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): On a point of order, Mr.
Illsley. Over the weekend the Minister honoured her undertaking to
circulate the draft clauses relating to the consolidation Bill and I
thank her for that. However, I have identified 254 new clauses that the
Government will introduce in Committee. There are a number of
identified changes to those clauses to reflect the new language in
which they are being introduced and the Committee will not have an
opportunity to do anything other than simply insert those into the Bill
under the Government&#146;s plans.</div>
<a name="06062741000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">When writing to the Committee,
the Minister stated:
</div><a name="06062741000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I said that
we hoped to do so as far as possible during Committee stage while
noting that this was a considerable

consolidation&#151;</div><a name="06062741000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
would then intend to seek the view of the Law Societies and others over
the summer, in particular to ensure that no unintended changes to the
law had been made by the restatement. We could then reflect any
comments in amendments brought forward at Report
stage.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 202</div><a name="06062741000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point of order is that that
is inherently unsatisfactory and should be done by the Committee. With
254 new clauses and more to come, as the Minister promised, it will
take an hour simply for the Chair to put the motions on those if we do
not get around to considering them in detail by 5 o&#146;clock on
Thursday 13 July, which is the current outdate of the
Committee.</div><a name="06062741000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I seek from
you, Mr. Illsley, some form of protection for us as legislators to do

Committee members to be involved in discussions in
September&#148;</div><a name="06062741000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">when, as the
Committee will cease to exist in July, its members will have no more
status than other right hon. and hon. Members of the House. I urge you,
Mr. Illsley to recommend that the Committee sits into October after the
summer recess so that we can do our job properly or, if the Government
are not prepared to do that, to recommend that sufficient
time&#151;it will be a long time&#151;is provided for consideration

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000412"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I listened to the hon. Gentleman who obviously
has a legitimate point of order, but the matter is outside the remit of
the Chair and I cannot make the recommendations that he requests. They
are a matter for the usual channels and, if there is agreement, they
can return with a further motion for the Programming
Sub-Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000413"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b>
Further to the point of order, Mr. Illsley. I can provide
clarification. Hon. Members will recall that the reason for our further
consolidating other aspects of company law is that there was consensus
between all political parties, when the Bill was considered in the
House of Lords, that it would make sense to put in one place all the
legislation that had an impact. It was decided on the basis of that
consensus and with the recognition that the new clauses in question are
not ready in the same way as the rest of the clauses
are.</div><a name="06062741000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have given an
undertaking that we are not, by the consolidation, changing the law,
except to make it fit with other clauses. There is no change to
existing legislation except in so far as it makes sense to do it in
that way. Clearly, there is a limited time frame and we want to get the
Bill on the statute book. We think we are being helpful in explaining
to hon. Members of all parties that we are introducing the new clauses
in Committee; that we want discussions with experts outside the
House&#151;particularly the Law Society&#151;and any members of the
Committee who want to participate, all through the coming period; and
that if, on Report in the House of Commons before the Bill returns to
the House of Lords in October, in the spill-over phase, any amendments
that have arisen from that discussion can be tabled at that point, in
the spirit of consensus. That is the practical way of going ahead,
unless we put the new clauses into a new piece of
legislation.</div>
<a name="06062741000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
hon. Members will work with us in the spirit of co-operation that we
have tried to engender. I am happy to meet Opposition Members of
whatever 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 203</div>party in the period in September and early October, before we return for
Report and Third Reading in the House of Commons, and before the
Bill&#146;s subsequent return to the House of Lords, to try to reach
agreement on the new clauses. We are not trying to pull a fast one. We
are simply trying to make sense of the current legislation and put all
company law legislation in one
place.</div>
<a name="06062741000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062741000414"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): Further to that point of order,
Mr. Illsley. We share the concerns of the official Opposition about the
time scale that is appropriate for the consolidation, but we have
listened to what the Minister said and will reflect carefully on it.
However, it seems to us that our original proposal, made by my
hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) on Second
Reading, is the appropriate approach and that the Committee should sit
briefly after the recess, simply to deal with the consolidation
clauses, in case there are problems and
errors.</div><a name="06062741000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
old saying among French lawyers that to codify is to modify. Some
change always happens when an attempt is made at codifying, simply
because of the different context. I think that the summer will be
needed for thought about that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000415"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr. Illsley. I have
reflected on what the Minister said. I think that the difference
between Conservative Members and the Government is whether the matter
should be considered in Committee or on Report. We are firmly of the
view that it is appropriate for examination by the Standing Committee.
We shall all be tediously familiar with it by July and would thus have
the opportunity to use our knowledge for the benefit of the House in
October, rather than having to deal with the matter on the Floor of the
House on Report.</div> <a name="06062741000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have another request to make of the Government: that we have a
consolidated, newly printed Bill, however matters are to go forward,
ready for the return of the House in
October.</div><a name="06062741000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000416"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Illsley. I want to be helpful. We shall certainly try to produce a new
consolidated Bill in time for that consideration; it certainly makes
sense and we shall try to act accordingly. I understand the point made
by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) about the possibility
of our inadvertently amending provisions in the process of
consolidating. That is not our intent. We shall all have the entirety
of the summer recess to examine the amendments. We are introducing them
in Committee now so that we can look at them in detail in consultation
with the Law Society and others to see whether we have inadvertently
made a mistake. Of course, we are consolidating existing law, which has
been subject to full consideration under all the due processes of the
House, and we are not introducing new laws, which it would be
legitimate to discuss in Committee and
beyond.</div>
<a name="06062741000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000417"></a>The
Chairman:</b> To confirm the issues raised by the hon. Member
for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) in his point of order, the Committee will
dissolve and report to the House on 13 July. It will not meet after
then. If hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 204</div>Members are given any information after that, it will be in their role
as Members of the House of Commons, not as members of the Standing
Committee.</div>
<a name="06062741000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000418"></a>David
Howarth:</b> We return to the question that we debated at the
end of last week&#151;the balance between two issues, on which I
think both sides of the Committee share the same outlook. On the one
side, there is the principle that there should be transparency in share
ownership and that people who own shares should be prepared to be
contacted by other members of the company and perhaps by members of the
public to debate and defend positions in the company. On the other
side, there is the problem, which has arisen largely because of animal
rights terrorism, of shareholders sometimes being intimidated and
threatened with, or actually suffering, physical violence as a result
of their shareholding.</div>
<a name="06062741000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">We became slightly overheated,
and the debate gave the impression that there was a fundamental
difference between the parties, but I do not think that there is. The
Government&#146;s position is that the principle of absolute
transparency must be compromised because of the problem of threats and
the intimidation of shareholders. They have rightly introduced a
proposal to deal with the problem and to balance the two issues that I
mentioned. A company faced with a request for a list of its
shareholders is to have the option of complying with that request or
going to the court, in which case the court would determine whether the
request was made for a proper purpose. The Government have included the
additional protection that any person who passes information on for
improper purposes commits a crime. Let it not be said, therefore, that
their position does not compromise the principle of absolute
transparency, because it does.</div>
<a name="06062741000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question raised by the
amendments is simply whether the Government have got the balance
between the two things right. The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr.
Djanogly) proposed a further, although not major shift in the direction
of protecting shareholders. He would allow companies to protect their
lists of shareholders when there is a threat to those shareholders and
when the Secretary of State can be persuaded that that threat is
sufficient to close the list.</div>
<a name="06062741000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberal Democrat amendments
offer slightly different approaches, but pursue basically the same
direction of change. They would slightly shift the degree of protection
in favour of shareholders and slightly close the opportunities
available to people who want to intimidate shareholders. We offer two
possibilities. The first, which is rather simple, is encapsulated in
amendment No. 168 and consequential amendments Nos. 170 to 176. All the
proposal would do is reverse the burden of proof. Under the
Government&#146;s proposal, the company can either comply with the
request to hand over its list of shareholders or go to the court. Under
our proposal, the slight change would mean that the company could
refuse on the ground that the request is improper, and the applicant
would have to go to the court. The other amendments are drafting
amendments to ensure that the proposal works within the
statute.</div>
<a name="06062741000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="06062741000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason why
we propose the amendments is that there is a legal principle&#151;I
guess the court would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 205</div>follow it to interpret the clauses&#151;that the person who asserts
something has to prove it, unless the statute says that the burden of
proof lies elsewhere. In the normal course of events, he who asserts
must prove. The Government have established a system under which, at
least initially, the company will have to prove that the purpose is
improper. With repeat applications, the Government&#146;s proposal
reverses the burden of proof. When people repeatedly go to the court
with requests, the Government propose that they are batted back without
further argument. Our change is minor, as we propose to change the
burden of proof for the first application,
too.</div>

Farrelly</b> (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab): Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that in this country a powerful bulwark against
over-mighty government isa free press? Under his proposal, can
he imagine what a fraudulent company would do to every journalist who
asked legitimate questions of its shareholder register? His proposal
would force them to go to court time and again. Can he imagine what
effect that would have on proper investigative
journalism?</div>
<a name="06062741000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000420"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The burden of proof that we propose is exactly
the same as that in libel law, so if the hon. Gentleman wants to engage
in a debate about the entirety of media law, he is perfectly at liberty
to do so. However, we do not propose anything unusual or more
restrictive on press freedom than already exists in law. If a newspaper
were to go to a court to explain its purposes, that in itself would be
even more embarrassing for the company. It would have to take that into
account when it refused the application.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000421"></a>Paul

let me say that the hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong on that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000422"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am not too sure on which of my various points I
am entirely wrong, so I shall give way again to enable the hon.
Gentleman to be more specific.</div>
<a name="06062741000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000423"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> The hon. Gentleman is wrong on every point that
he has made. His amendment to reverse the burden would result in a
major change and a major restriction on press freedom in financial
investigations.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000424"></a>David

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000425"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> If the hon. Gentleman would like to see me after
class, I shall take him to my office to show him the 12 years of
clippings that culminated in my position as City editor on <i class="I">The</i>
<i class="I">Observer</i>.</div>
<a name="06062741000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000426"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I shall be glad to look at the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s clippings. However, perhaps also after class, I can
show him my 20 years of experience teaching libel law. I assure him
that my amendment would make no great difference.</div>
<a name="06062741000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to the point, the
question that we are trying to ask the Government is precisely why they
have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 206</div>chosen that particular balance. Contrary to what the hon. Gentleman
says, it seems that they have gone a long way towards the position that
we propose, especially on second, third and subsequent applications.
The question we are trying to ask is why, in the first application
only, do the Government put the burden of proof on the company, not the
applicant? That is the only difference between us and the
Government.</div> <a name="06062741000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second proposal that we are offering the Government is new clause 22,
which would allow a company to close its list by special resolution.
Such a company would, however, come under a new obligation to
circulate, for a reasonable fee, any lawful information or
documentation that an outsider or a member wanted to circulate to those
on the list of shareholders. In making such a proposal, we are trying
to preserve the right of members of the company and people in general
to approach shareholders and to put their views on, for example, the
ethical standards to which the company is or is not adhering. We are
trying to do that in a way that does not require the company to reveal
the shareholders&#146; names and addresses, because that would
provide added protection from intimidation and threats of violence,
without closing down debate with members of the company or the public.
Members of the company would still receive information that they might
or might not find helpful in holding the company&#146;s directors to
account and in deciding whether to continue investing in the company.
</div><a name="06062741000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We offer new clause
22 as a third possibility, so there are three alternative proposals on
the table.</div>
<a name="06062741000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062741000427"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): As the MP for an area with a
pharmaceutical company, I appreciate the issues that the hon. Gentleman
raises, but does he not agree that the long-term concern is more about
improper financial holdings? Although new clause 22 would allow people
to lobby a company&#146;s shareholders, it would completely rule out
the possibility of journalists or others investigating peculiar
shareholdings, as my hon. Friend
suggested.</div><a name="06062741000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000428"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I accept that that is a danger of the new clause.
I was going to say that there might be a case for a composite amendment
that combined new clause 22 and the corresponding new clauses tabled by
the hon. Member for Huntingdon. I accept that the new clause is
defective in that it does not require outside control over the use of
the power involved, and the new clauses tabled by the hon. Member for
Huntingdon have the merit of requiring the permission of the Secretary
of State, who would presumably take any danger into account in deciding
whether to grant the company&#146;s request to close its list.
Another possibility, of course, is that one should go to the court,
rather than to the Secretary of State. All those possibilities are on
the table, although they all have
defects.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000430"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is precisely right, which is why there are
three possibilities on the table. However, the question before the
Committee is simply whether to go slightly further than the Government
have gone so far. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 207</div></div><a name="06062741000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062741000431"></a><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher</b> (Burnley) (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that
the problem with the Opposition&#146;s proposals is that a decision
would be made to close the list, but there would be no monitoring of
what happened after that? Unusual shareholdings or shareholdings that
involved a conflict of interest might arise, but there would be no way
of monitoring such things after the event.</div>
<a name="06062741000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000432"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Yes, that is a defect of our proposals, but the
hon. Lady&#146;s point does not address the issue of principle, which
is whether the Government have gone far enough. In a way, the question
could occur under the Government&#146;s scheme if people who went to
court were told that they were there for an improper purpose, and if
the court considered subsequent applications by the same journalist
simply as repeat applications and threw them out immediately, even
though the situation might have changed. Those dangers arise under all
the schemes. As soon as a scheme for closing the list of shareholders
is adopted, that sort of danger will exist, regardless of the sort of
scheme that is
chosen.</div><a name="06062741000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000433"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman is coming to the end of his
remarks, I think. Perhaps he can explain what principles underpin his
approach and his belief that our amendments, which we think are very
strong, do not go far enough. He has admitted the flaws in his
amendments, but he has not justified his belief that the Government
have not achieved the right balance and not gone far
enough.</div><a name="06062741000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000434"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The debate started with a strong statement by the
hon. Member for Huntingdon about the extent and seriousness of the
problem. His constituents in Huntingdon, like mine in
Cambridge&#151;and the constituents, in fact, of all south
Cambridgeshire MPs&#151;have faced the problem of intimidation and
threat in a very personal way. I suppose that the hon. Gentleman and I
have a slightly different starting point from that of other hon.
Members. We are trying to find ways to maximise protection for people
in that situation, without compromising the other principle. We are,
therefore, trying to push matters a little further.</div>
<a name="06062741000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is a serious one
from our point of view, and we have seen it for ourselves, but we
accept that the Government have come a long way along the route. Their
proposal is a serious attempt to take into account both the relevant
principles. We are not here to condemn what the Government have done;
we are here to try to push a little further along the path of
protection, because we see that as so important.</div>
<a name="06062741000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to repeat the
examples provided by the hon. Member for Huntingdon; they are all very
familiar to me, and to everyone in my part of the country. The question
for the Government to answer is why they have stopped where they have
and why they should not go a little further along the protective line.
The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) said last
Thursday that the proposals of the hon. Member for Huntingdon were a
fundamental threat to the openness of corporate governance. I do not
think that they are. They would be so only if the Government of the day
were themselves determined to undermine those principles by acceding to
too many 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 208</div>requests. Whether that happened would be within the control of the
Government.</div> <a name="06062741000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
proposals&#151;the shift of the burden of proof and the optional
regime&#151;are merely attempts to go a little further and balance
the two interests in a slightly different way. They are not
fundamentally different from the Government&#146;s proposals; we
accept that. However, we should like the Government to consider why
they should not go a little further along the
route.</div><a name="06062741000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000435"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> I have been so excited by the probing amendments
that I have taken the opportunity to scribble a few notes. I want to
speak about amendment No. 26 and new clause 22 in particular. I shall
also make plain my concerns about amendment No.
168.</div><a name="06062741000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result of
the activities of animal rights extremists, I would be more sympathetic
to the Opposition approach in new clauses 2 and 3 if that were an
alternative approach, with safeguards, rather than a belt-and-braces
approach. However, I have serious reservations about the wider
implications of those clauses, too.</div>
<a name="06062741000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062741000436"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000437"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> I said that I have more sympathy for those new
clauses. I have received many representations about the Bill, but I
have not received a representation from the assorted constabulary of
Staffordshire police, beating a path to my door and saying, &#147;We
must have these amendments in the Company Law Reform Bill to combat the
sort of activities that we saw at Darley Oaks farm,&#148; where on
the basis of good intelligence and investigation, they successfully
prosecuted four of the people involved. Neither Staffordshire nor any
other police force has beaten a path to our door crying out for those
amendments. The unacceptable behaviour of animal rights extremists is
well known, but any response enshrined in law has to be proportionate.
It should not produce other harmful consequences, whether foreseeable
or not. The amendments, the new clause and that sort of approach might
do so. They are sledgehammers to crack a few nuts.</div>
<a name="06062741000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the record, I should
declare that before entering the House, I was the City editor of <i class="I">The
Observer</i>, and I am still a paid-up member of the National Union of
Journalists, so I have a drum to beat. I can safely say that during a
career spanning a dozen years, much of it taken up with investigative
journalism, I was involved in almost every major corporate fraud during
that time&#151;journalistically speaking. Before that, I worked in
the City of London. I have the perfect CV for a Conservative MP, as
many people point out. I was a corporate finance adviser handling
flotations, mergers and takeovers with the investment bank Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, of whose parent company I am still a customer. I have
hands-on experience of corporate governance and due diligence from the
business side of the fence.</div>
<a name="06062741000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">If amendment No. 26 and new
clause 22 were agreed to, it would be tantamount to introducing a
rogue&#146;s charter to British company law. It would be manna 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 209</div>from heaven for crooks and fraudsters. That is clearly not the
proposals&#146; intention, but they would have that effect. They
would apply to companies across the board, not just the few that
extremists target. They would seriously impede effective corporate
governance, investigative journalism, and proper and legitimate due
diligence carried out by honest companies into firms and individuals
with whom they propose to trade, or in which they might invest. The
proposals would certainly lessen the transparency of companies not only
tothe outside world, but importantly to existing shareholders.
They might also hamper the ability of the Government, law enforcement
agencies and other regulators such as the stock exchange to carry out
their functions in a timely and expeditious manner in the eternal fight
against fraud and market manipulation.</div>
<a name="06062741000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 26 would deny to
the public, to the vast majority of shareholders in public companies
and to a significant number of minority investors, or any other
legitimately interested party, the right to attend a company&#146;s
registered office to inspect its shareholder register, unless they
owned more than 5 per cent. of the company. Anyone with experience of
investigating possible fraud or manipulation, or carrying out
legitimate due diligence, knows that when speed is essential, it is
often the quickest way to get answers about the make-up of a
company&#146;s shareholder register.</div>
<a name="06062741000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 168 would remove
the hurdle whereby a company must apply to the court before refusing a
written application for a copy of the share register. It would leave
refusal in the hands of the company, and it would leave the company
with the discretion&#151;in the first instance at least&#151;to
decide what it believes is a proper purpose. The amendment is also
poorly drafted, because having removed the requirement to apply to the
court, it does not seek to delete subsections (2) to (5) of clause 116
regarding the court procedure that it would make
redundant.</div>
<a name="06062741000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000438"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The courts must still have a procedure, no matter
who applies to them.</div>
<a name="06062741000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000439"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> Clearly they must, and the hon. Gentleman is a
learned lawyer, but he will agree that if the hurdle to apply to the
court were removed, the rest of the clause would be
redundant.</div> <a name="06062741000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The vast
majority of companies are honestly run, and people rarely have the need
to inspect or request a share register. However, there will always be a
few rotten apples in the barrel, and I have known a few.</div>
<a name="06062741000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider the effect of
the amendments from the vantage point not of a journalist such as me,
but of a small shareholder who owns less than 5 per cent. of a company
and wishes legitimately to ask questions about co-investors. By the
way, the five per cent. threshold that a shareholder must cross to
qualify is higher than the minimum disclosure threshold of 3 per cent.,
and the incongruity looks very odd. That aside, the 4.9 per cent.
shareholder will have no right to inspect the register.</div>
<a name="06062741000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under amendment No. 168, such
shareholders could also be barred and would have no further simple
means of recourse if the company was determined to hide the identity of
fellow shareholders. A company that was so 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 210</div>determined&#151;fraudsters, crooks and manipulators are clever,
determined people&#151;could conceivably deem any reasons to inspect
the list as improper if someone sought to cast aspersions on the
company and fellow shareholders. A fraudulent shareholder or main
director could quite possibly do that to block legitimate
investigation.</div> <a name="06062741000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
short, the Opposition proposals would not guarantee that shareholders,
let alone anyone else with good reasons for doing so, could check the
identities and bone fides of other investors. Quite apart from any
malpractice, the proposals would not allow small shareholders to
determine whether a company was comprised of a bone fide array of
fellow small shareholders.</div>
<a name="06062741000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000440"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes some good points, but he
conflates the various provisions. There is no 5 per cent. bar in
amendment No. 168, which would simply reverse the burden of proof in
terms of going to court. The situation would be similar to that under
the Government&#146;s proposal. The only difference relates to who
would have to apply.</div>
<a name="06062741000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000441"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> The amendments are clearly probing provisions,
as has been said, but I am trying to demonstrate their cumulative
effect in cases where someone is determined to run a company
fraudulently. The Opposition provisions would not allow a small
shareholder to determine whether there was a secret concert party that
guaranteed that certain investors always exercised control over the
company. That is clearly a legitimate interest for any investor in a
company, and the provisions would seriously erode shareholder
rights.</div> <a name="06062741000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">On some of
the other issues involved, shareholder registers and company returns to
Companies House are the bread and butter of investigative journalists
or investigators conducting legitimate due diligence. Indeed, I
remember numerous occasions on which I painstakingly built a true
picture of a dodgy company by tracking down shareholders and contacting
them to ask questions. The Opposition provisions would, however,
constitute a serious attack on good investigative journalism and
legitimate due diligence.</div>
<a name="06062741000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having made those arguments, I
hardly need repeat them in respect of new clause 22, tabled by the hon.
Member for Cambridge. Again, the new clause could apply across the
board&#151;it would be a sledgehammer to crack a few nuts. It would
allow any fraudster, crook or manipulator to exempt a company early in
its life from any semblance of transparency. The safeguard that the
company undertakes to pass on lawful messages and documentation to
shareholders is the proverbial chocolate fireguard. It would allow the
company&#151;in effect, the fraudster or manipulator&#151;to be in
the driving seat all the time.</div>
<a name="06062741000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give an example that
does not involve any of the more racy frauds that we have seen in this
country. In a publicly quoted company, it could be argued that investor
pressure would prevent a special resolution from being passed or force
its lifting on flotation or afterwards. A great part of the stock
exchange yellow book of listing requirements and part 10 of the Bill
governs the disclosure requirements that apply when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 211</div>companies and directors deal with connected parties. Quite properly,
boards of directors and shareholders always like to know whether the
company is trading with companies that are owned or part-owned by, or
connected with, fellow directors or employees. In practice, new clause
22 would make it much more difficult for boards of directors or
investors in public companies ever to find out whether they were being
ripped off. That would make good governance more difficult to achieve
and police and it would undermine large portions of part 10.</div>
<a name="06062741000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clauses 2 and 3 would set
up a confidentiality regime for directors, employees or shareholders
following an application to the Secretary of State. As I mentioned at
the outset, I have some sympathy with the motives behind the new
clauses, given the antics of animal rights activists, but I am
concerned that they would have serious across-the-board consequences.
Again, they are general in their application and are not confined to
companies involved in animal testing. Even if the scope were narrowed,
it would not satisfy all my
concerns.</div><a name="06062741000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000442"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It is important that, serious as threats against
animal testing are, we do not base this debate on animal testing. I
made it clear that whether it is boiler rooms or other sectors, even if
it does not exist now, it could exist. That is
important.</div><a name="06062741000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000443"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concerns, given his constituency interest in Huntingdon Life Sciences.
However, I repeat that the police have not beaten a path to our door to
argue that this is the way to tackle that sort of
crime.</div><a name="06062741000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clauses 2
and 3 would put the Secretary of State in an impossible position, as
well as becoming, by other means, a crook&#146;s charter. I shall
give a couple of examples. If a precedent were set whereby any company
involved in animal testing, however defined, were allowed this sort of
confidentiality, the first thing a determined fraudster might do within
a group of companies is to set up one involved or purporting to be
involved in animal testing. The new clauses are clearly drafted much
wider and refer to any situation in which there is a serious risk of
violence, intimidation or criminal activity. In my experience, some of
the most fraudulent companies and those with criminal links trade
overseas, launder money or are involved in business in unpredictable
and lawless countries. They are already among the least transparent to
investigate with legitimate due diligence. The procedures in the
clauses could make them more so. The Secretary of State, without
conducting his own investigations in the first place, would be in no
position to know the real purpose for which a confidentiality order was
being applied. He would be in an impossible position. He would be
blamed for granting an order when there was fraud, money laundering or
other criminal activity, and blamed for not granting an order when the
application was for legitimate reasons, such as the occurrence of
violence or criminal damage. There would also be a danger that all
sorts of companies would apply for such orders across the board. Put
simply, companies would simply take advantage of such an approach to
company law.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 212</div><a name="06062741000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">A senior bank executive in
Moscow had his family house burned down as a warning against opposing a
huge loan for one of the country&#146;s biggest businesses. That came
to light in specific circumstances when I was investigating alleged
insider dealing and fraudulent practice by a banker with a rival. That
banker let it be widely known that the rival was the fly in the
ointment, which was a dangerous assertion in what was the wild east in
Russia, and his house, with his family in it, was burned down. That had
nothing to do with names and addresses, whether of directors, employees
or shareholders, being available in any public record. Yet it is
conceivable that the risk of doing business in places such as Russia
and other parts of the wild east could be used as the basis for an
application for confidentiality under the new clauses. What grounds
would the Secretary of State have to
resist?</div><a name="06062741000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">In short, new
clauses 2 and 3 run the risk of being abused and allowing a coach and
horses to be put through legislation to lessen the transparency of
business generally. Like amendments Nos. 26 and 168 and new clause 2,
that sort of approach would be damaging to good corporate governance
and could allow crooks and fraudsters to drive a coach and horses
through company law and stock exchange regulations. They are a
crook&#146;s charter and should be
resisted.</div><a name="06062741000119"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000444"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The debate has been more measured than it was last
Thursday and I start by setting out what we agree on, which might be
helpful. We all agree that the appalling outrages committed by a few
animal rights extremists cannot and must not be tolerated. We all
condemn unreservedly any attempt to harass or intimidate anyone who
holds shares or engages in business with any company that is acting
lawfully, particularly if it is involved in activities as important as
testing the safety of medicines and other products. As the hon. Member
for Cambridge and my hon. Friend said, we are all in one place on that
objective.</div><a name="06062741000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
we all also agree with what the hon. Member for Huntingdon said in
response to an intervention last week: that there must be a balance and
proportionality between access to a register and security for those on
it. The argument is about where that balance lies. Certainly, we do not
want on-the-hoof, reactive legislative responses to real dangers, which
is what I think the hon. Member for Huntingdon accused us of doing and
what he, too, may be in danger of edging
towards.</div><a name="06062741000378"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="06062741000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Huntingdon spoke last week about the support that has
been coming from City institutions and others that are standing up
against terrorists and seeking to marginalise them. We agree that that
is a development for the good, and we should all support it. It
reflects developments that we all approve of. Something else on which
we can all agree is that the laws in themselves will not be enough to
tackle the problems that have arisen in recent years. Individuals,
companies and communities must show self confidence and stand up to
extremist thugs if we are to ensure that such incidents do not happen
in future.</div> <a name="06062741000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that we can all agree that the Government have now put in place a
criminal law infrastructure that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 213</div>provides a proper framework for dealing with the abuses that can happen
once a register of members has fallen into the wrong hands. Last week
the hon. Gentleman referred to the possible extension of section 145 of
the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. However, as he will
appreciate, that question cannot be considered by this
Committee.</div><a name="06062741000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
that we are debating, on which we consulted Opposition Members, is
whether we can strengthen the prevention side. We are concerned not
with the action taken once criminal activity has happened, but with
trying to prevent terrorists and fraudsters from carrying out such
activity. That was the subject of our amendments in the House of Lords,
as well as of the further amendments that have been tabled by hon.
Members.</div><a name="06062741000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
return to the principles, which are important. My hon. Friend the
Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme emphasised them as I should want to do.
Why do we want companies to keep publicly accessible registers of
members? It is important to be clear about that when we come to limit
the basic right, and to understand what we are interfering with.
Moreover, as I shall explain, the justifications for the right of
public access will be at the heart of any court&#146;s assessment of
whether a person is seeking to exercise the right for a proper purpose.
The idea of the proper purpose underpins our approach.</div>
<a name="06062741000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">When something is as deeply
embedded in our company law as the public right of access to registers
of members is, we should be extremely careful before we start diluting
it or significantly altering its character. Transparency of membership
is one of the conditions that a company and its members must observe in
return for the privileges that come from incorporations. Companies are
given a separate legal personality from their members, but the law
requires that they state who those members are, not least because in
the end it is the company&#146;s members who are its ultimate
decision-making body. It may well be that in the articles of a company,
considerable power is given to directors, but it is the members who
have the inalienable right to pass a resolution, such as one to remove
the directors from
office.</div><a name="06062741000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
company&#146;s members themselves have a clear interest in the
ability to gain access to information about other members of that
company, and the entry of names on the register is evidence of the
entitlement and rights of individual members. We can all think of
endless examples of the sort raised in the debate about members&#146;
need to contact each other, perhaps because of concerns about the
management of a company or because they want to check details of a
company&#146;s holdings. That might be even truer for a private than
for a public company.</div>
<a name="06062741000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my opinion&#151;I hope
that this view is shared across the Committee&#151;the requirement to
make the register available on request is probably the best check that
we have on the obligation to keep the register up to date. That was
certainly the response that we received when we consulted on the
clauses in the Green and White Papers and during the company law
review. That openness will prevent companies from getting the bad name
that they may have had in the first part of the 19th century. Openness
is the best way of ensuring probity and honesty.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 214</div><a name="06062741000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon. Friend the Member for
Newcastle-under-Lyme demonstrated by drawing on his experience, it is
not only members of a company who may want access to the register of
members; third parties may also want to consult it to find out who the
company&#146;s members are. The clauses before us deal with
directors&#146; duties and the review that companies will have to
undertake of their business, and we know from those who lobbied us that
a range of people might be interested in the way in which a company
pursues its objectives.</div>
<a name="06062741000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">When is it legitimate to deny
access to the register? I hope that hon. Members accept that the right
of access to the register is important. If that is the case, it follows
that any limitations on that right should not be capable of being
manipulated in a way that enables companies to undermine the basic
principle of transparency. Nevertheless, we in no way
underestimate&#151;I cannot remember the phrase that the hon. Member
for Huntingdon
used&#151;</div><a name="06062741000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000445"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It was economic
damage.</div><a name="06062741000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000446"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We in no way underestimate the economic damage that
can result from information falling into the wrong hands, and neither
do we underestimate the threat, which the hon. Gentleman also
mentioned, of other groups or fraudsters abusing our open access and
transparency rules. However, in seeking to eliminate opportunities for
a small number of people&#151;it is always a small number&#151;to
use access to the register to damage companies and harm or intimidate
individuals and members, we need to be clear that we should not end up
downgrading or devaluing access to the register for the vast majority
of people who avail themselves of it with no malign intent. We should
not discount the adverse impact that the loss of member transparency
could have.</div><a name="06062741000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman said last week that the debate on these provisions was partly
about the type of environment that we are to offer people who conduct
business. Of course we want that environment to be as safe and free as
possible, but we also want it to be open and transparent. We try to
achieve that proper balance between openness and security through the
concept of proper purpose, which is central to the clauses. In a
moment, I shall say a little more about defining proper purpose, which
is the subject of several amendments, but I can say that our concept
was informed by the work of the company law review. Our view has always
been that people should not gain access to the register if they do not
have a proper purpose for doing so. Conversely, the clauses assume that
companies should not be able to refuse access to the register to people
who have a proper purpose.</div>
<a name="06062741000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key question is how to find
out whether a person&#146;s purposes are indeed proper. The gap in
thinking between the Government and the Opposition probably relates to
who should make that judgment. Should it be the company itself? Would
that open the way to companies that might well abuse that judgment?
Alternatively, would the court be the most appropriate place to smoke
out bogus applicants and vindicate bona fide applicants? The judge can
make a more impartial assessment informed by evidence that is formally
and openly given in court and applicants can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 215</div>be cross-examined by both sides. That is why we give companies that do
not want to grant access to their registers the option of applying to a
court.</div><a name="06062741000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument
has been made that that arrangement might be particularly difficult for
smaller companies. We are aware of that issue, but as I tried to say
last week on an intervention, an individual who tries to exercise their
right faces difficulties equal to those facing small companies that try
to ensure their
safety.</div><a name="06062741000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000447"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I do not think that I am wrong in saying that
the clause as drafted gives no rights to individuals and that only
companies would have the right to block
access.</div><a name="06062741000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000448"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> What I mean is that if that situation were turned
around, the company could make a decision and the individual would have
to challenge it in court. The individual would then face the same
difficulties as companies. One can argue about whether a company or an
individual would be more powerful and competent to challenge the court.
On the balance of that argument, we have come down on the side of
companies, although I believe that Opposition Members come down on the
other side of that argument.</div>
<a name="06062741000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we accept that we must
make the rules as simple and straightforward as possible, particularly
in the interests of smaller companies whose resources and expertise
will always be more limited. We are talking to colleagues in the
Department for Constitutional Affairs about how applications should be
structured and provided for within civil procedure rules and the
associated protocols. We want to ensure a streamlined but rigorous
procedure that will be as easy and cheap as possible. That procedure
will be subject to consultation, so Members of the House will again be
able to
comment.</div><a name="06062741000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000449"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> In that regard, has the Minister considered our
amendment that seeks to extend the period from five days to 15 days,
which we believe would be advantageous to smaller companies, which need
more time to get to court than larger
companies?</div><a name="06062741000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000450"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I will come to that amendment later and explain why
I believe that it is not
appropriate.</div><a name="06062741000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments that the Government moved on Third Reading in the Lords were
not knee-jerk overreactions, and I rather resented the comment to that
effect. We took the opportunity to look at sensible amendments. I am
acutely conscious of the need to avoid legislating in undue haste on
the back of particular cases. In fact, when the issues were first
raised with me, I said that we must be really careful that we do not go
down the route taken in dangerous dogs legislation and legislate in
haste only to realise later that that legislation does not
work.</div><a name="06062741000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000451"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister will appreciate that the Government
amended the clause significantly on Report or Third Reading in the
Lords. My point is that that took place at the last minute, which I
gave as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 216</div>justification for the need for the Committee to consider these clauses
thoroughly. I was not saying anything too
controversial.</div><a name="06062741000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000452"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am glad of that. That description of what was
said was not how it was interpreted in the press last week. We were
responding not at the last minute, but to the new situation that arose
from the action that had been taken in the middle of the previous week,
before Third Reading. That action was taken in the middle of
consideration of the
Bill.</div><a name="06062741000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000453"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Does the Minister mean that she was responding
to the Prime Minister, who told the Department the week before to get
its act
together?</div><a name="06062741000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000454"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No. We were responding to a new situation that had
arisen and to which the Prime Minister had also responded. It was a
coming together of minds, and I had thought that it was a coming
together of minds throughout the House. It arose from the
GlaxoSmithKline issue and the intimidating letters that members of that
company
received.</div><a name="06062741000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000455"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> I find it strange that the hon. Gentleman is
coming over all sweetness and light on this issue. My right hon. Friend
the Minister and I have made the point that his approach to the issue
is controversial because it plays fast and loose with company
law.</div>
<a name="06062741000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000456"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That is the danger of trying to legislate without
thinking through the wider implications of any propositions that one
tables. I agree with my hon. Friend that we must be wary of legislating
in haste only to regret in the long term our creation of a much more
closed infrastructure, which, as we have tried to describe, would have
enormous
defects.</div><a name="06062741000379"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="06062741000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the point
of view of companies, we have introduced two changes. Those who seek to
access the register must identify themselves or those for whom they
act. We have created a set of offences relating to when they act
improperly. It will be an offence to seek or gain access to a
company&#146;s register with a view to acting in a way that is
detrimental to the company and its members; for persons other than the
company to fail to take steps to ensure that the information from the
register does not fall into the hands of those who may try to harass or
defraud; and to make a statement that is false and misleading, if a
statement of reasons is required when applying for access to the
register. We have toughened up that area.</div>
<a name="06062741000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for
Cambridge said, we have relieved the company of the need to make
repeated applications to the court when it faces repeated requests.
Many of the amendments were tabled after we held discussions with the
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which suggested
some of them to us.</div>
<a name="06062741000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000457"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I fully appreciate what the Government are trying
to do with those new crimes. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 217</div>am just surprised that there have been no interventions from Government
Back Benchers about the danger of them chilling investigative
journalism. Clause 118 makes it an offence to pass on names on the
register for a purpose that is not a proper purpose. As the Minister
said, the Bill does not define proper purpose at any great
length.</div>
<a name="06062741000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000458"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman is an eminent lawyer, and I am
sure he does not suggest that it is proper for the Bill to define
proper purpose, because were we to attempt so to do, it would be a
limiting feature of the Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000460"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We can take a common-sense approach to the
definition of proper purpose. Look it up in the &#147;Oxford English
Dictionary&#148; if one likes, but it is not a hugely complex task.
If one defines &#147;proper purpose&#148; in law, one loses a heck
of a lot of flexibility. I think that a judge, or whoever will consider
those issues in court, will be able to distinguish between legitimate
investigative journalism, which we wish to protect, and illegitimate

<a name="06062741000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 27 would insert
&#147;precise&#148;. It would not add very much, because proper
purpose is well understood and it does not need further definition.
Further, under the new regime it will not be harder for small companies
to deal with requests for access to the register. For such businesses,
requests from non-members are not the norm, and they can legitimately
be viewed with suspicion if they are not supported by a statement of
reasons that is manifestly above board and if they are not from a
plausible applicant. We do not think that amendment No. 27 adds
anything.</div> <a name="06062741000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 29 deals with the number of working days that a company would have
in which to take a decision. We do not think it unreasonable to require
companies of any size to decide within five working days what to do
with a request for access. If an application gives rise to suspicion it
is likely to do so straight away. Moreover, if we give companies too
long there is a real risk that directors of some companies may abuse
the procedure, to delay the members&#146; attempts to communicate
their legitimate concerns about the way a company is being
run.</div> <a name="06062741000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing in mind
the fact that an extraordinary general meeting can be called with 14
days&#146; notice, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 218</div>amendment No. 29 would make it possible for a company, without even
going to court, to frustrate its members&#146; attempts to organise
themselves before the meeting. Five days&#151;and hon. Members should
remember that that means five working days&#151;from the receipt of a
complete application under clause 115 is long enough to enable a
company to decide whether a request looks

already given, we do not think it right to restrict access to the
register of members to members only. The public should have access for
proper purposes. We do not think that it would be reasonable to
restrict access to the members of a company who individually hold at
least 5 per cent. of its share capital. A threshold of that kind pays
too little regard to the principles of transparency and shareholder
democracy which I said underpinned our approach to be
acceptable.</div><a name="06062741000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
probably dealt with amendments Nos. 168 and 176, about circumstances in
which the applicant rather than the company should go to court in
disputed cases. We considered those options when we drafted the
clauses, and again when we amended the Bill in another place. Our
concern is, again, about the balance of access. I think that I have
probably described that already in response to an Opposition
intervention.</div>
<a name="06062741000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it better
that a company should seek to limit access or that an individual should
seek access? In relation to the balance of access and security, we
believe that the company is much better placed to protect itself
against improper requests for access than an individual is to take on
litigation, with its expense and complexity, in order to exercise the
right to find information about members of a company. The question is
how to balance the matter; we have balanced it in another direction,
and I think that we have chosen the right one, with respect to who is
more able and competent to pursue
litigation.</div>
<a name="06062741000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000465"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is certainly one factor; the other is the
seriousness of the situation if the decision goes the wrong way. The
question that I want the Minister to address is: what is the balance
between the two different risks? On the one hand, there is the risk of
intimidation and violence. How frequently might that arise? On the
other hand, there is the risk of fraud, to which the hon. Member for
Newcastle-under-Lyme referred. The first question, therefore, is how
often these risks arise The second is how serious the two risks 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 219</div>are. How serious is the risk of physical violence on the one side and
financial loss on the other? The balance involves all three of those
things, not just the question of access to the court, which the
Minister mentioned.</div>
<a name="06062741000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000466"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The answer, if I have understood that intervention
properly, is that I cannot imagine a court that would not swiftly and
properly decide in favour of a company in the exceptional
circumstances&#151;and they are exceptional&#151;in which a group
of shareholders wished to access information about members for an
improper purpose, such as harassing or intimidating them. I discussed
the issue with, dare I say it, my own husband when I was preparing for
the debate, and the view among judges in our courts is that they would
take a pretty sensible, fast decision. Everyone in the Committee would
support that, and we should have confidence that the court system will
work in that way.</div>
<a name="06062741000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000467"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Minister&#146;s legal advice is, of course,
impeccable, but will she consider the scenario outlined by the hon.
Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme, who suggested that companies could set
themselves up so that they could make a claim and commit a fraud? If
that point can be accepted for the purposes of criticising the
amendments, it could, unfortunately, also apply to the
Government&#146;s proposal. My view is that it applies to neither and
that that fear is exaggerated, in which case that point cannot be used
against amendment No. 168, for example.</div>
<a name="06062741000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000468"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Whatever we prescribe in legislation, it will
clearly be open to companies and individuals to attempt to abuse it. On
the whole, however, it is easier for companies than for individuals to
access the court processes should they need to. In the interests of
transparency, therefore, we should protect the rights of individuals in
this context and ask companies to go through the court processes,
rather than having the rights the other way round. That is the
Government&#146;s judgment, and we believe it to be a proper
judgment. I also believe that the courts will act appropriately,
swiftly and in a simple and direct manner if a company&#151;be it
Huntingdon Life Sciences or any other company&#151;makes
representations to it about not disclosing its list of
members.</div>
<a name="06062741000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000469"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am sure that the Minister had excellent legal
advice from her husband, although someone once told me that one should
always beware of legal advice for which one has not paid. Perhaps the
Minister did pay for it&#151;I do not know. That aside, the problem
is that case law could build up around the provisions in the Bill.
Whether a hearing is short or long often depends on the
applicant&#146;s funding, the quality of their legal advice and the
extent to which they want to make a long case of it. A protest group
might want to use the opportunity of a court case to promote its cause,
so it might put more money into it than the individual whom the
Minister mentioned. Circumstances might therefore dictate how the court
case panned out. They might also dictate the rationale, because slight
changes could be made to the reason for wanting to see the register,
and a court case could be made on the back of each of
them.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 220</div><a name="06062741000380"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="06062741000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000470"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would accept that
one could make the argument entirely the other way. A company with more
substantial resources could use them to litigate to prevent access by
an individual or group of individuals with a legitimate request to
access the register of members under the rights of transparency. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the argument can go both ways. On
the whole, companies tend to have more resources at their disposal than
individuals and on the basis of that assertion we took the view that it
is for companies to go to court and demonstrate that a request for
access is not for a proper purpose. That is better than an individual
having to go to court and prove that their request for access is for a
proper purpose. That is the view that we have
taken.</div><a name="06062741000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
briefly with the proposals in the other new clauses. New clause 2 would
allow the Secretary of State to exempt a company from the rules about
making its register of members available because its members would face
a risk of violence and intimidation. New clause 3 would allow exemption
for individual members on similar grounds. I really think that those
exemptions would be very wide ranging and a step too
far.</div><a name="06062741000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">We propose to
deal with information on the register of members that applies to
Companies House in the regulations covering companies&#146; annual
returns. We will consult on those issues, but, as hon. Members know, we
intend to exempt private companies from the obligation to supply their
members&#146; addresses and to exempt public companies from the
obligation to supply any details of those who hold less than 5 per
cent. of a company&#146;s
shares.</div><a name="06062741000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last week, the
hon. Gentleman suggested that that should be in the Bill rather than in
secondary legislation. Our view is simply that that is a practical
matter and best set out in secondary legislation which, as is always
the case, provides greater flexibility to amend the legislation if
circumstances change. I genuinely think that it is more in the
interests of the people whom he is trying to protect to have that
flexibility
retained.</div><a name="06062741000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
registers of members kept by companies, it seems unlikely to us that
shareholders who were prepared to apply to the Secretary of State under
new clause 3 would not be willing also to take steps to protect
themselves, either by not using their residential addresses or by
holding shares through a nominee or in a different name. More
generally, I am not sure why, if a company&#146;s activities make it
a target for extremist activities, any one of its members is more
likely than others to need the protection of
anonymity.</div><a name="06062741000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">On new
clauses 2 and 22 we simply do not see why any company should be capable
of being wholly exempted from what will be a much more qualified
obligation to provide public access to the register of members. The
idea in new clause 22 that a company could simply opt out of its own
volition is very wide ranging. There is no suggestion that that power
could be exercised only when members faced the threat of violence or
intimidation. Perhaps the hon. Member for Cambridge deliberately did
not limit it in that way, but it seems to be a very widely drawn power
and it is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 221</div>clear to me what action members, particularly minority shareholders,
could take to ensure that a company complied with an undertaking to
pass on lawful messages or documentation. That is not clear in the
amendment.</div><a name="06062741000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000471"></a>David
Howarth:</b> In fact, we followed the Government&#146;s
strategy of adding a crime which would be committed by persons who
failed to do
so.</div><a name="06062741000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000472"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> As I read the amendment, there would be no way in
which anyone could inspect or check the register if a company chose to
opt
out.</div><a name="06062741000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000473"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is correct. All I am saying is that further
amendments would put in a crime of failing to pass on information.
Inserting a crime of that sort is precisely the same strategy that the
Government are following in clause 118. We are simply imitating or
mimicking the Government&#146;s approach. If it is not good in our
amendment, it is not good in their
provision.</div><a name="06062741000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000474"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I hear that, but the amendment is so widely drawn
that there would be a huge range of situations in which people could
assert that a criminal activity had been engaged in. I just think it is
too widely drawn. That is our
view.</div><a name="06062741000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think and hope
that I have covered the main issues and I apologise if I have not. It
has been a long debate and I want to end by saying that we have tried
to strike the right balance between transparency and the protection of
members. I accept that that is not easy to do and that the damage done
by extremists has been serious in many cases, so it is a legitimate
issue to discuss. We do not think that that brand of terrorism should
drive us into tilting the balance decisively away from transparency. If
we were to do so we would endanger a cornerstone of UK company law and
corporate
governance.</div><a name="06062741000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think
that the basic approach to be adopted from the start&#151;focusing on
the concept of proper purposes&#151;is sound in principle. We believe
that the changes made in the other place will make the provision more
workable in practice. We are not complacent about the issues. We
welcome the opportunity that the debate has provided to test our
thinking, but I hope that what I and all hon. Members have said shows
how seriously we all take the issues. I genuinely believe that our
amendments in another place set that balance appropriately and that the
amendments that were tabled for debate in the Committee would take it
too far. In light of what I have said, I hope that the amendment will
be withdrawn.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000475"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We have had a useful debate on clauses 115, 116
and 117. Having heard the various contributions and interventions
relating to my speech last week, it might be helpful if I say a few
words about what we are not proposing, as much as about what we are
proposing.</div><a name="06062741000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
certainly not ignoring previous legislation in this area. I appreciate
that the Minister recognised our input and review of previous
legislation, such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005,
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 222</div>other aspects of economic terrorism. The hon. Member for
Newcastle-under-Lyme accused us of playing fast and loose with company
law. I can only say that we believe that it was important to raise
those issues in Committee with the specific aim of having a full debate
to cover the ground and to ensure that the issues, including both
extremes as well as the bits in the middle, have been
discussed.</div><a name="06062741000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
certainly not ignoring the Government&#146;s willingness to improve
the situation where that exists, and we appreciate that clause 115 as
drafted moves the debate forward positively, although we believe that
the clause needs to be refined&#151;as it stands it will not work
adequately or be totally fit for purpose. In interventions during my
speech last week, the Minister noted that the hon. Member for Cambridge
and I were invited to the Department of Trade and Industry to discuss
the clauses&#151;I appreciated that offer&#151;and although we made
our position clear at that meeting we also received draft clauses which
I took away and looked at. Many of the comments that I made last week
and today were based on my views of the Government amendments that were
given to me at that
time.</div><a name="06062741000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
from our point of view, and as I explained to the hon. Member for
Newcastle-under-Lyme, this is not just a debate about animal rights
terrorists. I made the point that we believe that the attacks on pharma
shareholders will be just the preliminaries of a wider campaign against
other sectors, if we do not get on top of the issue. We recognise that
registers are already being misused for a variety of illegal purposes.
I gave the example of the offshore boiler-room criminal
gangs.</div> <a name="06062741000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
important point is that the debate, to us, is not just a matter of
protecting home addresses. The Minister said, in relation to new clause
3, that service addresses can be used, so that an individual can deal
with the problem within the existing law. I made the point, in response
to an intervention last week, that sending a threat to a service
address can be just as bad as sending it to a home address.
Furthermore, people may not want their names to be
revealed.</div><a name="06062741000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, to
us the debate is not about ending public access to shareholder
registers, as, I think, the Minister appreciated. The amendment that
would restrict access to those who own a certain percentage of shares
is not our policy; we tabled it on a probing basis so that that
question could form part of the debate. I should point out that
concerns have been raised by, for instance, credit agencies, that even
the Government&#146;s proposals go too far. That aspect of the matter
was debated in the House of Lords Committee. As the hon. Member for
Cambridge said, the Government themselves propose through the clauses
to restrict public access. The debate is therefore about not extremes
but degrees, and about whether the provisions approach the right
degree.</div> <a name="06062741000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">After giving
no little time to his impressive CV, the hon. Member for
Newcastle-under-Lyme described, but in a very unspecific way, how the
amendments would affect investigative journalism and hurt corporate
governance. I think that those were his main points. He will have to be
a little more specific, although I agree, basically, with his comments
about access not being allowed without 5 per cent. share 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 223</div>ownership. Even then, however, as the hon. Member for Cambridge noted,
the hon. Gentleman mixed up his amendments.</div>
<a name="06062741000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate should be about
protecting individuals from the use of their names or addresses for
illegal purposes. Now that we have heard the debate on the
Government&#146;s proposals I shall set out our position. The
Minister asked why we have, for instance, maintained that the
Government&#146;s proposals do not go far enough, and I want to deal
with her
points.</div><a name="06062741000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
remain concerned that Companies House is being kept in the equation. We
can see no need for double disclosure. We think that we should simply
stop companies having to provide details of members to Companies House,
and then debate the question of access to details attaching to the
companies&#146; registers of members. We shall table amendments to
that effect, and we still maintain that that should be set out in the
Bill.</div><a name="06062741000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000476"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the only
access to details of the membership of particular companies should be
through the company
itself?</div><a name="06062741000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000477"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am saying exactly that. Of course, Companies
House has to publish details of members once a year. At any time the
register as it is found at Companies House will be out of date. If the
Minister is suggesting that people should use that register for any
purpose requiring accuracy, that will not do. The only way to find out
who the members of a company are is through the
company.</div><a name="06062741000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000478"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That is a dramatic change in the current
transparency. I have two points to put to the hon. Gentleman. First,
the discipline of having to provide an annual return to Companies House
is a way of getting companies to keep their registers up to date. All
our evidence, from all the stakeholders, is that without that
discipline it would not happen.</div>
<a name="06062741000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the hon. Gentleman
must accept that on occasion perhaps an investigative journalist, or
perhaps an existing member who thinks that the directors, in a private
company where some of the members are also directors, are not working
in the interest of the company, will want access. There will be such
circumstances, in which people want to have access to the register of
members without the directors of the company necessarily being aware.
The hon. Gentleman must accept
that.</div><a name="06062741000381"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="06062741000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000479"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I do not accept that at all. What is filed at
Companies House is not the current register of members of a company but
a copy of the register at a set date. An investigative journalist going
to that copy of the register could well name people who are no longer
shareholders of the company. The Minister also seems to miss the fact
that the basic need is covered in the Companies Act 1985. If an entry
in the register is not made, an offence has been committed. The annual
return is simply a reflection of what should have been done under the
law, it is not the law itself.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 224</div><a name="06062741000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000480"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> The hon. Gentleman said previously that I had
not been specific. I did not want to delay the Committee, but I can
give him plenty of specific examples, from the Ostrich Farming
Corporation to the Alchemy pyramid selling scheme to the Facia collapse
that floored Stephen Hinchliffe, in which third-party access was vital
not only for journalists but for those investigating financial crime. I
suggest that the hon. Gentleman talks to the financial crime unit at
Cambridgeshire police, the Serious Fraud Office and the stock exchange
before he continues to advocate his current
position.</div><a name="06062741000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000481"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I hear the points made by the hon. Gentleman and
the Minister, but the fact remains that what is filed once a year in
the annual return is a reflection of the register at that moment, not
at any time afterwards. Access should therefore be granted to the
register rather than to what is filed at Companies
House.</div><a name="06062741000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we
are concerned that the Government&#146;s preferred mechanics will
favour larger companies that can go to court and employ a solicitor and
a barrister. The Minister raised that matter. It will be tougher for
the smaller company, which is why we want to increase the period for
going to court from five to 15 days. I found the Minister&#146;s
explanation that she does not want to give people too much time to put
together arguments somewhat strange. Perhaps I did not get that right,
and she might like to elaborate. I did not really understand her
point.</div><a name="06062741000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000482"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> My point was that companies need to give only 14
days&#146; notice of an annual meeting. The hon. Gentleman suggests a
longer period for which they could withhold information, during which
time they could pass all sorts of resolutions that might change the
situation and inhibit access to proper information on the company and
its members. That would be a risk if the period allowed were, in the
example that I used, longer than the period for calling an annual
meeting.</div><a name="06062741000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000483"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We would maintain that a small company with
limited resources is unlikely to be able to appoint a solicitor and a
barrister and prepare a court case in five
days.</div><a name="06062741000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 117 deals
with the refusal of inspection. The Government have given us their idea
of the balancing act that they believe should take place, and if access
to a register of members is refused it will be a serious matter.
However, the clause increases the potency of our argument that
companies should have more time than the five days provided to approach
a court for a non-disclosure order. As I have said, that is
particularly important for small companies. The Minister said that she
will consult with lawyers on the mechanics of how the process is likely
to work. Will she drop hon. Members a line to explain what she will ask
those lawyers? The provision is important and needs much further
consideration.</div><a name="06062741000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
the provisions would not be difficult to interpret. Companies would
have to consider whether a normal-looking request for member details
harboured a secret, illegal purpose, and courts would have to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 225</div>determine what was a fit and proper purpose, about which we have had
some debate. An amendment made on Third Reading in the Lords tried to
address our concern that many activists could buy one share each and
keep the company perpetually in court with requests. That amendment,
now clause 116(4), is still open to broad interpretation, and
presumably it would not stop further applications on grounds other than
the similar purpose test.</div>
<a name="06062741000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly, we remain concerned
that the only person who can seek protection is the company, not the
shareholders who are individually at risk. Fifthly, the UK Shareholders
Association, in its briefing to us on 30 May,
said:</div><a name="06062741000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
118 creating offences in connection with the obtaining of a copy of a
register or of passing it on also seems unsatisfactory. The definition
of the offence in connection with the passing on of the list would make
it very difficult for anyone to decide whether they were entitled to
pass it on or not. There seems a risk that the courts would feel oblige
to construe the phrase more widely than might be intended. Moreover, we
are not satisfied that all loopholes in connection with the chain of
passing on a copy have been stopped up. It would seem far simpler to
make the offence apply to the ultimate user of the list. The offence
would then be to use information obtained from the register or index
for an improper purpose, the latter having been defined as suggested
above.&#148;</div><a name="06062741000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">What do
we propose to improve the situation? First, the existing provisions
must be tightened up in the ways I have described. Secondly, the only
access should be via the company register and not Companies House.
Thirdly, there may be special circumstances in which the company or an
individual should have the right to approach the DTI and say,
&#147;We are under attack and we need protection.&#148; That should
not be an everyday occurrence, and it should be undertaken only on a
company-by-company basis. However, in such a situation, shareholder
protection could be so important that the register of members should be
made non-public.</div>
<a name="06062741000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000484"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> The hon. Gentleman again seriously suggests that
the only portal for access to a share register should be the company
itself. Has he considered that it would damage the economy&#146;s
efficiency? If somebody wishing to take over a company&#151;and
therefore do shareholders some good&#151;could access the share
register only through the company itself, the company would be tipped
off about the takeover in advance.</div>
<a name="06062741000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000485"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That would not be the case. One would ask for a
copy of the register, and the company would have to provide it. I
return to my basic point that what the hon. Gentleman describes as the
register of members is a point in time: a shareholder might have sold
half or three-quarters of their stake by the time the hon. Gentleman
had got to Companies House and asked to see a copy of the
register.</div>
<a name="06062741000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000486"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that a useful
guide is far better than no guide whatever?
</div><a name="06062741000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000487"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The accurate guide is the register. The company
maintains it, and the Companies Acts provide for people to access the
register. We should debate the question of more or less access, about
which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 226</div>I fully accept there are valid points to be made. I maintain that access
should be gained through the register, rather than through an old
record at Companies House.</div>
<a name="06062741000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today&#146;s debate has shown
that new clauses 2 and 3 could be improved. For instance, they could
provide for the company to circulate documents that shareholders would
normally circulate. Despite the register being closed to inspection,
access to other members could be retained. It was a feature of the
Liberal Democrats&#146; new clause 22, and the composite approach
mentioned by the hon. Member for Cambridge sounds attractive. It would
address the issue that was quite properly raised by the hon. Member for
Burnley (Kitty Ussher).
</div><a name="06062741000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the Labour
attacks on new clauses 2 and 3 were a surprise, and hon. Members might
not appreciate where the drafting derives from, so let me explain. A
few years ago, there was growing concern about the abuse of directors
arising from the requirement that their home addresses appear
onthe public register at Companies House.
The Companies (Particulars of Usual Residential Address)
(Confidentiality Orders) Regulations 2002&#151;that is a
mouthful&#151;attempted to provide a remedy, which became clause 723B
of the Companies Act 1985.</div>
<a name="06062741000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision, which will be
superseded by that in the Bill, played an important role in advancing
the debate on this issue. It provided that a person could ask the
Secretary of State to make a privacy order if he could show that
revealing his address would create, or would be likely to create, a
serious risk that he or a person living with him would be subject to
violence or intimidation. What is important is that the decision on
privacy was to be an administrative, rather than a court
decision.</div> <a name="06062741000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
practice, the current system has worked fairly well. The Minister might
wish to put me right on this, but I believe that there have been no
accusations of democracy having been attacked. The current system could
therefore form the basis for similar provisions for shareholders,
possibly with enhanced appeal rights. Of course, new clause 22 provides
for the decision to be taken by shareholders, rather than the DTI. At
this stage, however, I feel that that is a step too far, although it
was certainly important to bring the issue up for discussion.</div>
<a name="06062741000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition remain of the
opinion that clause 115 does not go far enough and that new clause 2
would be a useful addition to the existing powers. That is why I shall
ask for a Division on the new clause when we reach it at a later stage.
For the moment, however, I shall ask for a Division on amendment No.
29, which,I believe, we shall be able to have today. I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000506"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in clause 120,
page 54, line 16, leave out from beginning to end of line 18 and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) A company may
transfer to a separate register any entries relating to a former member
of the company; and the provisions of this Chapter apply to the
separate register as they apply to the register, with any necessary
modifications.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(2) An entry
relating to a former member of the company may be removed from the
register, or from the separate register of former members, after the
expiration of ten years from the date on which he ceased to be a
member.'.</div><a name="06062741000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause relates to section 352(6) of the Companies Act 1985 on entries
regarding former members. Lord Hodgson proposed an amendment to insert
the Law Society&#146;s recommended clause, which is largely
reproduced in amendment No. 33. The benefit of the amendment would be
greater privacy for those who are no longer members. Lord
Hodgson&#146;s amendment would also have reduced the relevant time
period from 10 years to five years. He said that the 10 year period
would be burdensome on companies and that a reduction would provide
some deregulation and cost
savings.</div><a name="06062741000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Sainsbury responded that such an amendment to separate the registers
would be unnecessary as clause 743 gives companies the power to arrange
their records as they wish, and that the time limit for keeping records
should be reduced to 10 years to take account of any claims arising
from errors in the
register.</div><a name="06062741000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes to the Bill state that the reduction to 10 years was
the result of a company law review recommendation. However, the company
law review also recommended that companies be permitted to keep entries
relating to former members on a separate register from that used for
current purposes. The Government seem to have ignored that
recommendation.</div><a name="06062741000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision has been reviewed in the Lords, but we ask the Government to
reconsider and we ask why they have ignored the company law review
recommendation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000507"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We have not ignored it. Indeed, it is our
view&#151;as I think was expressed in another place&#151;that the
issue is covered by what is now clause 787(1)(b), which says that
company records</div><a name="06062741000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may be
arranged in such manner as the directors of the company think
fit&#148;.</div><a name="06062741000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">That enables
companies to keep a separate register if they so wish. The opinion of
the commercial registrars whom we consulted on the issue was that that
provision covers the arrangement that the hon. Gentleman is proposing.
Therefore I hope that he will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
<a name="06062741000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000508"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for that explanation and I
apologise for not having clause 787(1)(b) to hand. The problem with the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000509"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause relates to section 355 of the
Companies Act 1985. Clause 121(1) removes the requirement of section
355(1) of the 1985 Act whereby the company must strike from the
register the name of members who have been issued with a share warrant.
The explanatory note says that the effect of the change to section 355
is to the effect of the change to section 355 is to make it clear that
shares need not first be issued in registered form, but can be issued
directly in warrant to bearer form. If there is no register, would not
the original requirement still be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000510"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000511"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause relates to section 352A of the
Companies Act 1985. Section 352A(1) has been developed by the insertion
of clause 122(1), which requires a company at its formation to enter a
statement on its register stating it to be a single member company.
Section 352A refers only to a company whose quantity of members falls
to one having to make a statement. As a result of amendments agreed in
the House of Lords, clause 122 now refers to all limited companies.
Section 352A referred only to private 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 229</div>companies. Lord Sainsbury explained that the amendment is a result of
the company law directive. It requires that once a company becomes a
single member company, whether public or private, it should be
recorded.</div> <a name="06062741000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that there may be some element of European law which is the root of all
of this. Perhaps the Minister could explain. To our mind, this is
patently an unnecessary clause. If there is only one shareholder on the
register that is a self-evident fact seen by looking at a copy of the
register. What is the purpose conceptually of the clause and why is
having one shareholder, rather than two or three, going to be of
concern to
anyone?</div><a name="06062741000256"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000513"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 34, in clause 124,
page 56, line 22, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5) Any amendment
to the register consequent upon an order for rectification shall be
deemed to have occurred at the time of the passing of the
order.'.</div><a name="06062741000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause relates to section 359 of the Companies Act 1985. Let us say,
for example, that there is a nasty shareholder dispute, typically over
a family company and the dispute leads to litigation and eventually the
court making a rectification order under these provisions so that
previously transferred shares need to be reregistered with the original
owner. In practice, the implementation of any change to the register,
say a share transfer to the rightful owners as dictated by the court
order, may be delayed between the time of the order and the upgrading
of the register.</div>
<a name="06062741000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until the register is amended
the legal owner remains the old owner. In practice that can mean that
physical possession of the company books and the register of members
can dictate how quickly the order will be implemented. The books will
normally be held by professionals such as the family accountant or
solicitor. However, in practice, and I have seen this happen on a few
occasions, the professional will have taken sides. The professional
often has to take sides to avoid a conflict situation, which can mean
that the books are effectively held by the wrong person and so the
client will advise the professional not to comply with the order and
the professional must follow the client&#146;s
wishes.</div><a name="06062741000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
aims to deal with such a situation by saying that the order for
rectification shall mean that the following amendment to the
register</div> <a name="06062741000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall be
deemed to have occurred at the time of the passing of the
order.&#148;</div><a name="06062741000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that way,
petty but often nasty disputes, sometimes needing extra orders to force
handover of the registers, could be
avoided.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 230</div><a name="06062741000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000514"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but
as I understand the clause&#146;s purposes, it might be appropriate
on some occasions for a member whose name was not on the register to be
engaged in decisions taken prior to his or her confirmation as a
legitimate member of the company. I am thinking of an example in which
somebody&#146;s name might not have been accepted on the register on
a particular day because a resolution or vote was taken by the company
during a meeting at which he or she was not
present.</div><a name="06062741000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I further
understand that case law in that instance demonstrates that courts
rarely exercise the power of retrospective rectification. In fact,
officials have told me that the case law informing the provisions is a
1904 case involving the Sussex Brick Company in the Court of Appeal,
which at that time was the Master of the Rolls. That decision was based
on an earlier decision of 1866. The case law tells us that very rarely,
and only in exceptional circumstances, do the courts suggest that
retrospective rectification of a mistake on the company register should
be made. That facility should remain in place.</div>
<a name="06062741000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman alluded to the case of a dispute in a small company whose
members might be members of a family in dispute. I am told that in such
circumstances, the court can already make orders in the terms that he
suggested. The amendment is not necessary to deal with the
circumstances of concern to
him.</div><a name="06062741000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000515"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I shall respond to the Minister&#146;s points,
because I accept totally that the situation will be rare. It probably
has been very rare. However, if such circumstances do arise, it will
probably be a pretty fraught, nasty scenario in which people have
fallen out to the extent that they are unable to sort out among
themselves the register and who owns the shares. They will probably
have talked through solicitors and will have to go to court to sort out
whether the entry was made appropriately. Yes, the proposed provision
is unlikely to be used, but in those rare circumstances where such
events do happen, it is likely that an amendment such as amendment No.
134 will be useful after the court has made a decision to avoid a
prolongation of the
dispute.</div><a name="06062741000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
rightly said that if the rectification is not made and the registers
are not handed over, the individual can return to the court and request
a further order to gain physical possession of the registers or speed
up rectification. Indeed, costs would probably be awarded. However, in
the case of a small company, if the individual must return to court to
obtain another order after having brought the court case, it will be a
dispiriting process in a situation where I maintain that there should
be no problem. Once the court has made a decision, there should be no
problem. That should be what is reflected on the register, even if the
registers have not been handed over. To that extent I hear what the
Minister has to say. I am not going to push the amendment to a vote,
but perhaps the Minister will have another
think.</div><a name="06062741000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

ownership of the person on the register may be as a trustee. They may
own the shares not on their own behalf but as the beneficial owner for

their status as a trustee in their entry on the register of

surprised that the clause existed. I have so often seen people make an
entry in the register of members saying, for instance, &#147;Mr.

Even after many years of practice, it is amazing how such little things
spring up with the Companies Act when one goes through it in a little
bit more detail than one otherwise might. Although I appreciate that
the trustees individually would be the legal owners, I am not sure why

Brokenshire</b>: Whether I fascinate my hon. Friend or not
will remain to be seen. My point is that often where a shareholder is
registered, for example, as trustee of the X settlement, that
information is often helpful to a company, so that one can have an
understanding of the manner in which that shareholder might exercise
his rights. Therefore, from the company&#146;s perspective, having
that detail on the register can be beneficial for the administration of
the company&#146;s
affairs.</div><a name="06062741000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000520"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend has pre-empted my next point. I
was going to say that it is quite the opposite of being a problem. Like
my hon. Friend, I consider that knowing from the register who is the
underlying owner would be helpful for the company. Not that it has to
be done, but it is helpful for that information to be provided. Also,
building on the debate on clause 115, it would be helpful for third
parties to be able to see who the underlying owner was. Again, not that
the information has to be provided, but if it exists I do not see any
harm being done and, quite the opposite, it is generally be helpful for
those making investigations.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 232</div><a name="06062741000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000521"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend will be aware of the section
212 notice provisions currently contained in the Companies Act 1985,
which in essence allow for investigations to be undertaken to establish
who is the ultimate beneficial holder of the underlying shares. Clearly
this sort of information, if volunteered, is helpful in those types of
investigations.</div><a name="06062741000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000522"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That is absolutely the case. We are talking not
about mandatory provisions but about allowing people to put on the
register those details that they want to
appear.</div><a name="06062741000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point
is that rights and obligations follow being a trustee. By notifying the
fact that someone is on the register as a trustee, third parties are
being put on notice that the legal owner has a different status, not in
terms of his capacity as a member, but in terms of his relationship
with a third party. That arises most often in relation to the sale of a
company, when it is very important to know that someone is selling as a
trustee, because the covenants that they will be prepared to give to
the purchaser will be of a very different nature from those of a
registered shareholder who is holding shares in his or her own right.
For that reason, it would be helpful as a matter of course, if not on a
mandatory basis, if people were able to put on the register their
capacity as trustees.</div>
<a name="06062741000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000523"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> This is a very technical issue, and I hope that I
will deal with it properly. First, hon. Members referred to section 212
procedure, which applies only to public companies. The clause is
concerned with all companies, so that procedure is not necessarily
relevant.</div> <a name="06062741000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
as far as trusts are concerned, the hon. Gentleman said that clause 125
reflects section 360 of the 1985 Act. It is, as he says, very common
for people to make their entry &#147;as trustee&#148;. The effect
of the clause is not to prevent that but to avoid the company having to
consider whether the trust is operating in a proper
way&#151;that is, if any transfer that is made in a trust is
proper.</div><a name="06062741000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000524"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I apologise, as I had not read the clause in
that way. To be clear, is the Minister saying that the clause does not
stop someone mentioning &#147;as trustee&#148; or make that
illegal?</div><a name="06062741000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000525"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No, it does not. It may be helpful to explain that
the clause replaces section 360 of the 1985 Act, which dates
back&#151;the Committee will be amazed at this&#151;to the Joint
Stock Companies Act 1856. That is probably why Opposition Members, who
deal with these things on a day-to-day basis, have not heard of it. I
hope that everyone is familiar with that Act. The intention behind it
is to ensure that a company&#146;s register of members only lists
those who are the legal owners of its shares rather than anyone else
who may have a beneficial interest in them without being the legal
owners.</div> <a name="06062741000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difference between clause 125 and section 360 is simply that it applies
to Northern Ireland as well as to England and Wales and does not apply
to Scotland.</div>
<a name="06062741000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition Members have given
reasons why companies may wish to keep records of beneficial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 233</div>interests in their shares. Indeed, in some circumstances other
provisions in the Bill require them to do so, for example, when they
have information about such interests as a result of serving a notice
under clause 606. However, it is the view of those who drafted the Bill
that it is desirable that any such information is kept separate from
the register of members. In short, we do not see any reason to change
what is a long-established provision of company law. That is why the
clause is in the
Bill.</div><a name="06062741000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000526"></a>Mr.

&#145;fifteen'.</div><a name="06062741000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause relates to section 352(7) of the Companies Act 1985, and reduces
the limitation period from 20 to 10 years. The explanatory notes say
that the reduction was recommended by the company law review. Will the
Minister please explain the rationale for the change and why 10 years
was settled on? Will she also please explain subsection (2)? Are there
lesser periods of limitation that might be relevant? This should be
seen as a probing
amendment.</div><a name="06062741000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000528"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I hope that I can help the hon. Gentleman. The
clause reduces the period for which a company is liable for errors in
its register of members. The reduction is greater by two years than was
originally recommended by the company law review. The current period is
20 years.</div><a name="06062741000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
good reason for reducing the period. In the 2001 report on limitation
of actions, the Law Commission recommended that the long-stop
limitation period for claims for a remedy for a wrong be 10 years, and
on that basis we settled on 10 years in the clause. The Bill provides
that a liability arising from an error in a company&#146;s register
should not be enforceable more than 10 years after the error, whether
it was an error to make an entry or a failure to delete an entry. I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment on that
basis.</div><a name="06062741000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000529"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The right hon. Lady referred to the Law
Commission recommendations to reduce the limitation period of liability
to 10 years. Is she able to clarify why the Law Commission resolved on
reducing it to 10 years? I am not familiar with the report, but it
would be interesting to know the basis on which 10 years was
arrived at, given that it appears to be the underpinning reason for
putting the figure in the
Bill.</div><a name="06062741000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000530"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> There is a lot of shaking of heads. I have no doubt
that there is a good explanation for it. All 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 234</div>we did was follow a principle that had been established elsewhere. If it
does not take too much of my officials&#146; time, I will be happy to
help the hon. Gentleman and will write to him if we manage to get an
answer. However, as this is a DTI matter, I hope that he will bear with
us if we do not spend a lot of time on
it.</div><a name="06062741000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000531"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way
again. The point that I am trying to make is that the reduction from 20
years to 10 is significant, and there may well be good and valid
reasons for it. If the Minister is unable to set them out in Committee,
it would be helpful if we could get clarification later so that we can
understand the rationale for the figure and the basis on which it was
arrived
at.</div><a name="06062741000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000532"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am happy to try to oblige Opposition Members. Of
course, the reduction in the length of time that companies have to keep

welcome the clause as another deregulatory measure in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000535"></a>Margaret

forward.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 235</div><a name="06062741000384"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="06062741000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group of
amendments brings into the Bill the provisions in the 1985 Act that
relate to overseas branch registers. They retain the powers, set out in
clause 128, for regulations to be made on the circumstances in which a
company is to be regarded as keeping an overseas branch register, but
seek to modify the provisions relating to registers of members in their
application to overseas branch registers.</div>
<a name="06062741000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions in the 1985 Act
have been reorganised, with a view to making them clearer. They have
also been updated, so that they fit in with changes made elsewhere in
the Bill. As an example of that, under the 1985 Act one of the criteria
for a company to have an overseas branch register was for its objects
to comprise a transaction of business in one of the relevant countries
or territories. That has been changed in the light of our new rules on
objects in part 3, so that the criterion is now for a company to be
transacting business in the relevant country or territory. Changes made
to part 8 have also been reflected.</div>
<a name="06062741000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments will ensure that
overseas branch registers can continue to be maintained and deemed to
be part of a company&#146;s register of members, so that rules
relating to registers of members apply to
them.</div><a name="06062741000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000536"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I have a couple of points on which I would be
grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments. First, she mentioned that
the purpose of the changes introduced by transporting the remaining
sections from the 1985 Act into the Bill was only to modify the
language, but is it not the case that what she described changes the
meaning of the Act, as well as introducing a modification? If that is
the case, I hope that it is not a sign of things to come. The point is
worth making, because the Minister said that the remaining provisions
to be transported would be moved pretty much in their current
format.</div><a name="06062741000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
Secretary of State has the power under the clause to introduce
regulations on the circumstances in which a register may be kept and to
modify any provision of chapter 2 of the Bill in relation to overseas
branch registers. Do the Government have plans to review the current
regulations relating to the keeping of a branch register, other than
those that the Minister mentioned in connection with the
amendments? If there are such proposals, could she please advise the
Committee on the timetable for them and when the consultation will take
place?</div><a name="06062741000321"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000537"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> To deal with the latter point, there are no plans
to review those regulations. I accept that there are slight changes,
but they are minor differences to ensure consistency with the new
provisions elsewhere in the Bill. That is a sensible way of
consolidating the new legislation, so that it is clear to those who
will have to use
it.</div><a name="06062741000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000538"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have a couple of quick technical points for
the Minister. I note that section 362 of the 1985 Act refers to the
Foreign Jurisdiction Act 1890. As no reference to the 1890 Act appears
in the amending provisions, I presume that it is no longer relevant,
but I would be grateful for her comments.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 236</div><a name="06062741000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, I note that new clause 11
refers to schedule 14 to the 1985 Act and the jurisdictions listed
therein, to which section 362 of that Act also refers. If we are
looking at consolidating the provisions into a single piece of
legislation, would it not be appropriate to ensure that schedule 14 was
stated in the Bill so that there was no further cross-referencing? The
reference in new clause 11 to
the</div><a name="06062741000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;countries and
territories to which paragraph 3 of Schedule 14 to the Companies Act

Chapter&#148;</div><a name="06062741000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">may have been
superseded by the list of countries in new clause 6. I do not know
whether there is a relationship between the two lists. If the Minister
could clarify that, I would be
grateful.</div><a name="06062741000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000539"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000540"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause relates to section 23(1) of the 1985
Act. The Department of Trade and Industry consultation paper asked
whether the prohibition on a subsidiary holding shares in its holding
company should be extended to entities other than a body corporate.
Most respondents stated that there should be an extension, but the
question was raised whether that would be workable in practice, as any
extension would probably require a new set of complex rules. If there
is an extension, it should only be to those entities that the parent
controls&#151;with the problem of defining control. It should not be
so wide as to catch employee share ownership trusts. Can the Minister
confirm whether there have been any developments on that
analysis?</div><a name="06062741000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000541"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Not that I am aware of. Again, this is one of those
clauses with a long history. It dates back to the Trevor <i class="I">v.</i>
Whitworth case in the 19th century, in which the House of Lords held
that a company could not purchase its own shares as that would result
in a reduction in capital. That principle has long been enshrined in
company law. We are dealing with section 143 of the 1985 Act. This
clause is one of a group of clauses that reinforce that rule. The
prohibition is not total because if it were it would make it impossible
for companies to do a number of things that are perfectly
unobjectionable, such as holding shares in their parent companies as
trustees or in the course of a securities dealing business, as
permitted by the second EC company law directive. I am not aware of any
other issues that have been raised with me.</div>

in with section 23(4) of the 1985 Act. Clause 130(2)(b) introduces a
relevant date for Northern Ireland, in relation to when the provisions
came into force. The second half of section 23(4) has been converted
into the provision introducing a restriction on members&#146; use of
their shares to vote on a written resolution. Currently, the
restriction relates just to voting in general meetings when holding
shares as an exception to clause 127, as allowed by the
clause.</div> <a name="06062741000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Hodgson
proposed an amendment in the other place to remove subsection
(1)(a)&#151;an exception to the restriction on a subsidiary being a
member of its holding company. That exception applies to situations
where the shares were bought prior to the relevant date&#151;1 July
1948. It was pointed out that there can be only a handful of situations
in which a subsidiary owns such shares and that those concerned have
been on notice of the prohibition for nearly half a century. Lord
Hodgson proposed that there should be a transitional phase towards
eliminating that historical anomaly&#151;quite rightly, in my
view.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000546"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> This seems to be one of those matters which has us
dancing on the head of a pin. The advice that I have been given by
officials is that there could well be companies that were around before
1948 and that we have no evidence of any implications of retaining the
provision, so why upset the situation that exists? I share much of the
scepticism of Opposition Members, but this is one of those things on
which it appears that it is better to retain the provision in question
just in case, rather than to remove it as redundant. I am happy to
write further to the hon. Gentleman on that very technical issue.
Although I think that hon. Members made good and valid points, that is
my advice.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062741000547"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I just want to remark that several hangovers
from times gone by seem to come up throughout the Bill. The dreaded
issue of stock comes to mind. One cannot help feeling that at a time
when we are clearing up the Companies Acts and moving ahead on a
consolidated basis it would be nice to clear all the junk from the
yard. However, I hear what the Minister says and do not entirely
disagree, and on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062741000342"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
