						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000654"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> Welcome back for the afternoon sitting,
Mr. Cook.</div>
					<a name="07112122000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendment No. 74
replicates the re-release provisions in clause 16 as it stands. In the
light of the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, we
tried to put them into a structure that would be easier for
practitioners to understand. That is not the result of this
morning&#146;s discussion. None the less, I hope that the hon. and
learned Member will accept that we are trying&#151;perhaps very
trying. We are doing our
best.</div>
					<a name="07112122000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions,
which essentially replicate those in the original clause, define three
groups of determinate sentence prisoners for whom different re-release
procedures following recall must apply. The first group is offenders
who are serving a determinate sentence for offences that are neither
violent nor of a sexual nature. We are attempting to ensure that if
such prisoners, having been assessed as not presenting a risk of harm
to the public, are recalled, that will be for a fixed period of up to
28 days, at which point they will automatically be re-released. That is
a significant change from the current arrangements, but in my view it
would ensure that recall would be not a punitive measure but a measure
of protection for the public; it would ensure that the purpose of fixed
term recalls is to remove offenders from often rapidly deteriorating
situations, and place them in secure environments.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>
					<a name="07112122000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The probation
service will have the opportunity to review the supervision
arrangements and, if need be, apply for additional restrictions. The
enforcement of the licence through recall also underlines, for the
offender, the importance of future compliance. I reassure the Committee
that if individuals who are recalled for up to 28 days go out into the
community again and commit further offences or cause further
difficulties while on licence, they will be returned to custody until,
potentially, the end of the sentence, and not for a second fixed term
period.</div>
					<a name="07112122000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
group is of determinate sentence prisoners who are serving a sentence
for crimes of a sexual or violent nature, or who have been assessed as
unsuitable for automatic re-release because they present a risk of
serious harm, or, indeed, have already served one fixed term recall and
as a result are no longer eligible for automatic re-release. The
provisions allow for such prisoners to be re-released through two
possible routes. In the first, the Secretary of State has discretion to
examine the case and determine whether re-release should occur; that
involves determining that the offender is safe to release. The decision
will be taken by the Secretary of State on the basis of up-to-date risk
assessments provided by probation staff. If the Secretary of State is
not satisfied on the matter, there is the option, as there is now, of
the Parole Board. The case of any recall prisoner who remains in
custody for 28 days must be referred to the Parole Board. If neither
the Secretary of State nor the Parole Board is satisfied that it is
safe to re-release the prisoner, he must accordingly remain in
custody.</div>
					<a name="07112122000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third and final category in the amendment, which also replicates the
original clause, is of those sexual or violent offenders who are
serving extended sentences. Such prisoners will be re-released only if
the Parole Board recommends it. If the board does not consider it safe
to re-release them following their recall they can potentially be held
until the end of their sentence.</div>
					<a name="07112122000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are trying to demonstrate
swift and effective enforcement of licence conditions. The figures on
enforcement of licence conditions following breaches of licence show 33
per cent. enforcement in 1997, rising to 91 per cent. in 2006. We need
to manage that in connection with the prison population. The proposals
strike a balance between public protection and ensuring that licence
conditions are met. Government amendments Nos. 75 to 77 are
consequential upon the main amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112122000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">That leads me to the Opposition
amendments tabled by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. In my
view, amendment No. 13 would produce a further step before recall takes
place in requiring prisoners recalled for a fixed term to be referred
to the Crown Court before they can be re-released. That measure is
potentially slow and cumbersome and would add very little to the
process. I will be grateful to hear the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s reasons for that amendment, but if it is designed to
enhance public protection, I reiterate that prisoners serving sentences
for sexual and violent offences are automatically precluded from being
given fixed term recall and that prisoners eligible for fixed term
recall will be subject to the risk assessment conducted by probation
staff that I mentioned earlier. I believe that the probation service is
well placed to assess the level of risk presented by an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div>offender and that it will do a sound job in that regard. The Secretary
of State will also have considerable powers to examine in detail any
assessment showing whether the offender presents a further risk to the
community. I believe that there are adequate safeguards in place to
ensure public protection. It is not in our interests to put public
safety at
risk.</div>
					<a name="07112122000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 138 and 139 would remove the power of the Secretary of State to
re-release a young offender following recall. I recognise that the
provision to re-release recalled prisoners using Executive powers as
opposed to going through the Parole Board is a departure from existing
practice. However, as I have already mentioned, we are keen to refocus
the board&#146;s energies to considering the release and recall of
the most dangerous offenders in the system&#151;those who serve long
terms for sexual and violent offences. In that way, it can provide a
most useful service in protecting the
public.</div>
					<a name="07112122000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 14 would deny the Committee, the House and the Government the
opportunity to amend the number of days that an offender serves on
recall, other than by amending the Act through further primary
legislation. Similarly, amendment No. 85 would remove the associated
order-making power in new section 254A(7) of the Criminal Justice Act
2003.</div>
					<a name="07112122000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The introduction
of fixed term recall provisions is a new initiative. We trailed it in
our paper published on the first day of the Ministry of Justice, 9 May.
As with other provisions, it has the support of not only the previous
Lord Chancellor, but the present Lord Chancellor, my right hon. Friend
the Member for Blackburn (Mr.
Straw).</div>
					<a name="07112122000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07112122000655"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): May I test the
Minister on one aspect of legislation within his Department? He refers
to the Lord Chancellor, who is the Secretary of State for Justice.
However, the legislation refers to &#147;the Secretary of
State&#148;, which, as we know is an interchangeable term between any
Secretary of State and could therefore put this very important power
within the compass of the Secretary of State for the Home Department.
That would place the matter in the executive arm rather than in the
Department of Justice. I wonder why the term Lord Chancellor, which is
still a statutory position that separates its holder from the
run-of-the-mill Secretaries of State, has not been used in this
legislation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000656"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> That is an interesting probing point. In terms of
Pepper <i class="I">v.</i> Hart, I will make some policy on the hoof and say
that, for these purposes, the Secretary of State is the Secretary of
State for Justice and Lord Chancellor. In the event that I find that
that is incorrect, I will write to the hon. Gentleman. That seems to me
to be relatively clear in the circumstances.
</div>
					<a name="07112122000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that with that
point and the hon. Gentleman&#146;s ever helpful smiling
contributions&#151;I think that today&#146;s score is about
2-all&#151;I commend the revised Government amendment to the

							<b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): Sacre
bleu, nom d&#146;un nom, merci beaucoup.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 372</div>
					<a name="07112122000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thank you very much indeed,
Mr. Cook, for inviting me to contribute to the debate on
clause 16. I shall leave it to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome
to deal with amendments Nos. 138 and 139, which deal with the point
about which he spoke this morning&#151;the age of the persons subject
to recall. I shall concentrate briefly on our amendments Nos. 13, 14,
84 and 85, which fit into two
sets.</div>
					<a name="07112122000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">One set deals
with the power of the Secretary of State to make orders amending the
number of days for the time specified in particular new subsections.
Amendment No. 14 deals with the number of days that come under what
was, until the Minister moved his amendment, the provisions on pages 11
and 12 of the Bill. About 40 pages of new amendments were tabled by the
Government at the end of last week, so, not for the first time, they
have come forward with a complete rewrite of the guts of clause 16. If
we read the clause alongside the amendment paper, we would see a
completely different
animal.</div>
					<a name="07112122000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although my
amendments do not now tag on in the same way to the latest set of
Government amendments to clause 16, they allow us to discuss the powers
of the Secretary of State. A moment ago, we heard the Minister claim
reasons of administrative efficiency&#151;he said that if the
Conservative amendment were made, each time that we wanted to change
the number of days we would have to amend the primary legislation.
Well, there is nothing much to worry about if we have to get the
Government to come back to Parliament to ask for permission to do
things.</div>
					<a name="07112122000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000659"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman will know of the
affirmative procedure. Any change made by the Secretary of State in the
number of days would have to come before both Houses of Parliament
anyway.</div>
					<a name="07112122000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000660"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I do know that, but it does not alter the fact
that I find the giving of powers to the Executive&#151;the handing
away from Parliament of the ability to control in an effective way a
Secretary of State&#151;something difficult to live with. Given the
great avalanche of legislation that is coming through, of course we
understand that if we did not give the Secretary of State, of whichever
Department, the power to amend primary legislation, we would be stuck
dealing with statutory instruments or special debates on matters as
detailed as adjusting the number of days that the Secretary of State,
or rather the statute as the Bill will be by then, would apply to a
recalled defendant.</div>
					<a name="07112122000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a matter of principle, we should not always nod through such matters.
In too many cases, we have seen the Secretary of State taking unto
himself powers to alter primary legislation. The affirmative procedure
is better than nothing. I cannot remember whether the right hon.
Gentleman has ever been in the Whips
Office.</div>
					<a name="07112122000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000662"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> They know their trade. If the Minister is trying
to persuade us that the affirmative procedure is an
effective way of holding the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>Government to account, he is still wearing his Whip&#146;s hat and he
ought to get out more. I assure him that there is no better way of
getting what he wants by bundling something upstairs with a short
Committee process, particularly towards Christmas as hon. Members are
busy concerning themselves over all sorts of other things but the
matter in hand.</div>
					<a name="07112122000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not need to expand on the argument; I have made my point and I think
that old subsection (7) and old subsection (10) are just another set of
examples of where we are losing control of the Executive and the
Executive must be kept in check.</div>
					<a name="07112122000614"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07112122000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
amendment No. 13, I want to add to clause 16 as previously
drafted the requirement that a Crown court judge should agree before
someone is released, not before he is recalled. In a sense this is a
slightly fruitless conversation because what I am arguing about will no
longer be part of the Bill if the Government have their way and their
amendment No. 74 is made. However, let us struggle on and see how we
go.</div>
					<a name="07112122000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
section 254A(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
states:</div>
					<a name="07112122000548"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the
Secretary of State is satisfied, on recalling a person to whom this
section applies, that the person will not present a risk of serious
harm to the public if he is released at the end of the period of 28
days beginning with the date on which he is returned to prison, then
subsection (4)
applies.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
13 would insert at the end of that
subsection:</div>
					<a name="07112122000549"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject to
the agreement of a Crown court
judge.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am after some
form of judicial input, so that it is not the Secretary of
State&#151;not a politician or the Executive&#151;who is deciding
when a recalled prisoner should be released. There should be something
outside Government dealing with matters of this sort. That is precisely
why in my amendment I include the board&#151;the Parole
Board&#151;in relation to proposed new section 254B(3) of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003, such that the section would read:
&#147;The Secretary of State must not release a person under
subsection (2) unless the Secretary of State and the Board are
satisfied that it is not necessary for the protection of the public
that he should remain in
prison.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not trying to stop the release of people whom it is appropriate to
release or to prevent the Secretary of State and the judicial system
from recalling for periods limited to 28 days those who have committed
breaches, because I can see that there is good sense in setting a short
return period for those who committed breaches while on licence. What I
do think is important&#151;this is a constitutional point as much as
a point of detail relating to the Bill&#151;is that Secretaries of
State should not have a direct say on whether somebody should be
released or not, whether they are Secretaries of State in the ordinary
sense of that term or whether we are using the term interchangeably
just because the Lord Chancellor happens to be the Secretary of State
for Justice. It should be either the Parole Board or some
quasi-judicial or judicial input that makes the decision.
</div>
					<a name="07112122000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said earlier, this is a slightly unreal discussion
because my amendments relate to a provision that the Government are not
satisfied with themselves. They 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 374</div>have taken it out and put in two and a half pages of their own revisions
under Government amendment No. 74.</div>
					<a name="07112122000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will finish by making one or
two general remarks about the 28-day automatic recall period. I think
that that is sensible, based on the experience of the state of New
York. The recall rules there have been changed in respect of people on
parole who have committed minor acts of misconduct&#151;they might
have had a row with their neighbour in the next-door flat, or there has
been a minor altercation over a parking space but it did not lead to
anything of a serious criminal nature. Under the old rules in the state
of New York, if reported to the police, those people were automatically
recalled to continue to serve their life sentence in custody, and the
prisons were becoming full of people who were perfectly safe but had
had one minor loss of temper, which led to the recall. We do not need
that. My understanding is the position in New York is that the
behaviour of paroled prisoners on licence has improved markedly. The
prisons run more efficiently and humanely as a consequence of not
having a lot of people who are recalled for minor breaches.</div>
					<a name="07112122000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we accept the deal that
people should be recalled only when necessary and if there is a limited
28-day period subject to all the safeguards so that if the man&#151;I
say man because it usually is a man&#151;is a danger to the public,
he will have to serve out a far longer period on recall, I would ask
the Government to do me the deal of allowing the release from recall to
have a far greater judicial input, and not to be a decision made by the
Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="07112122000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need clarification. This is
not a flippant point&#151;it arises from the intervention by the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome about the office of Secretary of State.
Under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which attempted to do away
with the office of Lord Chancellor, and the guarantee that was
negotiated between the then Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, and the then
Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, the holder of the office of Lord
Chancellor is statutorily required to maintain and safeguard the
independence of the judiciary.</div>
					<a name="07112122000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately, the Lord
Chancellor is also the Secretary of State for Justice. Wearing that
hat, he has a big spending budget and huge budgetary restraints are
rained down upon him. Every time that we have a discussion about prison
accommodation or capacity, that fact becomes increasingly apparent.
However, at the same time, that same individual office holder has to
protect the independence of the judiciary, and through various forms of
semaphore and direct speech, the judges are being told to be careful
about sending people to prison because the prisons are full.</div>
					<a name="07112122000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not care what the right
hon. Member for Blackburn calls himself, either in front of his shaving
mirror or when addressing his Ministers. I know, because I have teased
him about it, that he rather enjoys being called not only Lord
Chancellor, but Lord High Chancellor. He loves wearing the official
state robes. I do not deny him the joy of wearing those
robes&#151;perhaps one day not too far away they will be worn by a
Conservative. There is another debate to be had about the importance of
uniforms and the separation of the individual and the office holder.
However, whether the current Secretary of State for Justice and Lord
High Chancellor enjoys being called 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>this, that or the other does not matter. What is
essential, is that he separates in his mind his role as a spending
political Minister, and his role as the protector of the independence
of the judiciary. It is possible to do that, and it is essential that
he does it under the current regime. However, it is increasingly
difficult for the public to have confidence that he is doing it if, at
the same time as being the Secretary of State who deals with prisoners
on recall and releases them after 28 days to ease prison capacity
problems, he does something that I suggest should more properly be done
by the judiciary&#151;controlling the sentencing and sentence plan of
those who have been sentenced by the courts.</div>
					<a name="07112122000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">That will do for now, I think.
I look forward to hearing from others who have something to contribute.
</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000663"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> It was perhaps a mistake for me to have intervened,
as it enabled the hon. and learned Member for Harborough to say most of
what I was intending to say on the subject of the persona of the Lord
High Chancellor. It is an important distinction. When we allow the
Executive quasi-judicial powers, we must be careful and clear what we
are talking about. There are some responsibilities of the Secretary of
State for Justice in his capacity as Lord Chancellor which are
inalienable, and which should not be available to other Secretaries of
State. I say that simply because there is a statutory duty on the Lord
Chancellor, and on his position as set out in the Constitutional Reform
Act 2005.</div>
					<a name="07112122000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
good example of one of those matters that should rest not with a
common-or-garden Secretary of State, but with one who is charged with
maintaining the interests of justice, and that is the role of the Lord
Chancellor. It so happens that the Secretary of State and the Lord
Chancellor are the same person, and that is fine. I do not have a
problem with that. In legislation, however, it is helpful to make that
distinction. Although my interjection may have appeared to be a
debating point, it was slightly more serious. Where we intend the
Secretary of State for Justice to take on a quasi-judicial role, it is
helpful to specify the Lord Chancellor in statute for those purposes,
so that we have no confusion and to remind everyone of the
responsibilities
involved.</div>
					<a name="07112122000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to say a few words about amendments Nos. 138 and 139, which stand in my
name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge and which have
been subscribed to by the Conservatives. They brings us back to the
issue of how we treat children and people under the age of
18.</div>
					<a name="07112122000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his opening
remarks, the Minister said that he wanted the Parole Board to
concentrate on the most difficult cases, where there was concern for
public safety. I suggest is another area in which the Parole Board can
be usefully engaged&#151;where the person under recall is a
vulnerable person himself. I suggest that young people fall into that
category. This morning, we had a consensual discussion on the needs of
young people within the penal system and our desire to keep as many as
possible out of our prisons. One would assume from that that it is
necessary to stop them returning to prison, as far as possible. If that
is the case, having the assessment by the Parole Board seems to be a
useful safeguard that would ensure that young 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>people were not incarcerated additionally any more than is absolutely
necessary for the purposes of the operation of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07112122000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleading a special case
for the young person. The existing arrangements work reasonably well
with regard to young people. I see why the Government are proposing the
clause and do not argue against it as a whole, but I am saying that
young people are a special case and asking the Minister to at least
consider the possibility of pursuing the issue at a later
stage.</div>
					<a name="07112122000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000664"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I thank the hon. and learned Member for Harborough
and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome for their support for the
principle of fixed term recall. I am grateful, because I expected some
political discussion around those issues, and I appreciate that they
have made a judgment on that. The experiences in New York that the hon.
and learned Gentleman described are apt.</div>
					<a name="07112122000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">With had that element of
consensus, we have discussed the amendments before the Committee. The
hon. and learned Gentleman raised the possibility of some form of
judicial oversight or involvement in the decision-making process,
rather than simply leaving it to the Secretary of State. The reason
that we have not taken that route is simply one of scale and scope with
regard to the determinations to date. I estimate the number of fixed
term recalls that can be expected to happen in any one year to be
approximately
4,500.</div>
				
					<a name="07112122000615"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07112122000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I were to
accept the amendment tabled by the hon. and learned Gentleman, those
4,500 cases might well have to go through the judicial process, which
would add a significant burden to the work of the courts. During the
discussions that we have had to date on this subject, I believe it has
been shown that, regarding the cases that we have
addressed&#151;those of sexual or violent offenders&#151;the
Secretary of State has the ability to exercise discretion
accordingly.</div>
					<a name="07112122000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000665"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> If the Minister is going to have 4,500 people
recalled for up to 28 days during a given year, does he anticipate that
they will be recalled into category B, category C or category D
prisons, or a mixture of all three? How will he make that assessment?
Will the decision be made simply on the basis of the spaces available,
on the basis of the original crime, or on the basis of the conduct that
led to the 28-day recall?</div>
					<a name="07112122000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000666"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> We have to make risk assessments on all those
matters, which are dependent on the reason for the recall, the
activities involved and the advice that we receive in the first place
about the level of risk in relation to the prisoner and the recall. So,
there would be a range of mechanisms whereby individuals could be
recalled to a range of prisons, based on the risk assessment that was
undertaken at the time.</div>
					<a name="07112122000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s amendment seeks to have judicial involvement in that
process of risk assessment. I suggest that that would place a
significant burden on the courts, which the proposals before the
Committee would avoid while still giving protection to the public, as
there is a risk assessment of different categories of prisoner on
recall. That would apply even 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>within the first 28-day recall option for prisoners and on a second
recall. There are opportunities for consideration
accordingly.</div>
					<a name="07112122000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of parliamentary
oversight and the delegation of powers to the Secretary of State is
important. I value, as any Member of Parliament would, the rights of
Parliament. For goodness&#146; sake, I spent five years in
opposition&#151;that is not as long as you spent in opposition in
another role, Mr. Cook. Therefore, I know how important it
is to have parliamentary oversight of the Executive, having spent a lot
of time trying to secure
that.</div>
					<a name="07112122000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposals for a
change to the amount of time on a recall would be subject to the
affirmative procedure. I accept that I am a former Government
Whip&#151;in fact, I am the Whip who lost the former Member for
Caerphilly during his sojourn, so my whipping credentials might not be
that strong. Nevertheless, as a former Whip, I appreciate that there
will still be debates in this House and in another place under the
affirmative procedure. In those debates, I could not take for granted
the votes of my right hon. and hon. Friends, and I certainly could not
take for granted the votes of Members of another place. In another
place, my party&#151;and, indeed, the party of the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough, were it to form a Government&#151;would not
have an overall majority. There are parliamentary and legislative
safeguards with regard to this matter, and I hope that the hon. and
learned Gentleman will be reassured by
them.</div>
					<a name="07112122000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
138 and 139 would remove the power of the Secretary of State to
re-release following recall a young offender who had either been deemed
unsuitable for a fixed term recall, or who was ineligible for such a
recall because he was serving a sentence for a specified offence. Once
again, I will reflect on what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome
has said, but I will also reflect on what I have said to the Committee
to date, which is that the purpose of these provisions is to help to
refocus the Parole Board on what I believe it should be doing: looking
at the parole needs of serious, dangerous, violent and sexual
offenders, and considering the recall of the most dangerous offenders
in the system. It is important that the Parole Board focuses on those
issues, because, in my view&#151;the Under-Secretary of State for
Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston, who deals
with many of these matters, would agree&#151;the Parole Board is
heavily burdened at the moment by a lot of work that could be done
elsewhere just as effectively, efficiently and appropriately.</div>
					<a name="07112122000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Opposition
amendments will not be pressed and that, given the consensus on the
broad thrust of the new clause, which is essentially the old clause
made simpler, there will be common acceptance by the Committee of the
need for the changes on recall.

Parole Board. He seems to be going the other way with clause 18 and
taking away from the Parole Board any power to intervene in these
matters. I am not going to detain the Committee long on this amendment
because my argument broadly mirrors those that I made about the

face-to-face interviews in prisons with offenders wishing to apply for
release following consideration of their cases by the board. We all
know that the number of cases that it has to deal with on paper only is
growing. Although, to some extent, the Government have reversed the
mistake that they made in taking away the resources that allowed the
Parole Board to have more face-to-face interviews, the position is
still pretty parlous. However, all of those inefficiencies and mistakes
do not permit the Government to take unto their own hands the power
that they wish to have under clause
18.</div>
					<a name="07112122000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I draw
a comparison between clauses 17 and 18 because the influences seem to
be going in different directions. Under clause 16, the Secretary of
State wants not only to decide for himself what goes on, but to have
the power to change the number of days of the automatic recall. I think
that the arguments have been adequately described both now and on
another occasion. I hope that the Minister can satisfy me that this
clause, if it is not amended, is a good one.</div>

							<a name="07112122000668"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I rise briefly to agree entirely with the arguments
made by the hon. and learned Gentleman. The Minister said earlier that
he wanted the Parole Board to concentrate on the most serious cases.
Well, this is the most serious case in terms of a restriction in
liberty. This is the revocation of a licence given to a person under an
indeterminate sentence. It should have at least a degree of judicial
oversight. I believe that a judge should take the decision, but I am
prepared to accept a decision taken by the Lord Chancellor in
conjunction with a judge. I find it difficult to accept purely a
decision of the Executive effectively to deprive a person of his
liberty, sine die, on grounds given by an elected Minister, rather than
through a judicial process. I thus support the view expressed by the
hon. and learned
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="07112122000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000669"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> Again, I hope that there is an element of
commonality between both Front Benches in the sense that I, too, want
to ensure that the decisions taken are correct and proper, and that a
potential offender who will lose their liberty has the right to have
their case reviewed later. Under the clause, all recalled offenders are
entitled to be notified of the reasons for their recall and to see
material on which that recall decision is based. Their case will also
be referred to the independent Parole Board so that the recall can be
reviewed, and the Parole Board has the power to direct that such
prisoners are immediately
re-released.</div>
					<a name="07112122000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question arising from the amendment is whether a Lord Chief Justice, or
a judge appointed by him, should authorise the recall of life-sentence
prisoners before that process occurs. In my opinion&#151;I accept
that it is only my judgment&#151;the possibility for that judicial
oversight before the recall occurs would cause delay and, perhaps, some
great difficulties in managing the system. It could also put the public
at risk.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000670"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I would not prevent a potential offender from
being arrested and held in custody while the matter was considered, but
something more than simply the Secretary of State&#146;s signature is
needed. We should bear in mind that the relevant person will not
actually be the Secretary of State. As in the old Home Office days, a
designated Minister in the Department will have responsibility for this
aspect of implementation. He or she will be advised by a host of
lawyers and civil servants, so the decision will be made deep in the
recesses of bureaucracy. The Minister will have to stand up and defend
this in Parliament if things go wrong, but this will be very much a
bureaucratic and administrative decision. We are moving the criminal
justice system further and further away from judicial oversight or
involvement.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000671"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> This might not be the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s intention, but I should be very interested to know
the basis on which a prisoner could be recalled and held in custody
while waiting for a judge to authorise that recall in the scenario that
he describes. We need to look at those issues, but he says that the
recall could be authorised, and an individual could be taken off the
streets, because they were a risk or had broken the terms of their
licence, and that they could be put in a police cell to await the
sitting of a High Court judge or the Lord Chief Justice to authorise
that recall to prison.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>
					<a name="07112122000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under our current proposals,
that recall can occur. It is immediate. It removes the offender from
whatever place of safety they may be in, for the good of either the
public or themselves, and may relate to any offences that they might
have committed. It allows Parole Board oversight of the decision
subsequently.</div>

					<a name="07112122000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Gentleman&#146;s amendment would include a provision, which
may be helpful or not, for the judiciary to examine the relevant
issues. However, such a procedure would be bureaucratic, slow and may
involve the judiciary having to sit at evenings, weekends or different
times of the week to have oversight to ensure that those recalls
occur&#151;and recalls are often undertaken speedily. For those
reasons, I am happy to reflect on judicial involvement, because we can
always have discussions about such matters, but I am satisfied that
there is sufficient public safeguard for the public and the judicial
system in having the decision about the potentially recalled offender
overseen by the Parole Board, post recall
occurring.</div>

						</b> Most recalls are already undertaken using
emergency powers. My assessment&#151;again, this a matter of
judgment&#151;is that the proposal for the Lord Chief Justice or a
judge appointed to authorise the recall of life sentence prisoners
would inevitably mean delay and additional work for the courts and,
potentially, no swift return of dangerous, violent prisoners to
complete their sentences if their behaviour caused concern. I am making
that judgment and simply saying to the Committee that safeguards are in
place. On that basis, I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to ask leave
to withdraw his

						</b> I shall put the Minister out of his misery: I
will ask the Committee&#146;s leave to withdraw my amendment, but I
want to ask him a question. First, he reckons that we are talking about
some 4,500 likely offenders a year being recalled for breaching their
licences, which is fewer than the number who apply to the Parole Board
for early release from prison on
licence.</div>
					<a name="07112122000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
judges like to get a good night&#146;s sleep, just like anybody else,
but I assure the Minister that judges are available 24 hours a day, in
the criminal and civil jurisdictions, to deal with cases that need to
be dealt with immediately as a matter of urgency. They can be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>got out of bed, contacted via the telephone and got off the golf course,
if necessary, to reach a decision that they have to take, so we need
not worry too much about their being disturbed in that sense. However,
we do need to worry about Ministers encroaching on the powers of the
criminal justice system beyond their constitutional rights as elected
Ministers. Although we do not have a formal constitution&#151;our
constitution is not written in one document, but in lots of different
places and in various conventions, and so forth&#151;we understand
the separation of
powers.</div>
					<a name="07112122000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that,
very often, for reasons of convenience, be it administrative, executive
or otherwise, the boundaries between the Executive and the judiciary
and the legislature are blurred. However, every now and then we ought
to recognise that those separations exist for a purpose: to protect us,
to enhance the rule of law and to control the Government, otherwise we
are wasting our time. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

						</b> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I want
to make a suggestion now so that you have a while to consider it before
reaching a decision. Government new clause 29 appears on the amendment
paper for consideration under clause 26. However, new clause 28, which
deals with the powers of the Court of Appeal criminal division, is not
grouped with amendments under clause 26. Presumably, it will be dealt
with separately after clause 129 as one of the new clauses listed on
page 3 of the amendment paper. It is entirely a matter for you,
Mr. Cook, but you might find it more convenient to have the
new clause 28 debate, which fits in with clause 26, when we discuss
that clause rather than at the end. I simply make that suggestion and
invite your opinion on it in due course.</div>

that might be a question for another Chairman at our next sitting. The

at the moment it is questionable whether the Minister has papers
prepared that far forward. We do not need to come to that proposal yet,

No. 21 provides the clarification that his amendment seeks, namely that
an offender may be given a referral order if he has previously been

David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): I am grateful
for the Minister&#146;s acknowledgement of our foresight and
diligence in tabling the amendment, which has been followed dutifully
by the Government, as in other policy areas. I do not wish to split
hairs on amendments Nos. 21 and 140, which are very similar, and
although ours is clearer and simpler, I would not wish to divide the
Committee on the
words.</div>
					<a name="07112122000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 141 takes things a stage further. It does not deal just with the
issue that was the subject of the previous amendments in allowing the
flexibility and extension of referral orders to cover those cases when
a defendant has been convicted on a previous occasion. We seek to allow
a situation where, with a defendant who has had a referral order made
against him in respect of a previous conviction, the court is enabled
to decide in the particular circumstances whether to extend a further
referral order. That often occurs in the youth courts where, sadly,
referral orders are sometimes not implemented for weeks or months after
the first visit with the youth offending team outside court and the
defendant can commit another offence and come back before the court.
The court is often proscribed from allowing a further referral order to
be imposed even though the intent behind the order might
work.</div>
					<a name="07112122000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are cases
where it would be thoroughly inappropriate to impose another referral
order: the defendant has had their chance to be diverted away from the
criminal justice system and they should not have an additional
opportunity, but there are instances where a defendant has committed
another minor offence or one unrelated to the original one that was
subject to the referral order.</div>
					<a name="07112122000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Maybe there are circumstances
where the referral order has not had its true impact on the defendant
for reasons that may not be their fault, where it should be open to the
court to have the flexibility to impose an additional referral order
or, indeed, an extension. Amendment No. 141 seeks to provide for that
and allow the insertion of an extra subsection to say that:</div>

							<a name="07112122000683"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> Amendment No. 141 would allow, as the hon. Member
for Enfield, Southgate has just indicated, the award of a second
referral order, if that has been recommended by the youth offending
team, an officer of the probation team, or a social worker from a local
authority.</div>
					<a name="07112122000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
wish to see referral orders used for a second time, for reasons that I
shall outline to him. If a young person has reoffended, they have
failed the referral process and not taken the opportunity that has been
given to them to correct their behaviour at the first referral order.
The referral order principle works on the basis of restorative justice,
with the offender being made to face up to the effect that their
offence has on others, taking responsibility for their actions, and
making restoration to their victims. We have deliberately designed the
sentence to be targeted at those who receive a court sentence for the
first time, where they plead guilty. Pleading guilty demonstrates an
acknowledgement of the events and is an indicator that the young person
is suitable for the restorative justice approach, in terms of facing up
to their offences and talking to their
victims.</div>
					<a name="07112122000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
extending the referral order to be available on second conviction, if
not used previously, because those people have not had the opportunity
to undergo the referral process. I must say to the hon. Gentleman that
the purpose of the youth rehabilitation order that we have put in place
is, under the terms of the Bill, the next stage in relation to a failed
referral order, and I ask him to reflect on that and to withdraw his
amendments, and I ask the Committee to accept the Government
amendment.</div>

that the defendant has committed a further
offence.</div>
					<a name="07112122000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can think
of a number of circumstances where the referral order has not had any
real impact beyond the first meeting at court, there has been no real
implementation and the restorative appointments have not taken place.
In a sense, the failure of the order has not necessarily been the fault
of the defendant, when it is subject to the recommendation of the very
people who perhaps know best: the youth offending team, the local
probation team or a social worker. The point of the amendment was to
allow flexibility to the court, so I would like the Minister to
consider such exceptional examples where a referral order before the
court has not necessarily totally failed, because it has not really
started. The amendment would allow flexibility in those circumstances
even though a further offence has been committed.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div>
					<a name="07112122000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the Minister is
willing, by implication, within the clause, to give a second
opportunity to those who have previously been convicted to be diverted
from the system, the amendment could extend a second opportunity to
those in respect of whom the referral order has not had its full
impact. I do not wish to press the amendment to a vote, but ask the
Minister to reflect on the
matter.</div>

							<a name="07112122000689"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> The intent of the referral orders is primarily
to divert young offenders from the criminal justice system and that is
welcome. If they are fully implemented and funded, including all of the
restorative 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div>elements and the whole package, they will work. Moving young offenders
away from the criminal justice system must be to everyone&#146;s
benefit.</div>
					<a name="07112122000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
concern that there should be appropriate flexibility, as proposed in
new clauses 7 and 15. New clause 7 would substitute for the compulsory
element within the referral orders the discretion that was sought in
the evidence sessions by the Magistrates Association, which said that,
particularly in relation to high-end offences, it would like the
flexibility not to use referral orders. That is not proposed in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112122000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently, a
referral order must be given for the first offence when an offender
pleads guilty and the offence is imprisonable. The only alternative
that applies to very serious offences is custody. That is the concern.
There are cases of robbery where the term is not sufficient to warrant
being referred to the Crown court. There are offences of serious sexual
assault that could be determined to come within the youth court
jurisdiction. When dealing with a defendant who has no previous
convictions and who pleads guilty at the first opportunity for such
serious high-end offences, the courts do not have the discretion to
decide whether to propose a
referral.</div>
					<a name="07112122000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts
are often left in the invidious position of having to decide whether to
impose a referral order or a custodial sentence. They may be reluctant
to impose a custodial sentence and want the discretion to impose a
substantial community order. That is not available to them under the
Bill. The flexibility that magistrates would properly want when dealing
with that high-end penalty is not available. These new clauses would
provide that necessary discretion to enable magistrates to deal with
penalties in an appropriate manner, particularly for serious crimes.
That flexibility would avoid the inevitable step that we have talked
about in earlier debates of an increase in the population of young
offenders in detention. The new clauses would allow the magistrates
another weapon in their armoury to stop the defendant reoffending,
whereas custodial sentences often do not have that effect. I invite the
Minister to consider them and the point about flexibility that the
Magistrates Association quite properly made.</div>
					<a name="07112122000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will also deal with the practical aspect of referral
orders. I have said previously that there is concern that many referral
orders are not implemented in a timely fashion, and that the additional
referral orders that will be an inevitable result of the Bill will lead
to costs. The impact assessment states that those costs will be offset
by a reduction in reconviction rates, but will the Minister provide
more details of that assumption? There will inevitably be costs, and
the concern is that they need to be properly built into the system to
enable youth offending teams fully to implement referral
orders.</div>
					<a name="07112122000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that the Youth Justice Board is considering referral orders in relation
to the roll-out of restorative programmes, which will all cost money if
we are to give true effect to referral orders. There is concern that
that must come to fruition&#151;the additional referral orders need
to be properly funded. Another matter on which a good opportunity is
often not taken is rehabilitation for those with drug and alcohol
addictions. Often, developing a youth offender from the criminal
justice system requires proactive and immediate attention and treatment
for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>such addictions. That does not happen, because of the paucity of
adolescent services. It is important that the Government take that on
board if they want to give true effect to the good intentions behind
referral
orders.</div>
					<a name="07112122000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000690"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I thank the hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate for his new clauses. I shall deal first with new clause 15,
which would provide the courts with a power to extend a referral order
for up to three months. There is some merit in that proposal, and I am
happy to examine it in detail. As I have said, an order should be
subject to a maximum 12-month time limit, but within that there is the
potential for it to be extended for up to three months for failure to
comply or when it is impractical for the child or young person to
comply. There is an argument, and the hon. Gentleman has made it, that
there should be some flexibility, particularly if circumstances are
beyond the control of the young person, to prevent them from completing
the contract in the initial term. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press
new clause 15 on the basis that I shall consider it in detail and see
whether we can bring forward something that meets his objective
positively.</div>
					<a name="07112122000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
7, as the hon. Gentleman said, addresses a concern
raised in oral evidence by the Magistrates Association, which was
concerned about the compulsory conditions applying to referral orders.
Its view was that, for more serious first offences to which the
defendant pleads guilty, it should be open to the court to give a youth
rehabilitation order with robust requirements rather than make the
required referral order. The hon. Gentleman eloquently put that case
again.</div>
					<a name="07112122000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a referral
order is made, the young offender must agree a programme of action with
a youth offender panel to form a youth offender contract, which may
include such things as paying compensation, attending mediation
sessions with a victim, carrying out unpaid work or participating in
specified activities such as those that assist a young person to deal
with drug or alcohol abuse. In short, the referral order is in place to
deliver a restorative justice approach through a consideration of not
just the causes of difficulties but how reparations can be made and
mediation undertaken, based on offenders engaging with the court
process for the first time. Restorative justice can be effective for
young offenders who have not previously thought about the impact of
their offending behaviour on others and the communities in which they
live and work. I strongly appreciate that courts do not like to have
their discretion fettered, but I believe that we have a strong case for
the referral order to be maintained in its current position. It
currently has the lowest reconviction rate of all juvenile sentences,
at just over 44 per cent. It is an effective use of reparation for the
prevention of reoffending, and I want to continue to provide that
option for all those who qualify.</div>
					<a name="07112122000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The terms of
the contract can be robust and the penal power of that is strong. There
is an opportunity for the case to be referred back to court for
resentencing if the young offender fails to comply, but I believe that
it is currently in the right place, and I support the position of the
referral order on the face of the Bill. With those few comments, I hope
that the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate can accept my kind offer to
look at new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>clause 15, but I ask him to withdraw both new clauses for the reasons
that I have
outlined.</div>
					<a name="07112122000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000691"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his kind
offer&#151;I am always interested in considering kind offers from
anyone, but whether I accept them is another issue. In relation to new
clause 15, I am certainly willing to accept the offer to deal with the
issue of flexibility. In a sense, that is the second bite of the cherry
and relates to the wonderful amendment No. 141, which I was not able to
move. The new clause provides the opportunity for flexibility in those
instances when the referral order has not been able to be properly
implemented. Therefore, I welcome the Minister&#146;s indication and,
in that regard, do not wish to press the new clause to a
vote.</div>
					<a name="07112122000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
the Minister to reflect further on new clause 7 and on the
circumstances that the magistrates have outlined to us in Committee and
which others have seen in many youth courts. Magistrates often feel
obliged, given the seriousness of an offence, to move towards the
custodial option. Given the concern about the ever-rising prison
population, it is important to take seriously magistrates&#146;
concerns that these offences are dealt with more often than not by way
of a custodial option and not a referral order&#151;we have already
looked at ways by which that could be stemmed and the high rate of
custodial sentences can be
reduced</div>
					<a name="07112122000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a
magistrate&#146;s mind, it is not in the interests of justice or the
public to deal a referral order for a serious case, such as sexual
assault or robbery, through a referral order; if the defendant complies
with that order fully, their conviction would effectively be spent and
it will not be on the record. As far as the magistrates will be
concerned, the defendant would basically be getting off for a serious
offence. They often consider such an offence differently from those
less serious cases that can properly be dealt with through a referral
order. I do not wish to press the new clause to a vote or take any more
time, but I invite the Minister to look at those particular
circumstances and how those concerns can be alleviated.</div>

							<a name="07112122000694"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I do not propose to take too much of the
Committee&#146;s time on these amendments, whose purpose is to probe
the Government on the figures that they have chosen, which are
essentially to provide an alternative to a requirement of 40 hours of
unpaid work and substitute 20 where there has been a breach of a
community
order.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000696"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> That is quite right. The point of the amendments
is to consider a sliding scale and whether that minimum could be set on
the sliding scale between 20 and 50. Without getting too wrapped up in
the individual numbers, could there be more flexibility explicit in the
Bill to ensure that magistrates do not feel that they have to work to a
prescribed level when dealing with a breach of a community order? That
is the point of the amendments.</div>
					<a name="07112122000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn now to the stand
part debate. The concern is about dealing with defendants who have
breached the community order and the need to impose an unpaid work
requirement. Such people, who would no doubt often have a
rehabilitation order imposed on them rather than a community punishment
order, may not be suitable for unpaid work when that order is made.
They might have health issues, or they may be an addict whose probation
officer has determined that they are unsuitable for unpaid work. They
would come before the magistrates after breaching the community order
and, on the face of it, would not be eligible for the imposition of
unpaid work. The concern is about whether the clause would impose an
inappropriate sentence on those defendants.</div>
					<a name="07112122000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also like the Minister
to consider the question of flexibility. Magistrates might often want,
not always as a matter of compulsion, to impose an additional penalty
when there is a breach. Will the Minister also consider the unusual
circumstances in which an order might break down through no fault of
the defendant beyond a technical non-compliance? There might be a need
to consider discretion.</div>

							<a name="07112122000697"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have not often
departed from much of what he has had to say. It
seems, however, that his amendments would do the
opposite of what he hopes that they would achieve. Do they not reduce
the discretion available to the court by inserting a higher figure for
the minimum work requirement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div>that the magistrates court can impose? Perhaps I have misread the
provisions of the original clause, but that was certainly the
impression that I was
given.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000698"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I am grateful for the
intervention, which enables me to clarify. The purpose of the
amendment, which could perhaps be better drafted, is to ensure
flexibility in the numbers for the hours of unpaid work that are
available. I wanted to draw out a comment from the Minister about why
the Government have settled on 20 as a minimum, rather than another
number, and to make the more general point about the suitability of
such an order in some
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07112122000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000699"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> The clause attempts to set the minimum
number of hours that may be imposed as a penalty when
an offender breaches a community order. At the moment, the minimum
figure is 40 hours. The Bill would set a minimum of 20 hours, while the
amendments range from 20 to 50, which is above the above the current
minimum.</div>
					<a name="07112122000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
minimum of 40 hours that can be imposed as a penalty is, in some cases,
too severe a response. I have attempted to take the approach that a
minimum of 20 hours will be examined by the courts in the event of a
breach. There is a precedent for 20 hours. Section 300 and schedule 31
of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 allow unpaid work of at least 20 hours
to be imposed for fine default as an alternative to committal to
prison. We have tried to establish that baseline, linked to the
2003 Act.</div>
					<a name="07112122000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would replace
the proposed 20 hours with a larger figure. In some cases, they would
increase the current minimum of 40 hours and, in others, they would
decrease it. I believe that 20 hours is a fair minimum. It could
obviously be increased at the discretion of the sentencers. The new
minimum will be a far better figure in terms of the fairness of the
penalty than the current minimum of 40 hours.</div>
					<a name="07112122000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are attempting to examine
this in detail and the current minimum applies only to those community
orders that do not already have an unpaid work requirement. Where there
is such a requirement, there is no minimum to the amount of unpaid work
that may be added for the breach. The danger is that, where a court
feels that adding 40 hours is too much, it may instead resentence the
offender, possibly even to a short period of custody. My intention is
reduce the minimum to 20 hours. I ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect on
whether he wants to have a different minimum and whether in reality he
wants to increase the minimum from 40 hours to 50 hours. Having got to
know him over the last few weeks, I suspect that he would not wish to
do that. I urge him to accept our minimum of 20 hours and withdraw his
amendment
accordingly.</div>

							<a name="07112122000700"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> Having heard the rationale for 20 hours, I will
not press the amendment. However, I ask the Minister to respond at some
point to our concerns about the imposition of unpaid work requirements
on those defendants who have already been found not to be suitable for
such unpaid work, which led to the original imposition of a
rehabilitation order. There is a concern that this order should not set
up claimants to fail. That important flexibility is needed within the
system. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

Eagle:
						</b> It is quite a relief after this length of time
finally to be able to welcome you to the Chair, Mr.
Cook. You have been here for some time and I feel
that I have neglected the courtesies, as it were. It is only because I
have not managed to get to my feet yet. Now that I am on my feet, it
might be some time before my right hon. Friend the Minister of State,
Ministry of Justice and my hon. Friend the Home Office Minister get to
do their bit. None the less, the theatrical profession always thinks
that delayed entrances have something to be said for them. We will just
have to see whether the Committee agrees with that by the time we get
to the end of this group of amendments. At least I hope that the
Committee will be glad that we have managed to move up a group. I hope
that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough is happy to acknowledge
that we are trying to be as flexible as possible even if all of our
notes are not always available.</div>
					<a name="07112122000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of these amendments,
the Committee will recall the extensive debate about quashing
convictions at the beginning of the Public Bill procedure. Indeed an
extensive amount of consultation and thought went 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div>into those areas long before either I or my right hon. Friend came into
the Department. None the less, with Government amendment No. 207, which
I am pleased to be able to move, we are now able to come to the
Government&#146;s considered view of how we ought to go forward. I
look forward to debating with members of the Committee and others to
see whether they think that we have got it right and also to dealing
with the other amendments that have been tabled to deal with these
issues.</div>
					<a name="07112122000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
policy that clause 26 seeks to reflect is that it is not right that the
Court of Appeal should be obliged to quash convictions as unsafe
because of procedural irregularities when there is no doubt that the
appellant was guilty of the offence. That is the mischief that we are
trying to deal with in respect of these points. Our objective is to
ensure that the appellant&#146;s right to due process of law does not
automatically override the need to ensure that appellants who are
plainly guilty remain convicted. As the Secretary of State for Justice
and Lord Chancellor said on Second Reading, such a change requires only
a small adjustment to the law. We are not seeking to imply any
criticism of the Court of Appeal. His statement on Second Reading
reflected a change of view by the Government in that we agree on
reflection that the convention exception, which is currently in new
subsection (1B) as it stands, does not go far enough in providing that
extra protection. We need to ensure that new subsection (1A) does not
prevent the court from allowing an appeal even when the
appellant&#146;s guilt is not in doubt and when there has been
serious misconduct by the investigating or prosecuting authorities. It
is with that aim in mind that we have tabled Government amendment No.
207.</div>
					<a name="07112122000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 207 amends new subsections (1A) and (1B). The revised
version of new subsection (1B) ensures that the Court of Appeal retains
a discretion to allow an appeal if it thinks that it would seriously
undermine the proper administration of justice to allow the conviction
to stand. That is a change from the current wording that the Committee
members will see in the Bill as published.</div>
					<a name="07112122000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 207 provides for
a wider exception than the published new subsection (1B) in the Bill,
so it impinges more upon the operation of new subsection (1A). We
believe, however, that that will cover all the circumstances that will
be caught by the existing convention exception as it is set out in new
subsection (1B) in the Bill, but it will go further, allowing
convictions to be quashed when there has been serious misconduct by the
investigating or prosecuting authorities, and we are back to the
Mullen-type cases that we had a debate about earlier.

Eagle:
						</b> There is no doubt about the fact that it is a small
number of cases. They are the kind of cases that can significantly
damage the reputation of the criminal justice system as a whole if they
are allowed to proceed as they have in the past with convictions of the
plainly and incontrovertibly guilty being quashed at a later date. As I
said at the beginning of my remarks, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>that is the mischief that the clause and these
amendments to the clause seek to address. That has been the case all
the way through the consultations that have taken place, resulting in
the clause as it was originally drafted and in the changes that we are
now proposing.</div>
					<a name="07112122000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
not a question of there being thousands of cases affected by this
issue. Only a small number of cases are affected, but they are cases
that, if they are allowed to stand&#151;as the current law suggests
they would&#151;could do a disproportionate amount of damage to the
reputation of the criminal justice
system.</div>
				
					<a name="07112122000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000706"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> On the subject of the number of cases, the
consultation paper on the regulatory impact
assessment for quashing convictions says that the potential number of
individual convictions affected before the new amendments will be very
small, probably fewer than 20 each year. If the new amendments are
made, would even fewer cases be
affected?</div>
					<a name="07112122000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000707"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> The new amendments would give the Court a wider
discretion than was the case in the Bill originally. So it would be for
the judges and justices to consider the individual circumstances of the
cases that come up. Nevertheless, a small number of cases would be
affected&#151;perhaps fewer than 20 or slightly more. However, given
that the discretion is wider, it would be for the judges to decide, in
the appropriate circumstances, whether to quash a conviction, even
though the person is plainly guilty, or whether they feel that that
conviction can still stand. In any event, we are talking about a small
number of cases, but cases that, as I have said, can do a great deal of
damage to the reputation of the criminal justice system if they
continue. If we did not believe that to be the case, we would not seek
to make the changes that are in the clause and we would not have had
the consultations that we have.</div>
					<a name="07112122000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 207 would also
replace new subsection (1A). The revised version is designed to clarify
that the Court of Appeal is a court of review, which we all know it is,
and is not required to decide afresh whether it is satisfied of the
appellant&#146;s guilt. So, instead of the test used in the present
subsection&#151;that the Court is satisfied that the appellant is
guilty, which might give rise to the view that it has to retry the case
or be satisfied of the facts, as was the first instance
court&#151;new subsection (1A) says that the Court must say that it
thinks there is no reasonable doubt about the appellant&#146;s guilt.
New subsection (1A) does not have the ambiguity of the existing draft.
We hope that that clarifies
matters.</div>
					<a name="07112122000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 208 and 209 are consequential amendments, to apply the changes
effected by clause 26 to two other provisions, namely sections 13 and
16 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, which also make use of the same
test of unsafety. New clause 29 is the Northern Ireland equivalent of
clause 26. We are dealing with new clause 28 now, rather than at the
end of proceedings.</div>

							<a name="07112122000708"></a>Mr.

						</b> In my experience, that is normally a matter of
consultation with the jurisdiction and establishing whether people
there want this measure to apply. One would expect that, after those
consultations, the Northern Ireland criminal justice system suggested
that it would want the clauses to apply there. I imagine that that is
why new clause 29 is here.</div>

							<a name="07112122000711"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I do not have any comment to make about what the
Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has said. It may well have
said that, but I am not responsible for the criminal justice system in
Northern Ireland and we are including the new clauses that relate to
Northern Ireland because the Northern Ireland jurisdiction has asked us
to save it the difficulty of finding other vehicles to do so. It
obviously sees the sense of these measures in respect of Northern
Ireland and we are merely acceding to those requests. If I am wrong
about that&#151;I suspect that I am not&#151;I will obviously get
back to the hon. Gentleman, but that is the case as I understand
it.</div>
					<a name="07112122000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000712"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am provoked by the intervention to look at
clause 127, which deals with the extent of the Bill. I may not be
reading it carefully enough, but I cannot see a reference to clause 26
in clause 127 that extends to Northern Ireland. I may have got that
completely wrong.</div>
					<a name="07112122000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000713"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I shall have to rely on others to check that, but I
hear what the hon. and learned Gentleman says. I hope that he will bear
in mind the fact that I was not anticipating dealing with new clause 28
and all of these matters at this point. I hope that he will give me a
certain amount of leeway.</div>
					<a name="07112122000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 28 amends section 2
of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, and gives the Court of Appeal the
discretion to disregard developments in the law since the date of
conviction. During the various consultations on what has turned into
clause 26, members of the Committee will be aware that it was brought
to the Government&#146;s attention that there was a lacuna in the
current legislation, which new clause 28 will fill.</div>
					<a name="07112122000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter arises from the
judgments in the cases of R <i class="I">v. </i>Cottrell and R <i class="I">v.
</i>Fletcher. In those instances, two appellants who had clearly
committed acts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age
of 16, could not be prosecuted for that offence because a statutory
time limit had applied at the time at which they were prosecuted. In
accordance with the usual practice at the time, they were instead
charged with indecent assault, to which the time limit did not apply,
and were convicted.</div>
					<a name="07112122000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsequently, the House of
Lords decided that it was impermissible to charge indecent assault in
such circumstances, and after that decision, the Court of Appeal had no
option but to consider the law in its present state when one of these
cases was referred. It was reluctant to quash a conviction in which the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>appellant was properly convicted under the law as it was when the person
was tried, and would normally avoid having to do so by refusing leave
to appeal out of time. However, there are some circumstances in which a
case that is referred to the Court of Appeal does not need leave,
particularly where those cases are referred by the Criminal Cases
Review Commission.</div>
					<a name="07112122000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
this particular case, the Court was obliged to hear the appeal and
obliged to quash the conviction, even though it was apparent and
certain that the appellant had been properly convicted of serious
offences. That is what new clause 28 seeks to deal with. Members of the
senior judiciary brought the matter to the attention of the Government.
It is clearly something that needs to be dealt with and new clause 28
is our attempt to do so.
</div>
					<a name="07112122000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government agree
with the senior judiciary that this matter must be dealt with. The
Criminal Cases Review Commission does not disagree with the view that
this is an unsatisfactory state of affairs. Our preferred solution is
to give the Court of Appeal the discretion to disregard developments in
the law since the date of conviction, and that is the effect of new
clause 28.</div>
					<a name="07112122000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
and learned Member for Harborough has added amendment (a) to new clause
28, and he has tabled other amendments which, with your permission
Mr. Cook, we will deal with once he has had a chance to set
out his stall.</div>
					<a name="07112122000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 30 applies those matters to Northern Ireland in accordance with
the wishes of those who look after the criminal justice system in that
jurisdiction. With those few remarks, I commend amendment No. 207 to
the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07112122000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000714"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> In resisting the amendments I do not think that I
can be quite as brief as the Minister, because I shall also try to
persuade the Committee of the good sense of the Opposition&#146;s
amendments. I regret holding hon. Members up if they have other things
to do, but we are coming to quite an important aspect of the powers of
the criminal justice system and of the way in which the Court of Appeal
criminal division deals with matters before it.</div>
					<a name="07112122000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very much reliant on
advice that I have received from others on this subject. Although I am
now in what I think is my 35th year at the Bar, I do not have great
experience of the Court of Appeal criminal division. Actually, it might
be an exaggeration to say that I am in my 35th year. I was called in
1976, so I am in my 32nd year. My practice has been predominantly in
the civil jurisdiction dealing with media law, confidence, defamation
and so on. However, I have a little understanding of what goes on in
the Court of Appeal, and some understanding of what goes on in the
criminal courts through having sat as a recorder for the past 10 years.
Nevertheless, I make no secret of the fact that I shall be relying
heavily on the works of Professor J. R. Spencer, who is attached to
Cambridge university and who attends frequently at the Judicial Studies
Board lectures and refresher courses that I too attend. I have not only
read what he has to say, I have on many occasions in the past 10 years
had the benefit of listening to him speak on Government proposals for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>amending the criminal law in one form or another. He has written quite
extensively and thoroughly on the subject that is dealt with by this
part of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112122000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we all know, in September 2006 the Government
announced their intention to change the law so that, in future, the
Court of Appeal would no longer be able to quash convictions on purely
procedural grounds if it was sure that the defendant was factually
guilty. Last summer, the Government issued what they were pleased to
call a consultation paper. The paper was fairly brief, and made it
quite clear that, although the Government were interested in hearing
what people had to say about how to achieve the aims that are reflected
in the new clause, they were not consulting on the aims themselves or
on whether the law should be changed. The consultation was somewhat
partial, therefore.</div>
					<a name="07112122000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The paper
said that the present system risks outcomes that are unacceptable to
the law-abiding majority. As the Government were committed to
rebalancing the criminal justice system in favour of the victim and the
law-abiding majority, they said that the law had to be changed. The
depth of research underlying the paper was clear from the
Government&#146;s repeated references to the work of a wholly
non-existent body, called the 1985 royal commission&#151;an imaginary
amalgam, one presumes, of the 1981 Philips commission and the Runciman
commission of
1993.</div>
					<a name="07112122000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Among
those who put forward views adverse to those of the Government were the
senior judiciary, the council of circuit judges, the Criminal Cases
Review Commission, the Law Society, the Criminal Bar Association,
Justice and Liberty. I shall list the objections made by that quite
powerful group of bodies, which I would have thought were worth
listening to.</div>
					<a name="07112122000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
there was a failure to recognise that the criminal appeal process
exists not only to ensure that the factually innocent are not punished
but to uphold the rule of law. Thus, it was said, the function of
criminal appeals is not just to see that, in a given case, the right
result is reached, but to ensure that the law of the land in general
and the rules of criminal procedure and evidence in particular are
respected and properly applied. Because of that, it is inevitable that
the Court of Appeal must sometimes quash convictions that are tainted
by grave breaches of the law or serious failures to apply the
rules, irrespective of the factual guilt or innocence of the accused.
There are two good reasons for that: one theoretical and one
practical.</div>
					<a name="07112122000620"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07112122000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
theoretical reason is that a criminal conviction is acceptable only if
it carries moral authority and a decision reached in defiance of the
basic rules that society prescribes for criminal investigations and
trials does not. The practical reason is that, if convictions can be
upheld where the authorities have flouted the basic rules, that will
undermine the self-restraint that we expect the authorities to show in
keeping to them. If the police know that if they break the rules the
resulting conviction will be appeal-proof, as long as nobody finds out
until afterwards, that would&#151;to use the Government&#146;s
jargon&#151;send a signal that breaking rules can
pay.</div>
					<a name="07112122000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
objection from the bodies I have mentioned is that the proposal is
unnecessary because it fails to understand the way in which the rules
of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>criminal appeal currently operate. Behind the proposal
is the notion that, as the law now stands, defendants
who are clearly guilty regularly escape punishment because the Court of
Appeal quashes their conviction on account of footling procedural
irregularities. However, that is not so. For most procedural
irregularities the Court of Appeal will uphold the conviction if it is
convinced that the defendant is really guilty and would still have been
convicted, even if the irregularity had not taken
place.</div>
					<a name="07112122000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is plenty
of case law making it clear that the Court of Appeal will quash the
conviction of a defendant who is plainly guilty in respect of only the
most serious procedural irregularities. In the comparatively rare cases
where the Court of Appeal considers the procedural flaw too grave for
the conviction of a visibly guilty person to be allowed to stand, it
will usually order a retrial where, as is usually the case, a new trial
can cure the problem. The current law is not in need of change. I do
not say that out of complacency, but because an examination of the
issues underlying the Government&#146;s proposals shows that they do
not stand up.</div>
					<a name="07112122000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
matter of principle, it is right that some purely procedural
errors&#151;as the Government calls them&#151;should cause the
conviction to be quashed, irrespective of the defendant&#146;s
factual guilt or innocence and, in some cases, it should not be
possible for the defendant to be retried. Having said that, the present
law is not free from difficulty, because neither statute nor case law,
nor legal writers, have laid down any clear rules to identify cases
that fall into either of those two categories. I accept that that
uncertainty is unsettling and probably helps to foster the false
impression about the operation of the current law that has led to the
Government introducing a Bill to change
it.</div>
					<a name="07112122000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want briefly to
set my concerns in context and mention how the Court of Criminal Appeal
has developed since the Criminal Appeal Act was passed in 1907, which
was the first time that the Court of Appeal could review convictions
and sentences based on this issue&#151;or at all. Section 4(1) of
that Act
says:</div>
					<a name="07112122000562"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Court of Criminal Appeal on any such appeal against conviction shall
allow the appeal if they think that the verdict of the jury should be
set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported
having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court before
whom the appellant was convicted should be set aside on the ground of a
wrong decision of any question of law or that on any ground there was a
miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the
appeal:</div>
					<a name="07112122000563"></a><div class="hs_brev">Provided that
the court may, notwithstanding that they are of opinion that the point
raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant,
dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of
justice has actually
occurred.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
provision was modified to some extent under the Criminal Appeal Act
1968, in which the Court was permitted to quash convictions for
failures of due process but which did not allow the Court of Appeal to
order a retrial. That modification was a response to some of the
difficult cases that the Court of Appeal had had to deal with over the
previous 50 or 60 years. On the one hand, the Appeal Court would
sometimes uphold convictions despite failures of due process that most
people would regard as fundamental. An example of a case where nowadays
we would think that the wrong result was arrived at occurred during the
first world war. A Chinese man with virtually no command of English had
no interpreter at the trial so was unable  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div>to follow the proceedings. In the judgment, the Court of Appeal equated
the position of a defendant who was present but unable to understand
the proceedings with that of a defendant who was physically absent. It
stressed the great importance of providing interpreters for those who
were unable to follow spoken English. However, despite that endorsement
of a basic principle, the Court applied the proviso and affirmed the
conviction for murder because, as it said, if the evidence had been
translated to the appellant, the same verdict would inevitably have
followed. As a result, on 1 January 1916 the poor man was hanged at
Pentonville.</div>
					<a name="07112122000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
always said that another fundamental requirement of a trial is that the
judge who is trying the case should be impartial and unbiased. I do not
often speak ill of my profession, but this is an occasion to do so.
There was a case in 1969 when the Court of Appeal criminal division
refused to quash a conviction although the trial judge had demonstrated
his bias by saying in a loud voice, &#147;Oh, God&#148; when
defence counsel began his closing speech, and then by laying his
bewigged head down on his arms and making groaning noises while counsel
was trying to impress the jury. Surprisingly, the Court of Appeal
upheld the poor defendant&#146;s
conviction.</div>
					<a name="07112122000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
other end of the spectrum, appeal courts sometimes quash convictions
for minor procedural irregularities with the result that a defendant
who is probably guilty walks free. In the case of Hales, the Court of
Appeal quashed the defendant&#146;s conviction for theft and the
15-month prison sentence consequent upon it because the sentence had
been pronounced when he was absent from the court, although he had been
present throughout the trial. In another case, the Court of Appeal
quashed the defendant&#146;s conviction for dangerous driving and the
resulting prison sentence because the particulars of the offence as
stated in the indictment were that he</div>
					<a name="07112122000564"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;drove a motor car recklessly or
at a speed or in a manner which was dangerous to the
public&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112122000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">That offended
the rule against duplicity, but most people would not have thought it
appropriate in justice to quash the
conviction.</div>
					<a name="07112122000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
position became even more muddled when the House of Lords Judicial
Committee started inventing a theory that certain procedural
irregularities had the effect of making the initial trial a nullity. It
was trying to find an inventive way to get through the problem that the
current laws relating to the Court of Appeal criminal division as
invented in 1907 presented, so it suggested that some procedural
irregularities led to the initial trial being void, as though it had
never occurred, and it ordered a retrial so that the retrial could cure
the irregularity in the first
trial.</div>
					<a name="07112122000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Eventually, we
got to a position in 1964 such that the Criminal Appeal Act was amended
to give the Court power to order a retrial when it quashed a conviction
because new evidence had come to light, and then in 1988 Parliament
amended the Act again to give the Court of Appeal criminal division the
power to order a retrial when quashing the conviction for whatever
reason. The latest position for which figures are available is that in
2004 66 cases were ordered to be retried on the Court of Appeal
quashing a conviction on account of procedural
irregularity.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>
					<a name="07112122000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Runciman report was produced
in 1995, and there was a further change when Parliament amended the Act
to state that the Court of
Appeal</div>
					<a name="07112122000565"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall allow an
appeal against conviction if they think that the conviction is unsafe;
and...shall dismiss such an appeal in any other
case.&#148;</div>
				
					<a name="07112122000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is thought that when drafting that the Home Office was trying to
prevent people who were plainly guilty from getting away with it on
procedural grounds. Lord Taylor, then the Lord Chief Justice, said in
the House of Lords, &#147;It&#146;s business as usual,
chaps.&#148; That is how the Court of Appeal and the Judicial
Committee interpreted that amendment to the
law.</div>
					<a name="07112122000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">To achieve
clarity, I shall consider which due process errors should automatically
justify the quashing of a conviction. Professor Spencer lists a number
of such errors, including, first, cases in
which</div>
					<a name="07112122000566"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the court had no
jurisdiction to try the
offence&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112122000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">An obvious
example is one in which the judge trying the case is not a judge at
all. The second error applies to cases in which</div>
					<a name="07112122000567"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the court below fundamentally
misapplied the substantive criminal
law&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112122000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such cases, the
defendant was convicted of an offence of which he was not guilty and
was essentially put before the jury for an offence that did not exist.
The third error applies in cases in
which</div>
					<a name="07112122000568"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the rules of
natural justice were
broken&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112122000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
rules of natural justice. I am sorry to resort to legal Latin, but the
first is nemo judex in sua causa. That is to say, no matter how clear a
person&#146;s guilt, if the judge had a particular reason to be
biased or appeared to demonstrate bias, one of the rules of natural
justice has been
breached.</div>
					<a name="07112122000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
rule is that people should not be convicted without having an
opportunity to defend themselves and advance a case. That can be
amusing in some cases, but rather sad in others. In 1988, a judge
refused to allow a defendant&#151;a male transvestite&#151;to take
part in the proceedings unless he wore men&#146;s clothes. The
defendant did not want to wear men&#146;s clothes because he did not
feel comfortable in them, and was convicted because he refused to
appear in court. <i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> It is funny in
one sense, but on the other hand it is perfectly obvious that people
should not be convicted in such
conditions.</div>
					<a name="07112122000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fourth
category that Professor Spencer highlights
is</div>
					<a name="07112122000569"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;disregard of other
procedural rules of major importance that exist for the particular
protection of the
defendant&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112122000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not go into a long explanation of those rules,
but they are obvious and recognisable. Fifthly, he highlights
the</div>
					<a name="07112122000570"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;existence of some
formal bar to
prosecution&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112122000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
applies, for example, if the bringing of the prosecution is
time-barred. Finally, there could
be:</div>
					<a name="07112122000571"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;gross misconduct in
the course of investigating the offence, or preparing for the
trial&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want the Committee to consider under what circumstances the Court of
Appeal should be permitted to refuse to order a retrial where such
abuses. Professor Spencer says that he can see no reason in principle
for  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>refusing to order a retrial in any of the cases in the first four
categories. The only principle for refusing to order a retrial is what
might be called the penalty shoot-out theory of criminal procedure: the
notion that the prosecution is allowed only one shot at goal and if it
misses, for whatever reason, it is unfair to the defendant to let the
prosecution have another
go.</div>
					<a name="07112122000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that notion of criminal justice has any validity at all, it might
justify forbidding a retrial in cases where the prosecution is in some
way to blame for what has happened. However, it could hardly justify
the absence of a retrial in a case where the prosecution is blameless
and the failure of due process was the result of a bungle by the court.
In the light of the overriding objective of the new criminal procedure
rules, it is questionable whether the penalty shoot-out theory is
tenable even when the prosecution has
blundered.</div>
					<a name="07112122000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor
Spencer suggests that a retrial should be impossible only in cases that
conform to his fifth and sixth criteria, in which there is some formal
bar to prosecution and gross misconduct in the course of investigating
the offence or preparing for the trial. In those situations, the
prosecution should not have taken place at all: if the lower court had
done its job properly, it would have stopped the proceedings. If that
is the root of the problem, it obviously cannot be cured by allowing
the prosecution to continue. An example of the final category is the
case of Mullen, which is the only one that the Government have been
able to come up with. That decision seems to form the basis of their
argument in favour of messing around even further with the powers of
the Court of Appeal.</div>
					<a name="07112122000621"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="07112122000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry not
to have compressed Professor Spencer&#146;s argument as fluently or
as comprehensively as he might have wished. However, it is important
that we pay particular attention to people who have spent their
academic lives considering such issues: they have looked at case law
and the way in which the Court of Appeal criminal division has
developed over the past 100 years. For the Government to want to change
that on the back of one case&#151;the Mullen case&#151;in which the
defendant was unlawfully rendered, if that is the right expression,
from Zimbabwe to this country to face trial, because the Government
either could not be bothered or did not want to become engaged in an
extradition hearing in Zimbabwe is pretty
appalling.</div>
					<a name="07112122000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
concluding, I wish to deal with the point at issue in Government new
clause 28. The Minister explained it, but in amendment (a), we are
trying to make it clearer. We do not have the same fundamental
objections to new clause 28 as we do to clause 26 as a whole, but it is
not drafted as carefully as it could be. I suspect that Ministers have
received the a copy of the letter dated 24 October that I have received
from Professor Graham Zellick, chairman of the Criminal Cases Review
Commission. He sets out in delightfully simple terms why he thinks that
the current Government new clause is not quite right. He makes it clear
that the commission</div>
					<a name="07112122000572"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does
not oppose this amendment in
principle,&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07112122000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">nor
do we&#151;</div>
					<a name="07112122000573"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but we do
regard its drafting as seriously defective. In our view, the clause
should make explicit reference to the substantial injustice test which
has featured over the years in case law, so that the clause would then
read as follows&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div>
					<a name="07112122000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have copied his proposed amendment. I
adopt his reasons for the proposal and support them. He
said:</div>
					<a name="07112122000574"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
present wording gives the Court no guidance whatever as to the
circumstances in which a development in the common law may be
disregarded and it does not follow that the statutory provision is to
be applied in line with the Court&#146;s long-established practice in
respect of applications for leave to appeal out of time based on a
change in the law.</div>
					<a name="07112122000575"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
absence of the link to substantial injustice means that change of law
could be disregarded in cases where in our view it should be taken into
account and we believe that it is right for Parliament to give this
guidance to the judges of the Criminal Division and thereby limit the
scope of the
discretion.</div>
					<a name="07112122000576"></a><div class="hs_brev">Many
judges sit in the Criminal Division who are not particularly
experienced in criminal law and may not be fully aware of the
background to this
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112122000577"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
inclusion of a reference to &#145;substantial injustice&#146;
should prompt the Court over time to elucidate and clarify its meaning
which is essential if a provision of such importance is to be
understood by all those affected by it or who have to deal with
it.</div>
					<a name="07112122000578"></a><div class="hs_brev">The Criminal Cases
Review Commission, in particular, needs to know the basis on which
legal developments will be disregarded if it is to be able properly and
sensibly to apply the &#145;real possibility&#146; test in the
Criminal Appeal
Act.</div>
					<a name="07112122000579"></a><div class="hs_brev">The absence of a
reference to substantial injustice and the enactment of the clause in
its present open-ended form would preclude or seriously inhibit the
House of
Lords&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07112122000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Judicial
Committee, I
add&#151;</div>
					<a name="07112122000580"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;from ever
being able to offer guidance as to the proper scope of the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="07112122000581"></a><div class="hs_brev">It is true
that the expression &#145;substantial injustice&#146; even in this
context suffers from some uncertainty, but that is a reason for
including it in the statutory provision so that it can be adequately
defined or shaped by the Court in the light of past experience and
future cases. It is not a reason for a clause that is wholly destitute
of guidance.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor Zellick and the CCRC
remain puzzled that the Government, despite being told about those
arguments in advance of drafting their new clause, have not found them
acceptable. There are thus two big issues. The first concerns new
clause 28, and the secondly the approach to the powers of the Court of
Appeal when dealing with appeals in criminal cases. I have relied, as I
have made clear, on the learning of Professor Spencer, but any mistakes
in recounting his arguments are mine, not his. If, in the unlikely
event that Professor Spencer reads the Committee <i class="I">Hansard</i>, he
sees reference to his name and learning, he should not feel in the
least bit embarrassed if he wishes to write to me and say that I have
got it all wrong. However, I do not think that I have. Where we are
going wrong is in introducing the provisions simply on the basis of one
case and on an apparent appeal to populism to ensure that people do not
leave court after a successful appeal even though they are, in fact,
guilty. It is a bigger issue than that.</div>
					<a name="07112122000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">A court of criminal appeal has
a public and a private purpose: the public purpose of ensuring that
people are not convicted improperly, and that the authorities, whether
they are the prosecutors, police or the court system, do not condone
and repeat bad behaviour; and the private purpose of dealing with the
individual appeal, which is of particular interest to the appellant. I
urge the Government to pay attention to the great weight of authority
underlying the criticism in the responses to the consultation paper. I
doubt very much if anybody wrote to the Government to say, &#147;What
a good idea this is, we can&#146;t wait for it to come
into  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>force.&#148; All the criticism went in the other direction, but the
Government ignored it. No doubt they had their reasons for doing
so.</div>
					<a name="07112122000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 100
may be up in the air, because the Government have amended, or hope to
amend, the relevant part of the Bill. To some extent, but not as much
as I should like, the Bill upholds the difference between the Court of
Appeal and the court of first instance by requiring that the Court of
Appeal should receive a certificate from the trial judge confirming
that the evidence that he and the jury heard was sufficient to prove
the prosecution case, and that he had admitted&#151;and the jury had
considered and been directed by him on the matter&#151;the relevance
of any evidence of procedural or other misconduct. The Court of Appeal
must have evidence before then that the question of procedural
irregularity was dealt with, and not simply kept from the court or
brushed under the carpet.</div>
					<a name="07112122000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
Nos. 101 and 102 touch on clause 26 (5), which would insert new section
30B into the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and
states:</div>
					<a name="07112122000582"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If it
appears to the Court of Appeal, in determining an appeal under this
Part, that there has been serious misconduct by any person involved in
the investigation or prosecution of the offence the Court may refer the
matter to the Attorney
General.&#148;&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">We wish
to delete the words,</div>
					<a name="07112122000583"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may refer the matter to the

					<a name="07112122000584"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may,
as the Court think fit in the interests of justice in that case, either
direct that there be a retrial or that the appellant be
acquitted.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would
reinforce the power of the Court of Appeal to order a retrial or to
acquit, rather than simply shifting the matter over to the
Attorney-General to deal with the misconduct in some other disciplinary
way, but without affecting the defendant&#146;s right to a retrial or
to be acquitted.</div>
					<a name="07112122000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to amendment No. 102,

such criminal or civil proceedings (or both) as he thinks best suit the
justice of the case (taking into account the impact on the victim of
the offence or his family of his decision either to proceed or not) and
which decision either to proceed or not will provide the most suitable
redress to the subject of such misconduct, deter any such misconduct in
the future and restore public confidence in the criminal justice
system.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
taken a little while to set out my arguments and those that I have
borrowed from others. Given that the Government are making a
fundamental change&#151;and not a very good one&#151;to the
criminal Court of Appeal, it is important that the arguments against
that change, which they have so far ignored, should be set out
extensively. I make no apology for doing so. If we are not successful
in resisting the Government in Committee or on the Floor of the House,
the other place will not feel in the least inhibited about doing the
right thing on clause 26.</div>
					<a name="07112122000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill has been bolted
together like some sort of Heath Robinson contraption. From time to
time, the Government think of something else to write about and stick
it into the Bill. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State revised his
initial views about what clause 26 should do, and now, in Committee,
the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div>Government are bolting on a complete rewrite of clause 26. If that is
how they want to proceed with making this legislation, Members
considering the Bill at later stages should not have any inhibitions
about undoing this bolt-on business and putting the law back where it
ought to
be.</div>
					<a name="07112122000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000715"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I do not propose to take quite as long as the hon.
and learned Member for Harborough to make the case against the clause.
The proposal must have seemed like a good idea at the time to the
Government, but they have been trying to row back from it ever since,
because the arguments in favour of it do not stand up. They are now
attempting in their amendments to make partially digestible that which
is inedible.</div>
					<a name="07112122000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Lord
Chancellor made it plain on Second Reading that the clause has few
friends in his Department. He tried his best to suggest that there
might be a reason why it is necessary, but he could not come up with a
single concrete example of a case in which the discretion that is
currently available to the Court of Appeal is not sufficient to deal
with the supposed mischief that he described. Indeed, he went quite the
other way and made plain his view of the famous Mullen case. I teased
the Under-Secretary when she talked about Mullen and similar cases,
because we still do not know what the similar cases are. The Lord
Chancellor said that an egregious&#151;I think that is the word he
used&#151;abuse of process had occurred, that the Court of Appeal had
had to come to that decision, and that the right thing to do was to
free someone on appeal. There is a big question, therefore, about the
utility of clause
26.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07112122000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, the Lord Chancellor did say that he would rewrite the clause and
come back with more acceptable proposals. I do not want to suggest that
he has not been faithful to at least part of that intention. Government
amendment No. 207 is an improvement&#151;as far as it goes&#151;on
the wording of the original clause 26. However, it still raises some
serious questions about what the Government are trying to do. Why do
they seek to fetter the discretion of the Court of Appeal and what will
the consequences
be?</div>
					<a name="07112122000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key operative
concession, if we can put it that way, is to downgrade the requirement
on the Court of Appeal so that it no longer needs to be</div>
					<a name="07112122000587"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;satisfied that the appellant is
guilty of the
offence&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112122000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
refers instead to there
being</div>
					<a name="07112122000588"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no reasonable
doubt about the appellant&#146;s
guilt.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to say
that that still puts the Court of Appeal in a position whereby it is
required to act as a court that is finding on fact, not just on the
legal position and potential abuse of process. That is
unsatisfactory.</div>
					<a name="07112122000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">New

to allow the conviction to
stand.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that asks
the Court to make a judgment about whether it would seriously undermine
the proper 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>administration of justice, rather than simply to take a view on whether
there had been an abuse of process that required it to find that the
original verdict was unsafe, and should therefore be overturned. Both
changes would leave the Court of Appeal in an unsatisfactory
position.</div>

						</b> I certainly endorse the points that the hon.
Gentleman makes, particularly on the position in which the Court would
find itself when forming a view on the facts of the case. I am not sure
whether the Government intend to amend the explanatory notes, but
paragraph 228
states:</div>
					<a name="07112122000590"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would be for the Court to form their own view as to guilt on the
evidence available to them; where they were in any doubt the Court
would be under no obligation to seek to resolve it by calling for
further evidence.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fundamental constitutional concern is that, in essence, the Court would
be encouraged to usurp the primary role of the jury in determining
guilt.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000717"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct. That is precisely my
point. I think that that proposal fundamentally changes the nature of
the Court of Appeal. It is not a minor amendment to the Criminal Appeal
Act 1968, nor is it just a minor
&#147;recalibration&#148;&#151;is that the word that the Lord
Chancellor used?</div>

							<a name="07112122000719"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> He does indeed. In this instance, however, I think
he used the word &#147;recalibration&#148;. That is not what the
measure does. It fundamentally changes the process of the courts and
the role of the Court of Appeal. On those grounds alone, it should be
resisted.</div>
					<a name="07112122000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Lord
Chancellor&#146;s purpose was simply to underline the discretion
already available to the Court, he could have done that without clause
26. I do not think that anything requires the Court of Appeal not to
take a sensible view about the safety of a conviction when making its
determination. No evidence has been adduced to suggest that that is
that case. What we are talking about is not asking the Court to act
differently, but creating yet another headline for the newspapers and
people with less understanding of the legal process to give the
impression that we are significantly shifting the way in which the
courts will work, but in the process undermining the legal system as we
know it. That is profoundly
dangerous.</div>
					<a name="07112122000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tested
the Under-Secretary of State for Justice on new clause 29, which was
originally in this group; it is not one that was added, Mr.
Cook, when you sensibly altered our proceedings. New clause 29 was
always in this group. It would extend these provisions on the Court of
Appeal to Northern Ireland. I wanted to test her on that because I have
the benefit of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission&#146;s
briefing. The commission is not just another pressure group, which we
can safely disregard if we do not like what it says. It is a statutory
body that was set up under the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to review the
adequacy and effectiveness of Northern Ireland law and practice
relating to the protection of human rights. That is its sole purpose,
so what does it have to say about the provisions? Its briefing is
instructive, saying that</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div>
					<a name="07112122000591"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Part 3 of the Bill does
not extend to Northern Ireland and the Commission welcomes that, view
of the concerns it expressed in October
2006.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is when the
commission responded to a consultation by the Northern Ireland Office
on the proposal before us. It
continues:</div>
					<a name="07112122000592"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commission stressed at the time that any proposals for limiting the
independence of the Court to quash convictions would impact
fundamentally on the value given in the criminal justice system to
considerations of procedural
fairness.&#148;</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Northern
Ireland Office sought to extend the provisions to Northern Ireland, and
will have taken full account of its stakeholders&#146; opinions. That
is not a job for me to do in the Ministry of Justice, so I can only
assume that the Northern Ireland Office consulted all its stakeholders,
including the commission, when coming to its views. The Ministry of
Justice and I as the Minister proposing the new clause are simply
seeking to do what the Northern Ireland Office has asked us to
do.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000721"></a>Mr.

						</b> Precisely so. That is precisely my point. Here we
have the body charged with commentary on these
matters&#151;establishing the rights and wrongs of a
case&#151;being consulted by the Northern Ireland Office and
returning with a damning indictment on the Government&#146;s
proposal. What is the reaction of the Northern Ireland Office? It
commissions the Under-Secretary of State for Justice to come to this
Committee to extend it anyway, because apparently it is not interested
in what the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission
says.</div>

							<a name="07112122000722"></a>Maria

						</b> I do not think it is fair of the hon. Gentleman to
say that the Northern Ireland Office takes no interest in what the
Commission said. It has a range of stakeholders and takes a balanced
view, as any Department would, having consulted on the right way
forward. It has made a decision, and it is unfair of the hon. Gentleman
to suggest that it asked for one view and then ignored
it.</div>
					<a name="07112122000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000723"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I do not think I said that it asked for one view
and then ignored it. I said that it asked for the views of the body
that I believe has some importance in the context of Northern Ireland,
and chose not to accept its advice. I believe, therefore, that it is
perfectly proper for me to quote what it said about the
Government&#146;s position in support of my position, because the
commission is so strongly in support. Paragraph 6 of its submission
states:</div>
					<a name="07112122000593"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
the exception of Northern Ireland from the scope of clause 26, the
Commission limits its comment on the matter to expressing its view
that, in terms of the values underpinning the legal traditions in UK
jurisdictions, any measure that tends to undermine the requirement for
procedural fairness in the trial process may threaten the presumption
of innocence, diminish confidence in the integrity of the courts, and
increase the likelihood and severity of miscarriages of
justice.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
potent argument against the Government&#146;s
proposal.</div>
					<a name="07112122000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
quickly with new clauses 28 and 30, which deal with the Northern
Ireland extension, and amendment (a), tabled by the hon. and learned 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>Member for Harborough. He has quoted a letter from the chairman of the
Criminal Cases Review Commission. We have to use the wretched word
&#147;stakeholder&#148; again. What stakeholder is more important
in the particular case before us than the Criminal Cases Review
Commission, which is the only body that can actually deal with these
matters? The commission states that it understands and accepts what the
Government are proposing, but that the proposal is drafted so badly
that it needs revision. The hon. and learned Gentleman has put that
down as amendment (a)&#151;a revision which the chairman of the
Criminal Cases Review Commission believes is essential to the proper
working of his commission and the process.</div>
					<a name="07112122000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">How on earth
can the Government claim to have taken a reasoned and proper view of
the drafting of the amendment if they disregard the body that they
created and that they require to administer the consequences of the
legislation, when it says that it cannot work effectively without an
amendment? Again, the chairman of the commission&#146;s comment is
pretty
damning:</div>
					<a name="07112122000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
commission does not oppose this amendment in principle, but we do
regard its drafting as seriously
defective.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the terms
of the chairman of the commission, &#147;seriously defective&#148;
is about as strongly expressed as it is possible for it to be. Surely,
the Government ought to say, &#147;Hang on a minute, perhaps we have
got this slightly wrong. We know what our intention is, but if the
Criminal Cases Review Commission says that this is &#145;seriously
defective&#146;, we ought to think again.&#148; That would be the
sensible approach for them to take, but we have not heard that
recognition so far on the part of the
Department.</div>
					<a name="07112122000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I welcome the fact that the Government, in their amendments
to clause 26, have moved from their initial position, but to my mind no
justification has been established for the clause. I hope that I am
correct in understanding the hon. and learned Gentleman to have
indicated that he would seek to oppose, not amendment 207, but clause
stand part, because it is the clause that is the problem, not the
amendment. If he does so, I will certainly join him in opposing the
clause, because we have not yet heard any justification for this
fundamental change to the Court of Appeal and the legislation that
prescribes the way in which it works. We know that every respondent to
the Government has said that they are not convinced by the
Government&#146;s case. I do not believe that, in their heart of
hearts, the Government want this measure either. It is left over from
the previous Administration. It would be better, and I think that face
would be preserved rather than lost in the process, if it were quietly
dropped.</div>

							<b class="B">Harry
Cohen</b> (Leyton and Wanstead) (Lab): I want to take the
opportunity to put on the record the view of Liberty on this part of
the Bill. The organisation states
that:</div>
					<a name="07112122000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government&#146;s current proposals would prevent a conviction being
quashed where there has been serious abuse of process even where, once
quashed, the Court of Appeal would currently order a
retrial.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty

position,</div>
					<a name="07112122000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>
					<a name="07112122000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;to quash a conviction where there
is strong evidence of guilt, without ordering a retrial, will bring the
criminal justice system into disrepute, rather than protect its
integrity. According to that argument it is wrong to punish the public
and deny justice to the victim in this way; if the system or those who
operate it are at fault it is they and not the public which should be
punished or required to learn
lessons.&#146;&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty
goes on to say that in its view, the position is not as black and white
as that. It
states:</div>
					<a name="07112122000594"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
reality, those cases in which this power to quash convictions is used
involve very serious failings either before or at trial, or serious
illegality on the part of the prosecution or police... Those who
enforce the law should also obey the law and should not benefit from
breaches of it. It would be contradictory for the state to take
advantage of a breach of the law which it itself has
committed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty
continues:</div>

for the Court to check serious illegality and abuse of process by the
Executive&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">is an
important constitutional check on the Executive. It points
out:</div>
					<a name="07112122000596"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
concerned that, once the Court of Appeal&#146;s power to quash a
conviction outright where there has been serious malpractice on the
part of state authorities is removed, the next step would be to take
that power away from the courts of first instance. The power to stay
proceedings as an abuse of process is an important constitutional
safeguard which should not be restricted or
removed.&#148;</div>

					<a name="07112122000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is exactly
the point of the amendment, which I welcome. It will give the Court of

					<a name="07112122000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a

to be quashed for procedural reasons where there is obvious guilt. Most
of the public

serious procedural mistakes or deliberate malfeasance&#151;rigged
evidence or whatever&#151;that must surely prompt the reasonable
doubt that the Court of Appeal would have to assess in its
interpretation of whether someone is obviously guilty. Again, I ask for
an assurance that my view on that is
correct.</div>
					<a name="07112122000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister mentioned mischief, and we can talk about people getting off
when they are obviously guilty by using procedure. But there can be
another mischief at play: if the prosecuting authorities and the police
present rigged evidence or use procedure wrongly. I cannot see anything
in the Bill that says there will be punishment for that. If somebody is
out of line in court, they are done for contempt of court. Well, quite
frankly, rigged evidence is contempt of court. In the balance of
things, if the Government are to make the change in question, which I
can go along with, notwithstanding what has been said and my being a
layman, there should be a balance to include punitive action for those
whose misdeeds have been a contempt of
court.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): I, too, am a layman,
and not as distinguished as my colleagues on both sides of the
Committee. I have no legal training, but I am concerned about clause
26.</div>
					<a name="07112122000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the public to
have confidence in the legal judicial system, they need to be reassured
that the players within the system are operating to the highest
standards and levels of excellence, not taking short-cuts and making
mistakes. It is incumbent on the police, the Crown Prosecution Service,
barristers and the judiciary to operate to the very highest standards
of professionalism. If, in the process of bringing a case to court and
processing that case through the court, mistakes were made and the
conviction may be unsound or is based on not the full facts, or if
process errors have been made in reaching the conviction, it is not
unreasonable to review that process and order a retrial.</div>
					<a name="07112122000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">I become concerned when we, as
politicians, talk about obvious guilt&#151;&#147;Well, the
defendant is obviously guilty, so there&#146;s no need for a
retrial.&#148; There are many cases that go to court where many of us
could argue that the defendant is obviously guilty. We used to do it in
the middle ages, saying, &#147;He&#146;s obviously guilty, so cut
his hands off, cut his head off because we don&#146;t need to waste
everyone&#146;s time.&#148; But we have advanced since then, and we
have processes. Those processes must be followed and respected, and
people will not respect or follow them if they know that their failings
will not carry consequences. I would like to put my concerns on the
record.</div>

Eagle:
						</b> On the point about the middle ages and assuming
that people are guilty, the provisions and the changes that we are
making to amendment No. 207 are only brought into play where it is
absolutely clear to the Court of Appeal, on the evidence available to
it, that there is no reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant.
For example, he may have pleaded guilty at first instance, or his
grounds for appeal may not challenge the issue of whether or not he is
guilty, so this measure is not a resort to the lynch mob. I hope that
the hon. Gentleman accepts that.</div>

							<a name="07112122000729"></a>Mr.
Walker:
						</b> I appreciate that, but clearly if the proper
process has not been followed but the gentleman is guilty, he will be
found guilty again at a retrial. However, holding the retrial would
demonstrate that if the proper processes are not followed by those
involved in the first trial, there will be consequences. A retrial will
have to be gone through at great expense to the public purse and great
tediousness to all those involved, but in my view that is why we have a
legal system. Even when it becomes difficult and annoying and tedious
to respect that legal system, it needs to be cherished. I feel that in
some small way the clause undermines excellence in the legal system and
may actually promote short-cuts and a certain sloppiness that we could
do
without.</div>

Government new clause 28, to which the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough spoke, among his other presentations of his views, but with
some of the points that have been raised during the debate by Members
on both sides of the Committee.</div>
					<a name="07112122000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">By those who have opposed not
only the clause as it was originally written but the amendments to the
clause&#151;those who think that the clause should not stand part and
that we should leave the law as it is, which I think is more or less
the position of the Opposition&#151;the view has been expressed that
the provisions have been plucked from the air as a quick press release
by the Government in response to some sort of pressure, that they are
an attempt to look tough. In fact, there has been an extensive period
of consultation lasting a number of years.</div>
					<a name="07112122000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Long before I became a Minister
in the Department and long before the Ministry of Justice existed,
consultations were going on. It is not something that has been plucked
from the air as some sort of faux response to a concern that does not
really exist. To pray in aid, I should like to quote from a couple of
reports. The July 1993 report of the Royal Commission on Criminal
Justice said that nine out of 11 members</div>
					<a name="07112122000601"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;believe the Court of Appeal
should not quash convictions on the grounds of pre-trial malpractice
unless the court thinks that the conviction is or may be unsafe. In the
view of the majority, even if they believed that quashing the
convictions of criminals was an appropriate way of punishing police
malpractice, it would be naïve to suppose that this would have
any practical effect on police behaviour. In any case, it cannot in
their view be morally right that a person who has been convicted on
abundant other evidence and may be a danger to the public should walk
free because of what may be a criminal offence by someone else. Such an
offence should be separately prosecuted within the
system.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Justice
Auld, in a 2001 report on his review of the criminal courts in England

view, consideration should be given to amendment of the present
statutory test to make clear whether and to what extent it should apply
to convictions that would be regarded as safe in the ordinary sense of
the word but follow want of due process before or during
trial&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112122000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government

someone makes a purely procedural error in prosecuting a case, there
might be an argument for not going for a retrial. I am not convinced,
but I would have some sympathy. But if someone involved in a case
committed a criminal act as part of that case, but it still was not
felt that there should be a retrial, I would be extremely worried. I

the next step that the Government wish to take is to prevent
applications being made on the grounds of abusive process before trial.
She cannot logically argue for one and still permit me to prevent the
case from going on ab

Court of Appeal should not concern itself with the procedural
misconduct that has gone on; if the facts suggest guilt, the conviction
should be upheld. If that is right, why then is she
permitting&#151;there is no proposal here to prevent it&#151;the
continuance of the procedure by which defendants&#146; lawyers can
apply to the trial judge to prevent the case from continuing because of
abuse of

seek to do so. We are seeking to deal with a small issue of
long-standing concern to practitioners as well as to politicians. The
quashing of convictions, where people are plainly guilty, which are
forced upon the Court of Appeal because of the current state of the
law, whether or not it thinks it correct, gives rise to serious
concerns in the few cases where that happens. They bring the criminal
justice system generally into a great deal of public
disrepute.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>Court of Appeal must uphold the conviction, even though the cases of
misconduct had occurred in the conduct of the prosecution, either
beforehand or during the course of the trial. What is the logical
difference in upholding the conviction, despite the
prosecution&#146;s misconduct, before the Court of Appeal, but not
before the judge in the first instance? The concept is the same: the
court will not permit misconduct to override the rule of law. Why
should there be a difference?</div>

							<a name="07112122000741"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> It might be a combination of both those things.
There is a procedure within the criminal justice system that allows a
defendant to apply to the court to stop the prosecution because there
has been an abuse of process, some form of misconduct, some withholding
of evidence that the Crown wishes to use, or some form of misconduct by
the police. Armed with the evidence of that abuse of process and
misconduct, the defendant applies to a judge and says, &#147;Look at
all this. I can&#146;t possibly have a fair trial. Stop it.&#148;
The judge will say, &#147;Yes, you have been mistreated. The
procedure has been misapplied. The police have misconducted themselves
and a host of other matters have been brought to my attention that
makes the continuance of this criminal process wrong. I will stop
it.&#148; The Minister is only transferring those facts to the Court
of Appeal after the event. A trial can be stopped before the event
under the current law through an injunction. However, the Minister is
saying, &#147;I do not see a connection between the principles that
will stop a trial before trial, and those that will uphold a conviction
based on a case that has been
abused.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000742"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> No, I was saying that I did not understand the
point that the hon. and learned Gentleman put to me. I hope that I now
understand a little better than I did before. There is a distinction.
In the first instance, there has not been a decision about guilt. The
evidence has not been heard. The defence might make a submission about
abuse of process, and it is then for the judge to decide whether the
trial will go ahead. If the prosecution does not agree with the
findings on which the trial is stopped, there is now a provision
whereby it can appeal to get the trial restarted. With clause 26, we
are dealing with an appeal after the event, when there has been a
finding of guilt in one way or another, and with a small number of
cases in which it is clear to the Court of Appeal on the evidence
available that there is no doubt about guilt. I understand that both
Opposition parties do not see the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div>need for that. They have made that clear and it is a perfectly
understandable and legitimate point of view. The Government, however,
do not agree.</div>
					<a name="07112122000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Broxbourne asked why we could not just have retrials.
Retrials might well be appropriate in some cases. In many cases, they
may be the way to deal with issues that have arisen that make a
conviction unsafe. However, that system does not always work. For
example, it might be impossible to have a retrial because of the
passage of time, the death of a witness or the availability of a
witness. Some cases come to the Court of Appeal many years after the
original conviction. Others take less time to come to court, but people
can die or become unavailable as witnesses very suddenly. It is not
always possible for a retrial to be the answer.</div>
					<a name="07112122000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even when a retrial is
practical, there can be other concerns, such as the effects on victims
or witnesses of having to go through the entire legal process again.
That can sometimes be too much for them. Retrials do the job in some
cases, but they are not the only way to ensure that matters are dealt
with
properly.</div>
					<a name="07112122000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome suggested that the Government
amendments to clause 26 would require the Court of Appeal to retry the
case or to change fundamentally the role of the Court of Appeal. I do
not accept that. The Court will only consider cases in which it is
absolutely clear from the evidence available that there is no
reasonable doubt about
guilt&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>

the new version of Government amendment No. 207, rather than the
original one.</div>
					<a name="07112122000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that that answers many
points made by hon. Members. They have dealt with some of the issues on
the basis of the clause&#146;s original wording. They have not
acknowledged that Government amendment No. 207 changes the effect of
clause 26. It gives more discretion to the judiciary, which will deal
with the matters concerned, particularly in respect of the procedural
irregularity. My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead
acknowledged that after I intervened while he was relating the views of
Liberty to the original
clause.</div>

							<a name="07112122000743"></a>Mr.

						</b> I do not entirely accept what the Minister says
about Government amendment No. 207. Undoubtedly it changes the
threshold and the test that the Court of Appeal must apply, but it
still puts the Court in the position of determining the guilt or
otherwise of the appellant. The original wording required that the
Court of Appeal be satisfied that the appellant was guilty. Now the
Court of Appeal must think that there is no reasonable doubt about the
appellant&#146;s guilt. That is not a change of kind; it is simply a
change of
threshold.</div>

said in my original remarks, which now seem to have been made some time
ago&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I am glad to hear it.
The intention behind the change is to make it clear that the Court of
Appeal is an appeal court and is not supposed to retry entire cases. I
do not know whether it will assist Committee members if I make it clear
that during the formulation of the Government&#146;s amendments to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>clause 26, which are now found in amendment No. 207, we took the
opportunity to clarify the senior judiciary&#146;s views with them
directly.</div>
					<a name="07112122000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that deals with some of the issues mentioned by Committee members in
respect of the points made by Professor Zellick, who wrote to all
Committee members about the Criminal Cases Review Commission&#146;s
views. As I said, it is quite clear that the professor does not suggest
that the clause is unnecessary but has concerns about the wording. We
are now coming to amendment (a) to Government new clause 28, which was
tabled by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. That amendment
would have put the wording suggested by Professor Zellick into the
clause, thus requiring the Court of Appeal to be satisfied that to
disregard a development in the law would not give rise to substantial
injustice. That test has been applied by the Court of Appeal when
deciding whether, exceptionally, it should not disregard such a
development.</div>
					<a name="07112122000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Criminal Cases Review Commission supported the proposed addition of
those words, but the Government are not persuaded that they are
desirable or even appropriate, partly because the meaning of the phrase
&#147;substantial injustice&#148; is insufficiently clear to the
Court to give it effective guidance in exercising its discretion, or to
the Criminal Cases Review Commission when assessing how the Court might
do that. If the Court is required to satisfy itself that exercising its
discretion would not create an injustice, one must wonder what it
normally spends its time doing. The implication is that it spends its
time creating injustice in other circumstances when it is not required
to consider such a test. There is a great lack of clarity about the
meaning of the phrase, which is why it has not been possible for us to
accept the wording proposed by Professor
Zellick.</div>

complain that it is unclear. I will take that complaint as it is
intended, but for goodness&#146; sake, the Minister has had four
months to ask Professor Zellick to explain himself. This suggests that
nothing has been done in that
direction.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div>have also taken the opportunity to clarify the views of the senior
judiciary with them directly. Government amendment No. 207 reflects the
work that has gone on. One of our concerns about Professor
Zellick&#146;s formulation relates to his use of the phrase
&#147;substantial injustice&#148;, which we do not think helps. The
purpose of the change from the clause as originally published in the
Bill to new clause 28 is to give the court wider discretion to decide
when it is appropriate to take notice of a change in the law, according
to the circumstances of an individual case. That is the purpose of what
we have been

100 would impose conditions on new subsection 1(A) so the court would
need to have certain information certified by the trial judge. The hon.
and learned Gentleman is trying to make the same point about the court
not having to retry the whole case at the first instance but it is not
clear what would be gained by this certification. The evidence was
sufficient to prove the prosecution case. If it was incapable of
proving the prosecution case, the first instance judge would have had
it withdrawn; certainly the defendant would not have been found guilty.
On the other hand, if the judge is being invited to express his own
opinions on the strength of the evidence, one wonders what standard he
is expected to apply. Amendment No. 100 does not assist in that
respect. Obviously, the hon. and learned Gentleman will expect me to

No. 101 appears to give the Court of Appeal a discretion to order a
retrial or to quash a conviction in cases where there has been serious
misconduct by anyone involved in the investigation or prosecution of
the offence but the court can, and in fact must, quash a conviction
when it thinks it unsafe and will continue to do so if it thinks it
would seriously undermine the proper administration of justice to do
otherwise. If it does quash a conviction, it may order the appellant to
be retried if that is appropriate in the interests of justice. That
will not be changed by the current formulation of clause
26.</div>
					<a name="07112122000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 102
provides for the referral of serious misconduct to the Attorney-General
by imposing certain requirements on the attorney in cases so referred.
It seems to require the Attorney-General to consider as it talks about
initiating or not initiating. It is a requirement to consider. It is
not clear how far, if at all, it differs from a requirement to consider
taking proceedings that the Attorney-General would already have, nor is
it clear what would be gained by requiring the attorney to consider the
possibility of initiating a prosecution for, say, perverting the course
of justice where such a prosecution was appropriate. It is a bit
unclear but I suppose it is the best way of putting
it.</div>

concerned about.</div>
					<a name="07112122000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes, convictions which
may, on the evidence, be apparently safe, are, in the wider
circumstances, unsafe and should not be sustained. The Government
appear to take a different view, whether as a matter of principle or as
a way of chasing popularity&#151;it is difficult to discern. I am yet
to be persuaded that the Minister has taken on board or dealt
effectively with any arguments that we have made on the difference
between the Court of Appeal striking down the conviction that is
unsustainable on grounds of abuse, and the making of an application
before the first instance judge on the basis of abuse. I am not in the
least impressed by the suggestion that the big difference is that there
is no finding of guilt at the abuse stage&#151;I do not think that
that was the Minister&#146;s best point, if I may say so. We are
talking about an issue of principle, and that does not answer the
principle.</div>
					<a name="07112122000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister mentioned that there are a number of arguments against
retrial, such as the deaths of witnesses and the stress of witnesses
who have to go through the process again, but the Court of Appeal must
consider such things all the time. The prosecution must consider such
things, for example, when it makes an application for retrial when a
jury cannot reach a decision. They are not strange and new concepts for
the courts to deal with&#151;they deal with them every day. If the
absence of witnesses through either illness or death makes a trial
difficult, the Court of Appeal will presumably take that into account
and not order a retrial and quash the conviction, but that is a
judgment it must make on the facts before it.</div>

is much more I can do to persuade the Government of the error of their

defend him&#151;one has only to look at his bullet points in the

his reference to substantial injustice. It might be that the Government
do not want get to grips with the arguments, but that is not to say
that they are not arguments of substance. Bullet points 2, 4, and 7 say
that it</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000778"></a>The

Government amendments Nos. 80 to
83.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000779"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> The purpose of amendments Nos. 79 to 82 is twofold.
First, they make it clear that when the Attorney-General refers an
unduly lenient life or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>indeterminate sentence to the Court of Appeal, the so-called double
jeopardy discount is abolished in respect of any aspect of the sentence
that is varied by the Court of Appeal. Therefore, if the Court of
Appeal were to increase not only the tariff but also another aspect of
the sentence, the fact that the person is being sentenced twice would
not be taken into account on either
point.</div>
					<a name="07112122000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps it
would be of assistance if I were to explain briefly the background to
clause 28. It is concerned with appeals against unduly lenient
sentences. Hon. Members may be aware that part 4 of the Criminal
Justice Act 1988 enables the Attorney-General to refer certain cases to
the Court of Appeal if the sentencing in the Crown court appears to
have been unduly lenient. The Court of Appeal can then review the
sentencing in the case and, where appropriate, increase the
sentence.</div>
					<a name="07112122000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Court of Appeal decides to increase a sentence in such a case it will,
when calculating the sentence, often allow a discount on so-called
double jeopardy grounds to take account of the offender&#146;s
distress and anxiety at being re-sentenced and having to await the
outcome of the
referral.</div>
					<a name="07112122000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
already been legislation in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to prevent
the Court of Appeal from giving such a discount in mandatory life
sentence murder cases. We now propose to extend the prohibition to
apply to other very serious offences for which an unduly lenient
sentence was passed. It seems strange to an ordinary member of the
public that when a sentence is increased because it has been unduly
lenient, the offender should then get a discount in the increased
sentence on the grounds of their distress at being re-sentenced. That
is the point of the clause and the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07112122000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
prohibition would apply in all cases where the Crown court has imposed
a discretionary life or indeterminate sentence. The clause does not
contain anything new in principle, in the sense that this has already
been done in respect of mandatory life sentences. That discount has
already been abolished, so there is a clear precedent for the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07112122000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
clause as drafted, where the Court of Appeal decides to increase the
minimum period ordered by the Crown court to be served under a life or
indeterminate sentence, or, indeed, where it alters the sentence in
another way, no discount may be
given.</div>
					<a name="07112122000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
have a largely technical flavour. They have two purposes: primarily,
they ensure that when the Attorney-General refers an unduly lenient
life or indeterminate sentence to the Court of Appeal, the discount
cannot apply to the Court&#146;s review of any aspect of the
sentence, not just the tariff. In doing so, they also remove a
technical ambiguity in the clause as it appears in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112122000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause as currently drafted followed the structure of existing section
36(3A); that is, it focused only on the Court of Appeal&#146;s
variation of the tariff or minimum term. That is because section 36(3A)
currently applies only to mandatory life sentences, so the minimum term
is the only aspect that would be under review by the Court of Appeal.
However, now that the provision is to be extended to include
discretionary life and indeterminate sentences, the Court of Appeal may
in limited circumstances 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div>want to vary another aspect of the sentence. For example, in some cases
covered by the clause, the Court of Appeal might decide to increase an
indeterminate sentence to a discretionary life sentence. The amendments
will ensure that, as was always intended, the discount will not be
available in relation to any aspect&#151;not just the minimum
term&#151;of the sentence reviewed by the
Court.</div>

					<a name="07112122000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
Amendment No. 83 applies to provisions for the unduly lenient
sentencing appeals scheme in Northern Ireland, and we will be tabling
further amendments in due course to fully extend provisions in clause
28 to Northern Ireland, as the Northern Ireland Office has asked us to
do. I commend the amendments and the clause to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07112122000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000780"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The amendments are perhaps not ones that I would
have tabled, but they are not sufficiently egregious as to require
being voted
against.</div>
					<a name="07112122000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
context of clause 28, will the Minister agree with me that we should
cease the practice that has grown up over the last few years of the
Attorney-General, or some other Government Minister, inviting a
colleague to table a written parliamentary question calling for a list
to be published of individual judges who have been the subject of
unduly lenient appeals? I hope that the Minister knows that, once or
twice a year, articles appear in several of the tabloids in which
individual judges are picked out and subjected to personal
criticism&#151;often there are photographs of them. She will be able
to imagine the sort of headlines that go with such stories. They are
based on written parliamentary questions from Government members to the
Minister. She knows the procedure&#151;the planted question. They are
designed to cause difficulties, among other things, for those
judges.</div>
					<a name="07112122000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nobody knows
why a judge in any given case passes a particular sentence, apart from
the judge themselves, those listening in court to his or her sentencing
remarks, and the Court of Appeal, which will have listened to the
arguments of the Attorney-General when the case of the unduly lenient
appeal was advanced. If we are to have a system under which
judges&#146; unduly limited sentences are to be appealed&#151;the
Conservatives introduced that system when they were in
Government&#151;let us leave it at that. However, we should not
resort to the organised public abuse of individual
judges.</div>

							<b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I
understand the point that the hon. and learned Gentleman is making
about not castigating people generally and about the way in which the
tabloid media can trivialise, if you like, what are very important
issues. However, does he not find it shocking that in some two thirds
of the cases that the Attorney-General takes to appeal, the finding of
senior judges&#151;not the media or politicians&#151;has been that
an unduly lenient sentence was passed? We should bear it in mind that
such a finding has to pass the test that not only was the original
sentence unduly lenient, but unreasonably so. Is that not a matter of
genuine public concern?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000782"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The public concern is dealt with by having the
process that the Conservative Government introduced when it was in
office. That process permits unduly lenient sentences to be appealed
through the office of the
Attorney-General.</div>
					<a name="07112122000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000783"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> It does indeed deal with the mischief of the
particular sentence, but is the hon. and learned Gentleman not shocked
by such a proportion of unduly lenient sentences? That is a criticism
from senior judges, not politicians or the
media.</div>
				
					<a name="07112122000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000784"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> No, I do not find it shocking. What I find
welcoming is that there is a procedure that deals with the issue. Nor
do I find it shocking, for example, that the Court of Appeal quashes
convictions. Its purpose is to provide a proper braking system, or a
sieve, to prevent injustice either to a wrongly convicted or overly
sentenced defendant, or to a victim who sees a defendant given an
unduly lenient sentence. However, we should not engineer a system
whereby planted questions lead to the unnecessary abuse of individuals.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000785"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I should find it shocking if the Court of Appeal
were not prepared to act on a high proportion of the referrals from the
Attorney-General, because that would suggest that the Attorney-General
was bringing forward trivial issues of leniency, rather than executing
his or her proper judgment in the case and putting forward those
referrals for which there genuinely was a case to be
answered.</div>
					<a name="07112122000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000786"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I think that I probably agree with the hon.
Gentleman. All I wanted to say, and I have said it several times, is
that we should not allow planted questions to lead to the unfair abuse
of judges. I say that because I had been sitting in court, and on
adjournment I met judges who had been listed in <i class="I">The Sun</i> or
whatever newspaper it is that carries those lists. If the Committee had
seen the anguish of those people, who felt that their integrity and
judicial conduct was being savaged quite improperly, it would
understand what I am saying. I do not suggest that Ministers
deliberately set out to boil the reputations of individual judges, but
it is a consequence of those planted questions. Of course, as the right
hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth says, there is a public
interest in knowing that the Court of Appeal is increasing sentences
that are unduly lenient, but we do not need to go on from that and pick
out individual judges and pillory them as though they were proper
subjects of personal abuse.</div>

							<a name="07112122000787"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I am not in a position to put any boundary around
what individual Members might ask in their parliamentary questions, but
as a Minister, I certainly should not seek to have such a question
asked. I hope the Committee heard the Minister of State, Ministry of
Justice say earlier that he did not seek to question the sentencing or
behaviour of individual judges as part of the way in which he does his
job. The Secretary of State feels the same way, so I hope that I can
give the hon. and learned Gentleman the assurance that Ministers in the
Ministry of Justice would not seek to do such a thing. That is not to
say  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div>that individual Members do not have a perfect right to put down any
question to any Department. That is part of parliamentary scrutiny, and

							<a name="07112122000790"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The amendments all deal with the parliamentary
accountability of the commissioner or, as is currently presented in the
Bill, the absence of such parliamentary accountability. Some of us who
were at the evidence session before the end of the last Session of
Parliament will remember when I asked the commissioner whether he would
prefer his reports to be laid before Parliament rather than given to
the Secretary of State. I asked whether he would prefer to be in a
similar position to an ombudsman or even a judge. Thereby, although he
would be paid for and appointed by either the Crown or Government, the
line of accountability would go directly from him to Parliament, not to
a Minister.</div>
					<a name="07112122000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
why I have tabled the amendments, which would change the situation so
that the commissioner would lay a copy of his report before both Houses
of Parliament. They would delete the reference to the Secretary of
State in that regard. It is a matter of constitutional accountability.
That would undermine the work of neither the commissioner, nor the
Secretary of State. It would get the Secretary of State&#146;s
fingers off the report so that they could not edit it before it gets to
Parliament.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>
					<a name="07112122000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the Bill
as it is currently drafted, a report from the commissioner will get
before Parliament, but not before the Secretary of State has had a look
at it. I think that the Secretary of State has no business interfering
with the terms, wording or conclusion of any report that he may have.
He can answer in Parliament for any remarks that the commissioner might
make, but he should be given no editorial role or power to interfere
between the completion of the commissioner&#146;s report and its
presentation to Parliament.</div>

have not had the opportunity to do the research. It seems that there
would be considerable merit in having a common statutory format for the
appointment of those officers of the Crown. That way, we would not have
to discuss the details of the form of appointment and removal from
office because there would be a common form with which the House was
content, until such time as it might choose to have a different form.
Therefore, I ask the Minister whether that position is directly
comparable to other offices that are appointed by the Crown and fill
analogous roles
elsewhere.</div>

						</b> I would like to respond to the amendments that the
hon. and learned Member for Harborough has proposed and hopefully
reassure him that they are not necessary. Their purpose is to give the
commissioner and not the Secretary of State the power to lay reports
directly before Parliament. As he made clear, his intention is to try
to increase the perceived independence of the commissioner and ensure
that the Secretary of State cannot suppress or alter a report. I hope
that he is reassured by what the incumbent said when giving evidence to
the Committee; there has never been any instance in his time when the
Secretary of State has sought to impinge upon his independence or
interfere in any way with any of his reports. I hope that the hon. and
learned Gentleman accepts that that is the case. I hope that, in
resorting to some of his more flowery language, he was not suggesting
for one moment that the current Secretary of State or indeed anyone has
sought to do such a thing or to interfere with or suppress reports of
the current prisons and probation ombudsman in any way. The situation
was made clear in evidence to the
Committee.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07112122000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise, of
course, that the laying of reports by the Secretary of State might give
rise to concerns about the commissioner&#146;s independence. We
sought to obtain views from the British and Irish Ombudsman Association
on the best way to deal with the laying of reports and on who should
undertake that task for different Parliaments. The association
recommended that the new commissioner&#146;s reports should be
published by him in his own right, and that the Secretary of State
should then be required to lay them before Parliament. That is what we
have provided for in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112122000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
constitutional arrangements set out in the Bill are therefore broadly
comparable with those for other ombudsmen operating in similar
situations to that of the new commissioner for offender management in
prisons, whose post will exist once the Bill is on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>statute book. There are various differences in detail that reflect the
individual terms of reference of the different types of ombudsman, but
the association certainly recommended that the arrangements were the
correct way of proceeding.</div>
					<a name="07112122000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">An alternative view is that the
Secretary of State is responsible to Parliament for such matters, and
that he therefore ought to lay the report. We sought to make sure that
there could be no question of a Secretary of State changing a report
that he thought might be inconvenient, or delaying the laying of such a
report. The Bill requires laying to take place as
soon as practicable after receipt. The commissioner will be sponsored
by and will report to the Secretary of State for Justice. It therefore
seems right that that Minister should have responsibility for laying
the commissioner&#146;s report, but I can assure the Committee that
there will be no question of interference or delay. I hope that the
enables the hon. and learned Gentleman to withdraw the amendment, but
clearly that decision is a matter for him.</div>

						</b> I think that the Minister was a little too
defensive at the outset. We are making law for the long term; we are
not concerned with the individual holder of the office of Secretary of
State at the moment. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Blackburn
(Mr. Straw) would never suppress anything, and I have never
suggested otherwise. However, we need proper lines of accountability
and I happen to think that office holders such as the commissioner
should not have to present things as difficult or anxiety-inducing as
reports on the conduct of our prisons and on offender management
directly to the person who is in charge of the political management of
prisons. It would be better for the commissioner to report directly to
Parliament, and then we can cross-examine the Minister on the report,
or debate the report, at an appropriate time. It is a simple question
of accountability.</div>
					<a name="07112122000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
happen to disagree with the Minister, but I shall not press the

						</b> Clause 30 details the eligible
complaints that the new commissioner might consider. The amendments
change the method for excluding complaints about health matters and
remove from the commissioner&#146;s remit health care provided
directly by a service. The purpose of the amendments is to reduce
duplication and prevent overlap at the margins between the roles of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>existing commissioners and ombudsmen and the new commissioner for
offender management and prisons.</div>
					<a name="07112122000457"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the exclusion in
amendment No. 286 is to achieve the correct fit with the remit of the
parliamentary commissioner and the health service commissioner
responsible for dealing with complaints from prisoners and the public
about health care matters. There is a clear advantage in the expertise
of investigation and effectiveness of recommendations, and it is
desirable that it reinforces the position of the prisoner as a service
recipient on the same basis as any other citizen. We do not want the
new commissioner simply to investigate any complaint from a prisoner if
it is more sensible for the complaint to be dealt with by the
parliamentary commissioner or the health service commissioner. To add
such matters to the new commissioner&#146;s remit could lead to
duplication, confusion and rather invidious competition between the
commissioners and the ombudsmen.</div>

							<a name="07112122000797"></a>Mr.

						</b> I understand why the Government do not want
competing jurisdictions between commissioners and ombudsmen, but would
not it be better, in terms of organisation and ease of access, for the
commissioner to refer cases on matters not within his remit to the
health service ombudsman, rather than expect the prisoner to apply to
someone completely different? A one-stop-shop approach would be just as
appropriate to the prison system as to the general
public.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000798"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> That is effectively what will happen.
There are already grey areas, and prisoners who might
be better dealt with by the health service ombudsman might talk first
to the current prison and probation ombudsman. Part 4 deals with having
joint reports where that is sensible. We expect not to have hard and
fast boundaries in the sense that someone will be sent away and have to
start again; there will be sensible co-operation between the
parliamentary commissioner, health service commissioner and the new
commissioner. We are not trying to create or facilitate jurisdictional
disputes, but seeking to make it easy to avoid them. Amending the Bill,
rather than using an order under clause 30(4), as we had originally
intended, will provide greater clarity regarding the new
commissioner&#146;s complaints remit. That must be
sensible.</div>
					<a name="07112122000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 287 will allow for the possibility of defining more clearly over
time, and with experience, which matters of health care provision will
be included in the new commissioner&#146;s complaints remit. Some
matters that are related to the provision of health care might go
beyond the commissioner&#146;s complaints remit. Such matters are not
easily distinguishable and require negotiation between the new
commissioner, the health service commissioner and other ombudsmen. I am
sure that, in time, as they settle in with the new arrangements and the
work that they do between them, it will become clear what sort of
complaint should be dealt with by which process. There is no interest
in us facilitating dispute or duplication at the boundaries between the
ombudsmen&#146;s remits, and we hope that the amendments make it
clear where the boundaries should lie. Later provisions in part 4 deal
with sensible arrangements for joint reporting and so
on.</div>

							<a name="07112122000799"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Before the Under-Secretary spoke, I had some
misgivings, which have been allayed to some extent by what she said. I
was fearful that the Secretary of State would, under amendment No. 287,
simply redefine what the commissioner could look at in relation to
health care and neuter him. Under clause 32&#151;this feeds into the
point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome&#151;the
commissioner will have the remit to consider the eligibility of a
complaint and can take action under subsection (3)(b), which states
that</div>
					<a name="07112122000605"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;taking, or
facilitating the taking by another person of, any other action
(such as mediation or conciliation) which the Commissioner considers
may result in the resolution of the
complaint&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112122000462"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know whether the Government believe that the words in brackets
limit the other action to mediation or conciliation, but I hope that
the clause deals with the concern that the hon. Gentleman and I had
that the Secretary of State would simply cut the commissioner&#146;s
power to look into health care matters because that might be
politically inconvenient. If the commissioner can refer matters to the
health ombudsman or the appropriate office holder under clause 32, my
fears are dealt
with.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000800"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am not sure that my fears are entirely dealt
with. I am reassured by what the Under-Secretary said, and the
intention is clearly that the commissioner should behave in what we all
consider to be a sensible way if a complaint can be better investigated
by an alternative ombudsman. There will be grey areas, and the hon. and
learned Gentleman is right in suggesting that one instance would be if
an artificial barrier to appropriate health treatment were created in
the prison system, because of physical barriers or the attitude of
staff within the system. There will also be grey areas in mental health
and drugs, which are current concerns in the prison estate, and the
border between proper health provision and the proper province of the
commissioner for offender management and prisons. Those grey areas
should be elucidated in time.</div>
					<a name="07112122000464"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Under-Secretary rightly
said that there is provision later in this part of the Bill for a
thorough look at complaints, and I take it, as did the hon. and learned

point.</div>

						</b> It has taken us a long time to get here, but it is
a first for the Committee that my right hon. Friend the Minister of
State has signed one of the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s
amendments. I am not promising that that will ever happen again, but
clearly it is something that we ought to celebrate. I can tell him, if
he is interested, why my right hon. Friend and the Government wished to
support his amendment. The additional power to modify other enactments
provided by this provision will not be necessary when using the power
to exclude matters from the complaints remit. There is a general power
in clause 123(2)(c). We do not think that we will need to modify
primary legislation with respect to all of this.</div>
					<a name="07112122000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and learned Gentleman
had some questions about what kind of excluded matters the Secretary of
State might be considering and what kind of matters might be excluded
under clause 30(2). I might be able to reassure him about our
intentions. We have a working list of matters that we would expect to
be excluded. For example, we intend to use the order-making power in
clause 34(4) to exclude any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>matter within the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration, a member of the Commission of Local Administration, the
Scottish public services ombudsman, or the Welsh public services
ombudsman. The measure is thus another way of ensuring that there is a
clear boundary between the remits of the various ombudsmen. Therefore,
we need a power just to exclude those matters that are within the remit
of other ombudsmen.</div>
					<a name="07112122000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also seeking to exclude some matters apart from other jurisdictions
and other remits. For example, we want to exclude the conduct of the
police from the remit of the commissioner, partly because we have the
Independent Police Complaints Commission, which deals with those
matters. We want to exclude from the complaints remit the commencement
or conduct of proceedings before a court, because those would be
matters for the court or legal professional bodies. We are seeking to
address such issues. There is nothing sinister about the process. We
are not seeking to exclude any complaint that might be found in favour
of the prisoner, or any such thing. On that basis, I hope that the hon.
and learned Gentleman will be reassured in respect of the concerns
expressed through amendment No. 145, which we do not
support.</div>
					<a name="07112122000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments are minor and technical. Among other things, they
will remove the overlap with the general power in clause 123(2)(c),
which provides the order-making power in the Bill. Powers in the Bill
include a power to make consequential provision. The amendments also
ensure that an order made under the powers in part 4 cannot encroach on
matters within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament,
which is, of course, very important&#151;we do not want to do things
such as that. As I have said, the Government amendments are minor and
technical, so I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman might be
persuaded to withdraw amendment No. 145 and that the other Government
amendments&#151;and his amendment No. 146&#151;will be supported by
the Committee.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000809"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that elucidation.
I entirely support her view that complaints against the police should
be excluded, because otherwise, frankly, the commissioner would deal
with nothing else, if my experience of complaints by those awaiting
trial or those who have been convicted is anything to go by. Such
complaints keep the investigatory services of the police forces fully
engaged most of the time.</div>
					<a name="07112122000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the other ombudsmen
and similar bodies to which the Minister referred are almost word for
word the list of persons and bodies given in the subsection to which
she has helpfully drawn my attention: clause 42(6). Listed in that
group is the health service commissioner for England. I am not trying
to revisit the previous discussion, but I wonder why it was felt
necessary to refer explicitly to health as an excluded item, when the
other areas can be dealt with simply by the order-making power to which
she referred to deal with the proper province of the other ombudsmen,
which she suggested would also be in the excluded items. I am sure that
there is a very good 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>reason why one item has to be drafted one way and all the rest can be
drafted another way, but perhaps we will have to wait for a later
stage, or a letter, to discover that
reason.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000810"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> In the light of what the Minister said, I wonder
whether she could publish the list of excluded matters. I do not
suppose that it needs to be in the Bill, but it certainly needs to be
made public so that we all know what we are legislating about and what
the Government have in mind when it comes to considering the remit of
the commissioner.</div>
					<a name="07112122000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that the Secretary of State would ensure that the
commissioner would not deal with police matters. I am concerned about
deaths in police custody. Schedule 8, which is titled
&#147;The Commissioner&#146;s deaths remit&#148;,
says:</div>
					<a name="07112122000608"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A death
of a person while in the custody, or under the control or escort, of
prison officers or prisoner custody officers anywhere in the
world.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000484"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure about Government amendments
Nos. 315, 316, 302, 304, 317 and 310 to 312, which we will
discuss under that schedule, because I have not looked at them,
although I know that amendments Nos. 315 and 316 deal with Scotland. I
sincerely hope that Government amendments will not delete paragraph 2
of schedule 8, but we need a little bit of clarification from somebody.
Operation Safeguard has been extended until the end of the year and I
have no doubt that the Minister of State will be extending it until
Christmas 2008, given the way we are going at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="07112122000485"></a><div class="hs_Para">The official
Opposition think that setting up the commissioner is a good thing. We
want him to do a thorough job on behalf of the public and we ask the
Minister for a bit of clarity about the commissioner&#146;s remit in
relation to the investigation of deaths in custody, especially police
custody, and how that fits into what she told us a moment
ago.</div>

						</b> Those matters are already within the remit. In
respect of the working list of excluded matters, which I will let the
Committee see, I said that we were minded to exclude the conduct of
police because that is what the Independent Police Complaints
Commission will investigate. If a prisoner dies in a police cell, the
death will be investigated by the IPCC. We would not propose to change
the current arrangement&#151;I hope that that clarifies
matters.</div>

schedule 8 seems to say something else. Anyhow, I think that I have
made the point that I wanted to get across. The Minister will have to
try to explain paragraph 2 of the schedule to which I drew the
Committee&#146;s attention a moment ago. Having said that, this
debate has served its purpose, because we are now going to get the
working list published. However, will the Minister please publish it
not just by sending Committee members a letter, but publicly, so that
members of the public beyond the Committee can have some understanding
of what is going on? The outside world will otherwise have to piece
these things together like a complicated jigsaw puzzle. It would be
useful for the list to be published on the Ministry of Justice website
or some other place to which the public may have access.</div>

					<a name="07112122000509"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment no. 148 deals with
subsection (2)(c), which states that the requirements are
that</div>
					<a name="07112122000611"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where the
responsible authority has responded to the substance of the complaint
following such a communication (whether by rejecting it or by
addressing it in some other way), that a period of no more than three
months has passed since it did
so.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112122000510"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would substitute a
period of 12 months.</div>
					<a name="07112122000511"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I want to know why the
Government have chosen a limitation period of one year for making an
initial complaint, and a three-month limitation period for bringing a
further complaint based on the adjudication. In civil law, a limitation
period of three years is not unheard of. I appreciate that some torts
have a limitation period of one year, but there is a procedure by
which, if the complaint or the cause of action became known to the
complainant only after that period has elapsed, the court has
discretion to extend the
period.</div>
					<a name="07112122000512"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we are
dealing with prisoners, many of whom may be intellectually impaired,
mentally ill or badly affected by substance abuse of one sort or
another, one year will not necessarily for them to get their heads
around the issues confronting them. Equally, three months is quite a
short period of time for the typical prisoner&#151;the typical person
affected&#151;to take advice or, off his own bat, to do something
about the response from the responsible
authority.</div>
					<a name="07112122000513"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are not earth-shattering, but they are humane and sensible,
and do not undermine the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>power of the commissioner to act properly in any given case, prevent him
from rejecting complaints, or make him do things which he would not
think proper in the ordinary course of. They would provide a little
more
justice.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000822"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I have listened very carefully to the hon. and
learned Gentleman; I think that there is a proviso in subsection (3) to
give the commissioner the discretion to waive the time limits where it
seems appropriate to do so. My concern is slightly different. I agree
with him about the three-month period; I am not so sure about the 12
months&#146; initial complaint limitation, but three months following
the response is a relatively short time, particularly in the context of
many of the people who find themselves on the prison
estate.</div>
					<a name="07112122000515"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question to
the Under-Secretary of State for Justice is different. Perhaps she will
be able to help me by pointing out where else in the statute or in
other regulations is the time limit for the responsible authority to
respond to the initial complaint. Because, in the provision it would be
perfectly possible for a not very responsible authority to delay its
response to the person to the point where the complaint became time
barred under subsection (2)(a). I can find no requirement in this part
for the delivery of the responsible authority&#146;s response to the
substance of the complaint. As I say, that may be elsewhere in the
complaints procedure or the Bill, but I am not sure where and I hope
that the Minister may be able to
help.</div>
					<a name="07112122000516"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000823"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> We believe that the time limit reflects the fact
that investigation by the commissioner, which is an administrative
process rather than a judicial one, is most useful when engaged with
matters that are reasonably fresh and still capable of worthwhile
resolution. We consider that, in the vast majority of cases, the
deadlines set out in clause 31 will give complainants sufficient time
to raise grievances with the
commissioner.</div>
					<a name="07112122000517"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
setting a time limit, we have followed two main principles: first, that
the commissioner will not act on complaints beyond a year; and,
secondly, that the person must have given the prison or the body
complained against a reasonable opportunity to deal with the substance
of the complaint, which relates to the point that the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome made. I do not think that we define in part 4 or
elsewhere in the Bill what that period should be; it would depend on
the facts of each individual case. There will be some minor complaints
to which it would be reasonable for the controlling authority to
respond quickly and there will more complex complaints that take longer
to deal with. &#147;Reasonable&#148; is one of those words that
ought to be clear, one hopes, from the context of the
complaint&#151;its seriousness, when it was made and so on. That is
subject to common
sense.</div>
					<a name="07112122000518"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000824"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I accept that, but at the moment the provision
gives comfort to the authority that it will have reasonable time to
respond. I agree that common sense suggests that a complex complaint
will take longer to investigate. However, the clause does not give 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>any comfort to the complainant in cases where the responsible authority
simply delays responding. For example, the responding authority may not
respond for 12 months. It could respond on 31 December to a complaint
made on 1 January. I assume that the commission would apply its
discretion in those circumstances, but that complaint would then be
time barred, however unreasonable the response of the authority.
Reasonableness works both ways and there should be not only a
reasonable period for investigation, but a reasonable expectation that
the authority will respond in a timely way to a complaint that is made
to
it.</div>
					<a name="07112122000519"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000825"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has answered his own question in
the sense that the person who has made the complaint is not getting a
response. He still has three months from when he gets the response to
refer the matter to the commissioner. If the controlling authority sits
for 12 months without responding, that is a case in which the
commissioner might well exercise the discretion that we have given him
in clause 31 to act on complaints made outside the deadlines, if he has
good reason to do so. If a delay was the fault of the body concerned,
that might be a very good reason to deal with the complaint and I am
sure that that is what would happen in
practice.</div>
					<a name="07112122000520"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not
a formal judicial court procedure in which the limitation has to go
into years. We think that the commissioner is dealing with situations
in which the speedy resolution of complaints is best. We believe that
the time limits set out in the clause are appropriate, but as a
back-stop, the commissioner has the discretion to act outside those
time limits if he feels that, in the circumstances, justice would not
be served if the deadlines were adhered to strictly. On that basis, I
hope that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough feels able to
withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000826"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I did not propose the amendment thinking that it
would make the Government change their mind, and I take into account
the wording of subsection (3). However, at the moment the default
setting would be governed by the periods of one year and three months.
Therefore, the complainant would have to persuade the commissioner to
do something to extend those periods in the right circumstances. I
would prefer there to be a longer period for consideration in
subsection (2)(a) and (c). The commissioner would therefore not have to
use his discretion in subsection (3). Bearing in mind the sort of
people who are likely to be making the complaints, there will be a need
for the commissioner to exercise his power under subsection (3) rather
more often than he might like. That is the simple reason why I want to
change the periods set out in subsection
(2).</div>
					<a name="07112122000522"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not press
the amendment to a Division, but I urge the Government, if a lot of
complaints are coming in out of time once the commissioner is up and
running and he is spending far too much time dealing with out-of-time
applications, to consider reconsidering the limitation periods. I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07112122000829"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The issue is simple: whether the commissioner,
having reached a conclusion on a complaint, should make his decision
known in writing. The Government seem happy that, in certain
circumstances, he should give his answer in oral as opposed to written
form. I suspect that when dealing with the sort of people who are
likely to make complaints about the conduct of the system of offender
management and prisons, a written answer would be preferable and more
sensible, as it would prevent
misunderstandings.</div>
					<a name="07112122000534"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
amendment No. 150, I suggest that the commissioner should notify the
complainant in writing with a brief statement of the reasons for his
decision, and may notify such other persons as he sees fit. Amendment
No. 151 deals with the notification of other people, which should be
clarified so that subsection (8) states: &#147;Notification to
persons other than the complainant may be given orally.&#148; That
ties in with amendment No. 150. Amendment No. 152 deals with subsection
(2), which states that the Commissioner may &#147;make a report
orally&#148;. I suggest that it should state that the Commissioner
may not make a report orally, which is consistent with my other
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07112122000535"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
and large, complainants will come from the category
of convicted persons. We know about problems of illiteracy,
intellectual capacity and drug habits and the difficulties that many
offenders have in coming to terms with all sorts of things, and coming
to terms with an oral response to a complaint will not necessarily be
easy for them. The short answer is why not save us a lot of bother and
uncertainty by requiring the commissioner to make the reports in
writing? It may well be that, as a matter of practice, he will make the
reports in writing, but there is no harm in putting it in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112122000536"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112122000830"></a>Maria
Eagle:
						</b> Amendment No. 150 would require the commissioner to
notify the complainant in writing if a complaint was rejected or a
complaint investigation was deferred, stopped or reopened. Amendment
No. 151 would only permit such notification to be made orally to
persons other than the complainant. Amendment No. 152 would prevent the
commissioner from making a report of a complaint investigation
orally.</div>
					<a name="07112122000537"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Gentleman has set out his reasons for tabling the amendments.
We consider that flexibility regarding the form of the report is
needed, and we want discretion to be with the commissioner. He needs to
be able to maximise his efficiency and the effectiveness of his
responses by tailoring them to the needs of recipients and the
circumstances of each case. We expect that in the majority of cases, as
the hon. and learned Gentleman ended by saying, written notifications
and reports will be the norm, but in some circumstances it may well be
appropriate for the commissioner to relay such information
orally.</div>
					<a name="07112122000538"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, it is possible that some complaints relating to minor or
straightforward matters could be resolved by a few brief telephone
conversations between the complainant, the commissioner and the prison.
In such circumstances, it might be unduly bureaucratic&#151;the hon.
and learned Gentleman is rarely accused of wanting that&#151;and
burdensome for the commissioner to have to produce a full written
report.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 435</div>
					<a name="07112122000539"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that the commissioner
is best placed to make judgments and decisions about whether it would
be appropriate for such reports or notifications to be made orally,
based on the needs of each complainant and the circumstances of each
case. However, we expect that the commissioner will produce and publish
detailed guidance about the procedures for dealing with complaints,
complainants and the bodies against whom the complaints are made. He
