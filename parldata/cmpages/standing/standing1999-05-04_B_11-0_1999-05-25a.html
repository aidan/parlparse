<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) asked about the availability of capital allowances for employers who purchase cycles and cyclist's safety equipment that they lend to their employees tax free. Clause 47 makes no change to the deductibility for tax purposes of such expenditure by an employer. The normal rules will apply. Capital allowances will be available for expenditure on cycles and cyclist's safety equipment.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): The Economic Secretary may recall that I mentioned the level of allowances on bicycles and cyclist's safety equipment. I think she told me that long-life asset treatment would be provided for both. I hope that she might consider that short-life asset capital allowances should be available, at least for cyclist's safety equipment.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am addressing that question for both cycles and cyclist's safety equipment. Those items will not, in general, be long-life assets because they do not have an expected life of more than 25 years. Capital allowances will be given on the normal 25 per cent. per annum reducing arrangements. I hope that that clarifies what is an important point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): I failed to catch your eye at 4.30 pm, Mr. Butterfill. I hope that I am not speaking out of order now that the Economic Secretary has spoken.
<P>
I am interested in clause 47 not because I came to work this morning on a bicycle or because I intend to do so once the clause stands part of the Bill, but because I want to emphasise my support for the Government's commitment to using the tax system to promote sustainable forms of transport and to underpin a green transport plan. Sustainable forms of transport benefit us all because we all depend on the quality of air that we breathe. Green transport plans have particular relevance to those of us who live in major cities such as London. The Wimbledon city transport forum in my constituency has succeeded in persuading local authorities to publicise the prevailing figures for nitrous oxide and particulates in our area on an electronic notice board outside Wimbledon station. I hope that that will increase public pressure to reduce pollution. My constituents will be delighted to know that the Government share the commitment to that objective and have started to use the tax system to bring that about.
<P>
We heard that car numbers are increasing. That is to be expected. Not everyone in Britain owns a car, but more people will acquire one as economic growth and employment continue to increase.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) must resume his seat. He cannot sort out his filing by standing between me and the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Casale).
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. I am sure that my hon. Friend was demonstrating spontaneous enthusiastic support for my comments.
<P>
There is a great difference between owning a car and using one every day to drive to work. The 10-mile traffic jam into London--it is the same in any other major city in the industrialised world--gives the lie to the idea that the public interest is best served by allowing the unfettered expression of individual free choice. Car use is one of the best examples of the need for regulation, if free markets are to work properly and not to lead to contradictory and self-defeating outcomes. I mention that because the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell)--who is not at present in his seat--seemed to suggest during our earlier debate on the amendments that there was no positive role for Government in promoting more rational and beneficial modes of behaviour, such as encouraging people to cycle.
<P>
I do not own a car, and I use public transport to get to work. I do not publicise that fact widely in my constituency, for fear that I may be thought sanctimonious and holier-than-thou. My not using a car is as much a matter of convenience as of environmental zeal, and I hesitate to be too high-handed in urging my constituents to do the same. However, as public policy makers, hon. Members on both sides of the House have a duty to lead by example if serious progress is to be made in cutting congestion and pollution in cities and towns. Perhaps it would grate with hon. Members for historical reasons if I were to say to them, ``Get on your bike'', but more should be persuaded to leave their cars at home.
<P>
As I was preparing my speech I noticed an interesting photograph on the front page of yesterday's Financial Times, showing a large number of cyclists riding past Big Ben into Parliament square. I thought that perhaps it was a futuristic vision of how hon. Members would go from the Houses of Parliament to their constituencies, once the Serjeant at Arms had implemented some of the measures in the Bill by providing bicycles and cycle racks at the House of Commons. In fact it was the preliminary stage of the Prutour of Britain, in which the cyclists were setting off for Scotland, Wales and elsewhere. Those people will cycle 732 miles, which should encourage more of us to cycle between our place of work and home.
<P>
I am not against car use. Neither are the Government, or the groups in my constituency who campaign for increased public investment in sustainable forms of transport. Among those is the Merton cycling campaign, which organises an annual event with the London borough of Merton to publicise the case for greener forms of transport, called ``Don't choke Merton''. Hon. Members might assume that that campaign involves cyclists trying to get in the way of cars. In fact, it involves a timed race to the civic centre of Merton by groups of commuters who start their journeys from different locations in the borough using a variety of means of transport including private cars. Of course, the cyclists arrive well before everyone else, as I can testify as I am usually there from 8o'clock in the morning to welcome them. Year after year, I restate the Government's commitment to promoting cycling as an environmentally friendly form of transport. I know that my constituents, and the members of that campaign group, will be delighted with this clause.
<P>
The clause does not address certain other issues, in the context of an integrated transport strategy. In my constituency--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been fairly tolerant with the hon. Gentleman so far, because what he has said has gone rather wide of the scope of the clause. I shall not be so tolerant if he proceeds to talk about an integrated transport policy. He must now return to the content of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> I accept your admonishment, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
Clause 47 represents a modest but important step towards achieving a public policy objective widely shared by hon. Members on both sides of the House, and by many people outside. Logically, such an approach seeks to increase the taxation on environmental ills such as noxious exhaust fumes, while rewarding those who travel at little or no cost to the environment by eliminating taxes on greener forms of transport.
<P>
Moreover, by introducing a range of capital allowances on bicycles made available to employees by their employers, and on the provision of alternative transport--for example, when car-sharing arrangements break down--the Government are providing further positive incentives to those who choose green forms of transport, as well as removing the tax disincentives to do so.
<P>
For employers still in doubt as to whether to encourage their employees to use bicycles, the prospect of reduced paperwork resulting from the removal of tax charges will provide a further, perhaps decisive incentive. What could be more absurd than to insist that, for tax purposes, businesses make complex calculations of the benefits to employees of issuing bicycle clips and providing bike sheds and shower facilities? That was the policy that we inherited from the previous Government, although Opposition spokesmen have made it clear that they were unaware of it.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would assure the Committee that the Government are committed to ensuring that the clause has its full and desired effect in changing people's behaviour. I am slightly concerned about the need for adequate publicity to promote the clause and about legal definitions of categories of employees included within its scope.
<P>
It is regrettable that much of the publicity surrounding the Budget has so far focused on policies such as the road fuel escalator, which the Government inherited from the Conservative party. The clause will set the road fuel escalator in the context of a coherent and genuinely new overall approach to environmental taxation. The unemployed were the only people that the previous Government tried to get on their bikes, on the assumption that the world economy would suddenly come up trumps if such people went to the trouble of cycling round the corner. I hope that this Government's kinder, greener, well-intentioned invitation--to employers as well as employees--to cycle will be publicised as widely and with equal force.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would clarify three important points in respect of legal definitions of categories of employees. First, subsection 4(b) refers to journeys made
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``between one workplace and another.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will that include any work-related trip undertaken by an employee during working hours, or only trips between workplace A and workplace B? For example, a local authority planner or health officer might wish to visit work sites on a bicycle supplied by an employer. One thinks also of journeys undertaken by hon. Members between outlying buildings and the House of Commons in order to vote. Fewer hon. Members might be late for votes if such journeys were undertaken by bicycle. The clause's purpose is, wherever possible, to promote sustainable forms of work-related transport, but the Economic Secretary may wish to emphasise that point for clarification.
<P>
Secondly, will the new regulations cover people who use a bicycle to visit their clients? Such trips help to cut congestion and improve air quality and quality of life in the same way as trips to and from work. At present, the clause makes no specific reference to such journeys.
<P>
Thirdly, will the new regulations cover the self-employed? Increasing numbers of people are self-employed and, although they may not make regular trips to and from work, encouraging them to use a sustainable mode of transport to make work journeys is as important as encouraging company employees to cycle to work. Under the provision, will the self-employed enjoy the same fiscal incentives as employers who choose to cycle to work? If not, the Economic Secretary should include them as a separate category, because as many working people as possible should be encouraged to take up the new incentives.
<P>
I welcome the clause and ask the Government to trumpet it more forcefully, because it has much to compete with in the many benefits that the budget provides for families, businesses, working people and those with children. My colleagues in the all-party cycling group and many campaigners outside the House, who have worked hard for many years for a more rational, balanced and sustainable policy on travel incentives for employers and employees, see great merit in the clause. 
<P>
They want the new regulations to be publicised more widely and the clause's detail to be set out more clearly.

<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon for his excellent contribution to the debate and for his welcome to this significant clause. He rightly said that the clause has been welcomed by green, and by cycling, organisations. I know that we can rely on them to help to publicise its proposals to employers who might be willing to take advantage of it. The Inland Revenue will, in the normal way, draw employers' attention to the benefits.
<P>
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon that all journeys to and from the workplace will be covered, and that the examples that he gave will be covered. On the self-employed, the new tax free allowance of 12p per mile for cycling in the course of business will apply to the self-employed and to employees. I hope that my hon. Friend is assured on those two matters. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 47 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 48</center></H4>
<H4><center>Scottish Parliament and devolved assemblies</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): The clause deals with the tax treatment of the new devolved Scottish Parliament and the assemblies for Wales and Northern Ireland. The Government propose to extend a tax treatment which many regard as a tax privilege. There may be good reasons for doing so, but when such steps are taken the relevant conditions need to be tightly defined and the good reasons need to be stated.
<P>
The explanatory notes state that the clause will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``treat Members of the Scottish Parliament and the devolved assemblies for Wales and Northern Ireland in the same way, for tax purposes, as Members of Parliament''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many employees of other public bodies and in the private sector have to work away from their homes. They have to engage in extensive tours of duty away from their main residence but they are not treated, for tax purposes, differently from other people. We in the House have a special tax treatment in that regard. To discuss whether that status is valid or not is beyond the scope of our debate, but we should be sure that it is right to extend the proposal in one leap to the Scottish Parliament and to the two assemblies, which differ markedly from the Westminster Parliament in their proposed duties and in the scope of their responsibilities.
<P>
We should also consider the obvious point that they cover much smaller territories.
<P>
Who in future will be responsible for setting the level of the relevant allowances? We might base the tax treatment on the assumption that the allowances and payments are made for broadly comparable duties, but that arrangement would be upset if, at some future date, the bodies in question started to set their own rules, which they might make much more generous and which they might base on the erroneous assumption that they would be taxed on the relevant allowances.
<P>
To illuminate the issue, I turned to a written reply that the Prime Minister gave in March 1999 to the Review Body on Senior Salaries. On the proposed allowances for the devolved bodies, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is not yet possible to know exactly what the allowances will need to cover ... this is best done by the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly themselves. We would expect them to put in place as soon as possible an appropriate but closely controlled system, mindful of the need for a prudent approach and the need to justify to the taxpayer any significant divergence from the recommendations made by the Review Body.''--[Official Report, 31 March 1999; Vol. 28, c. 774.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is clearly an intention that the allowance system, covering subsistence, travel and so on, should, in the Prime Minister's words, be ``appropriate but closely controlled'', but there is no assurance that it will be.
<P>
We have before us the unfortunate example of the European Parliament. Doubtless, when that body was set up, there were all sorts of intentions that its allowance system should be appropriate and closely controlled. However, it did not turn out that way. Recently, there have been some truly startling examples of Members of the European Parliament wasting taxpayers money. Even more remarkably, those Members have said that they have not broken the rules. Thus, when Pauline Green, head of the European Socialist Group--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think the right hon. Gentleman is going rather wide of the subject. It is not appropriate to discuss arrangements for the European Parliament in the context of clause 48.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I bow to your ruling, Mr. Butterfill, but I believe that it is appropriate for us to examine how the various allowances are considered for tax purposes. When I write to the European Parliament, as I do from time to time, about specific examples that are drawn to my attention--the one to which I alluded is only one of many--I am informed that the rules are very different from those that we are used to in the House. Nevertheless, the tax treatment of allowances is similar; Members of the European Parliament are not taxed on any of those benefits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that attempts to reform the system of payments to Members at the European Parliament, led by Pauline Green and the European Socialist Group, have been frustrated--
<P>
<B>The Chairman<?h -.001pt>:</B> Order. I have already ruled--I hope that neither the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) nor the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) will challenge my ruling--that the arrangements for the European Parliament do not fall within the scope of the clause. The clause deals with the tax treatment of Members of the new assemblies, and it clearly says that they should be treated in the same way as Members of this Parliament. Therefore, comparisons between anything proposed here and the European Parliament are wholly inappropriate and wide of the context of the clause. Please may we deal with the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Let us take examples that are more hypothetical. There are other bodies elsewhere in the world that have much looser arrangements than the House, and which remain entirely unreformed. In establishing the tax status of the devolved assemblies within the United Kingdom, we must ensure that there is a parallel process of ensuring that the allowances of their Members do not go beyond the bounds of what is, in the Prime Minister's words, ``appropriate but closely controlled''. That is a modest request. We do not want to get into the muddle that other assemblies have got into. Because the devolved assemblies are able to make up the rules for themselves, we run the risk--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry, but the right hon. Gentleman persists in dealing with arrangements for the assemblies, which are outside the scope of the clause. The clause is concerned exclusively with tax treatment. The arrangements for the payment of expenses are not within the terms of the Bill, let alone the clause, and therefore cannot be discussed in this Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall try to comply with your ruling, Mr. Butterfill. Surely the level of someone's salary is relevant to its tax treatment. It is relevant when the House debates income tax rates. How can we debate tax treatment without reference to what is being taxed?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman has been in this House for a long time. He knows that the arrangements for the amount of salaries and for expenses are not within the scope of the Finance Bill. They are therefore not to be discussed in relation to this clause. The right hon. Gentleman must return to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have a much simpler question. To what are we granting tax status? What system of allowances is likely to apply, or is there a vacuum? The clause and the schedule--when we reach it--refer to pension arrangements. Who will set up those pension arrangements, and how will they meet the Prime Minister's requirements? The Financial Secretary should at least make reference, if not give an answer, to that, otherwise, the Committee will be signing a blank cheque. Disagreements may occur in the future on whether it is appropriate for a Scottish Member of Parliament sitting in this House to deal with a function for which he has received a tax-free allowance, or whether that function should be carried out by a Member of the Scottish Parliament who has overlapping functions. Two sets of tax arrangements could therefore cover the same function.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to keep interrupting the right hon. Gentleman, but he knows that the arrangements that he is discussing were dealt with under the Scotland Act 1998, the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The issues raised by the right hon. Gentleman were debated in this House--no doubt at great length, although I did not serve on the relevant Committees--when those Acts were passed. We are now dealing exclusively with the tax treatment of any benefit that may be taxed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do not know how to ask my question differently. It is relevant to the schedule, which we will debate later. The explanatory notes refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``pension schemes set up under legislation which broadly correspond with Inland Revenue tax approved schemes.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That refers to pension schemes that will be set up in the future. Surely we can debate, in general terms, what is likely to be set up, who is likely to set it up, to whom it will apply, and whether it will be generous. I am merely referring to the explanatory notes. To comply with your ruling, Mr. Butterfill, I shall wait until we debate the schedule  and ask my questions all over again.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> I will confine myself to the matters before the Committee. As you pointed out, Mr. Butterfill, the provision being debated under this clause does not relate to levels of payment allowances. It ensures that the same underlying tax rules that apply to Westminster Members of Parliament and Ministers also apply to our counterparts in the devolved legislatures. Indeed, the proposal in the clause and schedule is simple. As all Committee members know, a handful of provisions in the Taxes Act apply specifically to Members of Parliament. We have already covered matters such as termination payments and pensions, and there is also provision for travel and subsistence for the Speaker, Ministers and Opposition office-holders. 
<P>
The purpose in each case is to provide certainty in the unusual circumstances applying to Members of Parliament.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Similar considerations apply to members of the new devolved assemblies. The Scottish Parliament and the Assemblies for Wales and for Northern Ireland will put in place systems of allowances for their Members, taking account of the recommendations of the Review Body on Senior Salaries, which closely follow the Westminster model. In terms of equity, it is only right that we make the tax position clear by ensuring that the rules applying at Westminster apply also to the devolved assemblies. Clause 48 and schedule 5 extend the scope of the rules that currently apply to us so that they apply in the same way to members of the new devolved legislatures.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> It may assist the Committee if I give my view, which is supported by the Clerk, of what may be debated under the schedule. It deals with exemptions and reliefs and the tax implications of a variety of expenses. Those expenses are permitted under a series of Acts of Parliament: the Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991, the European Parliament (Pay and Pensions Act) 1979, the Scotland Act 1998, the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the Northern Ireland Act 1998. We are not entitled to debate the matters of principle that were decided in that legislation relative to the payment of expenses. However, we can and should debate their tax treatment, which is what the schedule covers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I take it from that helpful illumination, Mr. Butterfill, that it is in order to debate the matters to which the tax treatment will apply, in the same way that when we debate other matters of taxation--for example, capital gains tax, income tax and so on--it is relevant to debate the incomes of those to whom the taxes will apply. The rate of taxation is as important as the fact that they will be taxed.
<P>
My question relates to the parliamentary pension scheme which may be set up. I do not know whether the devolved assemblies have already set up schemes, but the explanatory notes refer to paragraph 5(2) of schedule 5, which proposes that the definition of a parliamentary pension scheme should extend to any new scheme set up by the Scottish Parliament and devolved assemblies. The schedule will extend a tax treatment to a pension scheme which may not yet exist--and if it does, it still may be changed in future.
<P>
That is outside the control of the tax-raising, tax-controlling Parliament of the United Kingdom, which is the House. We set taxes and tax laws, raise and spend revenue, but other bodies will be responsible for the generosity, or lack of it, of the pension scheme in question. That is an example, and the same would apply to travel expenses, subsistence payments and familiar office costs appropriate to the other bodies. That arrangement does not apply to other public bodies, such as local authorities, or to the many employees who have to stay away from home in pursuance of their duties.
<P>
A tax privilege is being extended, and I am concerned that no parallel devolution of responsibility exists. The assemblies will not be responsible for the other side of the equation; they will spend the money, but will not be responsible for raising it. We know that about 25 per cent. more is spent per head in Scotland than elsewhere in the United Kingdom. To that extent, money is transferred from England to Scotland, the reasons for which are familiar. However, problems might be created if that is replicated in the arrangements for the Scottish Parliament. We are responsible to the United Kingdom electorate, but we would have given away the power to set those pension or travel allowances.
<P>
Am I right to say that the Government are extending a tax treatment to three other bodies, which will be on their own from then on--that they can do what they like with those arrangements and set whatever allowances they wish, with no comeback to the House that granted them the power to do so? That is a reasonable matter for debate. Indeed, the notes on clauses are riddled with references to other allowances that will be treated similarly. Exactly what is being devolved along with the blanket arrangements in which it is simply assumed that the arrangements of those bodies will mirror those which we enjoy in the House?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> If I followed what the right hon. Gentleman said correctly, we should rejoin the debates on devolution. You will be pleased to know, Mr. Butterfill, that I have no intention of re-enacting that, from our view, successful battle. However, as I have said, the Scottish Parliament and the new assemblies will put in place systems of allowances for their members and, of course, they will take due account of the recommendations of the Review Body on Senior Salaries. All that we are doing in the schedule, in which the details are given, is extending to the Scottish Parliament and the new assemblies the same tax treatment as we have in the House--no more, no less than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My question, therefore, goes unanswered. There is simply a pious hope that those bodies will follow the recommendations of the review body; they will not be required to do so, and there will be no comeback if they do not. The Financial Secretary specifically said that devolution is dealt with elsewhere.
<P>
Of course, other measures before the House deal with devolution, but it is also dealt with in the Bill. Under the Bill, an important tax treatment will be devolved, and that should be of concern to the Committee. It cannot simply be supposed that the issue of devolution is all over, and that all the devolved powers and responsibilities are dealt with in other measures. We should be alert to Finance Bills that extend tax treatments unpredictably.
<P>
I am surprised that no guideline has been issued, beyond a hope that those bodies will comply with a United Kingdom review body set up by Parliament, given that many people in those bodies specifically reject the authority of the United Kingdom Parliament. We are creating problems, and we shall return to them in future debates.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Although clause 50 is seemingly a technical clause, confined merely to reversing Privy Council offences--the New Zealand Wattie case--it is widely seen by those in commerce and industry as a change in the law. It is an extension of the tax base and, in effect, another of the Government's infamous stealth taxes--the tax rises that the Government hoped no one would notice, which will raise &#163;20 million in this tax year and &#163;50 million a year thereafter.
<P>
The Government clearly regard property as a rich source of additional tax revenue. They have raised stamp duty three times, abolished MIRAS and now they want to tax reverse premiums. That fits into another perceived rich vein of additional taxation--the nation's pension funds, which are already taxed by the Government to the tune of &#163;5 billion a year.
<P>
The measure in schedule 6, involving the taxation of reverse premiums, is likely to be borne to a large extent by pension funds, which are heavy investors in property. The taxation of the receipts by the tenant will mean that tenants will require correspondingly higher reverse premiums than would otherwise have been payable, which will be at the expense of the returns of the pension funds.
<P>
The Institute of Directors feels strongly about the matter. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This measure will effectively raise tax from pension funds. The payer of a reverse premium will often be a pension fund, exempt from tax, so that any deduction that it might be able to obtain for the payment of a reverse premium would not be tax-effective...the effect of this measure will be to narrow the tax exemption available to pension funds by passing part of the tax burden on to them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants is also concerned that there was no consultation with it, or with any other sections of industry, before the provision was introduced. For a Government who pride themselves on consultation, that is quite surprising.
<P>
Before the Wattie case, there was an element of uncertainty in the taxation of reverse premiums. For most tenants, there will be capital receipts without the disposal of a capital asset. Thus, for tax purposes, it constitutes a nothing, and technically it is not taxable. The Inland Revenue, however, will try to find a link between the receipt that the tenant receives and subsequent rent levels that the tenant will pay. That will then be taxed as a revenue receipt. Paragraph 528 of the Inland Revenue's inspector's manual recognises that there can be circumstances when there is no such link and, as a consequence, the receipt is not taxable.
<P>
The Wattie judgment said that such receipts were not taxable, even when there was a clear link with subsequent rent levels. The Government are trying to reverse the effect of that case. In so doing, they have taken the opportunity to extend the circumstances in which a receipt is taxable, to include circumstances that were previously not taxable. We object to that extension of the tax base and the host of ambiguous and widely drafted provisions that create new and greater uncertainty in the legislation.
<P>
We also object to the practice of drafting widely drawn and unreasonable taxation provisions that are then tempered by Inland Revenue statements of practice and published letters.
<P>
Schedule 6 is drafted so widely that the term ``reverse premium'' includes cash inducements paid to a tenant, capital contributions to a tenant's fit-out costs and non-cash benefits provided by the landlord to the tenant. The tax treatment will generally follow the accounting treatment by the tenant, which would normally be to spread the receipt over the whole term of the lease, so the tenant will be taxed each year on the portion of the payment already received.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Where the landlord is a property developer who is taxed as a trader on the basis of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Case I . . . of Schedule D'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
he should normally be able to obtain a reduction for paying the reverse premium. In those circumstances, there is symmetry of treatment between tenant and landlord. The tenant is taxed on the receipt and the landlord gets a deduction for tax purposes on the payment.
<P>
Where the landlord is an investor, however, he will be able to obtain relief only if he sells the property, when it will be added to the capital gains base cost of the property in some circumstances, although there is some doubt about that, too. It seems harsh that in such cases there is not symmetry of treatment. The landlord will not get a revenue deduction for that payment, although the tenant will be taxed on the receipt.
<P>
That is a cause of concern to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is not apparent that a landlord who is an investor could obtain tax relief for the payment. We believe that this is unfair and that the landlord should obtain a tax deduction regardless of his tax status.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 83 to 85 would do precisely that by stipulating that a reverse premium is a revenue payment as well as a revenue receipt. Amendment No. 142 does that in a slightly different way.
<P>
Those are not simply the views of Opposition members of the Committee, but of outside bodies. The Institute of Chartered Accountants said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We are concerned about the lack of symmetry in that the proposed legislation imposes a tax charge on the lessee, on deemed income, but gives no corresponding relief to the lessor. Contrary to the implication given by the Budget Day press release, most transactions of this sort will be on capital account for the lessor, so the reverse premium could only qualify for relief under the capital gains code ... in the event of a future disposal of the lessor's interest''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The CBI is also concerned. It said that it welcomes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``clarification of the treatment of the payer of the premium charged under the new rules.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Through the amendment, we seek some clarification of precisely what the schedule means.
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Explanatory Notes state that in most cases such premiums are paid by developers and other property dealers, with the result that the premium paid is deductible in computing their trading profits. However, such a premium might be paid by an investment company. In this case, fairness requires that it should qualify for a deduction ... A specific provision to this effect appears to be required in Schedule 6.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In view of the enormous concern over the lack of symmetry, expressed by those and other bodies, I hope that the Minister can accept the amendments. If not, I hope that she can mitigate the injustice by confirming that it is the Government's intention in practice to give a deduction for those who invest as landlords on the same basis as the income is taxable with regard to the tenant.

<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> After this morning's sitting, I was beginning to think that we would have an entire day without hearing from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). I am reassured that there is a schedule of sufficient complexity to draw the hon. Gentleman out.
<P>
The purpose of schedule 6 and clause 50 is to restore what we believed was the position before the Wattie judgment in a New Zealand revenue case in the Privy Council. That judgment casts doubt on the Revenue's ability to tax reverse premiums under similar circumstances in the United Kingdom. Reverse premiums should certainly be taxable in the hands of the recipient because, in commercial terms, the recipient of a reverse premium has a sum which supplements his trading revenue. The tenant may, for example, undertake trade in the premises for a number of years in return for the cash. Alternatively the reverse premium may reduce his trading expenses; the payment may be a contribution to relocation or start-up costs, or a subsidy towards future rents. In commercial terms, the reverse premium increases the recipient's trading profit and as such should be chargeable to tax. That is the position of the recipient and it is to his position that clause 50 and schedule 6 are directed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked why there had been no consultation on this change. This is a charging provision. It was introduced at very short notice following the unexpected judgment in the Wattie case. Had we consulted prior to its introduction, there would have been a flood of transactions designed to pre-empt the legislation and take advantage of the impact of the Wattie decision. That would not have been satisfactory.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of pension funds that pay reverse premiums. The real commercial bargain--the nature of the agreement here--has been the payment of rent by the tenant, who can deduct it from profits, to someone who is not chargeable on its receipt. Clause 50 and schedule 6 do not change that. Instead they ensure that the tax effects of the normal commercial bargain can no longer be distorted by increasing the rent, which is tax deductible for the tenant, in return for a reverse premium which might not have been taxable on the tenant. Clause 50 and schedule 6 clarify that position and ensure that the tax charge falls where it should--on the tenant who receives the benefit from the reverse premium.
<P>
The amendments seek to deal with the position of the payer of the reverse premium and to provide him with tax relief at the same time as it charges the recipient. I am not willing to accept the amendments because they go well beyond the intention of the clause and the schedule, which, as I said, deal with the problem of the tax charge on the recipient of the reverse premium following the Privy Council decision in the Wattie case.
<P>
As for the builder and developer, under the law the payer will get a tax deduction for the payment. If the payer of the reverse premium is a schedule A landlord, he will not. A reverse premium that is paid by a landlord with a rental business rather than a trade is part of the capital cost of the landlord's property. Neither this nor previous Governments have chosen to provide a general relief for the capital cost of land and buildings. It would be extremely expensive to do so and in any case there is no shortage of commercial property that might provide a motive for such a relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I believe that the Government propose to tax reverse premiums, in the same way as premiums are taxed. Thus those provisions are being roughly mirrored, but there are certain extraneous circumstances which I should like the Economic Secretary to address. For example, will the provisions apply when the landlord gives an inducement to an assignee if the original tenant's affairs are in liquidation?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt<?h -.001pt>:</B> I shall come back to that, as I wish to deal with the alleged unfairness of the asymmetry of the provisions as they apply to developers and landlords. A builder or developer who grants a property lease is selling the trading stock of his business. Expenditure that is incurred to sell trading stock is a revenue expense and is therefore tax-deductible. Should a builder or developer pay someone an inducement to take a lease of the building, the payment of that inducement is part of the revenue costs of selling that trading stock.
<P>
However, the position of a landlord who has a property-letting business is different. For a landlord, the let property is the business's fixed capital. A landlord who grants a lease does not realise trading stock, but creates an asset--the lease--which he will retain as part of the business's fixed capital, and which will generate rental income.
<P>
The costs to the landlord of acquiring or creating property for letting, such as buying a freehold or granting a lease, are not allowable as a revenue deduction from rental profits. A reverse premium paid by a rental business landlord is clearly part of the cost of acquiring or creating a capital asset, namely the lease of his business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The schedule seeks to connect the premium received by the tenant with the rents payable by him. Therefore, the reduction in the tenant's rent is taxable because the Bill seeks to reduce the deductibility of tenants' rent. To put it in a clearer way, the schedule seeks to turn what may be regarded as a capital receipt by the tenant into a revenue receipt by linking the receipt with the rent level that the tenant subsequently has to pay. Given that the tenant will get a deduction for such rental payments, the schedule makes provision for the tenant to have a slightly reduced level of rental reductions in future and will implement that by taxing the receipt on a revenue basis.
<P>
It is only fair that that should be mirrored in the landlord's position. The landlord holds the lease as a capital asset rather than trading receipts; nevertheless, he is still taxable, on a revenue basis, on the receipt of the rent paid by the tenant. The same principle should apply to the landlord: he should be deemed to be receiving less rent from a tenant, in the same way that the tenant is deemed to be paying less rent by virtue of receiving capital receipt. Therefore, our amendments would create equity.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be complicating the matter unnecessarily, although I accept that this is a fairly technical area.
<P>
As I said earlier, the basis for charging to tax the reverse premium received by the tenant is that the tenant has received money or other benefit, which is supplementing his trading revenue or reducing his trading expenses. Therefore, it is quite proper that the reverse premium should be chargeable to tax, as it increases his trading profits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Economic Secretary referred to other benefit, which is mentioned in paragraph 1(1)(a). However, that is a rather loose definition. Perhaps a wiser definition would be another benefit in money's worth.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> That is the subject of other amendments, which we shall discuss later.
<P>
To return to the point made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, there is not necessarily a read across from the position of the tenant--which we are restoring to what we believe it was before the Wattie judgment--and the different positions of the developer and the landlord.
<P>
The amendment goes well beyond what would be necessary to restore the position prior to that judgment and would take us into extremely expensive territory where no previous Government thought it desirable to tread and where we do not intend to tread.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On the specific question from the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon about a landlord giving an inducement to a assignee where, for example, the original tenant was in liquidation, the charge will apply in such circumstances because what gives rise to the charge is the benefit that is gained by the tenant to whom the reverse premium is given. For the reasons that I have outlined, I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will withdraw his amendment, otherwise I shall have to ask my hon. Friends to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb<?h -.001pt>:</B> I am not terribly satisfied with the Economic Secretary's response. There is a lack of symmetry in the position that the Government have created. The amendment gave the hon. Lady an opportunity to make the position crystal clear for investors and tenants, but she rejected it. I hope that she will read our debate in Hansard, consider the matter carefully before Report, and at that stage make changes that will clarify once and for all these complicated legislative proposals. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb<?h -.001pt>:</B> Amendments Nos. 87 and 88 propose to revert the law to its presumed position prior to the Wattie case, which is what the Inland Revenue purports to do in schedule 6. That being so, the Government should accept that schedule 6 should be amended, to tax only receipts linked to subsequent rents, leaving unlinked receipts tax free. The amendments would add a fourth condition to the schedule relative to what constitutes a reverse premium for these purposes. The condition would make it absolutely clear that the receipt must be to recompense the grantor of the lease for rent due to him, or for other tenant liabilities connected with the lease.
<P>
Amendment No. 113 revolves around the phrase ``other benefit'' in paragraph l(l)(a) of the schedule, which will apply where a person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>	``receives a payment or other benefit''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
by way of inducement. The phrase is widely drawn, and creates huge uncertainty about precisely what will be caught by the provisions and constitute a reverse premium.
<P>
The Law Society says{**?h -.001pt**}:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Notwithstanding the ambit of the clause, we consider that the term `or other benefit' in paragraph l(l)(a) will create uncertainty.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Inland Revenue has acknowledged the problem and the concern by clarifying the position in a published letter, which states{**?h -.001pt**}:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Since publication of the draft clauses, approaches from practitioners have included various requests for clarification of the precise scope of the measures proposed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The letter goes on to clarify what will, and what will not, be regarded as a reverse premium. The letter states that ``other benefit'' does not include a rent-free period. That is helpful, because paragraph 31 of the notes on clauses states that a reverse premium may include a rent-free period. A later note in the paragraph states{**?h -.001pt**}:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In the case of a rent-free period this does not involve the imputation of a notional charge.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thus the Bill implies that a rent-free period is a reverse premium; the notes say that it is, but that no charge arises, and the Inland Revenue's letter says that it is not. That is as clear as mud.
<P>
The letter also says that a payment to enter a new, less onerous lease would not be a reverse premium, but, as the CBI points out, in the case of an onerous lease the payment would usually be from the tenant to the landlord and not the other way round. The letter also says that a landlord contribution to a tenant's fitting-out costs would constitute a reverse premium.
<P>
The letter highlights our concern. The Government have proposed a widely drafted Bill, which is then narrowed by a letter. The letter is not included in the Bill, so anyone looking at the statute will not know of its revised meaning. It is not subject to the approval of Parliament; indeed, it cannot be amended in the Committee.
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants has expressed its concern in its submissions, saying{**?h -.001pt**}:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we regard it as wholly unsatisfactory that a fundamental defect in the drafting of the legislation should be dealt with by means of an extra-statutory clarification, which appears to be unsupported by the actual wording.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is the second example of this approach in the Bill. The VAT business brief narrowed the definition of the protection of revenue in the VAT grouping provisions. It is not acceptable to legislate in this way. One can understand the need to clarify legislation at some point in the future, when unforeseen circumstances arise, but when it is evident during the passage of a Bill that the wording is not clear, it should simply be amended.
<P>
Amendment No. 113 seeks to do that by incorporating into the Bill the wording used in the letter. Amendment No. 86 makes it clear that a rent-free period is not a reverse premium. The Government seem to have accepted the principle of amendment No.82, if not the exact wording, as amendment No.163 tabled by the Chief Secretary does precisely the same. Both amendments seek to prevent the schedule from imposing a double charge to tax where a tenant receives a contribution to his fitting-out expenditure. Under section 153 of the Capital Allowances Act 1990, the landlord rather than the tenant would obtain capital allowances on that type of expenditure. It would be harsh if not only was the expenditure disallowed for tax purposes for the tenant, but the tenant was taxed on that contribution from the landlord. The amendments seek to prevent that.
<P>
Amendment No. 115 ensures that schedule 8 does not apply to non-business transactions such as the purchase of a second home by someone who is given an inducement by the builder of, for instance, free carpets or a washing machine. It does so by removing the only or main residence test from the exemption in paragraph 9.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt<?h -.001pt>:</B> Like amendment No. 82, amendment No. 163 in the name of my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary remedies an unintended defect in the schedule. I congratulate Opposition Members on spotting the defect and tabling an amendment to deal with it. The issue relates to a double charge that could arise where a reverse premium takes the form of a contribution towards costs that qualify for capital allowances. The interaction of clause 50, schedule 6 and the capital allowance code makes it possible to charge a reverse premium as revenue under the new provisions and to deduct the same sum from the tenant's expenditure qualifying for capital allowances, thus in effect creating a double charge. That was never the intention of the clause and the schedule.
<P>
The amendment remedies the potential inequity by providing that where receipts are taken into account to reduce the amount qualifying for capital allowance, they should not also be charged to tax as reverse premium.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw amendment No. 82 in return for Government amendment No. 163, which is drafted in a manner that is more in keeping with the rest of the Bill. It is slightly simpler and more elegant in its wording, although the effect is precisely the same.
<P>
The purpose of amendments Nos. 87 and 88 is, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton suggested, to restrict the general charge on reverse premiums to when the payment is a contribution to a tenant's fitting-out costs or when it represents a subsidy in advance of the rest of the perhaps inflated rent that the tenant has to pay under the lease. For the first category of payment, it also introduces into the schedule an explanation of fitting-out costs.
<P>
On that narrower point, the amendment is simply unnecessary--it already follows from the wording. On the wider point--the restriction of the definition of reverse premiums to only two types of payment--the amendment would greatly cut down the scope of the charge and would exempt certain receipts that should clearly fall within it. It might help the Committee if I gave some examples.
<P>
The amendment would, for example, let out an inducement that took the form of a new landlord paying a lump sum to the old landlord to permit the potential tenant to break his existing lease. It would also exempt an inducement that took the form of paying the rent for which the potential tenant is liable under his existing lease. Equally, it would not catch a sum paid by the landlord to the prospective tenant as a contribution to relocation or start-up costs.
<P>
As drafted, clause 50 and schedule 6 catch all those payments. It is right to catch those payments and we want to continue to do so. The examples to which I referred are as much about giving valuable consideration to the tenant as making a contribution to fitting-out costs or the rent subsidy--the two circumstances specifically provided for in the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. There is no sense in exempting the sums that I mentioned while catching those included in the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<P>
Furthermore, the amendment would not catch a contribution to the tenant's provision of chattels, which creates another loophole because it would enable the landlord to pay for the acquisition by the tenant of something that will become the tenant's property and it will not affect the freehold value of the property. Amendments Nos. 87 and 88 are not soundly based and I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will agree not to press them.
<P>
On the question of what ``other benefit'' means, the subject of the charge is any valuable consideration provided by a lessor in order to induce a tenant or potential tenant to take out a lease--for example, when the landlord directly bears the tenant's fitting-out costs, or in the case of an assumption by the landlord of a potential tenant's existing liabilities, which might have arisen under an old lease.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett<?h -.001pt>:</B> Does the Economic Secretary mean that ``other benefit'' must be quantifiable in terms of money?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt<?h -.001pt>:</B> Precisely so, but those words do not need to be added to the schedule to convey that meaning. That is already clear as the schedule stands.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton also raised the issue of the ambiguity in the Treasury's original explanatory notes and the letter subsequently issued to representative bodies. I regret, of course, any ambiguity in the Treasury's notes. Letters were issued to representative bodies to make clear--some of them had raised the matter with us--the Revenue's view of the draft legislation. The schedule does not impose a charge on the granting of a rent-free period. That is not caught within schedule 6, so there is no need for an exemption.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 113 and 115 would, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, extend to second homes the exemption from charge of a reverse premium received for taking the lease of an only or main home. Opposition Members are reverting to type by trying to create a new tax loophole for the few and not the many. There is no good reason to extend to owners of second homes an exemption from a reverse premium. The purchaser of a second home is creating a schedule A letting business if he lets it out when he is not using it for holiday purposes. Why should someone who occasionally lets out his second home be in a different position from someone who derives income from letting property? There is no need for the distinction. No public policy would be served by encouraging people to buy second homes or by encouraging the owners of those homes to provide a reverse premium to the people who are lucky enough to be acquiring them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): Is the Economic Secretary implying that she is against the home-for-rent schemes that are provided by many reputable mortgage companies?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Not at all. I am simply saying that there is no good reason for distinguishing between a normal schedule A letting business and one that is created by someone who buys a second home for use partly as a holiday home and partly to let. It would be unfair to import the distinction that is proposed in amendments Nos. 113 and 115.
<P>
Although I appreciate the intention behind amendment No. 82, I cannot accept the Opposition amendments. I hope that my explanation will encourage the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No. 87.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for that full response. I am sorry that amendment No.82 was not elegant enough; we will try better next time. I am unhappy with her response to amendment No.113, which, along with amendment No. 82, is the most important amendment in the group. She did not say why the Bill cannot contain the words that are in the Inland Revenue letter. It is not just a matter of clarifying the ambiguity in the explanatory notes; there is also ambiguity in the Bill. Why does she not want to clarify the Bill by incorporating those words? Interested parties will have access to the legislation, but they will not have access to the letter.
<P>
The letter gives rise to another ambiguity. Paragraph 3, entitled ``Fitting out costs'', states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``As indicated in the Notes on Clauses, the Revenue regards a contribution by a landlord to a tenant's fitting out costs as a reverse premium chargeable under the proposed provisions. By ``fitting out costs'' we understand expenditure incurred by the tenant on a tenant's fixtures and trade chattels which do not affect the value of the freehold reversion.
<P>
We do not regard as fitting out costs expenditure incurred by a tenant on effectively completing the fabric of shell and core premises by carrying out works which would usually be the responsibility of the developer. The reimbursement of such expenditure is not properly an ``inducement'' to take out a lease, but rather part of the costs of producing a finished building.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That distinction may not be as clear-cut in practice. Let us consider the example of carpets. A landlord would be expected to fit a minimum grade of carpet, but a higher grade might be fitted as part of a package of measures to induce a tenant to take a lease. To what extent--if at all--would the Revenue consider that as giving rise to a reverse premium?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall do my best to respond, but this debate is nearly as bad this morning's debate on computer equipment, which was so enjoyable.
<P>
I shall deal first with the question of whether it is necessary to spell out in great detail the nature of the reverse premium to which a charge will fall. Where possible, it is important to try to achieve elegance and simplicity, even in drafting tax legislation. Parliamentary counsel draft legislation as an integral whole, and if undue emphasis is given to a particular aspect, a real danger exists of upsetting the balance and undermining the scope of the legislation. Declaring one form of reverse premium--the contribution to fitting-out costs--as chargeable holds a specific danger. It may cast doubt on the power of the legislation as a whole to charge to tax other sums that fall within the generality of the charge on ``payment or other benefit'', but which have not been specified.
<P>
No good reason exists for elaborating on the legislation as suggested. Giving more detail and emphasis to a particular form of reverse premium may not be necessary, and may be positively undesirable, as the courts, in their wisdom, may decide that Parliament did not intend to catch other forms of reverse premium, as it had not specified them.
<P>
The Government think that the Bill makes a distinction between fitting-out costs and the cost of completing the building. Fitting-out costs are those traditionally borne by the tenant: tenant's or trade fixtures are procured to meet the needs of the tenant, and the tenant has the right to remove those fixtures at the end of the lease before the landlord repossesses the premises. A lessor who meets those costs is paying out money that would normally come out of the tenant's pocket. In those circumstances, there is clearly another benefit--in the words of the legislation--that accrues to the tenant, and a charge should therefore properly arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> How will that apply if the lease contains a provision that the property is to remain the landlord's property?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> If there is a provision that the property is to remain the landlord's property, the definition of fitting-out costs--which relates to tenant's fixtures-- will not apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The definition of fitting-out costs would apply. Although the property would revert to the landlord when the lease expired, the tenant would benefit from the fixtures for the duration of the lease.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall take further advice on that, in case an additional technicality applies that I have not spotted.
<P>
As far as reverse premiums and fitting-out costs are concerned, our aim is to catch the payment by the landlord or lessor of money that will be used by the tenant to acquire property that he will retain at the end of the lease. That must be different from the landlord retaining the beneficial ownership.
<P>
To return to the distinction between fitting-out costs and the cost of completing the building, the builder or developer will normally be responsible for the cost of completing the building. However, the tenant may want the building to have a special feature, such as a special roof. The parties to the contract may agree that the tenant will take the development without a roof and install his own specially designed and especially beautiful roof. The landlord will then reimburse the tenant to the extent of the expenditure that the landlord would have incurred on a standard roof. That expenditure is not properly an ``other benefit'' within the terms of the legislation; it is simply the landlord's normal expenditure for a completed building, although it is incurred indirectly rather than directly. No charge would therefore arise.
<P>
I hope that my remarks will give the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton some comfort. I hope that he will, as a result, feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Economic Secretary's response, particularly to the point made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, may have added to the confusion and created a new loophole that will be avidly exploited. We warned the Government that the use of tertiary and fourth-level legislation through letters and extra statutory statements while a Bill is progressing through Parliament is unacceptable. However, given that we have debated that issue and the clause widely, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The amendments are fairly straightforward and consistent with the clause's intention that gifts in kind that are deducted from a business's profits should include not only finished products but other forms.
<P>
I should begin by declaring an interest, in that I own a joinery business. We often give wood offcuts to our local further education college, which puts them to good use in training apprentice carpenters. Such things happen up and down the country. If we are to have a formal system for gifts in kind, there would be a great advantage in including such gifts, which sometimes have a monetary value. For example, my business produces wood shavings, which can be sold commercially or given to local charities. The same is true of engineering firms, which produce metal offcuts and shavings that charities can recycle. Therefore, it would be perfectly reasonable for the Government to accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall say a few words about the difficulties that the charities sector is experiencing under the Government. Charities have already suffered--to the tune of &#163;400 million--from the abolition of the repayment of dividend tax credits. The consultation process, which began in July 1997, seems not to have benefited the charities sector. A report published in Accountancy Age on 6 May states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government has effectively closed the door on its charity tax review by warning that it does not want to hear fresh ideas about how to restructure the current system.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause will give back &#163;5 million in 2000--01 and &#163;10 million in the following year. 
<P>
The Government are taking &#163;400 million but they propose to give back only small droplets as time goes by. They are taking large amounts with one hand and giving back very small amounts with the other.
<P>
The clause is needed because, as a result of the common law case Sharkey v. Werhner, when a business gives away part of its trading stock, it has to be regarded as a disposable stock at its market value. If equipment is given away, it has to be regarded as a disposal for capital allowance purposes, and the market value of the goods has to be added back by way of market value proceeds.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, the clause is very cumbersome. A donor has to make a claim each time he wants to claim the relief--he has to specify each and every article. For example, Marks and Spencer might want to give away food that had passed its sell-by date to the Salvation Army, but, if it does not want to be taxed on its donation, each tub of guacamole and each packet of paprika chicken will have to be listed.
<P>
Offcuts will have to be disallowed for tax purposes unless such a claim is made. The clause does not deal with that matter satisfactorily--offcuts are excluded by the clause's wording. It states that the goods have to be sold in the course of the donor's trade.
<P>
The Institute of Directors shares that view. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``New section 83A(2)(a) could usefully be widened to cover by-products of manufacture, such as waste offcuts of wood or metal...New section 83A(5) requires a claim for the relief. It would be far less burdensome to small businesses if no claim were required.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why did the Government devise a system that requires a claim? Why did not they change the tax law and avoid the need of having to add back? Why is the market value of goods involved in the tax computation?

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> On the whole, we welcome the clause, although it will have unnecessarily burdensome repercussions. We suggested a de minimis limit of &#163;1,000, which would overcome the need to make a claim for small donations. I hope that the Economic Secretary--presumably she will reply to the debate--will respond to that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward (Witney):</B> In principle, there is something to be said for the clause but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton clearly said, the truth is that over the past two years the Government have taken several hundred million pounds away from charities by changing the ACT credits system. When that provision was passing through the House, the Government led us to believe that they would seriously consider in the course of their review of charity taxation what would be put in its place. In March, we had the benefit of seeing the Green Paper--it was presented by the Economic Secretary but, of course, it contains no proper replacement for what the Government have stolen from charities. It is clear that they are not putting that money back in almost any shape or form.
<P>
We must consider the clause and the amendment against that background. As the Economic Secretary pointed out, the Prime Minister said that he wanted to launch a campaign to ignite a new spirit of involvement in the community, but the clause will do little to ignite that spirit. The Red Book makes it clear that charities will receive benefits of about &#163;5 million or &#163;10 million in subsequent years. Those figures do not compare in any way with the &#163;400 million that the Government have swiped from charities--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman might just about be in order if we were having a clause stand part debate, although even then he would be stretching my tolerance. We are considering amendment No. 139 and those grouped with it. Will he quickly turn his attention to them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Butterfill, and I presume that there will be a stand part debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If hon. Members wish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I shall restrain myself and reserve my remaining comments for clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> It is a pity that the hon. Gentleman was so grudging in his comments on the clause--
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> What?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The Chairman's guidance was that we are not discussing the clause. I discussed only the amendment, but I am happy to discuss the clause when the hon. Lady so wishes.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Indeed, we shall return to the matter on clause stand part.
<P>
I know that the accountancy and legal professional bodies have questioned whether the clause covers scrap material and offcuts that are a by-product of the manufacture of trading stock. Those concerns were expressed by the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) and I was pleased to hear that he runs a business that routinely donates offcuts to a local education establishment.
<P>
The point that I want to stress is that when a trader normally sells scrap or surplus materials, relief is available under clause 51 for gifts of those items. When the offcuts are donated in the course of a trade, relief is available under the general principles of calculating trading profits. In either case, under the general principles or clause 51, relief on the donation is available, so the amendments are unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Economic Secretary clarify whether a business that does both can claim relief under both provisions? If a joinery business gives some offcuts to a charity and sells others in the course of its business, can it claim both reliefs at once?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Yes, if the goods are donated and relief is available under clause 51, it can be claimed under clause 51. If it is available under general principles, it will be given under general principles.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to the Inland Revenue's letter. We seem to be discussing Inland Revenue letters today and I apologise that its letter on this matter was not clearer. It might have given the impression that the Revenue was extending the impact of clause 51, but that is not so. As I said in response to the hon. Member for Guildford, relief is available under the new provision if the offcuts are normally sold and, under first principles, if they are donated in the course of a trade. The purpose of the Revenue's letter was simply to provide assurance and to respond to concerns that had been raised. It was certainly not to suggest that the Revenue had any power to extend the legislation in the course of writing a letter.
<P>
Amendment No. 183 would remove the charge to tax when a donor received a benefit as a result of making a gift in kind to a charity in circumstances in which an article had a value of less than &#163;1,000. The amendment may be well intentioned, but it would have the curious and perverse effect that a donor could receive tax relief for donating an item worth up to &#163;1,000 with no restriction whatever on any benefits received in return for the donation. That would give rise to an inducement to tax evasion. A trader could donate an item worth less than &#163;1,000 and, in return, receive free tickets to a concert or event that were worth substantially more.
<P>
It would not be right to give traders the full tax relief for donating items to charity, with no restriction in respect of the benefits received in return. There is no reason for traders to be exempt from the normal rule that one gets tax relief on a charitable donation only if one receives no substantial benefit in return. For that reason, I hope that the hon. Member for Guildford will withdraw the amendment. However, if it were pressed to a vote, I would ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
Both the hon. Member for Guildford and the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised the claiming procedure, suggesting that it might be unnecessarily cumbersome. I agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I am grateful for those signs of agreement from the Minister. Are we now debating amendment No. 172?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sorry. I meant to ask whether the Minister was now debating amendment No. 172?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are debating amendment No. 139, with which we are debating amendments Nos. 168 and 183.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Butterfill. I will come to the claiming question when we reach amendment No. 172, which I now appreciate has not yet been moved. However, perhaps I can predict that I shall be able to offer the Committee some comfort on that matter. I hope that, in the light of that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. If he will not, I will urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn<?h -.001pt>:</B>: I feel that we have been offered what one might call a reverse premium on the amendment about to be moved. Far be it from me to discourage the Economic Secretary from proceeding with that. I will therefore be happy to withdraw my amendment. However, I am still confused, despite her answer to my question. She told us that when a trader is selling items, he will gain relief under clause 51; when he is giving them away, he will claim relief under other established tax law. That raises the question as to why any trader should decide to follow this procedure, rather than the procedure in which goods are given away.
<P>
The answer is that the goods--such as offcuts and shavings, for example--have a commercial value, and can be sold. There will be traders who not only sell such goods in the course of their business but give them away at other times. Although I am comforted by the Economic Secretary's statement that traders have an either/or option on the matter, I am confused as to why they would choose this more cumbersome procedure. However, on that note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon wish to move amendment No. 183 separately?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 183, in page 29, line 23, after ``article'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which has a value of over &#163;1,000.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All that I would say to the Economic Secretary is that the parting of the item is either a gift or a sale. We are dealing with gifts in this measure. The purpose of the de minimis provisions in amendment No. 183 is to overcome the need to make a claim. I hope that the Economic Secretary understands what I have just said, and will therefore reconsider her earlier response.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall respond briefly to that point. The hon. Gentleman says that his intention is to get round the cumbersome claims procedure for small gifts. As I shall accept amendment No. 172 when we come to it amendment No.183 is no longer necessary, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am delighted, or rather I hope I shall be delighted, to hear what the Economic Secretary is about to tell us. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 172, in page 29, line 32, leave out subsections (5) to (7).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With the long anticipated amendment No. 172, we may also consider amendment No. 165, in clause 54, page 31, leave out lines 43 and 44.
<P>
I should explain that amendment No. 165 refers to clause 54, and it will therefore be possible to deal with it when we reach that point in the Bill, should the hon. Gentleman so wish, but we may debate it now.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am slightly confused about why we are debating amendment No. 165 now, but I am no surer why we may deal with it later. I shall ask leave for that amendment to be withdrawn.
<P>
Enthusiasm for the Bill is shared by all who are involved with it. Just as I was over-enthusiastic in tabling amendment No. 165, those who drafted the legislation were over-enthusiastic in including subsections (5) to (7) of clause 51. The Economic Secretary has indicated that she is of like mind. Therefore, I hope that, in the interests of simplicity, and in order to encourage people to give to charity and not frighten them off with excessive bureaucratic burdens, the Economic Secretary will look favourably on the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call any other hon. Members, I should explain that amendment No.172 is grouped with amendment No. 165 because both amendments relate to the issue of whether relief was given and whether a claim was made. They relate to different kinds of relief, but the principle is the same.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I should explain that when we decided to extend the existing relief for gifts in kind to all charitable causes, beyond the limited group of educational establishments to which the relief has applied for some years, it seemed sensible to take over the claims procedure that had previously existed. We were not aware of the existing claims procedure having given rise to any problems in practice. Therefore it seemed sensible to follow that precedent in clause 51.
<P>
However, the suggestion has been made, both by hon. Members and by representatives of the accountancy and legal professional bodies, that the claims procedure is unnecessary and cumbersome, and we agree that it is not appropriate, especially under self assessment. We are therefore pleased to accept the amendment and get rid of the claims procedure. The proposed relief will now be reflected in the figure of taxable profit included in the tax returns of unincorporated businesses, and in the accounts that accompany corporate returns. I hope that that clarifies our intention and the effect of accepting the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I know enough to quit when I am ahead.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am sure that hon. Members welcome the Government's cave-in as a result of listening to the experts. I describe it as such because, sadly, one of the things that strikes me about the Government's approach to taxation and to charities has been that they have not listened to charities in the past two years.
<P>
The charities that depended on the income that they received from ACT tax credits still find it difficult to come to terms with the changes that were introduced in a previous Finance Bill. Clause 51 might give them something, but it is important that the Economic Secretary understands that that does not go very far towards making up for the damage that the Government have already done.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Although the people who lost the tax credit regret it, does the hon. Gentleman not accept that it was an anomaly? The present structure of corporation tax is much more constructive. The Government were right to do what they did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I believe that the hon. Lady did not serve on the Committee of the Finance Bill that scrapped the tax credit. We debated the issue at length, and Treasury Ministers reassured us that serious consideration would be given to the consequences of its abolition, with a view to examining what might replace it.
<P>
The Red Book suggests that the Government's generosity in clause 51 might produce &#163;5 million in one year and &#163;10 million in another. However, that it no way makes up for the &#163;400 million that has been taken away from charities. That money was taken away from them, because we are not taking about gifts--in many cases they already had it. They lost it because of a change in legislation. The hon. Lady asked a bona fide question, but we should ask what charities will do as a consequence of the damage that the Government have done to their income stream.
<P>
This year's Finance Bill does not solve that problem, although clause 51 will give charities &#163;5 million or &#163;10 million. I do not complain about the fact that the clause will hand some money back, but I remind the Committee that when the tax credit was abolished, we were led to believe that the Government would take the problem seriously. However, two years later, neither the Finance Bill nor the Green Paper on charities taxation contain anything that will fill the gap that was created.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> How much further tax relief would the hon. Gentleman give to charities? He mentioned the figure of &#163;400 million. Will he confirm that he would like &#163;400 million in tax relief to be given to charities? How would he pay for that? Would he raise a tax, and if so, which one? Would he cut another part of the budget, and if so, which part?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Gentleman's approach to the problem is interesting. The Government stole money from charities in the first place, but he asks us how we propose to give it back. That question should more properly be directed to Treasury Ministers, who might answer it by telling us what proposals they will make in the next 12 months to repair the damage that the changes to ACT tax credits have done to charities. That is a proper question, and I look forward to the hon. Gentleman asking it of Ministers.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I accept the fact that I was not on the Standing Committee on the Finance Bill that abolished the tax credit. However, it is not right to accuse the Government of stealing money from charities when there is a good argument that the money was not theirs to be stolen in the first place. Charities are much better served by a thriving corporate system, under which donations come from profits, than by inappropriate tax arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am a little concerned that we are having a general debate on the overall taxation of charities; that is not the purpose of our consideration of the clause. I am always prepared to let debates run a little wide to enable Members to make reasonable points, but we must now return to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. I would be delighted to answer the hon. Lady's questions, but I take note of your guidance, and shall be happy to do so later, as the issue is extremely important.
<P>
I can relate the debate specifically to the clause by mentioning Childline, a charity with which I am involved. Childline depends on gifts from the public, which are crucial. It receives only a tiny fraction of its money from Government grants and is therefore dependent on gifts. One problem that Childline, in common with other major charities, faces is that its sources of income among the public have been reduced; there are fewer donors out there.
<P>
If I thought that the Bill would deal with that problem I would be more optimistic, but it does not; the Government's claim to do a lot for charities is only rhetoric, because in practice little is being done. Although the aim of the clause is to widen the scope, the mechanism for giving relief is not designed to be user-friendly. In my experience, it is crucial for charities that giving should be made simpler, not more difficult.
<P>
Hon. Members have given examples of lobbying by other organisations; I am glad that the Economic Secretary was generous enough to listen to their arguments and to change her mind and that of her colleagues on the Treasury Front Bench. The essential point is that it is not enough to introduce a provision in the Budget statement that suggests that the Government are being extremely generous. Although I would not turn away a single penny that may go to charities as a result of the clause, it does not go anywhere near making up for what the Government have already taken away from them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): It is a pity that the hon. Gentleman has dragged the debate down, although that is not unusual. The Minister listened to what was said, so he said that the Government had caved in. We are often accused of not listening to the arguments, and people ask whether this is a useful forum in which to air views. We have had a good debate and the Minister made a clear case. It is difficult to know why we have been accused of caving in; we listened to the good points that were made. It is important to stress that the clause extends the relief for a gift of equipment or trading stock by businesses, so it helps all charitable concerns. It is incredible that the hon. Member for Witney should think that that is a bad thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> For the sake of clarification, I must repeat that I did not suggest that it was a bad thing. My point was that as &#163;400 million has been taken away from charities in a previous Finance Bill, the benefit of &#163;5 million, or &#163;10 million in subsequent years, still leaves those charities short of about &#163;390 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg<?h -.001pt>:</B>: As usual, the hon. Gentleman ducks the point. I reiterate that the clause makes things better. It provides an opportunity for giving, both by individuals and by companies, in various shapes and forms. We learnt about offcuts, which the hon. Member for Guildford mentioned, and which are a useful gift for many companies to make, certainly to young people in training and education.
<P>
We must not lose sight of the fact that, despite the comments of the hon. Member for Witney, the clause extends tax relief. That is a good thing, and it has been welcomed by the charities.
<P>
The legal costs must be set against the background of the review of charities taxation, which began in July 1997. We want the system to be more coherent and consistent. The clause improves the system inherited from the previous Government, which was neither coherent nor simple to administer. It will also reduce companies' costs. Our policy towards taxation is to reduce tax avoidance by ensuring that money is given for the appropriate purpose.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants has been mentioned, and the paper from the Library shows that many similar bodies, such as the Chartered Institute of Taxation, have said that they welcome the measure. Although such organisations have expressed a few concerns, which the hon. Member for Guildford outlined, in principle they have welcomed the clause and its aims. Listening to Opposition Members, one would think that the clause was bad--so I am glad that the hon. Member for Witney has been moved to clarify his position.
<P>
On the whole, charities benefit to the extent of &#163;1.75 billion. In the context of the clause, &#163;1 billion is direct tax relief and &#163;200 million is VAT relief, with the rest relating to business rates. We want a healthy, giving, commercial sector, and that is what the clause tries to achieve.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney said that we should listen to members of the public, companies and organisations. I believe that there were 3,000 replies to the consultation. Although some concerns have been raised, it must have been an excellent consultation to have brought in so many constructive views. People welcome the fact that the Government consulted so widely. The consultation might even have held up the changes being made in the Bill, because so many representations were made.
<P>
A number of recommendations relevant to clause51 could be made about the definition of eligible charities and business donations. That goes back to my earlier point about improving the definition and providing clarity. We want to encourage gifts of assets to charities; we want charities to be supported. That, too, has resulted from the Government's proposals. [Interruption.] I am being asked what happened last time. Last year's Budget extended tax relief for gifts to charities for medical purposes--another Government initiative. One must wonder whether Opposition Members have a specific criticism of the Government, or whether they broadly welcome the position on charities.

<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> I shall, so long as the hon. Gentleman makes a sensible point this time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am always delighted to make a sensible point to the hon. Gentleman, and I shall now remind him that during the debate on last year's Finance Bill, when the original measure was introduced, Opposition Members pressed the Government to extend it and the Government resisted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> The hon. Gentleman's gall knows no bounds. The Government consulted. They asked charities, companies and individuals what they would like to see, and the results of that are here, and in other measures.
<P>
There is an important point to be made about why people are not giving as much as they used to. The hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) seemed to suggest that it was something to do with Government policy. However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which carried out a survey, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The charitable giving behaviour of UK households has been changing over the last 23 years. In particular, patterns emerge in the types of households that are most likely to give to charity and how much they give, as well as the form in which they give.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Not only do today's young households give less frequently than today's middle-aged, but they give less frequently than today's middle-aged did when they were young.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There has been a pattern change, and it is rather disingenuous to try to blame the Government for the drop in charitable giving. The whole purpose of clause 51 and our approach to charities is to encourage more giving. The Government have made a pretty good start. They are not perfect and they have to do more, but they have listened, and have made a good start overall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): I shall pick up the theme of making a good start with which my hon. Friend concluded his remarks. It is important in this context to realise that the Government have invited further responses on the subject of charitable giving, which they want to be submitted by the end of August. One should not assume that the Government's ears are closed, that they have set things in print and will not take on board any further representations from the charities. I hope that the Opposition will take that on board.
<P>
I particularly like proposed new section83A, which allows people to give gifts in kind to charities. That will enable companies of all sorts to review their strategy of giving to charity. It is not simply a matter of looking at profitability at the end of the year and assessing, as I used to in my company, what could be given to charity and which charities to support. Here is a new opportunity for companies to say, ``We manufacture goods that can be of use to different charities in different ways.'' The cost to those companies of such gifts is incidental to the global productivity of the company, but to the charities concerned, they can be of real value. I particularly welcome that aspect of the clause, and I am sure that it will be heartily welcomed by the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): May I mention a personal interest? My company, Pure Crete, is a travel company which restores locally owned village houses. I am picking up the theme of charitable donations, particularly as certain companies can donate to charities linked with their raison d'etre their competitive market position and their product. My company gives money for the survival and preservation in Crete of the bearded vulture--[Hon. Members: ``The Secretary of State for Health.''] We also fund a hatchery for the endangered loggerhead turtle.
<P>
There is no direct benefit to consumers in that, other than knowing that we are a good company that looks after the environment and supports the environmental proposition, not with words but with actions, so more loggerhead turtles survive and more bearded vultures reproduce. As we approach the millennium, a regime in which contributions are made to good causes and charities is a good idea for a fiscal method.
<P>
Furthermore, the business community is now more in tune with the idea of being a stakeholder in a broader partnership society. I am active in Croydon's business community, where companies are thinking about donating to broader sociological concerns, such as education, which have an input into corporate affairs.
<P>
The Government are giving benefits so that money can be spent charitably, which is good. We face a future in which people think less about their individual activities and are more broadly interested in how those activities fit into a whole. People will have a stronger idea of themselves as stakeholders in the environment and in the broader economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Let us get this in perspective. All those things may be true, and one hopes that they are. However, the clause makes provision for a sum amounting to &#163;5 million--10p for every man, woman and child in the United Kingdom. Yet we are taking &#163;400 million away from the charities. What will we do to make up for the money that is being taken away? We should not celebrate giving back &#163;5 million, when &#163;400 million will have been taken away. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Yes, &#163;5 million is a lot to a bearded vulture.
<P>
I have a relationship with Nestle, which is based in Croydon. Nestle is surrounded by controversy in relation to the marketing of milk products in the third world. I have just proposed an initiative to the company. ``Frankly, Nestle,'' I said, ``Why don't you--''[Interruption.] I am referring not to you, Mr.Butterfill, but to Nestle. ``Why don't you invest millions in Water Aid?'' I said to Nestle. To be blunt, everyone complains that Nestle's milk products involve the use of dirty water, which kills babies. So why does Nestle not spend millions on cleaner water? I had an informal chat on the train from East Croydon with one of the directors of Nestle about that, and I will shortly have a meeting with the managing director to discuss charitable opportunities.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. In discussing charitable opportunities, the hon. Gentleman is straying widely. I am sure that all Committee members are in favour of more opportunities for giving to charities, but the hon. Gentleman should return to the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Right, Mr. Butterfill, I shall conclude my remarks.
<P>
It makes sense if charitable donations made by business in the regime created by the Government fit in with a business mission--as in the case of Nestle and Water Aid, and, in a lesser way, in the case of the bearded vulture.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that the problem discussed by the hon. Member for Witney involved the management of income? In a difficult climate, charities must think about supporting large, often international enterprises. With the kind of initiatives mentioned by my hon. Friend, business can almost wholly, and cost-effectively, subsidise a local charity through donations in kind. The Government's proposals will help to ensure that that happens.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> That is precisely the point that I was trying to make. Coming across loud and clear with great unity, in this fine Committee in the mother of all Parliaments, is the idea that the business community should move forward and explore charitable opportunities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Given that there was some mirth surrounding the example of the bearded vulture--Gyps Barbatus--I do not want the Committee to think that it is not a serious issue for charities. The RSPCA is worried about conservation of the bearded vulture--one of the endangered species living in the Pyrenees. It is identifiable by its habit of dropping bones on to rocks in order to crack--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am afraid that the particular habits of the bearded vulture are not precisely matters that should be debated under clause 51 stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Indeed, the bearded vulture is nothing to do with the Secretary of State for Health either. We are not here to discuss the bearded vulture or loggerhead turtles, but I was providing a narrow example, illustrating how a small and medium-sized enterprise could make charitable donations under a mission statement. I mentioned the bearded vulture to show that there are opportunities--that make business sense--for small companies to make charitable donations. Those opportunities are not limited to large multinational companies making small donations--that appear to be large--to certain charities.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are moving towards a new environment and a new paradigm in which the business community can look forward to enjoying relationships with charities. Consumers are more aware than ever before of what is good and bad morally as well as thinking in utilitarian terms. It is important to consider not just what people do, but the ethical background to what is happening.
<P>
Such communication is important and will encourage people to ask about products that may be linked with charities. They might think about reasons for buying a product, or they might opt for the Co-op bank because of its ethical investment. I am talking about a broader change in society, linked to our stakeholder view. People's responsibilities to each other will be linked to our success in the business world--[Interruption.] With those shouts from outside, I will finish.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt<?h -.001pt>:</B> I rise with great pleasure to respond to an immensely entertaining, well informed, formative and properly wide-ranging debate on this important clause. We have heard excellent speeches from my hon. Friends the Members for Halton (Mr. Twigg), for Brent, North (Mr.Gardiner) and for Croydon, Central (Mr.Davies). All drew on their expertise in working with and supporting charities through their business activities.
<P>
As I observed earlier, it was also good to hear from Opposition Members about similar support for charities and the application of business expertise to benefit them. I regret only that the hon. Member for Witney did not extend the charitable spirit, which he gives to Childline and other organisations, to this side of the House, which has demonstrated so clearly again today its willingness to listen, to learn and, whenever sensible and constructive points are made, to try to accommodate them.
<P>
I should perhaps declare a particular interest regarding my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central. Before he and I were elected Members of Parliament, I had the good fortune to take my family on holiday to--[Hon. Members: ``Croydon?''] No, Crete, by virtue of the company that my hon. Friend ran, no doubt from Croydon. Although I did not have the pleasure of seeing a bearded vulture or a loggerhead turtle on that holiday, I was delighted to know then, and to hear in more detail today, of the environmental and ethical responsibilities that many companies display in doing business. I am not sure that there are many bearded vultures in the House, but loggerhead turtle is a thoroughly apt description of right hon. and hon. Members of the official Opposition at loggerheads over Europe--

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Endangered species.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Precisely so. The right hon. Member for Charnwood, who is a member of the Committee, is busy elsewhere speaking on the European Union--he is indeed a loggerhead turtle--and so is the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory).
<P>
My hon. Friends have elaborated on the welcome extension of relief for business giving in the clause. The original relief for business giving of gifts, equipment and trading stock was introduced in 1991 and confined to educational establishments. I observe in an entirely charitable spirit that the previous Government did not see fit to extend the relief for business gifts in kind to a wider class of charity.
<P>
Last year, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor decided, as part of our additional efforts to encourage people to give money and gifts for the benefit of the poorest people in the poorest countries, to extend the relief to gifts in kind for educational and medical purposes in the world's 80 poorest countries. We undertook then to consider wider relief as part of our charity review and we did so. Many charities that responded to the first phase of the review of charity taxation asked the Government to extend existing tax relief for gifts to all charities and we readily agreed to that request. It was promised in the consultation document published on Budget day and the extension of tax relief on corporate giving was introduced as part of this year's Finance Bill. It does not pretend to be more than a modest step towards a much larger objective: to create a dynamic culture of giving.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Halton spoke brilliantly about the need to raise levels of giving by individuals and by businesses. That is precisely the purpose of the review of charity taxation upon which we embarked after we were elected. The consultation document on the charity taxation review makes it clear that we do not see it as the Government's job to tell charities how to do their job, nor is it our job to finance them. Our job, as a responsible Government who want to create a culture of giving and mutual responsibility in our community, is to create a dynamic environment with the right incentives, which, of course, includes incentives in the form of tax relief that will encourage more people to give more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Perhaps in the light of what the Economic Secretary said she will address the central question: whatever the Government's aspirations to create an exciting, vibrant, giving economy, the reality is that through their changes to ACT credits, the Government took away &#163;400 million--which they do not acknowledge--from the charitable sector. What action does the Economic Secretary want to take to compensate those charities, or does she no longer regard that as the Government's business?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I was about to come to that point, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman will wait a moment. He also referred to Childline, which does wonderful work on behalf of children who have suffered or who fear abuse, bullying or similar problems, and he talked about the decline in giving from which it and other charities have suffered. My hon. Friend the Member for Halton properly made the point that the decline in giving was not caused by the present Government; the origins of the problem go back a long way. As my hon. Friend said, a decline has taken place over some decades in the proportion of each age group that gives to charity, although some compensation has been provided by an increase in the average level of donations.
<P>
As a result, although the charitable sector as a whole has seen its income from donations increase, that income has been derived from a declining and ageing donor base. As my hon. Friend rightly said, the Institute of Directors survey, and other surveys, show that there has been a worrying decline in the proportion of young people who give to charity, compared with the proportion of older people who gave when they were young.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> My hon. Friend makes the correct point, which I was trying to make earlier. Over 20 years a decline in giving has taken place, and the age profile has changed. What did Conservative Governments do to change that? We are being accused of scuppering charitable giving, but when the Conservative party was in power, individual giving, across households and age groups, decreased considerably.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend is right; he makes an important point. The values encouraged by Conservative Governments during the 1980s--when what was correctly dubbed a ``Me now'' society was created--are utterly antithetical to those of mutual responsibility and charitable giving.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I shall make two points for the record. The average donation in 1978 was &#163;2.24 a week. By 1993 it was &#163;4.27, which is nearly double the 1978 average. It is ungracious of the Economic Secretary to characterise the past 20 years in such a way.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I have already made the point that the hon. Gentleman has just made--that the average value of donations went up, and as a result, the total amount donated to the charitable sector increased. The problem is that the number of donors has fallen, and in particular, the proportion of each age group that gives to charity has fallen. Fewer young people now make donations to charity than when my generation was much younger.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall give way first to the hon. Member for Witney, and then to my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> It is important to correct the impressions that are being given. As I reminded the Economic Secretary, the average donation has almost doubled during the past 20 years, when the Conservative party was in power. A comparison of the percentage of households giving to charity in 1979 with that in 1995 is significant: in 1979 it was 32.4 per cent. and in 1995 it was 31.9 per cent. I accept that a slight decline has taken place, but it must be seen in proportion. We must recognise the problem, but we must also recognise that ACT credits for charities were a clever way of guaranteeing charities a steady income at a time when donations were falling.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the number of donors--the proportion of households giving--has declined. My point was that the average figure that he quotes masks the worrying fall in the proportion of young donors. They are the donors of the future and they are not getting in the habit of giving. A better approach is to try to create a dynamic environment with effective incentives that will ensure that more people give more. That is the approach that the Government are taking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary is right to say that we should use the tax system to promote a culture of giving, and increase the number of donors and donations, rather than compensating for a declining level of donation. The official Opposition said that they wanted to throw &#163;400 million at charities, but what is needed is the transformation in the culture of giving that the Budget's tax changes will bring about. I should be interested to hear the Economic Secretary's comments on that.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend is right: the issue of tax credits, with which I shall deal in a moment, is not related to that of donations. Through the tax review the Government have put forward an exciting series of options, which have been warmly welcomed by the charities sector, for the simplification, modernisation and substantial increase in the generosity of, tax incentives. Those options will incentivise giving by businesses, individuals and employees through the payroll giving system. As hon. Members have said, it is important to reverse the decline in giving that has been most pronounced among younger households. The Institute for Fiscal Studies conducted a survey of households that gave to charity in 1978 and in 1993 and found that the proportion of younger households giving to charity had fallen from 28 per cent. to 21 per cent. That is a worrying decline.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Although the lottery is not a mainstream charity per se, since its advent, younger families give much more money in that way. If we bear in mind the global picture of donations to various good causes, the trend is not as dire as it first appears.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point, but I should stress that the decline to which I referred predates the lottery.
<P>
In our review of charity taxation, we set out a range of options designed to achieve the broad purpose of encouraging more people to give more, of which clause51 is simply the first instalment. For example, we have considered suggestions for significantly reducing the minimum limit at which tax relief can be claimed for a gift aid donation. That would allow the much simpler method of payment by instalment, streamline the payroll giving scheme and give it an additional tax relief kick-start. As I said, all such suggestions have been warmly welcomed by charities and will, I hope, be welcomed by the official Opposition when the appropriate measures are introduced in next year's Finance Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney mentioned dividend tax credits. We have of course listened to the concerns expressed by charities. However, just as the wider review of charity taxation is designed to create a dynamic environment that will encourage giving, so the reform of tax credits is designed to create a more dynamic environment for investment. The tax credit change in 1997 was part of a wider package that included substantial and welcome cuts in corporation tax rates, and was designed to help promote economic stability and rebalance the tax system in favour of long-term investment. It removed an inherited distortion in the tax system that gave companies a perverse incentive to distribute surplus as dividends instead of retaining it for internal investment, thereby contributing towards the company's growth.

<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward<?h -.001pt>:</B> In the light of the Economic Secretary's remarks and the consequences of the change that her Government made in a previous Finance Bill, what is her advice to charities that have depended on that stream of income?
<P>
<B>The Chairman<?h -.001pt>:</B> Order. We have had enough on the contents of previous Finance Bills. We are debating a specific clause. I hope that the Economic Secretary will not be tempted down that path.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt<?h -.001pt>:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Butterfill. We have debated this issue many times. I remind the hon. Member for Witney that we not only deferred the introduction of the change until April this year, but put in place a five-year transitional relief for charities alone, which will cost the Exchequer &#163;1 billion.
<P>
The clause introduces a welcome extension of an existing tax relief for business gifts in kind. It is part of a broader strategy which will unfold in the years ahead to encourage a greater number of people to give more. In that charitable spirit, I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt<?h -.001pt>:</B> I should like to explain briefly the purpose of the clause. The Standing Committee that discussed last year's Finance Bill welcomed the introduction of the millennium gift aid scheme, which forms part of the Government's initiative on debt relief in the world's poorest countries. Millennium gift aid allows tax relief on charitable donations of &#163;100 or more which are made before the end of December 2000, whether they are made as a single lump sum or in instalments.
<P>
The clause provides donors and charities with certainty, from the outset, on the rate of tax that the charity can reclaim from the Inland Revenue when a donation that is made by instalments has been completed. At the moment, the tax that can be reclaimed is calculated at the basic rate in force when the instalments finish. We are changing that so that the tax that can be reclaimed is calculated at the basic rate in force when the instalments start.
<P>
Provided that a donor starts to make instalment payments by 5 April next year, the charity will be able to reclaim tax at the current basic rate of 23 per cent., although the basic rate will have fallen to 22 per cent. by the time the final instalment is made. With the announcement by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor that millennium gift aid will be extended to cover donations for Kosovan refugees, the clause delivers an important improvement to the benefits offered to charities by the millennium gift aid scheme. It will apply from 31 July 1998--the date on which the scheme started--and I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley){**?h -.001pt**}: I was reminded earlier this evening that at about this time last year I spoke in favour of the original clause on the millennium gift aid scheme in the Finance (No. 2) Bill. It is interesting to see the scheme coming to fruition--how it has developed and how we can fine tune the system to make it more responsive to public demand.
<P>
The clause provides greater clarity and simplicity for donors and charities in calculating the tax relief by basing it on the initial instalment rather than the final instalment. That clarity and certainty provides various benefits, not least in boosting the number of public donations to the worthy, educational, health and anti-poverty causes that make up the millennium gift aid scheme in 80 of the world's poorest countries. It is estimated that between 150 million and 261 million extra donations will be made by the general public under the scheme, which runs until 31 December 2000. Removing complexity from the scheme will help to prevent people being deterred from joining it.
<P>
The scheme allows for lump sum donations and for the phasing of donations through instalments. I am glad that the paperless direct debit system has enabled young people in particular to make donations to the millennium gift aid scheme. The clause will simplify the system for charities and will ensure that donations are boosted further.
<P>
It might be appropriate at this point to give the telephone number of millennium gift aid. It is 0845 075 2000. It is also possible to make donations over the internet. The internet address of millennium gift aid is www.giftaid2000.org.uk. I hope that everyone will consider visiting the site and that they will join in with the Government's approach--the giving age--as we move into the next millennium.
<P>
The millennium gift aid scheme will be advertised on, for example, beer mats and cinema tickets, which will promote it among young people in particular. Such advertising will remind us of the wonders of the clause, which will help to ensure that millennium gift aid will thrive and succeed as we go into the next century.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies<?h -.001pt>:</B> Under the clause, tax will be reclaimed at the basic rate for the year in which contributions start. That is good, because it will give charities budgetary certainty. The Government are committed to reducing tax; the risk is that eventually taxes will be so low that not so much money will be raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie<?h -.001pt>:</B> That is the essence of the clause. My hon. Friend alludes to the Government's generosity towards charities. We are cutting taxes for the general population, and we are giving extra benefits to charities. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making such a wonderfully fluent and excitingly spontaneous contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Healey </B>(Wentworth){**?h -.001pt**}: I had not planned to speak to the clause, but I want to make some brief comments.
<P>
I worked for several charities during the 1980s. When the then Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), introduced the original gift aid scheme in his 1990 Budget speech, the charities sector warmly welcomed the gift aid innovation. Charities had lobbied for such a scheme for some time, and they made great use of it. When it was first introduced, tax relief was given on one-off donations of more than &#163;600. The figures were fine-tuned in subsequent Budgets. The threshold was reduced in, I think, 1992, to &#163;400, and the current level is &#163;250.
<P>
Our experience of the gift aid scheme underlines the importance of its introduction in 1990. Charities calculate that they have now received more than &#163;1 billion through the scheme. The introduction of the millennium gift aid scheme last year is a similarly creative and innovative move. The same spirit lies behind the introduction of that scheme and of the gift aid scheme in 1990. The millennium gift aid scheme will allow individuals and businesses to get tax relief on charitable donations that are destined for the 80 poorest countries in the world, where the money will be used for education and anti-poverty projects. That was equally warmly welcomed by my erstwhile colleagues in the charity sector. Like the original gift aid scheme, the clause fine tunes and further develops the original concept of that scheme.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central emphasised that one of the benefits of the clause will be that charities will receive tax relief on donations they receive at the basic rate of 23 per cent.--the same as when the scheme was introduced on 21 July 1998--and will not suffer from the income tax reductions introduced in this year's Budget. That is the fun point.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The serious point, in the charities' view, is not just the amount that they stand to gain, but the fact that it will be more predictable. As the explanatory notes make clear, the clause ensures that donors and charities will know from the outset what rate of tax relief will be available on a donation. That is crucial for charity managers who want to make the most of the millennium gift aid scheme, because they are often under considerable pressure to make ends meet. I warmly welcome the clause and look forward to its introduction.

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn<?h -.001pt>:</B> May I welcome the Chief Secretary to the Committee? This debate has spurred many Labour Members to speak for what seems like the first time in our deliberations. We look forward to many more helpful contributions from the Labour Benches. I hope that the Chief Secretary is not in Committee simply because word has spread about the Government accepting Opposition amendments this evening, and because he has come to stiffen the resolve of his colleagues on the Front Bench. I assure him that, in a spirit of constructive opposition, our amendments aim to improve the Bill, not simply to score points--easy though that would be in any circumstances, particularly in relation to the Bill.
<P>
We are dealing with several proposals that build on the new consensus about the direction of education in this country and, in particular, the ways in which we can benefit schools in this country and overseas. If businesses are to be encouraged to second their employees to work in schools, we should not limit the proposal to schools in this country. It is eminently sensible that people should gain experience from working in other European Union states and, indeed, in the United States of America, which, in the past, has been regarded by the educational establishment in this country as having little to offer but is now increasingly recognised as having many new ideas. Those ideas have been learnt by Conservatives and local education authorities, and they are even evident in the Government's initiatives. In fact, developments in education in the United States are so much more interesting that the Select Committee on Education and Employment, of which I am a member, intends to visit the United States this summer to learn from the experience over there.

<P>

<B>Ms Keeble<?h -.001pt>:</B> I started my education in the United States. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the most important lesson we can learn from the American education system is that education there is provided, almost exclusively, by the state sector?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn<?h -.001pt>:</B> I, too, benefited from being taught in the United States of America.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie<?h -.001pt>:</B> In the state sector?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn<?h -.001pt>:</B> Not in the state sector, but by the commercial organisation for which I worked. For that reason, I cannot agree with the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) that only the state sector in America has something teach us.
<P>
What the American education system teaches us is that when the state sector wants to deliver good education, it can turn to the private sector to make the provision subject to various basic standards. That is the thinking behind charter schools in the United States, and behind the new school being developed in Guildford, Kings Manor school, which was previously failing. That approach is also finally penetrating the Government's thinking on how to tackle problems of continual failure by Labour-run local education authorities, such as Islington or Hackney, on which the Economic Secretary made a statement in the House only a few weeks ago.
<P>
I warmly recommend to the Government the idea that we should extend the benefits of clause 53 to those seconded to the United States, as well as to those seconded to other European Union countries. Many people have benefited from taking a year out before taking up full-time employment--I am one of them. It has always been recognised that those with degrees may be better able to deliver a benefit to the country that they visit, as well as gaining in terms of personal development.
<P>
Because of the new regime of tuition fees and the higher cost of debts with which students leave university, it is difficult for graduates to contemplate a year out before going into full-time employment. For those wishing to take a year out in order to contribute to their own personal development and to make a contribution to the country that they visit, the type of scheme proposed in clause 53 may be one of the few ways in which they can do so.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I know that the hon. Lady is interested in this matter, but I would like to continue this argument a little longer.
<P>
This scheme would provide one of the few ways in which graduates would be able to afford to take a year out, because the company which they were about to join would also recognise the benefits of their taking that year out. They might, for example, improve their linguistic skills in a part of the world to which the company intended to send them in the future.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems somewhat out of touch with the realities of education. Will he accept that many colleges, especially those that provide business studies courses, have regular exchange programmes with other countries, particularly other European countries? Northampton university college is a classic example. It has regular exchange programmes in which thousands of students visit other countries for a year.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I know from the experience of the University of Surrey in my constituency how important a year out can be, as part of a course. However, we are discussing those who wish to make a contribution after they have attained their qualification, and cannot, under the Government's new funding regime, consider a year out unless it is sponsored by the company that they are going to join. Many such placements would be educational, and unless clause 53 is amended as we suggest, it will be hard for those graduates to avail themselves of those opportunities.
<P>
May I bring the hon. Member for Northampton, North up to date? Organisations such as Voluntary Service Overseas, which have excluded school leavers from their programmes for 30 years, now find that, because of the dearth of graduate applicants, they have to go back to the 18-plus sector to obtain volunteers for their overseas programmes. That is another example of how the new regime is affecting the contribution that has been made to overseas development, as well as to the development of the individuals concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): I am genuinely ignorant about foreign taxation systems. Will the hon. Gentleman explain to the Committee whether, if we accept his amendment, reciprocal arrangements would operate from other member states of the European Union and from the United States? If not, does he feel that it is appropriate for us to operate a tax system that does not have reciprocal arrangements with other countries?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The whole point of cultural exchange is that reciprocal benefit is built in. The benefit that a graduate obtains from working for a year in another country is unquantifiable. It is almost certainly as great as the benefit obtained by the country in which he works. The amendment would improve contact with our European Union partners and with our vital NATO partner, the United States.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I will not, because we have limited time available. We have heard many contributions--I will not describe them as eloquent--from the hon. Gentleman. When he rose, I wondered how bearded animals would benefit from the clause.
<P>
The amendments also relate to private sector involvement in the management of schools. They would ensure that, when a local education authority has delegated the running of a school to a private sector company, the provisions of the clause would apply.
<P>
Subject to the agreement of the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, a private sector company will run a local state school in my constituency, so we shall look to businesses in my constituency to contribute. One of the ways that they might do that is by seconding someone from the business to play a part in the school. Without the wider framework proposed in the amendments, that type of contribution will be excluded. That is not because the Government mean to exclude it, but because the clause does not take into account the fact that the private sector increasingly plays a role in state schools.
<P>
Private sector involvement in the school in Guildford is not part of an ideological crusade. It is a pilot in a carefully thought-out programme. After the Government's initial resistance--indeed hostility--to such programmes, they have accepted the idea. In fact, they have been won round to such an extent that the Department for Education and Employment is thinking of involving the private sector to sort out the historic problems found in Labour-run local education authorities, such as Islington. If private sector companies are prepared to second their staff to help improve the running of schools not only in Guildford but in Islington, it will be a great pity if that is not possible because of the narrow definitions in the clause.
<P>
A constructive cross-party consensus has emerged over developments in education. I hope to build on the agreement that we reached earlier, and I look forward to the Economic Secretary's reply.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am sorry that the contribution of the hon. Member for Guildford was marred only by his reluctance to accept an intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central, who contributed so brilliantly to the previous debate. I am afraid that, having spotted loggerhead turtles on the other side of the Room, my hon. Friend has left our deliberations for the rest of the evening. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will, on reflection, regret his churlishness.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman misunderstands--whether deliberately or not--the intentions behind the clause and section 86(3) of the Taxes Act 1988, which the clause reintroduces. That section ensured that a deduction was available for businesses that second staff to educational establishments when computing business costs for tax purposes. That relief expired on 1 April 1997--only one month before the expiry of the Government who introduced it.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are reinstating that tax relief and updating the description of the educational establishments referred to in section 86. The tax relief that was introduced then, and which we are now reinstating, is for businesses that second their own staff to schools or other educational establishments. The issue is not about staff who are already employed in schools going abroad to overseas schools to learn new ideas on education. That never was the purpose of the relief introduced in the 1988 Act, and nor is it the purpose of this clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford spoke eloquently about the benefits gained by activities such as those sponsored by VSO, which is a registered charity. Secondment by business to charities is already covered by section 86, so there is no need to extend the clause to deal with that, or to ensure that businesses can second staff to charities.
<P>
Another aspect that must be stressed is that under general tax principles, relief is already available when, for business purposes, a business decides to second a member of staff to an educational establishment, whether in this country or abroad. That is available under general business purposes.
<P>
That brings me to amendment No. 181. The intention of the clause is to reinstate the relief that was available under the 1988 Act. It will encourage businesses to support and improve the resources available to educational establishments in the United Kingdom, and ensure that additional staff become available to our own schools. We do not have a particular public policy objective in supporting the resources of educational establishments elsewhere in the European Union or, indeed, in the United States of America. When a secondment is an expense that is incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes, it will qualify in any case as a deduction when computing trading profits for tax purposes, under general tax deduction principles.
<P>
Of course, development of staff is a proper business expense. If a company decides that it would be useful to send a member of staff on secondment to an educational establishment in America, it will already get tax relief. The reintroduction of specific relief will ensure that there are no gaps. It makes it crystal clear that secondment to United Kingdom educational establishments will attract the specific relief provided by this clause, which was previously provided by the 1988 Act. Amendment No. 181 is, therefore, not necessary, so I hope that the hon. Member for Guildford will withdraw it.
<P>
I turn now to amendments Nos. 179 and 180. The purpose of amendment No. 179, which would add the words ``or otherwise supported'', is to extend the scope of tax relief to those schools in England and Wales that may not already be covered by the legislation. That would include some independent special schools that cater for children with special educational needs. In the general spirit of co-operation that has characterised today's proceedings, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for identifying that helpful extension, which I propose to accept.
<P>
Amendment No. 180 proposes a similar extension of the scope of tax relief to schools in Scotland. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Guildford is unnecessary because Scotland has a different education system. Legislation already covers education establishments that could be described as ``supported'', and the type of arm's length relationship between education authorities and educational establishments which would be caught by the amendment in relation to English establishments simply does not exist. Thus there is no need for the additional wording proposed in the amendment in respect of Scottish education establishments. I hope that the hon. Member will withdraw his amendment, but, to ensure that there is no doubt among my hon. Friends, especially my hon. Friend the Whip, let me make it clear that I accept amendment No. 179 on the Government's behalf.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn<?h -.001pt>:: I am grateful for the Economic Secretary's sincerity. I admire her courage, given that she is sitting next to the Chief Secretary, in being so generous to the Opposition. I am grateful to her for pointing out that the 1988 provisions expired within a month of the previous Government's leaving office: it proves that all good things come to an end, but we hope to resurrect them one day.</B><P>
<P>
I ask her to reconsider her statement because there will be instances where, I hope, companies will be prepared to second people to the European Union or the United States of America not only for business purposes but for cultural and goodwill reasons. Given that we are 11 years on from the 1988 Act--and we have heard much from the Government about being prepared to give more to Europe so as to get more--I am surprised that the hon. Lady did not accept amendment No. 180 as well. One thing that I learnt when I was being educated in the United States was the 80-20 rule whereby, if we get 80 per cent. of what we ask for, we should stop there. I am most grateful to her for accepting amendment No. 179. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``except in respect of higher rate tax payers.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn: Clause 167 is what I would term the ``learning age'' clause of the Finance Bill. As I understand the Government's intentions, the clause is the precursor to their new regime for the individual learning account, which they regard as the means by which we can promote more vocational training.</B><P>
<P>
It is worth pausing for a moment to remind the Committee that, in reality, the learning age commenced on the day in 1993 when the previous Government set free colleges of further education from the iron control of local education authorities and gave them the independence to grow, and to build learning for all sectors of society. So successful at it have the colleges been that, in the subsequent six years, they have managed to put through their courses a further 30 per cent. of adults and school leavers for the same cost in real terms as was paid six years earlier. That was a 30 per cent. one-off productivity gain from releasing further education colleges from the shackles of their LEAs.
<P>
When the Select Committee on Education and Employment conducted an inquiry into further education colleges just over a year ago many Labour members were on the alert for a decline in the quality of further education colleges as a result of this change. They found little evidence of that. Indeed, the evidence was that there had been virtually no change in the quality of the courses that were being delivered, including those delivered through franchising--something that we need to consider in the context of this clause--even though the saving had been made.
<P>
None of us felt that such a significant productivity gain could be extended ad infinitum. The Government are right to take stock and to congratulate the previous Government on their achievement in extending the learning age and seeing in what ways they can build on that achievement at the periphery--this is very much at the periphery, I am afraid. I welcome their efforts to try to do so. The purpose of the amendment is to say that in trying to extend training and to encourage training for those who would perhaps not have thought it suitable for them, we should not attack the training that is already taking place. The amendments relating to higher rates of income tax payers are not intended to provide some tax sop to the rich, but to provoke the Government into coming forward with a proper definition of how help appropriate to higher tax payers--in other words, those who are more highly skilled--may be delivered.
<P>
The weakness of the Government's scheme as set out here and in their press release is that it has to apply across the board to all employees in a business. There may be businesses where those who have not had enough education in the past will benefit from tax concessions and incentives for employer-driven training. But there will be other businesses where, quite simply because of their nature, it is right to focus any such help on the more highly skilled members of the work force, The problem with the individual learning account set-up, as it is understood by business, by chartered accountants and by many others who commented on the Bill, is that it presumes that for an individual learning account scheme sponsored or funded by a company to have merit it must apply across the board.
<P>
I can well understand why the Government want to emphasise the help that they give to those who may not have had enough education in the past, but it is a mistake to force companies into a regime that obliges them to give exactly the same benefit to all. That top-down economic view of society, which tries to regulate the way in which business operates, flies in the face of the needs of modern businesses which favour a flexible environment in which they have tax incentives to do what is best for their industry. That may mean giving support to the more highly skilled--those who, as a proxy in these amendments, we have talked of as higher rate taxpayer. Our amendment is aimed at the more highly skilled.
<P>
The other aspect is that there was an attack in the Inland Revenue press release on people who go on diving courses. What can one say? We have heard a lot about loggerhead turtles. We saw a classic example of a political loggerhead turtle on a diving course when the Deputy Prime Minister went on his world jaunt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there has been a significant misuse of vocational training relief as a way of training appropriate people?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn: I am sorry but for a long time there have been attacks on franchising courses, which our Select Committee found provided a lot of benefit. Equally, there is an aspect of personal development in flying or diving courses, which develop team work in an organisation. That goes well beyond the shorthand description that they must be freebies. The hon. Gentleman and, indeed, the Government are mistaken in assuming that diving courses--one of which proved so beneficial to the Deputy Prime Minister--should not prove beneficial to the career development of those working in commercial industry.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Love: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way again.</B><P>
<P>
The benefits mentioned by the hon. Gentleman depend on whether such courses are vocational or recreational. Does he accept that, in many cases, diving courses and similar courses are recreational, rather than vocational?
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Such courses must lead to a formal qualification, such as a national vocational qualification, if they are to qualify for the tax relief obtained in the past. Many people who take diving and flying courses do not qualify for the benefit.
<P>
The clause will introduce a stealth tax. The saving from the change will be about &#163;25 million a year, although the cost of the new regime is estimated at only &#163;10 million a year. Will the Economic Secretary comment on that?
<P>
Finally, will someone who goes on a degree course be allowed to have an overdraft on his or her individual learning account? If an employer or future employer contributes to an individual learning account after the completion of a course which leads to an overdraft, will the costs be tax deductible? If we are to allow a tax break, it should apply to heavier student debts incurred under the new student funding regime, so that when graduates get a job, their employers can help them to discharge that debt through the mechanism of the individual learning account.
<P>
It would be invidious if payments made by a new employer to discharge that debt were a taxable benefit, but vocational training was not. That would militate against those going for a higher education qualification, rather than a further education qualification, suggesting a blind spot in the Government's programme.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble: I support the Government's proposals and oppose the amendments. Like many other provisions in the Bill, the proposals are part of a radical recasting of how this country divides education and continuing education. The hon. Member for Guildford implied that the individual learning accounts are only part of the story. However, the changes go much wider than that, and it is important to point out why the proposals are correct and why the alternatives are wrong.</B><P>
<P>
On the surface, ending support may appear to be against Labour's principles. The real benefit of the proposals is that they make it possible to change the climate of adult education, ensuring that training and support are in line with what people need, providing them with positive material benefits. Industry will also benefit. Vocational training may not always be recreational, but it does not perform a real service for industry or equip individuals with practical skills.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Guildford that we should celebrate the achievements of further education colleges, which were realised in spite of, not because of, the actions of the previous Government. Problems remain to be sorted out. We should listen carefully to what the further education sector says. It does not enjoy a coherent policy, organisational or funding framework. Various issues are being examined by this Government and proposals will be brought forward shortly. The fact remains that the FE sector succeeded in what it did because it was put under pressure and had to fight for its survival in difficult times.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford is wrong to pretend that the decision to take the further education sector out of local authority control was pain free. We can all argue about the framework for services, but when the FE sector was floated off, vast amounts of basic vocational training were lost by some of the most vulnerable adults.
<P>
I was a council leader at that time. The FE college floated off reasonably well and we all got on with it--there were no great ideological battles. However, we had to shut down many adult education centres. Many people did not learn to read and write because their courses were shut down: they were no longer viable when the FE sector was floated off.
<P>
We also faced real problems with racist attacks on students in our FE college. As long as that college was linked to the council, we bussed students in, provided security guards as students went in and out of their classes and CCTV covered the whole college. But when the college was floated off, the council faced real difficulties and could no longer provide such support.
<P>
The Chairman: Order. The hon. Lady is making an interesting speech, but she is straying wide of the amendment.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Keeble<?h -.001pt>:</B> I apologise, Mr. Butterfill, but I did not realise I was. It is wrong to view what happened to the further education sector as some great liberation.
<P>
The value of the provision and other proposals coming on line is that they will focus support where it is most needed. There is no reason why the state should subsidise people who have already had a good education--many of them at the state's expense--and who have transferable skills and do not need to retrain to find another job. Scaling down in that respect and providing not just individual learning but a university for industry will be important. It will be coming on stream soon and will ensure that people are placed in the right training.
<P>
Changes can been seen from the employers' side as well. For example, British Aerospace has an internal university and Barclays has a national training scheme with learning centres dotted around the country which, frankly, is on a par with many local authority training schemes. It is actually superb. That is much more realistic than vocational support through tax measures, which is now being phased out. People will also soon be able to get degrees on line from Oxford university. That will change the way in which many people view education. [Interruption.  Yes, Oxford is engaged in that.
<P>
I should like to provide some examples to show why the hon. Member for Guildford is wrong about training. Many people on high incomes and high tax bands had a university education. We all know that people with a university education end up earning more money. All the figures show that. Many of them also have transferable skills, which they can use when jobs change. That does not always hold for others.
<P>
I shall cite a concrete example and try not to test your patience, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
After leaving university, I worked in the printing industry. In those days, it was a heavy manual industry and still used hot metal. I was a journalist, but I was familiar with the stones that printers used. People suffered industrial injuries because of the weight of the stones and various accidents occurred because of the machines.
<P>
When I left that job about 10 years later, it was no longer a heavy manufacturing industry and the injuries that most of those people who previously dealt with heavy machinery sustained was repetitive strain injury from operating computers. Such methods completely transformed the industry; the heavy jobs had gone. The same applied in Birmingham, which is represented by my hon. Friend [Interruption.  I am sorry, my hon. Friend represents Coventry. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth). Welders and fitters became operators and used to complain that all the had to do was to push a button and watch the machines work. That showed how much their jobs had changed.
<P>
The only people who survived in the print industry, for example, were those who could upgrade their skills and change from handling heavy equipment and lifting stones to operating computers. Some could carry out such work anyway, but many needed training, and what the Government are doing is absolutely right. Jobs are changing and people who do not have transferable skills must learn new ones and change their jobs. I recognise that that was not a problem for the previous Government, because they invented incapacity benefit, so that people who could no longer work in traditional jobs because they hurt their backs, for example, could receive that benefit and that solved the problem.
<P>
This Government have a more constructive approach. It is about training people and making sure that, throughout their working lives, they have the skills that they need. The clause is the tip of an iceberg, but I absolutely support it. It is the right way to go and I hope that members of the Committee will support it.
<P>
Ms Hewitt: I congratulate my hon. Friend on her excellent speech. As she said, the purpose of clause 54 is to provide for vocational training relief to be phased out in two stages: first, <P>
by the removal of the higher rate of relief so that relief will be given at only the basic rate on repayments made on or after 6 April of this year. Secondly, vocational training relief will be withdrawn completely next year when the national framework for individual learning accounts is launched.
<P>
Although the drafting is a little obscure, I take it that the intention of amendments Nos. 166 and 167 is to retain higher rate tax relief, certainly for the current year and perhaps thereafter. The difficulty that arises, to which my hon. Friend cogently drew attention, is that in the past vocational training relief has subsidised rather expensive hobbies rather than, as was its intention, support vocational training and, thus, extend and build the skills of the work force.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford referred to what he apparently regarded as an unfair criticism of the subsidy that had been given through vocational training relief to activities such as flying and diving. However, the facts are revealing; indeed, they are quite shocking. More than a quarter of the &#163;36 million tax relief in 1997-98 went on supporting flying and diving. It is difficult to believe that the skills shortage in this country, or the productivity gap between ourselves and our most successful competitors, is so concentrated in those two spheres of activity that we suffer from such a shortage of qualified pilots and divers that more than a quarter of the tax relief given for vocational training has to be geared to them.
<P>
Mr. St. Aubyn: I am glad that we have established that that is what really exercises the Government. Why do not the Government simply exclude those activities, so that companies concentrate their minds on activities that are more appropriate?
<P>
Ms Hewitt: We shall undertake a more radical reform of the system than that, but I shall say more about it in a moment. 
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The conditions originally laid down for vocational training relief provided that trainees must not undertake the course wholly or mainly for recreational purposes, or as a leisure activity. It has proved difficult to ensure compliance with that condition, because the trainees self-certify that they qualify for relief. The Inland Revenue has come to the conclusion that there has been wide-scale abuse, as many people claim tax relief for courses that are claimed to be vocational but are mostly purely recreational. Flying and diving are indeed the two most prominent examples, but a surprising number of claims for relief are made in respect of payments for horse riding and cordon bleu cookery courses--again, examples of courses that can, on rare occasions, be vocational but which, in most cases, are not.
<P>
The Government's intention, by contrast, is straightforward. We will replace vocational training tax relief with individual learning accounts. That will ensure that support for training from public funds will be better targeted, with more help going to those with the greatest need to improve their basic skills and qualifications.
<P>
The real problem with the skills shortage is that a large proportion of the adult work force receive little or no training during their employment, and that many of them lack even basic literacy and numeracy skills or the basic general qualifications that would enable them to improve their productivity in their place of employment. The immediate removal of higher rate tax relief on vocational training starts the process of targeting public support on those who need it most, rather than giving more help to those who are already better placed to help themselves because they are higher rate taxpayers.
<P>
That policy seems to have been widely understood and warmly welcomed, at least outside the Opposition, as I understand that the Revenue has not received a single representation on the subject. I regret that, as with other amendments, the hon. Member for Guildford has sought to help the few and not the many, by seeking to retain a relief that is not justified in itself, and to retain it specifically for higher rate taxpayers. That is a double injustice.
<P>
I hope that, following my explanation, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. If not, I must ask my hon. Friends to reject it.
<P>
Mr. St. Aubyn: I hope that it will eventually sink in that by helping those who are highly skilled, one may also help those who work for them. Fewer people would be looking for new jobs if the people for whom they worked, and the managerial sector, had the training and expertise needed to guide their firms through the fast-changing world in which they live. I regret that the hon. Lady has not taken the chance to clarify the position of those who have come from a higher education environment, and what the impact on their learning accounts will be. That is another point that she might answer, either now or when we come to clause 55.
<P>
I should tell the hon. Member for Northampton, North that, on this wonderful evening, many contributions have been made from the Government Benches. Far be it from me to discourage them, but I am bound to say that, although the hon. Lady said that there was no proper funding framework for the further education sector, the Further Education Funding Council is a model of how to run such a regime. That is why Labour members of the Education Select Committee endorsed it in a cross-party report barely a year ago.
<P>
<B>Ms Dari Taylor </B>(Stockton, South): Will the hon. Gentleman explain why, if further education is so well funded, it is possible to fund only basic literacy and numeracy in Stockton and why in places such as my town of Thornaby the local authority has had to fund those courses? It is not well funded, as the hon. Gentleman should acknowledge.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> There has been a 30 per cent. increase in the number of people taking courses at further education colleges. That has been the big contribution in this decade to the learning age. As I said, we welcome the Government's efforts to build on that and the individual learning account has a role to play. The amendments would ensure that there was a more flexible regime whereby the system introduced in 1991 would continue alongside the individual learning account.
<P>
I regret the Economic Secretary's attitude but I have no desire to force the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Although the provision is not included in the Bill, will the Economic Secretary say why she decided that students who will now have to bear the much greater cost--and much higher share of the contributions towards their degree courses--will not enjoy a fair tax system if their employer, when they get a job after leaving university, wishes to help them discharge their student debt? Why will any payments that a company gives an employee--what might be called a golden hello--be taxed rather than allowed as a non-taxable item, or as a contribution to the individual learning account? If we are to regard the extra cost as a business expense of self development--where money is paid by someone's employer towards discharging the debt incurred in obtaining a degree--it seems unfair that adverse tax treatment should be applied? Would it not be fair that those payments to discharge the student debt be a non-taxable benefit to the new employee?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for not responding to his point about higher education courses and individual learning accounts during our previous debate.
<P>
Individual learning accounts are designed to help people already in work to undertake further education courses. They are not designed to assist with higher education, nor as a means by which those who have been in full-time higher education can repay their student loan. As for the general tax treatment of golden hellos and whether they are used to repay a student loan or for any other purpose, I do not think it would be right to have a different tax treatment for a payment that is made by an employer when a graduate joins a firm if the new recruit decides to use that lump sum to repay the student loan. We have put in place a much fairer system of funding for higher education with generous subsidies for the loans in question.
<P>
Clause 55 is a minor measure, but it ensures that if at the end of the student loan too much has been paid back by way of deductions from salary, a refund will be given, with interest, at RPI and the interest itself will be tax free so that the effective rate of interest matches the interest payable on the loan itself. This is simply a tidying measure in relation to student loans generally.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It seems incongruous that someone who on leaving school takes employment for a year or two, and in that time sets up an individual learning account and goes to a higher or further education college offering a higher diploma course will qualify for some form of tax deduction on contributions by an employer. However, if they choose to go direct from school to university, no tax breaks are available. There seems to be a bias against the more able members of society who have the most to contribute.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt<?h -.001pt>:</B> I think that I dealt with that point. I should also say that we are straying well beyond the scope of this and the previous clause. In other statutes, we are putting in place a much fairer system for the funding of higher education. Given the extent of taxpayer-funded subsidy of the beneficiaries of higher education, which has been such a notable feature of university funding in this country, the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that we are biasing the system against higher education is well wide of the mark. With regard to individual learning accounts and the withdrawal of vocational training tax relief, we are creating for further and vocational education a much fairer system that will run alongside the new system of financing for higher education.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Last year, when the then Paymaster General announced the proposals, Opposition members were all too pleased to discover that the Government were rightly paying attention to an industry that, at the time, was in some difficulty. The matter is one about which the former Paymaster General cared a great deal and I, for one, miss his contribution to the proceedings of this year's Finance Bill.
<P>
I welcome the Government's proposals to extend expenditure on film production and acquisition. As you probably know, Mr. Butterfill, it was the film policy review group that originally called for the current three-year period to be extended. Sadly, the Government have not adopted the group's proposal to write off tax on the first &#163;15 million spent on films with budgets of more than &#163;15 million. The group believes that that would make film production and distribution an attractive option for yet more new and significant potential investors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> In a moment. Did the Government consider extending tax relief to films that might cost &#163;15 million and more? Clearly, there are financing implications, but given that a large number of films arguably should not have received such money--I shall deal with that subject before I give way to the hon. Member for Wimbledon--it may have been possible to finance the provision within current revenue limits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman intervenes, I should say that we are straying somewhat wide of the clause, which simply extends the date. A further, detailed discussion of the relief is not appropriate.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way and to you, Mr. Butterfill, for your ruling. I assure you that my intervention will be focused on the clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney is making a habit this evening of, on the one hand, praising the Government for a measure with which he agrees and, on the other, blaming the Government for not going far enough. Clearly, it is matter of judgment as to where the relief is set. We believe that it should be for films costing up to &#163;15 million, but the hon. Gentleman thinks differently. Has he costed his proposal? The advantages must be weighed against the costs. We would all like to give even more support to the film industry--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is an extremely long intervention, which is also outside the scope of the clause. I hope that the hon. Member for Witney will not be tempted to lead the Committee any further into such discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I respect your advice, Mr. Butterfill, especially if the hon. Gentleman has a hearing impairment that has prevented him from understanding my explanation of how I would finance my proposal. I understand his excitement about taking part in what has otherwise been a debate of silence.
<P>
It is relevant to discuss the film policy review group, as it has also considered the efficacy of the scheme so far. That is especially germane to whether the scheme should be extended, which is the issue at the heart of the clause. Some interesting statistics exist in relation to that.
<P>
The principle of the scheme is good. Since 1998, more than 200 films have become involved in a scheme whereby tax relief will be reclaimed from the Inland Revenue. That is good news and a justification for the measure and its extension. It should be seen in the international context, as it is an international industry that we are trying to get back off the ground. I give full credit to the Government for implementing the scheme, which is causing concern in California, where the amount of tax relief on films is being changed partly because of the measure introduced in the previous Finance Bill.
<P>
We are grateful to the Government for introducing such a measure to help the film industry. It is also good for Britain and for Britain's finances. In Ireland, where the level of tax relief, at 80 per cent., is much higher than that proposed in the clause, it generated &#163;123 million. It is therefore not merely about giving away money. If the hon. Member for Wimbledon understands that sensible economics can create wealth, he might understand that it is not simply about handing out money but about understanding how wealth is created. He may wish to intervene, but the possible reasons for changing this clause are different from those for changing the earlier clause on charity taxation. While charities are not in the business of making money, many films can and do make money, and are good for the British economy.
<P>
There is a problem, which we have discussed before, in relation to whether to extend the current provision. Of 114 films that have been completed under British production limits since 1997, 60 per cent. have not yet been screened. It is all very well using taxpayer's money for tax relief, but if the films do not end up being screened, we must ask whether the scheme--apart from its valuable role in training people to make films--is as effective as it might be. That raises a crucial question that is relevant to the clause. Elsewhere, consideration has been given to the idea of a front-end tax relief for the film business, rather than for the film production itself.
<P>
In Canada, by extending the tax relief to include the film business, five independent distribution companies have been formed, each of which now has a capitalisation of &#163;100 million. That, in turn, has allowed films that were not distributed to be distributed. That is the crucial point.
<P>
It is right that the Government are extending the relief under the clause, that much has been done for the film industry in this country and that the Government should be rightly proud of the help that they have given it, but they should take a crucial next step. The Government should consider whether to extend the relief to the film business to allow independent distributors, like those in Canada, to form pools of people who could ensure that the 60 per cent. of the 114 or so films that the Government have allowed to be made in the past year that have not been screened will be screened. That would be a more imaginative use of the tax relief, which would fully endorse the reason why the Government have introduced it. However, the Government might want to go further and consider a more comprehensive tax incentive.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Casale:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows the reason why 60 per cent. of those 114 films have not been screened--some of them are not particularly good or have little potential for commercial success. Before he suggests putting large sums into film distribution companies, perhaps he should think twice about whether the problem is the lack of distribution or the lack of commercial merit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I will answer that point, because the answer is worth putting on record. Although some of those films are probably not very good, it would be foolish to suggest that all 60 per cent. of those 114films are not very good. If that were so, the Government scheme would be a waste of money, because more than half the films that have been financed through tax relief are not good enough to be shown. That is not my view, nor that of most of the film producers that I have worked with in the past few years. I declare an interest: I am also involved in the pre-production of a film. The hon. Gentleman is not right in what he says. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) should calm down. If he has a proper speech to make, I am sure that the Chairman will call him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Perhaps more importantly, I shall allow the hon. Gentleman to make a speech.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has shown great ingenuity in pleading his case for the film industry while attempting to remain in order. He has made his case very well, but further discussion on the principles of assistance cannot be in order. We must return to the principle of the clause--whether the relief should be extended. Therefore, I ask the hon. Gentleman to conclude his speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Butterfill, for your advice. I look forward to hearing the Economic Secretary's comments and those of any other hon. Member who wishes to play a constructive role in the debate.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I had not appreciated the extent of the hon. Gentleman's involvement in the film industry. I was aware, of course, that he was involved in producing a party political broadcast during his days at Conservative central office. I, too, have had such experience. Perhaps I can refer to my own minor role. I had the great pleasure of working with Hugh Hudson on a particularly famous party political broadcast during the 1987 election campaign. I think that I am right in saying that none of the party political broadcasts in which the hon. Gentleman was involved quite achieved the cinematic distinction of that wonderful broadcast.
<P>
The clause will extend the current tax relief for film expenditure by another two years, fulfilling the Paymaster General's commitment of March 1998,
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The holder of the office of Paymaster General has changed since then. Will the Minister confirm that the present Paymaster General sadly cannot be with us because she is involved in the debates of the tax harmonisation committee in Brussels? According to a reply that the Paymaster General gave my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton), the code of conduct working group on harmful tax competition, which she chairs, includes in its subjects for debate
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``special tax measures for the film industry.''--[Official Report, 28January 1999; Vol. 324, c. 469.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why are we discussing extending a benefit that the Paymaster General is negotiating away in Brussels?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong. The code of conduct group is examining a long list of tax measures. We have made it clear that we see no difficulties whatsoever with that relief in relation to the code of conduct working group. Indeed, as the hon. Gentleman said, the relief has successfully encouraged the British film industry.
<P>
On incentives for distribution, there is no proof that a tax incentive of the kind that the hon. Gentleman describes would work and we think that it would be premature to issue such a measure before the film finance forum reports.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The Minister says that there is no proof; it would be foolish to brush aside the proof from Canada, where five companies became independent distributors, using that front-end relief. Each capitalised more than &#163;100 million and has been extremely successful in distributing films that it previously could not, because of the virtual monopoly by two or three distributors.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Of course we shall look at that issue, after the film finance forum reports. However, there is no evidence that British films with popular appeal cannot go on general release; a recent report in Screen Finance stated that two-thirds of the films made by British producers between 1993-96 had been released by the end of 1998 and that over half of the low-budget films--the majority of those that are helped by the relief--will have theatrical distribution--
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> No, I have already given way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt<?h -.001pt>:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
I am trying to deal with that point; the hon. Gentleman has spoken at length. Over half the low-budget films will have theatrical distribution deals in place within two years of starting shooting and most of the rest will get video or television release. The figures prove that British films are seen and are a tribute to the energy and success of the industry. As the hon. Gentleman has said, the relief is a success and its introduction is a credit to the Government. The clause merely extends it for two years and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and aqreed to.
<P>
Clause 57 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 58</center></H4>
<H4><center>Income of unmarried child of settlor</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> We understand that tax loopholes must be closed and that there is a long history of anti-avoidance legislation in respect of parental settlements, where the Taxes Acts provide that income shall be deemed to be that of the settlor. The loophole was created for bare trusts when the rules were simplified in 1995. Will the Minister confirm that the clause is designed solely to include within section 660B(1) of the Taxes Act 1998 the income of a bare trust created by a parent for the benefit of a minor child, the latter being absolutely entitled to call for capital and income, although the capital is unlikely to be paid to the child in view of the trustees' responsibilities? Secondly, will she confirm that the clause is not applicable and that the income will not be deemed to be that of a settlor in the case of an absolute gift to the child by his or her parent?
<P>
The provision is retrospective in that it takes into account income of a minor of a settlor for the tax years 1995{**nrl**}96, 1996{**nrl**}97 and 1997{**nrl**}98 inclusive. Is that appropriate even if such income has not borne tax because it was covered by the child's personal allowance? If the legislation was to be effective during those years, the Revenue should stand the cost, even though the accumulated untaxed income will not be paid out until later.
<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Spend, spend, spend--the Liberal Democrats are reverting to type. The clause deals with a long-standing weakness in the legislation, which, as the hon. Gentleman recognises, allowed financial institutions and financial advisers to establish bare trusts and market them specifically as tax saving vehicles. That is unfair, and we are right to act.
<P>
The clause also deals with a loophole--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> We do not question whether the Economic Secretary is right to act.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked several questions that I am trying to answer. The first intention of the clause is to deal with a long-standing weakness that allowed tax avoidance. The second intention is to deal with a loophole that was inadvertently added when the legislation was simplified in 1995, which allowed income accumulated in the trust to be removed without triggering a tax charge. As a result, parents could set up artificial arrangements under which substantial funds were invested in one year, and withdrawn the following year, with significant tax savings. That loophole will be closed for payments made on or after Budget day.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that the provision is retrospective. It is not. Existing funds will not be affected if they are left to roll up until the child is 18 or marries. If parents choose to ignore the provision and withdraw funds, they will incur a tax charge, but that is their choice. Equally, if they add further funds or create new trusts, they do so in full knowledge of the tax consequences. I trust that that is clear, I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Economic Secretary answer my first question about whether the clause is designed solely to deal with a bare trust created by a parent for his or her infant child?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Yes.
<P>
Question put and aqreed to.
