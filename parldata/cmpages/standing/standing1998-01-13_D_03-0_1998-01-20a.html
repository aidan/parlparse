</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): I should like to return to the key issues behind the amendment--under-18-year-olds in training and low-skilled adults or those with obsolete skills.
<P>
There is a clear case for a training rate for under-18-year-olds. All 16 to 18-year-olds should, in any case, be in training as a matter of right. It is widely recognised internationally that a lower rate should apply for under-18s. The House of Commons Library has produced some interesting work on the issue, which shows that lower rates apply for under-18-year-olds in training in Belgium and France. The Scottish Low Pay Unit, too, believes that a percentage of the national minimum wage should be paid to workers under 18, provided that they are not simply used as an alternative form of cheap labour and that they undergo training. The greater Manchester Low Pay Unit says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is a case to be made for young people to be paid a proportion of the minimum wage if they are receiving training leading to a recognised qualification.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry agrees that there should be a lower rate for people in training. It notes that 48 per cent. of all 16 to 18-year-olds are paid less than &#163;3 an hour and that 60 per cent. are paid less than &#163;2.50 an hour. The impact of a national minimum wage on those young people in training would be quite dramatic. The key issue is that we must never forget that equal work should mean equal pay, regardless of age. I do not subscribe to the view that young adults should not be entitled to a national minimum wage purely because of their age.
<P>
The crux of the amendment and of the problem is low-skilled adults. How can we treat employees and employers fairly within the national minimum wage structure? How can we provide a mechanism to get the low skilled or those with obsolete skills, who are often the long-term unemployed, off benefits and into permanent work? How can we provide them with high-quality training to impart the skills that they need and which are essential if they are to become part of the permanent labour market? How do we enable employees to earn a living wage, free of the benefit trap and with an entitlement to a national minimum wage? At the same time--this is equally important--how do we protect employers from the unsustainable costs that they could incur while their employees are training and before their productivity increases to a level that provides added value to the national minimum wage and recovers the training costs that employers have supported?
<P>
It is as though we were trying to solve a complex algebraic equation without enough formulae to cover the many unknowns in it. It is, therefore, difficult to arrive at a solution. However, the CBI believes that new employees who receive training while they develop the skills necessary for their job will be less productive during training. That is fairly well understood, and it is recognised internationally in lower training rates.
<P>
	The problem that we face when trying to solve such a seemingly insoluble equation is how to match the unknowns. When we face such a problem, it is always best to return to first principles. In this case, the first principles are that employees should not continue to be paid poverty wages and be supported by in-work benefits that are paid for by the taxpayer. The national minimum wage should therefore apply to all adult employees.
<P>
The low skilled, who are often the long-term unemployed, must have access, as of right, to high-quality training to increase their productivity. At the same time, employers must be protected from unsustainable training costs while paying the national minimum wage. Training must therefore be supported by state finance. That could be achieved through the transfer of unemployment benefits into a training fund for high-quality, recognised vocational training while the employer pays the going rate for the job. That measure would represent a net saving to the state because new employees would invariably pay back money in their income tax contributions.
<P>
We should consider an example that has already been used in this debate to justify the amendment. The view has been expressed that if training rates paid to craft apprentices, compared with the wages paid to qualified craftsmen, were up-rated to the national minimum wage, that would upset employer's staff and other costs. That presupposes that a national minimum wage would be at least close to the hourly rate paid to qualified craftsmen, but I can find no example in industry of craftsmen being paid at a rate as low as even the most optimistic forecast for the national minimum wage.
<P>
At the heart of the amendment there is a need for the Low Pay Commission to look beyond the immediate impact of the national minimum wage, which will be to take workers out of poverty, at the complex interrelationship that exists between training provision and costs. It needs to consider what will be the impact of the national minimum wage on the welfare-to-work programme and the costs that will apply to responsible employers. I therefore urge the Government to consult the Low Pay Commission on those essential factors if we are to have a sensible national minimum wage that does not undermine training and provides the skills that the low skilled and the young need to get into profitable, productive employment.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> The debate has been reasonably short but it has raised issues of principle relating to training, its purpose and the role of the state, employers and employees, including potential employees. We are trying to achieve the right balance between the investment made by the employer, the state and individuals in their personal development through their working lives.
<P>
Much adult learning takes place in the workplace and the balance must be struck between the interests of the labour market, which is susceptible to change, and those of the work force, who must therefore be adaptable. People who leave school with few or no skills must be given the opportunity to gain skills so that they can have a relationship with an employer or a range of employers and sustain themselves in the labour market. However, employers must be able to invest in an employee and try to get a return on that investment, both in terms of the relationship with that employee and in terms of the enterprise's capacity to gain a competitive edge through the qualifications and adaptability of its employees.
<P>
In addition, the state, by co-operating with employers and employees, must be able to make investments to target and draw in those who are outside the labour market and those who need to return to the labour market. It must also be able to invest over a longer period in the basic adaptability of the work force in all sectors.
<P>
The Government have inherited a situation in which those factors have been out of kilter. There has been a huge escalation of the number of young people outside the labour market. They have difficulty getting in to it and, if they do so, quickly return to the benefits system. We must first get rid of that revolving-door syndrome where people go in and out of the labour market because of a lack of skills or lack of a proper relationship with an employer because the schemes that they have been on had no direct relevance to the labour market. The most important aspect of the new deal is the way in which the Government have built it up from its foundations. From the outset there has been a relationship between the employer and the potential trainee, which is crucial to the success of the programme.
<P>
Secondly, during the past few years there was little or no leadership from the previous Government on the issue of workplace training and investment in trainees. They focused their strategy almost entirely on what they perceived as a flexible labour market--undermining and undercutting, cutting out costs irrespective of what that would mean in the long term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> I have been trying not to interrupt the Minister, who is making interesting points, but does not he at least concede that the previous Government pioneered, introduced and brought about to a degree of success the modern apprenticeships scheme? That scheme includes a proper range of vocational qualifications which are designed to complement those available through the education system.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I was just coming to that point. I was making an historical analysis of the whole term of the previous Government. It is true that, eventually, the penny began to drop. They realised that there had to be a new relationship between the Government and industry, employees and potential employees.
<P>
The principle behind the modern apprenticeships scheme was right and it was supported by all sides. The problem was that instead of the scheme taking 40,000 people a year, it floundered at 4,000. The difference between the previous Government's scheme and our new deal is that, from the outset, we got employers involved and gave people a sense of ownership and a commitment to driving the programme forward with their day-to-day involvement in the development, management and outcomes.
<P>
The other difference is in the range of the quality options. Training must be of quality. Unfortunately for the United Kingdom, there is a residual view that training is not for us: somehow, it is not a proper option, but something short term and of poor quality that people must do if they are not in work and which will not lead to an employment opportunity. We must change that attitude. The Government are prepared to tackle that problem, which we must do if we want to get the balance right.
<P>
During the debate on the national minimum wage prior to the general election and the consultation with private sector industry and the public sector, we made it clear in our pledges to business that as part of the development of the strategy and structure for the introduction of the minimum wage, the Low Pay Commission would be given the clear obligation to consider the impact of the minimum wage on the labour market in relation to training and young people. We have fulfilled that commitment and have given the Low Pay Commission the widest possible brief to make recommendations to the Government. Indeed, we have been criticised on occasion for giving it too wide a brief, but we thought it necessary.
<P>
We came to the right decision intellectually following the consultations. Therefore, we were more than happy to contest the general election on our pledge to business that the Low Pay Commission would, as a core activity, make recommendations on the minimum wage as it related to young people in particular and to training in general. We have carried out that commitment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) rightly identified the importance of quality training and of investing in individuals so that people feel committed, have a choice about their training, feel a sense of ownership and think that the investment by themselves, the employer and the state will have a beneficial outcome. That is critical in relation to my previous comments, and it is why the Government moved quickly, not only by setting up the new deal, but by announcing employment zones in December. The zones seek to pilot ways and means throughout Britain of ensuring that training is not only of good quality, but that it relates to the needs of individuals and to their local labour market. Employment zones are important in relation to the hon. Gentleman's comments about ensuring a relationship between the provision of training and trainees' ownership, and ensuring a good-quality, non-exploitative training scheme. I accept that that is necessary.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment has a number of difficulties. It pre-empts the question of whether there should be a different rate for trainees. Some people argue for a different rate for trainees of any age. The Low Pay Commission has been asked to examine that question, and the Bill allows the Government to take into account its recommendations, and for the matter to be dealt with in that way.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It would help the Committee and me if the hon. Gentleman clarified whether under the Bill, and especially under clauses 3 and 4, it would be possible to extend a training rate to adult trainees over the age of 26, on the Low Pay Commission's recommendation. It is not clear whether that is possible without radical amendment of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It is not necessary to radically amend the Bill. The purpose of clauses 3 and 4 is to give the Government maximum possible capacity to take into account the Low Pay Commission's recommendations.
<P>
As I have to keep saying, the Low Pay Commission is independent, and it is seeking to ensure the widest possible consultation and agreement about a range of issues, including training in the workplace. Clauses 3 and 4 were drafted to enable the Government to take fully into account recommendations that may come from the Low Pay Commission--I do wish to speculate on those recommendations.
<P>
I know from evidence sent to me and to hon. Members of all parties that views have been expressed across the board about training, whether from employers' organisations, or from trade unions that represent employees. I am certain that those views will be taken seriously when the Low Pay Commission makes recommendations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green (Ashford):</B> I am genuinely confused by what the Minister said. He seemed to suggest that the Low Pay Commission could recommend more variation than the Bill currently allows. Surely, the point of parts of clauses 3 and 4 is specifically to take away the Minister's power to implement such recommendations, even if the Low Pay Commission recommends that he does so. Is that not the point at issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No, the Bill does not permit the Secretary of State to set regional sectorial rates, or to remove certain classes of business, and so on. The clauses are quite clear. The remit has been given to the Low Pay Commission to consider training, young people and other issues put before it, either by the Government or by people who wish to submit evidence. The Low Pay Commission's recommendations should be awaited. In the context of the Bill, my job is to ensure that the Government have the capacity to take into account recommendations that the Low Pay Commission may give on the issues under discussion or other issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> The Minister is being kind by giving way, but I remain confused. I have looked in the Bill for the point at which Ministers can use recommendations from the Low Pay Commission to exclude trainees from the provisions of the national minimum wage or from the varied rate. I can find reference to that only in clause 5(2)(e), which relates only to adding descriptions of persons to those in clause 3.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have tried not to interrupt hon. Members. The matters being debated are complex, and it is very difficult for hon. Members to stay in order. However, if hon. Members can control themselves and discuss the amendment that is before the Committee, we can then move on to the next set of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Clause 3 clearly gives the Government the widest possible remit in terms of Low Pay Commission recommendations on training. That is the position, and the hon. Member for Daventry may or may not wish to accept it. That is why the clause has been drafted in this way. No doubt when we come to debate clause 3, Opposition Members will have points to make. However, we must ensure that any amendment that comes before us, like this one, does not undermine the Government's capacity to take into account recommendations that may come from the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Clause 1(2)(c) specifically states that a person qualifies for the national minimum wage if he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``has ceased to be of compulsory school age.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To me, that is absolutely categoric--once people are over the school age, they are entitled to the national minimum wage. It seems to contradict following clauses which put a cart and horse through that provision. Perhaps this harmless amendment is a way of tying those two issues together.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No. The purpose of the clause is to provide that people over the school leaving age will be entitled to the national minimum wage. That must be right--it is the whole concept and principle of clause 1. However, Opposition Members are using the amendment to get to other clauses further on in the Bill which relate to the capacity of the Low Pay Commission to place recommendations before the Government. This is an enabling piece of legislation, which set out the context of those who will be entitled to the minimum wage and the Government's capacity to take account of recommendations on this or any other matter from the Low Pay Commission when it comes to secondary legislation.
<P>
Clauses 3 and 4 have been drafted in a way that will allow the Government to take into account as fully as possible recommendations on this matter which may come from the Low Pay Commission. The Government have always wanted to proceed in this way. There is no point in setting up a commission with the widest remit and not ensuring in the context of the legislation the capacity to take its recommendations into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham):</B> Will the Minister confirm, despite what he has just said, that even if the Low Pay Commission were to recommend that some people well over the age of 26 and possibly even as old as 65 are full-time trainees, he will nevertheless not have the power to exclude them from the provisions of the national minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman should on occasion do some homework before he blusters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It was not a bluster. It was a serious question to which I want an answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes little blusters and big blusters, depending on tactics. That was definitely a bluster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Try to answer the question.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that members of the Committee will find it difficult to catch my eye if they wish to make a speech. That does, however, preclude a constant running undercurrent of sedentary interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to be the same height as me, so that when I speak, he sits.
<P>
I hope that my next comment is in order--I notice that your eyebrows are already raised, Mrs. Dunwoody. I wish to ensure that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are clear on this point and are not simply using it to prolong the debate unnecessarily. Paragraph 1 of the notes on clause 3 entitled ``Purpose and Background'' says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This clause provides a full and discretionary power which may be used in the light of the report of the Low Pay Commission.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 1 of the notes on clause 4 entitled ``Purpose and Background'' says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The most likely possible use of the regulation-making powers in clause 4 is to provide different treatment for trainees.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are being quite clear about this. That is why I think that Opposition Members' fears are unnecessary, and why we will oppose the amendment.
<P>
It is important that we await the Low Pay Commission's recommendations. We must do nothing during the Bill's passage that will undermine the Government's capacity to look at the commission's recommendations. The amendment would remove the Low Pay Commission's opportunity to contribute to debate on trainees in general, including the limited range of trainees covered by the amendment.
<P>
The amendment would also go too far as it would take the trainees covered outside the entitlement to a national minimum wage altogether. That sends the wrong message to employers and workers. Trainees are a valuable part of the work force and training makes them more valuable to the company.
<P>
I have a specific example in mind when I say that. Bass, a major, blue chip company, wrote to hon. Members before Second Reading. The company has more than 67,000 employees across the United Kingdom. Its various subsidiaries include high street outlets and large providers of goods and services, and they require a wide skills-mix to meet the demands of different sectors of the economy.
<P>
The letter from the company made interesting points about training. Bass said it supported the principle of the Bill, althought it also took the legitimate opportunity to describe how it would prefer a minimum wage to be introduced. Some of its comments about what it wanted out of the Low Pay Commission were sharp, and I cannot evade that. However, the letter stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``By way of illustration, the main Bass employer in the UK is Bass Taverns, with over 46,500 hourly paid employees. The leisure sector traditionally has a high staff turnover, and in Bass Taverns this can be up to 100 per cent. per year.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So even a company regarded as blue chip in the United Kingdom has to face the total loss of its work force every year.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Taking into account both growth and turnover, Bass Taverns annually recruit over 50,000 people a year.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not mean to criticise the company, which has been very honest in expressing its views about the Low Pay Commission and its recommendations about training. The letter notes that new staff spend some 70 hours on training during the first 13 weeks of employment. The high level of resource involved is reflected in the low rates of pay, which range from &#163;3.10 to &#163;3.40 an hour.
<P>
The letter then considers the types of skill and the length of service that people who are retained need if they are to achieve national vocational qualification level 2. To get people to stay on, the company provides other incentives such as employment benefits, pensions and share and local incentive schemes, but it still faces staff turnover of 100 per cent. in a year.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) made an interesting contribution when he said that a national minimum wage could increase labour costs and therefore deter employers from taking on trainees. An article in Sunday's edition of The Observer is relevant here. I did not agree with everything that it said but it offered an interesting analysis of the on-cost to employers facing huge staff turnover.
<P>
The article contended that that problem prevents companies from maintaining good management practice. They cannot set a benchmark for the quality of goods and services that they offer, they cannot get their ethos across to customers, nor can they provide consistent delivery of goods and services.
<P>
I shall give only the bottom decile of the cost to such companies, as I do not suggest that all the employees of companies such as Bass are managers. When an employer recruits and trains people at the bottom echelon of a company, the total cost is &#163;1,746. That is the cost incurred every time an employee leaves a company.
<P>
In a company the size of Bass--and I do not relate the figures to make a point about that company--the failure to retain staff because of poor working conditions and low pay represents a cost of between &#163;85 million and &#163;100 million a year. Conservative Members never take account of that huge on-cost. A national minimum wage will establish stability of employment and a good relationship between employees and employers, who will then be able to get back what they have invested in employee training.
<P>
That is why it is important to get the balance right. Employers should invest in training and employees should offer loyalty and commitment to the company, but employees should see the benefit of training and receive a financial return for their loyalty and commitment. The minimum wage will be important in achieving that balance.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Philip Hammond (Runnymede and Weybridge):</B> When the Minister began to develop his argument, I thought that he was going to say that Bass was seeking the minimum wage to ensure that other, smaller employers in similar sectors would not undercut it if it decided to increase wages in an attempt to address the problem of staff turnover. He went on to tell us, however, that Bass incurs a huge cost--&#163;1,000-plus per employee--in recruiting and training. Would not it make perfect sense for Bass itself to raise hourly rates if it felt that that was how to lower staff turnover? Surely it does not need a national minimum wage to achieve the obvious solution to the problem that it has identified.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The reason why Bass is committed to the principle of the national minimum wage is that like most good employers, whether of large, medium or small firms, it recognises that there is a need for a basic floor in the labour market which poor employers cannot undercut by a lack of investment in labour costs or training.
<P>
The debate has moved on--only Conservative Members remain static. The economic and business case for the minimum wage has move light years on. There was a time when Conservative Members could expect to win support for their position, but the changing nature of the labour market and the way in which companies trade in goods and services means that they want certainty in the system. They have invested in their work force, whether through labour costs or training and development costs, and they want to know that when they compete for goods and services, they will not be undercut by poor employers. The argument has moved on from where Conservative Members are. That is why firms such as Bass want to see, as part of a package of measures, the introduction of a sensibly set national minimum wage.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 is unnecessary. Clause 4 already allows for the possibility of excluding trainees from entitlement to the national minimum wage, but we want to reserve the option to use clause 4 until we receive the views of the Low Pay Commission. I therefore ask hon. Members to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been an illuminating and generally good-natured and constructive debate. I want to thank the Minister for supplying his Department's note on remuneration, which will be helpful to us. I remind him, however, that as of this morning, his Department has still not provided us with its evidence to the Low Pay Commission. I hope that that will be available shortly, because it would help clear up some of the Opposition's misconceptions or preconceptions. It is very important that the Committee has that evidence when it considers clauses 2, 3 and 4.
<P>
The amendment raises two issues. The first concerns what might be termed the Bill's architecture, a subject that lay behind my and my hon. Friends' interventions. I had intended to ask some questions about it when we reached the clause stand part debate, but you have been kind enough to let this debate range widely, Mrs. Dunwoody. I promise that I shall not repeat these questions later--indeed, I hope that I shall not need to.
<P>
As I understand the Bill, clause 1 provides for a national minimum wage, while clause 2 provides the means for the calculation of what that wage should be and prescribes that it should not be discriminatory. We shall debate those points later. Clause 3 is specifically keyed to young persons under the age of 26 and in effect enables the Low Pay Commission to come to see conclusions about training rates for young persons and others.
<P>
However, clause 4 as drafted--their lordships may get very excited about King Henry VIII clauses, but I may be wrong about it--says that the Government may set further regulations to widen the definitions in clause 3. That does not seem, without destroying the whole import of clause 3, to enable them to remove the requirement that it applies to persons of 26 and under. As I read the Bill--though I am no lawyer--it would therefore be impossible to extend clause 4 to include adult trainees, even if the Low Pay Commission was so to recommend, without amending clause 3 to remove the 26-year test. I do not want to go on about that, but there is a clear difference of view about what is permissible. It would be helpful if the Minister, in the spirit of his earlier actions on remuneration, gave an assurance now or tabled a note for the Committee to consider at greater leisure on exactly how the Bill's architecture will meet an objective that he says he wants the Low Pay Commission to consider. I will give way to the Minister, but I will understand if he wants to deal with the matter by correspondence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> There is no need to deal with it by correspondence. Correspondence has already taken place in respect of the detailed notes on clauses. As the hon. Member for Daventry said at the outset, they are the most detailed notes on clauses that he has ever seen. Their purpose is to make sure that members of the Committee clearly understand the whole structure of the Bill.
<P>
I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to paragraph 3 of the notes on clause 4(2). I will not read it out; I just note it to save hon. Members having to listen to me go on about it and to save myself having to write the hon. Gentleman a letter. That paragraph clearly and specifically sets out the purpose of and background to the provisions that the hon. Gentleman was discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I appreciate that we shall return to the matter, but I am still not absolutely clear about it. I am not trying to make a political point or a clever point to upset the Minister. The notes on clauses may be very good, but they are not definitive and from my reading of them, it seems to me--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying hard not to restrict legitimate discussion, but we shall be coming to a discussion on clause 4 and to a group of amendments that will draw this fine line. I hope that hon. Members will not stray too far from the clauses under discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall rest on the point that the notes on clauses seem to preclude any amendment to the regulations which refer to age. It would, therefore, be difficult to change 26 to another age. I ask the Minister, in all humility, to reflect on that.
<P>
Although it is right that we should have such legalistic cut and thrust on the way in which the Bill is structured, it is more important to come back to the substance of the amendment and what is intended by it. We can take some comfort from the Minister's tone generally--it is not always so conciliatory--and from contributions by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. We can pick out elements of consensus. The first such element is that training is important. The second is that it is at least worth considering whether there should be a separate rate for trainees--regardless of whether they are young persons or adults who are subject to certain restrictions. Parallel to the consideration of whether there should be a lower rate is the question of whether that rate should reflect the particular status, respectability or worthwhileness of training. We should also bear that in mind.
<P>
Those are a perfectly fair general considerations, which Conservative Members share. However, we probably differ from the Minister and some of his hon. Friends on several points about which we are concerned. First, I need to remind the Committee that no employer needs to employ anybody. If an employee's circumstances and the value added by him--whether he is a trainee or otherwise--are not commensurate with a national minimum wage at the standard or the trainee rate, an employer will not employ him. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, no employer needs to train anybody. There has been a long discussion about that subject, which has a long history. The Labour party was in favour of a training levy in opposition and, in effect, of moving back to the old concept of industrial training boards. It has dropped that idea in government. Clearly, the right structure must be in place if we are to encourage the employer to employ and train people. Conservative Members believe--our debates have reinforced this belief--that we shall certainly not achieve that through a standard rate across the whole adult work force, whether we are talking about trainees or not.
<P>
The amendment would, as the Minister said, exclude trainees from the national minimum wage. It is worth spending a moment considering status, although I shall in a moment press the amendment to a Division. Clearly we have regard to the position of trainees and we want them to be treated properly, but that need not be done through the national minimum wage. For the reasons that have been amply debated, it is perfectly possible for a good employer--it also makes good sense--to provide a proper training rate without being told by the Government that they must pay a national minimum wage. It is for those reasons and because of the difficulties and doubts concerning the age qualification, which were referred to earlier, that I should like to press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3) No amendment shall be made under subsection (1) above which treats persons who have not attained the age of 65 differently in relation to different ages.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that hon. Members will remember that this is a delicate line and I do not want to keep interrupting because it does not help, so they should not stray too far in discussing other aspects of the Committee's work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to provide, one way or another, for the exclusion of those of pensionable age from the effects of the national minimum wage. Our position on Second Reading was based on our fear of the effects that the Bill might have, particularly on the most vulnerable groups of workers and the most vulnerable sections of industry. We accept that the promoters of the Bill are well intentioned, but the economics do not add up and the Bill may damage those that it is intended to help most. We shall seek to mitigate what we consider the potential harmful effects on particularly vulnerable groups and sections of industry. I submit that pensioners are one such vulnerable group.
<P>
The Government have already accepted the principle that special cases may apply, based on the degree of vulnerability of a whole class of workers, and that there is a need for special treatment in those cases. That is explicit in clause 3, which provides for the possibility of special provision for workers under the age of 26. It is implicit in clause 4, as the Minister implied in the debate on the previous amendment, that other groups may need to be excluded from the provisions of the national minimum wage or require special treatment. There has already been speculation in Committee and elsewhere that the powers in clause 4 could be used to deal with training and, possibly, the disabled. However, clause 4 does not provide for the exclusion or special treatment of pensioners as a group because of the restrictions on reference to a group in terms of age. I submit that that is wrong.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 25 would exclude pensioners from the minimum wage. There is an argument for that approach. The alternative approach in amendments Nos. 29 and 31 would give powers to the Secretary of State under clause 4 mirroring those in clause 3 to make special provision for people aged under 26. Neither amendment would force pensioners to work for low wages. The great majority of them do not work, but those amendments recognise that they are a marginal group, like young workers aged under 26, who may have low productivity which is specifically related to their age. They would be allowed to price themselves into work to overcome that difficulty.
<P>
When recommending groups that the Secretary of State may want to exclude or treat specially under the provision of clause 4, the Low Pay Commission would know that the Secretary of State would not have the power to identify pensioners as such a group because of the requirement of age blindness, which is provided by clause 4(2)(d). Amendments Nos. 29 and 31 would at least give the Secretary of State the power to listen to what the Low Pay Commission might recommend.
<P>
The Minister made the point quite powerfully in a previous debate that clause 4 provided the power for the Secretary of State to consider submissions from the Low Pay Commission with regard to trainees. I am seeking the power for her to consider such recommendations should the commission, in its wisdom and after proper deliberation, decide that pensioners should be excluded or dealt with differently, perhaps by a lower rate.
<P>
Even if the Secretary of State did not want to use such powers, they would remain in statute. If it became apparent that the Bill was destroying jobs among that group, she could correct that relatively simply through secondary legislation. As drafted, the Bill requires further primary legislation to deal with such a situation.
<P>
Members of the Committee will be aware that pensioners are a large and growing proportion of the population. Of 10 million pensioners in this country, 800,000 are economically active and approximately 600,000 of those are employees. Interestingly, there was a dip in the percentage of pensioners employed during the economic downturn of the early 1990s. That neatly emphasises the marginality of that group of people, whose employability and economic effectiveness as employees remain vulnerable.
<P>
Many pensioners in work have part-time jobs, and more than half of all pensioners in work earn less than &#163;4.61--the benchmark of half male median earnings sought by many trade unions as the level for the minimum wage. We do not know whether the minimum wage will be set at such a generous level, but about 29 per cent. of pensioners in employment earn less than &#163;3.50 an hour.
<P>
The Bill is intended to try to force up low wages. I do not agree with that intention, but I accept it. The Minister has offered the novel economic theory that higher wages will create jobs, but there can be no doubt that some jobs will be lost if wages are forced up. Without special protection measures, those job losses will fall most heavily on the most marginal groups of employees with the lowest productivity.
<P>
The present free labour market makes it possible for employees suffering from low productivity to price themselves into work. They can adjust for their low productivity by adjusting the price that they charge for their labour. It seems self-evident that if no adjustment for productivity is allowed--which would be the effect of the national minimum wage--those workers with the lowest productivity are most likely to lose their jobs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give the Committee an example of what he means? How can a security guard working between 85 and 100 hours a week at &#163;1.80 an hour for a bring-your-own-dog-and-van firm improve his or her productivity? How can such low wages be excused?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My specific point is about pensioners, and I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I explain how the productivity of pensioners reasonably can be expected to be lower as a result of their age. The Government have recognised that that is true of people under 26.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does not my hon. Friend agree that it is unfortunate that the Minister did not note that he is referring not least to pensioners who work part time? To refer to people busily engaged in 80 to 100 hours of work a week was not appropriate in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend, and shall give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To prevent misinterpretation of his remarks, it must be recalled that my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge acknowledged that it would be reasonable to expect pensioners to show lower productivity in certain circumstances. However, for the sake of completeness, does not he agree that there will be plenty of instances in which pensioners work at least as well--or even better--than younger people?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry is absolutely right. The experience that someone over pensionable age can bring to a situation outweighs any disadvantage that comes with advancing years. However, in the context of minimum wage legislation, we are almost certainly talking about people engaged in unskilled work. I should like to press on and then return to this point to deal with the Minister's question about what I mean by low productivity and how workers may make adjustments in their own rates to compensate for productivity.
<P>
The arguments advanced for special treatment for the young, which the Government have put clearly, are that they may offer lower productivity specifically because of their age. With young people, that will be because of inexperience. With pensioners, I suggest that the argument is equally applicable, although it relates not to lack of experience but to the inevitable consequences of the aging process. We tend to slow down as we get older.
<P>
I would like the Committee to consider at least providing the Secretary of State with the power to deal with pensioners as a special group. There are a number of specific reasons for that. The first and most obvious is that all pensioners are, by definition, already in receipt of another source of income in addition to and, in most cases, more significant than, any earnings that they will gain from employment, particularly part-time employment.
<P>
Secondly, pensioners do not pay employees' national insurance contributions. This may seem like a minor and technical point, but in effect it means that within the national insurance wage band, a pensioner in work will be 8 or 9 per cent. better off than a person below pensionable age doing the same work for the same wage. It seems odd to suggest that a pensioner must have a higher take-home wage than someone below pensionable age who does a similar job.
<P>
Thirdly, it is an unavoidable fact--and one which some members of the Committee may have already noticed--that as one gets older, one's productivity decreases. One may become a little slower; one may have a little less stamina. That seems to be economic speak for a statement of the blindingly obvious. In many areas of work, that may not be a relevant factor, but in some areas it will be. Let me give an example to illustrate the point.
<P>
We do not yet know precisely how the Government propose to deal with piece workers, but let us assume that they are to be treated like all others, and their hourly rate is to be assessed. It is perfectly plausible that a pensioner who has time on his hands may take on a job. To avoid any suggestion of an improper employer, let us say that he delivers electoral registration forms for his local authority. He takes the job, knowing that the rate for the job has been set on the basis of the speed of work--the rate at which a young, fit person can whip round the front doors delivering such forms. Is it not perfectly legitimate for a pensioner to say to himself, ``I would like to go at a slightly more leisurely pace. I accept that the rate has been set on the basis of someone younger and fitter than me, but I am willing to invest a little more time to go slightly more slowly to earn the same money.''? His hourly rate will be lower, but that is a legitimate exercise for a pensioner to go through in assessing the desirability of such work.
<P>
Many pensioners--my own father is one--do a part-time job, not primarily because they want or need the money but because they want to keep themselves active and to keep some structure and discipline in their lives. That is a laudable objective and we should seek to avoid anything that would make it more difficult for pensioners to keep themselves active in that way. They do not necessarily want to operate under the kind of pressures that competing with younger workers might involve, but by including them within the scope of the minimum wage, we are necessarily asking them to compete with workers who are perhaps younger and fitter. Can it be morally right that a pensioner is precluded from saying to an employer, ``Yes, I can do that job--it may take me a little longer than someone younger, but that is my problem, not yours.''? The Bill would mean that an employee's productivity would become the employer's problem but, he or she would not be allowed by law to address that concern by adjusting the wage rate to compensate. The rational employer will therefore inevitably tend to employ those with higher levels of productivity rather than those with lower levels.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The problem of competition with younger people will become even more acute if, as we suppose, younger people are given special treatment under the powers to be vested in the Secretary of State under clause 3. Unless there is a mirror provision to give special treatment to those of pensionable age, we will not merely be asking older people to compete with younger and perhaps fitter and faster people, but to compete with people who have all those advantages and are allowed by law to charge a lower rate for their labour. In extreme cases, we may find pensioners required to compete for part-time jobs or Saturday jobs with schoolchildren, who are excluded altogether from the scope of the Bill.
<P>
All I want is even-handed treatment across the age spectrum for age-related reduced productivity. I applaud the Government's recognition of the phenomenon of age-related reduced productivity in relation to young people--clause 3 shows that they want to avoid any detrimental effect to that group as a result of the imposition of the national minimum wage. I urge the Committee to accept the logic of that position and to consider its extension to pensioners.
<P>
I hope that the Government will consider accepting at least the permissive version of the amendment to allow the Secretary of State to bring pensioners into the special categories, which he would have the power to do under clause 4 were it not for the age restriction in clause 3. I hope that the Minister will see that the amendments are not an attack on any central principle, but an attempt to draw an obvious analogy between people who suffer from a ``disability of youth'' and those who suffer from a parallel ``disability of age''.
<P>
There are two alternative routes. I might instinctively prefer the more prescriptive route of amendment No. 25, but I fully accept that amendments Nos. 29 and 31 would sit more comfortably with the overall architecture--to use the term of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry--of the Bill. I hope that the Minister will regard this as a constructive proposal for improving the Bill, which is in no sense intended to strike at the Bill's central purpose.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): Unlike some members of the Committee, this is the first time that I have tried to capture your attention, Mrs. Dunwoody, in order to speak. Thank you for calling me.
<P>
I have been entranced as I have listened to some of the flights of economic theory that we have heard from Conservative Members in the past few days. I am sure that you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and other hon. Members have been too. They have attempted over the two and a half sittings that we have had so far to refine the Bill out of existence. They have attempted to exclude this group and that group, including trainees and under-17s, from the provisions of a national minimum wage. They have even tried to argue away the notion of the employer himself or herself, and have suggested that that concept should not be considered to exist any longer. Many of the flights of economic theory that have been heard were based on stereotypes, perhaps none of which is worse than the stereotype that the Committee heard about this morning when the amendment was being moved--that of the pensioner suffering from low productivity.
<P>
Another view of the pensioner exists, and unless the Committee pays it some attention and rejects the amendment, hon. Members will severely undervalue the contribution that many older people can make to economic life. For instance, an Institute of Personnel Management report of 1993 was critical of the way in which many companies then pursued what the report called
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``agressive deselection of the over-50s. During the process, organisations may lose some of their best and most experienced people, with a consequent loss of continuity and experiential learning. Increasing economic inactivity among those displaced, especially those early retired, has a profound knock-on effect on the national economy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Committee agree to the Opposition amendments, it would add to that process of devaluing people over 65--the people specified in the amendment--and their skills and experience in relation to the economic life of Britain.
<P>
Interestingly, at about the same time as the publication of the Institute of Personnel Management report, some companies were beginning to see the value of employing older people. I shall highlight one of those companies--B and Q. I am not paid a retainer by the company, and I have no connection with it; nor am I a great do-it-yourself expert, as my wife will testify. I was interested in the company's policy of encouraging older people to apply for jobs. Its personnel department told me this morning that the policy was suggested to the company in the late 1980s by a civil servant, serving under a Conservative Government. The company decided to experiment with one of its stores, by employing only older people approaching retirement age. It found, as the university of Warwick found on its behalf in 1991 from research on that store, that it scored highly in comparison with other stores, not only in terms of profits but in terms of its low rate of staff turnover. The Committee heard from the Minister this morning about what a huge burden on many companies increased turnover can be, and about its huge expense.
<P>
The company also found low rates of absenteeism among older employees. That encouraged it to spread the policy across all of its stores throughout Britain. The personnel department spoke about the older employees' positive attitudes and the life skills and customer skills that they bring to their work. It also mentioned the basic do-it-yourself knowledge that often enables older employees to help customers more than young members of staff can.
<P>
I asked whether the only people who gave such benefits were the 50 to 65s. I was told that they were not. My attention was drawn to a gentleman working in B and Q's Swindon store at the age of 84, and to the dozen or so people in their seventies working happily in the stores throughout the country--the personnel department thought that there may be more, and said that there were at least two or three others in their eighties who were contributing well and playing their part in the success of the stores.
<P>
That is just one company, as the Minister suggested, whose attitude to employment has moved light years ahead of that of Conservative Members. By excluding the over-65s, or the 84-year-old in the Swindon store and his fellow employees, a negative message would be sent from the House of Commons about what we thought of the skills that the older members of the community could contribute in their everyday working lives. It is especially appropriate to send a positive message as age discrimination week, of which all hon. Members will be aware, takes place at the beginning of February. At the end of that week, the House will consider a private Member's Bill dealing with age discrimination in job advertisements. I am sure that hon. Members on both side of the House will support it.
<P>
What worries me about the amendments, particularly amendment No. 25, is not only the discrimination against older people, but the way in which they were spoken to. It sent a negative message about the House's view of the contribution that over-65s can make to their own communities and to the economic life of the country. People in that age group do not need the protection that Conservative Members so kindly offer. They are able to argue their case if they think that--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> No, the hon. Gentleman can made his point in his own contribution.
<P>
The over-65s are capable of deciding how and at what rate they might want to contribute to the economic life of the community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I have already said that I do not intend to make another contribution on the clause, so Conservative Members can make their points in their own speeches.
<P>
The Committee should reject the amendment. It would give another weapon to those unscrupulous employers who Conservative Members were only too keen to tell us about last week. They assured us that such people would find every way possible to subvert and circumnavigate national minimum wage legislation. Such unscrupulous employers need only read the Committee proceedings to build up a strong armoury of weapons to do that. It would be wrong to build yet another weapon into the Bill, particularly as it would be aimed at people who, as we have heard from Conservative Members, are so vulnerable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper) has misunderstood the intention of the amendment. It is not intended to diminish the contribution that older employees can make to employers. I am well aware of that contribution because I am fortunate enough to have in my constituency--I know that it is not true for every hon. Member--an unemployment rate so low that many categories of employment are sustained by older workers. The hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion referred to the retail sector. In my area the retail sector would find it difficult to maintain its level of service to customers without the contribution of older employees, some of whom are above pensionable age.
<P>
The amendment has a different purpose. It is apparent from earlier discussions that the Government have given themselves an enabling Bill and specifically set about the process of disabling, here and there, its ability to reflect labour market conditions and needs by making variations in the coverage of the national minimum wage.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) ably set out the respective arguments for amendments Nos. 25, 29 and 31. It seems perverse for the Government not to accept such amendments--if that will indeed be the Minister's reaction to the debate--because they would give them the opportunity to pay attention to the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission. Much of the evidence to the commission might have a bearing on these issues.
<P>
My hon. Friend went through the arguments in favour of the amendment in considerable detail. I will add only a few points. It is necessary when one is considering legislation to think not only of the present circumstances as we perceive them, but of those that may apply in the future. This is not a party political point: I hope that the Government will be successful and that there will be a continuation of the present trend in the reduction of unemployment, which has been sustained over the past five years. Under those circumstances, there will be areas of the country where it will be necessary to being into employment more people who are currently unemployed or on the margins of employment. That process will only be helped by the amendment.
<P>
At the same time, however, there may be significant regional variation. In some places there will be no difficulty about employees above pensionable age securing employment, should they wish to do so, at the national minimum wage. In other places it may be difficult to achieve that. In the absence of such possibilities in those labour markets, employers will not necessarily be able to obtain the work force that they require. If we are to give employers continued labour market flexibility notwithstanding a national miniumum wage, which I understand to be the Government's intention, we should support the amendment.
<P>
That begs the question why Ministers are restricting labour market flexibility through the national minimum wage. Their answer, which is not the view of Conservative Members, is that they are doing so to set a floor for low wages to eliminate poverty pay. It does not follow that the inability of an employee who is in receipt of a pension to obtain the national minimum wage rate signifies poverty. It simply signifies a willingness to accept work at the wage that the employer is willing to offer.
<P>
Ministers say that the national minium wage means that poor employees will not be subsidised by the taxpayer through systems such as family credit. Again, the argument for employees of pensionable age receiving the national minimum wage falls away because, by definition, they are not employees for whom the Government or taxpayers pay any form of subsidy.
<P>
Should we accept the amendment when to do so might give employees above pensionable age a relative advantage in the labour market over those below pensionable age? I suspect that that will not be the case if we implement the present provisions. Most employers will continue to look to meet their employment requirements according to workers' productivity and characteristics. Our debate has illustrated some of those factors. It is unlikely that employers will take on workers above pensionable age at lower rates simply because they are granted the discretion to do so by virtue of a variation in the Bill.
<P>
Let me refer to one or two other circumstances. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred to national insurance. As he said, his was not simply a technical point but an important one. Because people above pensionable age do not pay employees' national insurance, they require a smaller gross for any given amount of take-home pay. For any given national minimum wage rate, which sets a floor below which the gross level of pay cannot go, they will receive a higher level of take-home pay. That introduces a distortion into the relative position of people above and below pensionable age, which ought to be reflected in the national minimum wage. The Bill's present structure will exclude exactly that kind of variation, which could be reflected in different rates for employees of different ages.
<P>
A separate question is that of the treatment of pension costs. It is one to which I frankly do not know the answer, although the Minister may be able to enlighten us. He has been kind enough to supply us with a note that capably deals with issues of remuneration. I was, however, interested to cross-refer his note with the CBI's evidence to the Low Pay Commission. The note and the CBI's evidence deal with issues of remuneration in similar terms, but with one exception. The CBI raised the question of pension costs in relation to remuneration. Its recommendations were not clear about whether pension costs should be included or excluded. If pension costs were included in remuneration, however, and pensions were not payable to older employees, we would, as was the case with national insurance--these points are accumulating--encounter a significant difference in the take-home pay of different sets of workers in relation to a given national minimum wage rate. Does the Minister intend to include pension costs in remuneration? What implications will that have for older employees?
<P>
Taking those points together, we see that there is a case both theoretically--the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion is slightly dismissive of theory--and practically for Ministers to retain the discretion to respond to the Low Pay Commission and to set a different rate for older workers above pensionable age. I urge that course on Ministers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I listened with interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who made an outstanding argument. He and I did not discuss what he was going to say, but he said it with such manifest reasonableness and in such persuasive terms that it will be interesting to hear not just the content but the tone of the Minister's reply.
<P>
I listened with equal interest to the contribution of the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion. I was singularly unimpressed by his presentation, partly because it was dismissive in tone and a travesty of the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I was also unimpressed because the hon. Gentleman, who is sadly no longer in his place, managed without any difficulty to contradict himself in his short contribution. He said that older people were quite capable of making their own arrangements and decisions. Apparently, their capacity to make their own arrangements and decisions does not extend to making decisions about the rate at which they are prepared to accept employment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman, when he returns to his seat, will ponder the internal inconsistency of his position, which he managed to convey in a speech that did not exceed five minutes. That was a shame, but my hon. Friend made a powerful case. Our argument is that, if it is right to allow for age discrimination in respect of people under 26, it should at least be possible to allow for age discrimination in respect of other categories of workers to whom similar considerations apply.
<P>
Why are people under 26 considered suitable for different treatment? The reason is that it is thought that it will be more difficult for them to get work--or having got it, to keep it--if they are subject to the full national minimum wage. That is why they will be exempted from the provisions of the Bill and eligible for a reduced rate of the national minimum wage. Why should such extenuations not apply to older workers? If the national minimum wage means that some older workers lose their jobs or cannot secure them in the first place, surely that is an argument for differential treatment?
<P>
I wish to underline the point about reasonableness made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, which I considered to be the most striking element of his contribution. Conservative Members do not argue from a dogmatic perspective--[Interruption]. The Minister is chuckling from a sedentary position but I hope that he will listen to the argument. I should be happy to give way if that is what he wants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I was chuckling from a sedentary position because, when I stood up, I fell over laughing at what the hon. Gentleman was saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am sorry that the Minister could not contain himself. Conservative Members argue that the possibility of differential treatment for the elderly should be considered. The Minister and others have previously accused us of taking a dogmatic, ideological position and of arguing by assertion rather than according to the evidence. We maintain that the evidence should be considered. It would be unfortunate if the Minister were to prefer blindly to ignore the evidence.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I have been very relaxed about requiring the hon. Members to speak to the amendments. However, a wide-ranging debate on an amendment will render it impossible to have a debate on clause stand part. It is clear that those debates will not now take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I note your guidance and instructions, and shall readily adhere to them.
<P>
Conservative Members believe that elderly people should be treated differently from other people for a number of reasons. As I and other hon. Members have explained, they may find it more difficult to obtain or retain work, but other factors are relevant too.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred to the make-up of pensions. It is important to understand that there are two broad categories of people over 65 who might consider employment. The first category includes people who have income other than their pension and comprises the overwhelming majority of pensioners. That majority has increased in recent years, and the evidence is that it will continue to grow. Those people already are substantially better off as a result of improved pension arrangements. Most have occupational pensions, and a proportion have personal pensions. In no sense are they dependent on what they are paid by their employers, as other resources are available to them. If they choose to supplement their income by working, perhaps part time, for an employer at a rate that is below the national minimum wage, which will be set in due course, I cannot understand why the Government set their face like flint against allowing them to do so.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, there is a category of pensioners--much the smaller of the two main categories to which I referred--who enjoy no income beyond their state pension and who therefore want to supplement that pension by working, probably part time. If, as a result of the failure to exempt them from the provisions of the national minimum wage, they are unable to secure work to supplement their state pension, they will be worse off.
<P>
As I listened to the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion, I was struck by the fact that he had nothing whatever to say about the evidence--he did not appear to be interested in it. He would not be influenced by it, but Conservative Members would. We want to know what evidence there is. We want the matter investigated by the Low Pay Commission. That is our argument. Why is an arbitrary distinction to be drawn between the under-26s and everyone else? Why is it not possible for the Low Pay Commission to consider an exemption from the national minimum wage for those over 65? Why is the Minister not prepared simply to look at the evidence? I put the case no more strongly than that.
<P>
For the record, if the evidence shows that there would be no economic disadvantage at all as a result of the inclusion of the over-65s within the provisions of the national minimum wage, so be it. If there is no good reason to exclude them from it, we will take note of that. If no one is to lose his or her employment, or if there is no evidence that he or she will be prevented from getting employment as a result of the full national minimum wage, all well and good. We are prepared to consider the evidence. What is the purpose of establishing the Low Pay Commission if it is not able fully to investigate all material considerations?
<P>
The Minister has talked about Conservative Members' ideological position, our dogmatic opposition to the national minimum wage and our failure to look at the evidence. The truth is that throughout our sittings, he has greatly exaggerated the support for his position. He talked earlier about a changed labour market. What has changed is not the labour market, but the Government. Obviously, people are rallying to the Government and are prepared to give them a chance. There is, however, strong opposition to the uniform application of a national minimum wage.
<P>
I want to invoke a long, considered and articulate letter--one of a number that I have recently received on this subject--from a constituent who is concerned about the Government's intentions. I am delighted to be able to rely on the support of a good consitituent of Buckingham, though I am not in any sense surprised by it. The individual wrote last week--his letter is firmly imprinted on my mind and rings in my ears. He said that he was very sorry to learn that, as far as he understood, there was to be no exemption for elderly people from the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Bill. He said that a neighbour had told him that I was sitting on the Committee that was considering the Bill, and therefore he thought it right to bring his concerns to me.
<P>
My constituent asked whether he was right in believing that the under-26s were to be excluded from the Bill's provisions but that no similar exemption was to be made for the elderly. He said that that was a matter of concern to him. He is over 65 and has income other than the state pension, but he wants to undertake casual work. He has done that in the past at as low a rate as &#163;3 an hour. He said that his understanding was that he would be legally prohibited from so doing in the future if the Bill proceeds to the statute book unamended in this respect. He believes that that is wrong and hopes that I will draw the argument to the attention of the President of the Board of Trade. I have informed him that she does not grace us with her presence in Committee, but have said that I would relay the point to the Minister of State.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman might sneer, but that is a legitimate concern expressed by a constituent. To make the point beyond peradventure, this may be only one letter--although I have had other representations expressing discontent with other features of the Bill--but it expresses a concern.
<P>
Is the Minister's opposition to an exemption for this category absolute or is it contingent upon the evidence? Is he saying that because he is opposed to this form of age discrimination, though not to that relating to the under-26s, he would be opposed in all circumstances to an exemption or a variation in the national minimum wage rate for those over 65, or is he open-minded about it?
<P>
If 5,000 people over 65 were to lose their jobs as a result of the unamended passage of the Bill, would the Minister regard that as sufficient reason to reconsider? If the figure were 10,000, would he regard that as sufficient reason to reconsider? If it were 20,000 would he regard that as sufficient reason to reconsider? I am anxious to establish whether the Government's opposition is ideological or based on a calculation of evidence. If the hon. Gentleman is reasonable--a fact about which there is considerable doubt--his opposition will be based on pragmatics and evidence. If that is so, I invite him to consider the possibility--I put it no stronger than that--that he might be mistaken. It is conceivable that the Minister might be wrong. He does not think that there will be an effect on employment as a result of including older workers over 65 within the full national minimum wage. However, there might be.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend has forgotten that the Minister has introduced to the Committee the novel economic concept that raising wages will increase employment. He might like to consider what I shall call the McCartney curve that generations of school children and students in the future will be invited to learn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that contribution. It was incisive and witty as his contributions invariably are. However, the ascendency of the Phillips curve over the McCartney curve is likely to be assured for some decades to come. Secondly, for partisans of the Laffer curve--and I hope that the Minister has studied the economic theory of Arthur Laffer--the hon. Gentleman has some way to go before he is able to compete satisfactorily.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman has studied Arthur Daley when it comes to economics. [Laughter.] If the hon. Gentleman's theories are correct, can he explain why, after 18 years of this cost-cutting exercise of reducing wage levels to get into the labour market, we inherited unemployment levels double what they were in 1979?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister should consider carefully before making interventions of that kind. The notion that the absence of a national minimum wage for those over 65 has been responsible for increased unemployment among those over 65--or, indeed, for any other category--is patently absurd. I hope that the Minister realises the scale of the economic transformation of our country, the structural differences in the labour market and the force of international competition that is involved. The idea that the over-65s have in some sense suffered because of the absence of a national minimum wage is absurd. But if the Minister thinks that that is the case, I simply invite him to allow individuals to choose for themselves. If he is not prepared to do that, why will he not let the Low Pay Commission consider the evidence before coming to a conclusion? Once the commission had come to a conclusion, it could make a recommendation to the Secretary of State, the supporting evidence could be published and we could have a proper debate. It is not necessary for the Minister to be quite so crotchety.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before my hon. Friend finishes his economics lecture, does he recall, as I do, that certain economic goods have a reverse sloping supply curve--the higher the price, the greater the demand, because people cannot afford anything else? That is the so-called Giffen influence. Such goods are known in the trade as inferior goods. Does not that throw out the signal that to prescribe a price for wages implies that they are inferior to other economic factors of production, which is exactly the signal that no member of the Committee wants to send?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We should remind ourselves that interventions should be brief. Before we get too many reverse curves, I should say that the temper of the Chair is directly related to the width of the debate: the narrower the debate, the more cheerful the Chairman. I am sure that hon. Members will bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Nothing would sadden me more than the prospect of your ill temper, Mrs Dunwoody. We wish your cheery spirit to continue under all circumstances, and I shall of course faithfully follow your guidance.
<P>
The point has been made, but I reiterate it: let the Minister and others consider the evidence. That is all we ask. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge advanced a powerful case in support of an exemption for the over-65s while, with due respect, the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion failed to respond. There was no comparison in the quality of their arguments. What is the Government's response to my hon. Friend's case? Why are they not prepared for the matter to be studied by the Low Pay Commission? If the commission found in favour of the Government's argument--they have presented no evidence to support it--and against ours, so be it, but let the matter be considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I support the amendment, partly on the basis of a remark made by the Minister this morning. He said that much of the Bill reflects a modern labour market and that those who oppose it somehow reflect old structures and attitudes. However, the clause reflects outdated views on treating elderly workers with flexibility, the operation of the labour market and how individuals operate within it.
<P>
To an extent, the pass has already been sold by the Government at the other end of the age range. Over the past few years, they have admitted that there is no sensible cut-off point for young workers below which they should be entitled to no minimum wage or a lower rate, or above which they should be paid the national minimum wage. The same flexible, modern thinking should be applied to elderly workers.
<P>
In opposition, in a paper prepared for an Industrial Relations Services conference, the Minister explicitly said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There will be no regional rates and no sectoral rates. Young people, aged between 16 and 18, will be entitled to high quality training, and will earn a trainee rate during this time. All employees over 18 will earn the national minimum wage.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He said that in 1996. Greater consideration and changes to the labour market have produced this Bill in which the cut-off age has changed from 18 to 26, so the Minister himself has displayed flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Nothing I said then about the Bill's proposals is in conflict with what I am saying now. We made it clear in clause 1 that employees over the school leaving age will be entitled to the national minimum wage. Clauses 3 and 4 make arrangements for the Low Pay Commission to consider specific groups in relation to training--no more and no less. What I said then and what I am saying now is consistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister makes my point ever more strongly. If the compulsory school leaving age of 16 is one cut-off point and 26 is another, the Bill's effect will not be that all employees over 18 will receive the national minimum wage. The Minister makes my case for me.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are practical difficulties at the lower end of the age range. The amendment seeks to rectify the inflexible thinking that used to characterise the Minister's papers. His thinking on the other end of the age range should now become more flexible. The idea that there is one definitive group of workers that needs to be protected has gone by the board. The amendment seeks to embed in the Bill the idea that it is no longer modern and sensible to think of a retirement age at which people stop working. That point was made by the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion when he referred to the companies that use many workers over the traditional retirement age.
<P>
The skills plateau is another fallacy related to the idea that one reaches an age at which one falls out of the labour market. That is the idea that workers are trained when young, reach a level of skill that they apply throughout their working lives and then retire and receive a pension. That no longer reflects the modern labour market. Thankfully, elderly people live longer, more of them are fitter for longer and an increasing number want to work part time. The amendment seeks to make it easier for them to do so.
<P>
There is clearly a divide in the Committee. There are those who do not believe that raising the price of labour makes it more difficult to employ people. Common sense tells Conservative Members that if the price of something is raised, there will be less demand for it. That applies to labour as much as it applies to cars, food or any other product.
<P>
We are trying to ensure that elderly workers are not deprived of the opportunity to extend their working lives, often on a part-time basis, so that they can avoid the increasing problem of feeling that they have suddenly been dislocated from an area of life that in many cases has been extremely valuable to them. I am sure that we have all read the studies that show that, sadly, a significant number of people die shortly after they retire. Retirement often has the same effect as bereavement--many people die shortly after their partner has died. Ending work is much less traumatic than bereavement, but statistics show that there is a significant effect when people are suddenly cut off from the world of work. The amendment would help people to avoid such trauma.
<P>
The amendment is directly relevant to the debate about welfare reform and the future of pensions. It will be easier to implement widespread and radical pension reform if it is easier for increasing numbers of elderly people to remain connected to the labour market and to earn money. From the tone of the speech by the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion, I assume that the Government will oppose the amendment, but if they accepted it, they would create greater flexibility in the labour market for older workers and, therefore, would encourage more of them to stay in it, making it easier for themselves to promote the type of pension reform that they say they want to promote. We should be forward looking on this issue. I suspect that the Government have not included such a provision partly because they have based their thought about the minimum wage on the way in which other countries operate it. Those countries are, however, stuck in a time warp and have adopted old-fashioned theories about the labour market. They introduced minimum wages, but did not consider elderly people to be a significant part of the labour market.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has already told us what happens now. There are about 800,000 over-65s in the labour market. That number will increase in absolute terms and as a proportion of the labour force as technology develops. We have already seen that manufacturing no longer provides large numbers of the heavy jobs that require young, fit men. It is clear that, as technology develops, more jobs will become available to people who are not physically strong or able to travel. The advent of new technologies and of the internet means that it will be possible to do increasing numbers of jobs from home. Those jobs will be particularly applicable to elderly people. If such people can overcome the prejudice that regards them as less employable than younger people, they will be able to connect with the world of work.
<P>
Perhaps deliberately, although I hope accidentally, the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion reversed the sense of the amendment. The sense of the amendment is not to devalue the work of elderly people, but to value it more highly and to make it easier for them to stay in the labour market. If, as I contend, it is true that more jobs will be available to elderly people, it would be perverse to put the artificial barrier of a full national minimum wage in the way of their getting in touch with the labour market.
<P>
One other point that I should make is that new services will emerge if relatively low-paid, possibly part-time jobs are made available to the elderly. One thinks of the retail trade, which the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion mentioned in this context. Supermarkets are always looking for new ways of attracting customers. Some have already developed the idea of helpers--employees who help people pack their shopping, give them advice or tell them where things are in the store. Many such jobs are ideal for part-time, elderly workers who want to continue to earn money and to stay in an environment in which they meet many people.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am interested in my hon. Friend's point. The implication of some of his argument is that if the national minimum wage were introduced for all employees, employers would substitute other employees for older employees because they could not price themselves into work. In fact, something quite different might occur, as my hon. Friend suggested. Employers might simply not offer a service at all, which would be to the detriment of customers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. It is not simply potential elderly employees who will be disadvantaged, but all the customers of the particular concern. In many cases, the jobs about which we are talking will be of marginal economic benefit to the company that offers them. They might, however, be worth while as a piece of public relations or as a way of generating customer good will. In a hard-nosed world, however, companies would not offer such services if they thought that they would lose significant amounts by doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I agree, as I am sure others will, that categories of worker could be affected in the future if the amendment is not successfully pressed. Could not present workers, however, also be dramatically affected given that 29 per cent. of working pensioners are currently paid under &#163;3.50 an hour? That is the practical relevance of the point to which we want the Minister adequately to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Clearly, some pensioners are willing to take jobs at rates of pay below the level that may be set for the national minimum wage.
<P>
It is hard for the Government to argue that they wish to introduce the minimum wage out of economic necessity. The Minister gave the example of the security guard working for very low pay. It is pretty unlikely that the many pensioners who accept such relatively low paid jobs do so out of that basic economic necessity, but such jobs are less likely to exist if a national minimum wage is imposed on employers. If the amendments are not agreed, the result will be that significant numbers of working pensioners--possibly hundreds of thousands, and not just the 5,000 or 10,000 to which my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) referred-- will find that their jobs will disappear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend might like to reflect on the comment by the chairman of the Low Pay Commission that some of the very marginal jobs that may be lost should be lost. When he made that comment, the chairman was probably thinking about heads of households and wage earners in the mainstream of the economy.
<P>
May we not find, as time passes, that pensioners can take on more of the valuable and useful jobs in society that are marginal in economic terms? Such jobs are appropriate to people with other sources of income, but they would not be viable as a main source of income.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It was injudicious, to say the least, of the chairman of the Low Pay Commission to define categories of job that he thinks should not exist. We must all jettison the idea that there are good jobs that certain categories of people perform full time at certain periods of their lives. The notion that people go through the stages of school, higher education and training before they become workers and, eventually, pensioners does not describe how the world works now, let alone how it will work in the future.
<P>
One function of the amendment would be to stop the Bill adopting an ossified, old-fashioned world view. The Bill looks backwards; the amendment would improve it at the margins and ensure that it does not do unintentional damage in an increasingly important section of the labour market. The more the Bill can be made flexible at the margins, the less damage will be done. The amendment would insert the necessary degree of flexibility for the elderly, who form a large and increasingly significant element of the work force. The Government should approach the amendment with an open mind, and not reject it out of hand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> From time to time, to paraphrase Disraeli, it is desirable to let the representatives of young England have their head on the Opposition Back Benches to promote amendments. However, I rise to endorse their arguments and to say that I hope that the Minister will respond to the amendments in the spirit in which they were moved.
<P>
I was keen to rise to speak in case anyone thought that I had a personal interest in the matter. Indeed, it was somewhat to my chagrin that I remembered during the general election that I attended my first general election meeting in 1945, when I was a toddler. At that meeting, I had the privilege of listening to a lecture from none other than Professor Harold Laski but, given the celebrated put down of that gentleman by Clem Attlee, I shall dilate about the event no further. Given that I shall be 65 in 10 years, the amendment is of increasing interest to me. It is also of importance to the Committee.
<P>
I can understand why the Government want the national minimum wage to be simple and straightforward. Unfortunately, for reasons to which I shall return when we discuss other amendments, that desire seems to do insufficient justice to the complexity of economic life, the development of social life, the on-going changes in the employment market and people's aspirations for their lifestyles, all of which are reflected in today's practice.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although I understand the attractions of a simple approach, a single mould will not fit in several cases--this particular debate relates to older people--and such an approach would be simplistic and possibly damaging, in ways that have already been very well established by my hon. Friends. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge outlined clearly and eloquently the number of people involved and the particular factors that give rise to the need for their different treatment. Of the points that my hon. Friend made, I would single out two.
<P>
The first is the fact that some workers--though, as I corrected him, not all--become slower and less productive as they get older. That is particularly so of workers in the manual trades, and they may therefore be in a different position with a different economic framework. The second--a point that my hon. Friend made very tellingly and to which we may well want to return later--was that, bearing in mind that workers of that age are not paying employee national insurance contributions, a national minimum wage set with the interests of those under 65 in mind would be quite different in practice from a level set for those over that age. Those factors alone should give the Government cause to consider the matter.
<P>
Another factor that I want to bring to the Committee's attention--it is not distinct from the points that have been made by several hon. Members, most eloquently, by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, but I also touched on it a moment ago--is that there is a natural mainstream bit of people's career that might loosely be said to run from the completion of their time in higher education or the completion of a post-graduate degree of training, and which might be flexibly interpreted as running out at about the age of 26, along with the young person's railcard.
<P>
The greater proportion of the population--nowadays increasingly both male and female, almost without distinction--might then continue to work until the age of 65 when, because of changes that the previous Government made, the pension age would cut in for both males and females. They would then be in receipt of a separate income from the state or from an occupational pension. There is a strong and powerful case, which my hon. Friends reinforced, for limiting consideration of the national minimum wage to that bracket--people between the ages of 26 and 65.
<P>
My final point is that the debate cannot be conducted without consideration of the general economic and social effects, as well as the effects on individuals. We have an aging population but mercifully, there is also an increasingly fit elderly population--people who feel young and want to carry on working in one way or another. There will be certain constraints on them, but there will also be opportunities for work, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, and it would be very unfortunate if the operation of the national minimum wage were to preclude that, by making it no longer attractive for employers to take them on and keep them on. As I have said, no employer has to employ anybody. No job has to exist--it exists only if there is a mutuality of advantage in its doing so.
<P>
I believe that those factors together make a strong case for the issue to be considered by both the Government and the Low Pay Commission. As my hon. Friend said, there are a number of ways of proceeding--the prescriptive way, which says that it should not happen for persons over 65, or the permissive one, whereby it is open to the commission to consider it. I hope that the Minister will make it possible for the commission to consider whether the Opposition have a point. If we have, it should be reflected in subsequent regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The measure is part of a family of measures. Since day one of the Committee, the Opposition have on the one hand suggested that they are trying to be helpful and that their suggestions and recommendations are about low-paid workers' wellbeing, while on the other hand their amendment seeks to prevent some workers from being able to seek the national minimum wage. In truth, that is just another formula by which the Opposition are trying to restrict the capacity of individuals to have access to the wage floor that the minimum wage will provide in the labour market.
<P>
I declare an interest in this subject, as a grandfather in favour of the national minimum wage. I think that the Chairman is a grandmother. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge may wish to know that, almost every time that I have worked on a Bill, its conclusion has been celebrated with the arrival of another grandchild. My two daughters have told me that that will not be the case this time. I have not yet been able to track down my unmarried son, so I do not know whether that is also the case with him. I shall keep my fingers crossed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge tried to suggest that the amendment was about protecting older workers who might not be able to keep up with their job, and who are a bit old, tired, behind the times, unfit and unhealthy, but who are seeking to do something if only somebody would allow them to. The hon. Gentleman should clarify that point. Right hon. and hon. Members would not apply that definition to their commitment and productivity, either here or in the general economy. The amendment is, frankly, a granny-bashing amendment. It attempts to prevent older workers from earning the national minimum wage.
<P>
It is important to place information on the record in response to Opposition Members' comments. About 8 per cent. of pensioners are in work. The issue concerns 272,000 men over the age of 65 and 504,000 women over 60--that is 776,000 individuals, which is not a small number in the context of the 26 million people in the total work force. Those people, many of them skilled through a lifetime of work in the labour market and commitment to their employers, are worthy of consideration for inclusion in the national minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also tried to suggest that national insurance contributions are determined simply on the basis of age. That is not the case. National insurance contributions are in the main related to earnings limitations. For every person under 65, payment of national insurance contributions is decided on the basis of their weekly earnings. Since 6 April 1987, the lower earnings limit has been &#163;62 per week, and the upper earnings limit has been &#163;465 per week. The issue of contributions, in relation to the general number of people in the labour market, is about earnings and not age. The hon. Gentleman tried to make his correlation stand up, but it does not.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the Minister has cited the exact figures, will he concede that pensioners in employment who earn more than &#163;62 per week benefit in their take-home pay because they do not have to pay national insurance contributions? That contrasts with non-pensioners working under similar conditions. I am sure that the Minister does not wish to argue that, on the basis of a 40-hour week, the striking rate of the national minimum wage will be about &#163;1.50 an hour.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> My point is that the hon. Gentleman tried to say that older workers do not have to make a contribution, but they will already have done so by making national insurance contributions throughout their working lives.
<P>
The amendments have the simple purpose of discriminating against workers over the age of 65. Amendment No. 25 would exclude people over 65 from the Bill by taking away their right to a national minimum wage. Amendments Nos 29 and 31 relate to clause 4 and would allow those aged 65 and over to be excluded from the national minimum wage or to be subject to a modified rate. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) would rather have support for amendment No. 25, but as a compromise he would accept amendments Nos 29 and 31. There will be no compromise on this issue and we will oppose amendments Nos 25, 29 and 31.
<P>
The amendments would deprive those aged 65 and over of the right to a decent wage. They would also encourage job substitution--the replacement of younger workers by older retirees--which would be an absurd and distortive outcome, particularly in view of the fact that older workers are different from younger workers. We have all agreed in the debate so far that the purpose of getting young people into the labour market is to create a skills and knowledge base and to enable them to have a relationship with a company. No doubt we will return to that debate on clauses 3 and 4.
<P>
Older workers already have that skills and knowledge base and they have commitment. My hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion set out in spades the arguments on that issue. B and Q does not have different rates of pay based on age. The fact that it does not discriminate between younger and older workers in terms of pay contradicts one of the central arguments of the hon. Gentleman's speech to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> What would the Minister say to those pensioners who are unable to gain work with employers such as B and Q, perhaps because they are slightly physically slower than younger workers? I shop in B and Q and many elderly people are perfectly fit and capable of working there, but that is not true of all elderly people. The Bill would prevent those people who suffer from some kind of disability--I use the term unashamedly--as a result of their advancing years from pricing themselves into the work force.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman has slightly changed his ground. He is now saying that people with disabilities should not be included in the minimum wage. I assume that at some stage amendments will be tabled on that basis. As I said a few moments ago, the Opposition are trying at every step to exclude groups of workers from the potential of earning the minimum wage. We have just had another example--people with disabilities--of those whom the Conservatives would exclude from the minimum wage.
<P>
The whole point of the discussion, which my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion highlighted, is that employers take on older workers because of their skills, knowledge, experience, commitment and understanding and the capacity to communicate with customers that stems from that experience. Employers and employees benefit from that relationship. That is why companies are turning away from age discrimination in the workplace. We will not allow older workers to experience pay discrimination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister seems to be unconscious that he is making our argument for us. He has just contradicted himself. He said a few moments ago that B and Q does not treat employees differently by age. He has also just pointed out that older workers are often employed because of their skills, merits and advantages. On the other hand, he claims that job substitution in favour of the elderly and against the young would result from the exemption that we seek. Which is his position? How many over-65s will need to be made unemployed before he will reconsider his blanket opposition to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman speaks so much hot air that Richard Branson could fly around the world on his back.
<P>
My point was quite clear: the amendment could create the potential for job substitution. My second point, which supports that of my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion, and which I think is the view of most reasonable people, is that employers such as B and Q do not want discriminatory policies against older workers because of their skill and knowledge base. That skill and knowledge should be reflected in pay rates, which is why we do not want older workers to be discriminated against regarding the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Does the Minister think that no elderly worker will lose his or her job as a result of the introduction of a full national minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> This is a dressing up of another old argument that the national minimum wage will cost millions of jobs. The hon. Gentleman has always argued that the national minimum wage is a job loser. Given all the international evidence that there has been, and the national evidence we have from when we had wages councils, we know that that is not the case.
<P>

<P>
A sensibly set national minimum wage will not cause massive job losses. The hon. Gentleman's point is bogus. He is simply trying to regurgitate his opposition to the concept and principle of a national minimum wage. I repeat that there are no economic grounds for excluding this group of workers in a labour market from potentially earning a national minimum wage. There have been social and economic arguments in respect of this. When we were in opposition, we considered them over a great period, in consultation with employers, older people's organisations and trade unions. Opposition Members have put no argument this morning to dissuade us from the view that older workers in this category should, if they are in work, be entitled to the benefit of a national minimum wage. I therefore ask my colleagues to reject the amendment.

<P>
Mrs. Dunwoody, you have wisely warned us in the past not to refer to previous amendments. I shall do so only to the extent of saying that this amendment might be of particular interest to some of the category who were the subject of the previous debate. I refer to those people who will remember the wireless programme ``Mrs. Dale's Diary'', which attracted a huge national following, and in which the wife of Dr. Dale was always saying, ``I'm worried about Jim.''
<P>
I have tabled the amendment because I am worried about the definitional clause regarding the compulsory school leaving age. It is a technical matter, but an important one, and the Government should get it right. Whereas in other aspects of the Bill the Government have sought not to be discriminatory, they have in this case--perhaps by accident and with the best of intentions--promoted a dangerous, if minor, discrimination.
<P>
I am aware of the concepts which have to buzz around the world of the civil service and the drafters of legislation. The terms of convenience concepts are brought in to provide a starting point for something else. Explicitly in the case of clause 1(2)(c), compulsory school age has been used as a convenient point at which the national minimum wage should apply.
<P>
Nothing in the Bill suggests that there is anything improper in employing schoolchildren. We may all have concerns about how that is sometimes done, but the Bill does not prevent pupils from working, nor does it relate to whatever remuneration they may receive, except in so far as that is covered by the national minimum wage. But the complicated concept of the school leaving age--anyone who understands education law in detail is better than I--has been applied to employment law. Domestic legislation has been translated into legislation on which European directives may bite, which might embarrass the Government.
<P>
There is a problem with the different school leaving ages in England and Wales, in Scotland and in Northern Ireland. Note 3 on clause 1, which deals with the matter, set me on that train of thought. Persons in Scotland could be outside the compulsory schooling age while their counterparts of the same age could be required to be at school in England. Feeling after the problem, I tabled an amendment--I do not claim that it is the end of the matter--suggesting a simple time test as an alternative to the compulsory school leaving age.
<P>
The first difficulty is that, given the small but explicit distinction between the compulsory ages in Scotland and in England--the Minister is nodding--there can be no national minimum wage. There has been press comment on whether the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly would have an input into the national minimum wage. The Guardian has stated that the President of the Board of Trade has firmly resisted that because the minimum wage will be national, so it is interesting to find a distinction between the countries of the United Kingdom.
<P>
In domestic legislation--I am not objecting to this--the several countries of the United Kingdom have for many years legislated separately and had different school leaving ages. It is odd that a national minimum wage turns out not to be that at all in this respect.
<P>
Secondly, there will be practical problems. The Minister knows that there are several with the Scottish Parliament's tax-raising powers in relation to employers. A supermarket in Berwick-upon-Tweed might employ young shelf stackers on Saturdays. Whether they are at school is immaterial to the amendment. Some will be resident in Scotland, and some in England. For people above the tax and national insurance threshhold, employers may have to have different payroll and PAYE computations, but even people working only for an hour on a Saturday morning may fall within the scope of the national minimum wage. That may depend on whether they are in Scotland or England--some people may be caught, but others may not.
<P>
I am not an expert and so do not fully understand the details but, depending on age, the Scots will be caught in some cases and the English in others.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered the further difficulty that the Bill is unclear as to whether the relevant place of residence applies to the young worker or to the supermarket? Supermarkets may even cross the border, in which case that question may depend on which self is being stacked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and I was about to unveil another element of the Pandora's box that the Bill represents. My understanding is that education legislation is tied to residence, and that that governs the decision to send out a school attendance officer to check whether little Johnny is going to school. Normally, a Scottish child will go to a Scottish school unless he or she is sent to an independent school across the border. The equivalent is true for English children, and that governs the compulsory school leaving age.
<P>
My hon. Friend is right to say that employment is flexible and that it is not limited by national boundaries. I presume that the test will cover the compulsory school age in that person's place of residence, but the Minister owes an explanation of that matter to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I have racked my brains to work out what employment on the Scottish border would include both banks of the Tweed. The only such job that I can think of is poaching, which is outside the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am all for having a few jokes in the Committee, but I am sorry that the Minister should treat the matter so lightly. He may come to regret in court his inability to treat the problem seriously. My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) is a distinguished lawyer. Occasionally I consult him on a matter of law, with bated breath and cheque book metaphorically raised. The Minister has his own distinguished lawyer in the shape of the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry.
<P>
The Minister sometimes finds it difficult to accept motives, but I am genuine in wanting to point out that a supermarket owner in Berwick-upon-Tweed with young employees from England and Scotland would have to sort out whether they were beyond the compulsory school leaving age. If they lied, there would be interesting evidential questions about whether they could return and make a case for themselves. The owner would face a considerable practical problem, which might be resolved if he or she decided not to employ anyone below the age of 17, which is the import of the alternative test proposed in the amendment.
<P>
I am also worried that the Bill goes wider than the relevant European directives. It does not specify where the compulsory school leaving age applies. What would happen if one of a pair of identical twins from Portugal were to go to work in England, and the other in Scotland? Labour Members may laugh, but that is a serious question, and such matters are what bring Ministers before the European Court of Justice. They would be well advised to consider the question. It is not clear, but in those circumstances I think that the compulsory age will be interpreted according to where the young workers come from. The fuzz will not be sent around to ensure that they go to school; in fact, the school leaving age in many European countries is higher than in Britain. However, there is the possibility that young people will avail themselves of their rights under the treaties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered a further problem stemming from the introduction of the concept of a school leaving age into the Bill? The European Commission is already keen to intervene in social and work-related legislation. The Government's signature on the social chapter means that it can do so more than before, but the Bill will allow the Commission a route into education and thus towards the possible harmonisation of the school leaving age.
