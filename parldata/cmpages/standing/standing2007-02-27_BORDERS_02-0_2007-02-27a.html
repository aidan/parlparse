actual

could be charged with that and the limits would, of course, be way
above the 51 weeks. My understanding is that that offence is limited in
its scope and that the concerns that you have would be met by powers

						</i> Having looked at what the members of the
Committee said on Second Reading, I saw that the issue has not been
raised just by yourself. Our concern is that from the 1999, 2002 and
2004 Acts, there have been extended powers to immigration officers.
What has not gone on at the same time has been the support provisions
that go with that for training officers and ensuring that they have
access to the relevant Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 training.
Those officers are going to be acting in sensitive situations, some
politically so and some involving vulnerable clients. Such
considerations led to PACE in the first place, to ensure proper faith
in and effective use of the justice system; however one looks at this,
if those powers are to be enforced effectively, that must be done in
the appropriate manner. That happened for the police service with PACE,
which provides protection to the police and to those in their custody.
At the moment, the powers of immigration officers are extending, but we
are concerned that they do not have the appropriate training or
legislative structure to act
within.</div>

								Richard
Thomas:

						</i> My experience comes from the context of the
prosecution of immigration offences. My understanding is that the
extended number of offences has taken up a huge amount of police time,
because there are not enough arrest-trained immigration officers. They
have been given more and more powers, which is creating an additional
strain on the police services at ports. The police there are not able
to concentrate on what they perhaps really want to concentrate on,
which is catching the traffickers or the professional criminals
involved in border crime. A lot of time is taken up doing things
relating to newly introduced immigration offences. So, the problem
arising from my answer to the last question is that there are not
enough trained officers to do the new jobs. They are being given more
and more powers, which they are not in a position to do, and it is
placing a strain on the police and taking away from what I imagine the
public would really want to see policed.</div>

what you have just said. Although all offences are serious, there is a
lot of public concern and in this place about the really serious
offenders, the people traffickers who make big money, work an organised
network and are into all sorts of crime. You have just told us that
your experience is that the police are being distracted from dealing
with such people. How strong is your evidence for saying
that?</div>

						</i> My experience over the last three years is in
dealing with offences in the Crown court and the Court of Appeal in
relation to offences mostly brought in with the 2004 Act, but also
documentary offences. So, on a weekly basis, I speak to police
officers, mostly down at Isleworth Crown court, who have come out of
Heathrow. Of course what I say is anecdotal and from my experience, so
I limit it in that way, but certainly the concern that the officers
have is something that I see on a regular
basis.</div>
					<a name="0702282000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other thing
that I hear about is that under the &#147;Operation Enforcement
Manual&#148; there is a lot of scope for immigration officers not
being able do their own work, but having to do it within police teams.
That is taking resources away from the police. Albeit anecdotal, it is
something that I am confident is a correct view of the
circumstances.</div>

						</i> I know that in recent years the police have
been working on the team work, and that they have a specified role;
there is a job within the police for liaising with the immigration
officers over roles that overlap. I am aware that the police are making
that effort. However, clearly, there are only finite resources, and
arresting five people on Saturday night for arriving without
documents&#151;they are easy targets&#151;produces a vast amount of
paperwork for those officers. Immigration officers have to arrive,
carry out the arrest and go back to the police station and process it,
which takes up their whole evening. They are not then able to focus on
what may be perceived as more serious crimes&#151;although everything
is serious, of course.</div>

relation to section 11 of the Children Act 2004. That sets out that
various agencies have a duty of care to the child&#146;s welfare.
Immigration officers are excluded from that. Now there are increased
powers where children are again going to come into the hands of
immigration officers; I am thinking of the first clauses in this Bill.
It may be children who are detained under the powers in clauses 1 and
2. They are not, at present, going to have the statutory protection

						</i> We would like to see an amendment that
incorporated the immigration service within those bodies mentioned in
section 11 of the Children Act. That would be a very big step forward
because it would mean that any immigration officer would have to
receive training around issues that include trafficking matters. They
would have to be concerned about the welfare of children passing
through ports as it would come within their statutory duties. I think
that would be a huge step forward and, because of that, there would be
knock-on effects in terms of the training and guidance issues that have

the detention provisions in clause 2, they mean that an immigration
officer can arrest anyone who is liable to be arrested by a police
officer. That is outside the scope of immigration and it seems to be a
sort of trickling, creeping effect. The other problem will be that, if
this information has been requested and is perhaps required for
criminal enforcement, there will be great difficulties in using that

others, we have highlighted refugees, people on highly skilled migrant

could be required to report, yet if someone was required to report
weekly or even daily, that would be within the terms of the Bill,

						</i> The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 was brought in
to target serious crime. The understanding was that it was difficult to
prosecute people but that serious criminals can be hurt by having
access to their funds curtailed. Therefore civil forfeiture methods
were brought in where funds could be seized on a balance of
probabilities. It is therefore much easier to target those serious
criminals. That is why the recovery of cash provisions were there in
the Proceeds of Crime Act.</div>

the magistrates court, go through the committal proceedings, go up to
the Crown court, perhaps have a trial and serve a sentence&#151;all

offence to resist deportation. The circumstances that enable somebody
to resist are exceptional ones and we see no need, therefore, to extend
the provisions in this way, which will remove the possibility to
exercise any discretion in a very large number of cases, no matter how

whether to make a mandatory deportation order, someone could serve time
way beyond their sentence, which would clog up the prison system and

						</i> If you look at the question in the
international context, it cannot be right that there are many people
who claim asylum but who are not found, on a fair adjudication system,
to come within the provisions of the 1951 convention. One of the
problems is that the 1951 convention is fairly tightly drawn. I shall
not reiterate the provisions because you will all be very familiar with
them. However, they mean that some people in a war-torn area, seeing
loss of life all around them, do not fall within the definition. They
might be entitled to humanitarian protection or discretionary leave,
but will not be recognised as refugees under the convention. That is
not to say that they are bogus&#151;an unfortunate adjective that has
been used in the past&#151;or that they are trying to flout the
system. It means that they are in genuine fear, but they are not
covered by the definition.</div>

						</i> No. You are putting words in my mouth. The
United Kingdom is one of many signatories to the 1951 convention. It is
reasonable to assume that any Government in the UK will apply the
provisions of the convention in good faith and will apply the
adjudication system individually to each applicant for
asylum.</div>
					<a name="0702282000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those who may
claim asylum are people who are outside their own countries of origin
and, necessarily, within the United Kingdom. In limited cases, somebody
might go to a British post overseas to claim asylum and be
accepted&#151;Aung San Suu Kyi or somebody like that, for example. I
cannot think of many others who would be able to do that; normally,
they would have to get to the UK. The present Government have
consistently tried to make it very difficult for anybody to get to the
UK. Our objection to that is that it is discriminatory against the
genuine asylum seeker, because there is no attempt at that stage to try
to ascertain whether somebody comes within the provisions of the 1951

can imagine the plight of a working holiday maker who wants to get
around the country and see different parts of the United Kingdom for
the purposes of their holiday who is told that they have to reside in a
particular place and to report regularly.</div>
					<a name="0702282000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">We cannot see why the clause is
so widely drawn when, in fairness to the Minister, he is giving
examples 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div>of where he wants to see it applied. My understanding is that it will
apply particularly to foreign criminals who cannot be removed and also
to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children when they reach the age of
majority. If that really is the Government&#146;s intention the
clause should be drawn as restrictively. The danger is that it leaves
it wide open for it to be applied much more widely and make life much
more difficult for people who do not really need these
restrictions.</div>

not enough for somebody to come from a certain country. For example, I
have a lot of asylum seekers and refugees in my constituency from

Where do you draw the boundaries? You seem to be saying that they are

are at specific risk. Where do you suggest the boundary be drawn? Would
you say that anyone coming from Somalia ought to be given refuge?

and the great majority of the world&#146;s refugees are women and
children. If they are lucky, they get across one international
border&#151;no more, for fairly obvious reasons such as a lack of
mobility. In a way, Britain has been the unwitting beneficiary of those
fleeing persecution who are the most useful to the country where they
end up, because they tend to be young, male, fit, healthy and capable
of work&#151;and, often, people with qualifications and
multi-linguistic skills. You could almost say that those are the

children a year coming into this country; there are around that number
falling into the category of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.
They need particular care; certainly, they need care that will give
them direct and immediate access to legal advice, so that they can be
assisted in their claim. They also need to be treated sympathetically
when they reach that magic age of 18, because it is a traumatic event
to be told that, on your birthday, you will no longer be given any kind
of protection and you will be removed. So there needs to be
sensitivity.</div>

example, serious complaints against IND will be dealt with by the

right direction. You will have more knowledge than I do about what
constitutes a serious complaint and what will happen to the other
complaints. There is a need for a fast-resolution system of what one
might call the minor complaints. They are usually personal complaints
against individual staff of IND, because someone has been rude or
unsympathetic, or refused to give their name, or something of that

down and will not gain public confidence. That is why we have been so
vocal in seeking to preserve rights of appeal, because we see that as a

to be the first hearing instance of much evidence that comes its way,
because that evidence was not presented earlier. That may not
necessarily be the fault of the applicant or the appellant at that
stage; there is a variety of reasons why evidence that is cogent and
necessary for a particular application is not delivered when it should
be. That is why we have some sympathy with the Home Affairs
Committee&#146;s recommendation that there should be a &#147;minded
to refuse&#148; stage, particularly for overseas refusals, to give
people an opportunity to remedy a defect, for example if they have been
unable to submit a document that is material. We do not have a great
deal of confidence in the idea of a so-called administrative review,

						</b> I have two quick questions. On the specific issue
of unaccompanied child asylum seekers, Mr. Best, in your
practical experience are the Government doing enough to offset the
financial burden that is suffered by a small number of local
authorities, principally in west London? They have really struggled
with that issue. Secondly, I thought the submission from the IAS was
very good. Surprisingly, I do not disagree with all of it. You say that
public confidence in the system will be engendered only when statistics
give an accurate picture of who is entering and leaving the UK every
year. Previous witnesses have made that point. Do you think the Bill
will have any meaningful impact on protecting our borders unless the
Government adopt a policy of proper record-keeping and database
management?</div>
				
					<a name="0702282000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Keith
Best:
							</b>
						</i> To answer your first question first: the
problem of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, in so far as it is a
financial and administrative burden on authorities, clearly needs to be
dealt with centrally by central Government. Kent county council has had
much to say about this in the past. I see Mr. Green nodding.
No doubt he has a constituency interest. I am not in a position to say
whether the Government are adequately compensating local authorities
for that or not. All I can say is that in principle I believe that that
sort of burden is a central rather than a local authority
burden.</div>
					<a name="0702282000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">On your second
question, we have long advocated proper embarkation controls. We feel
that public confidence in the immigration system will only be regained
if people know that the statistics they read about are verifiable and
accurate. It is not good to run a whole system&#151;sadly the
Government seem to make policy decisions based on this kind of
information&#151;on the international passenger survey, which samples
only 2 per cent. of passenger movements. It says that anyone who comes
into this country for more than 12 months is coming as a permanent
immigrant and that anyone leaving for more than 12 months is a
permanent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div>emigrant. A lot of it includes you or me going on holiday. It is not
good to try to base an immigration system on those sort of figures. If
one is to deter&#151;as one should&#151;abuse of the immigration
system, particularly by overstaying, it is essential to know how to
count out the people who come in to see whether they have left the
United Kingdom at the end of their limited leave to
remain.</div>
					<a name="0702282000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I applaud the
Government for bringing in e-Borders. I am sorry that it will not be
fully rolled out until 2014. We have been advocating it for a long
time. I appreciate that it cannot be done on paper, but that it must be
an electronic exercise. Unfortunately, the history of the association
of the Home Office with technology has not been particularly
felicitous. We can only hope that it will work and will actually give
the public the statistics on which we can have a proper reasoned debate
rather than one that is based on

						</i> Certainly. You need to know that the identity
of those leaving is the identity that they purport to have. That is
being done through the fingerprinting system. The biometrics that are
being rolled out now are more and more through entry clearance posts
overseas. I hope that that will have a marked effect on removing the
duplication of applications, so that when someone has been refused in
one identity, they are not likely to come back and try to be accepted
in another identity. I am told that in Pakistan at the moment there is
a lively trade of false exit stamps being put in passports to show that
people left the United Kingdom at a particular time when, clearly, they
did not. However, that is anecdotal
evidence.</div>

such a tendentious subject and leads to such strong feelings. I fear
that the Government have not fully appreciated that the deterrent
measures against asylum seekers, including being dragged through the
courts and found wanting on human rights legislation, which has upset
many of us who take a pride in our country, only fan the flames of
racism. When you legitimise in that way, using a particular section of
the population as a scapegoat by reference to a common characteristic
such as being asylum seekers, unfortunately evidence shows that that
translates directly into violence being visited by a mindless thug
against someone whom they assume is an asylum seeker, but who is
probably a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 63</div>third-generation British citizen. That is one of the problems and,

reason why we have such a tendentious debate about such matters is the

former Immigration Minister, Barbara Roche, has now called for an
independent statistical service to do this and increase public
confidence, and that may be something else that has to be done.
Certainly people will not be able to have a proper debate, and
therefore there will not be confidence in the system, unless they know

will take an applicant&#146;s perfectly legitimate details, which
would probably succeed in an application, and then ruin them by telling
the applicant that they cannot tell that story and they have to tell
another one or have a false document. They then sell them one under the

they are supposed to be. That has been the experience to date under the
current powers. Evidence within the IAS shows that following the

actually increase the amount of fraud? As you explained, people obtain

						</i> First, you mentioned the question of illegal
immigrants. We fear that a great opportunity has been missed in the
Bill, which could be remedied, maybe, by amending clause 17, to
actually deal with something that engenders a great deal of public
disquiet and is acknowledged by the Government in their actions to try
to combat it: the number of illegal immigrants in the country. We have
always advocated a regularisation of the system that would give some
people a limited status
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 67</div>that could be renewed and would bring them within the tax system, and so
on. That would be highly advantageous. I will not labour you with all
the details, because they are well
articulated.</div>
					<a name="0702282000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
particularly concerned about those who may have failed to establish a
legal right to remain in the country, but who cannot be removed for
various reasons. These people are literally in a state of legal limbo.
They are not allowed to work and are not allowed to do anything else
and could be in that situation for a very long time. We feel that that
is unacceptable. There will be a rising number of people in that
situation.</div>
					<a name="0702282000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">To come back
to your second question about the practicalities, obviously we are
deeply concerned about anything that will further delay the process for
people. We feel that the Government&#146;s intention, expressed in
the phrase &#147;exporting borders&#148;, is a good one. We would
like to think that, by the time people arrived in the United Kingdom,
they had been fully checked and documented, so that there would be
little work for an immigration officer to do&#151;because they would
be satisfied that those people had been properly documented at the time
of the application. That presupposes all sorts of issues about the
entry clearance

which discriminate against visitors from poorer countries. For those
people a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to visit family members in the
UK can, all of a sudden, be a bit further away in terms of the
administration cost. One of the biggest concerns is that, even when you
succeed in going through a long appeal system, finally getting hold of

where you draw the line. I understand that, in the ID legislation that
has gone through, there are exemptions for children, because their data
change. Beyond that, the best we can say is that it is going to have
the same impact as for adults. But if there is a family visit and
people are bringing the whole family, more people have to be catered
for and it takes longer and costs more.</div>

difficult to try to forge a fingerprint, if forge is the right word. A

You said that you welcomed in principle the idea of exporting borders,
so that when people arrive here their paperwork is in such order that
the immigration officer has not much to do. I gently suggest that we
are a very long way from that. We will all have seen the
&#147;Panorama&#148; programme a couple of months ago that showed
that inside the EU it was very easy to buy 20 passports, and that
testing two of those passports, one forged and one stolen, going by
Eurostar through Waterloo, for example, you could get into this
country. Presumably, if that is true around Europe, it is also true in
other parts of the world. So the idea that we are close to a situation
in which we can be sure of the paperwork of those arriving here is,
frankly, a bit optimistic.</div>

								Keith
Best:

						</i> You may well be right on that, Mr.
Green. One of the problems is being able to spot a forged Polish or
Czech Republic passport. With the increase in EU membership there are
many different passports and people have got to be fairly expert on
what the genuine ones look like. One thinks of the relative porosity of
the eastern borders of the European Union now, and the very large
number of Ukrainians, for example, who come to Poland on a visitor
basis but work illegally, not least to backfill the spaces of those who
have come to the west to work, especially in care homes and so on. Once
you are within the borders of the European Union there must be a
tremendous temptation to get hold of a somewhat obscure European Union
passport and travel around the EU on
that.</div>

						</i> Yes, there is a clear need for that. I hope to
have indicated in my answer that, to a certain extent, when there is
clear evidence of abuse that obtains in some countries rather than
others, it is almost inevitable that there will be a prejudicial
assumption against nationals from those particular countries; and if
those particular countries have citizens of a particular ethnic
background, it will be regarded as discriminatory. That is very
unfortunate. It does not invalidate the system, but it means that you
have to be more careful. You have to scrutinise more fully the
decisions that are taken in respect of those particular countries so as
to avoid stereotyping.</div>

						It goes outside
the remit of the Bill, but one of the things that we have advocated in
order to remove the sort of prejudice that exists in people who do the
job day in, day out is to recruit entry clearance officers far more
widely. I can think of all sorts of university leavers, for example,
who would welcome two years in Beijing learning Mandarin at Her
Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s expense and enhancing their career
prospects when they leave, who would come to the job of an entry
clearance officer without any baggage or prejudice inherent in what
they have done beforehand and who would approach it with an open
mind.</div>

must grapple with measures such as that to ensure that the people who
administer the system are not so hidebound in what they have been doing
beforehand that they almost subliminally&#151;I acquit people of
doing it consciously in most cases&#151;feel that sense of prejudice
because of what they have been dealing with in the
past.</div>
