<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I beg to move amendment No. 145, in page 23, line 39, leave out subsection (1).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 161, in page 24, line 2, after `Class 1', insert `and Class 2'.
<P>
No. 146, in page 24, line 10, after `class 1', insert `and 2'.
<P>
No. 162, in page 24, line 10, after `Class 1', insert `and Class 2'.
<P>
No. 163, in Clause 28, page 24, line 20, after `Class 1', insert `and Class 2'.
<P>
No. 166, in Clause 28, page 25, line 19, after `Class 1', insert `and Class 2'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Good morning, Sir David. It is nice to be starting the sitting on another part of the Bill after our long and thorough examination of part I, which deals with the Child Support Agency. Even if we do not take as long to scrutinise part II as we did to consider part I, I hope that we will be as thorough, as it raises a number of long-term issues concerning the provision of a better income for retired people.
<P>
My view, which is shared by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) and Liberal Democrat colleagues, is that the provisions in part II, including the establishment of a state second pension that attempts to target resources more on the lower income pensioner groups, are welcome. We also welcome the distributional effects of the proposals. However, as we consider these and subsequent amendments, we shall want to explore a number of concerns that have been expressed to us and to other Committee members about the way in which the relevant clauses will work in practice. Although the principles enshrined in the clause should be applauded, the timing of bringing them into full effect and the qualifications that must be met to gain access to the state second pension make a hurdle that will be too high for some people to surmount.
<P>
The amendments are intended to deal with self-employed people, who face a completely insurmountable hurdle because of the Bill. The clause sets out the framework for people to qualify for national insurance contribution credits to the state second pension. In effect, it is a gateway to the second-tier pension. Amendments Nos. 145 and 146, in common with the amendments tabled in the names of hon. Members representing the official Opposition, are intended to probe the reasons why the Government decided to exclude self-employed people from the terms of the state second pension.
<P>
Self-employed people are included, at least in part, in the state earnings-related pension scheme. Class 2 national insurance contributions are taken into account in the calculation of the amount of surplus earnings on which SERPS entitlement is based. Under the clause, class 2 contributions will no longer count, which will leave self-employed people unable to accrue rights to an additional pension. The amendments seek to find out why that is the case. The clause will leave self-employed people with a lower final pension than they would otherwise have been able to receive. Credits on earnings in employment, yes, but not credits in respect of self employment in the same tax year. That is the issue that we want to explore. A person could be employed for one part of the year and self employed for another. Such a person would clock up credits for the period in which he was employed but would not be entitled to any credits towards a state second pension during the period of self employment. With flexible labour markets, people will increasingly have different forms of employment at different parts of the year.
<P>
The Library tells me that it has had discussions with officials which have revealed that some 150,000 people will lose out as a result of the provision. Beyond that figure of 150,000, it is difficult to get hard facts on how the provision—or lack of it—will work. The Bill will deprive people whose income is made up of employment and self-employment of a full entitlement to credits, especially class 2 credits, that go towards a state second pension. They may have to retire on a lower income than other categories of people. Why have the Government decided to do that? They consulted on it in the Green Paper. It would be useful to spell out why they are not willing to countenance changing the rules so that self-employed people can be counted in. That is especially relevant to those on lower incomes whom the Government are trying to support and assist in their retirement.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I should like to speak to amendments Nos. 161, 162, 163, which are similar to amendments Nos. 145 and 146, and 166. Like the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow), I note that we have moved on to part II, which some of us see as the second Bill in this compendium.
<P>
Clause 28 is relatively easy to understand. In contrast, clause 29 contains more complex ideas that will be best explained if we become a high-tech Committee that uses slides, videos and other paraphernalia. Clause 28 concentrates on the groups that will be brought into S2P, the state second pension: we should try to avoid jargon, but I suspect that over the next few days we will spend many hours debating it. S2P is being extended to people who do not have access to a pension. There is, however, a category that will be excluded, and it is unfair that the poorly paid self-employed, or those with mixed work records, should not benefit from the credits.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said that about 150,000 people will fall into that category. It does not take a great deal of imagination to construct patterns of work that put people in that mixed category of employment and self-employment. For example, in my previous constituency, where wages were low and the local economy was weak, people moved with great frequency between employment and self-employment. They benefited from SERPS. The proposal will hit those people hard. Skilled tradesmen, such as plumbers and electricians, who for much of the year are employed as sub-contractors, use their skills to work for other people on a self-employed basis when their contracts end, perhaps fixing washing machines or—this happened to me over the Christmas holiday—replacing a central heating boiler.
<P>
That category of people will be hardest hit by the exclusion from S2P. Part of the reason for that—this theme will run through many of our arguments on the clause—is the fact that people will receive credits for S2P only if their condition exists for a whole year. The reason why the Government have excluded the self-employed is because if a self-employed person had one credit, he or she would be credited with a whole year of contributions to S2P. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us whether it is the Government's policy that, although all categories of people are set out in the clause, only a person who has claimed for a whole year will receive the credits. That suggests that the clause introduces a rigid rule instead of providing the flexibility that is necessary when dealing with the self-employed.
<P>
I have spoken about people who currently move in and out of the self-employed world. As the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said, as employment becomes more flexible, more people will want to mix and match. In the same way as, in a previous part of the Bill, we were trying to create a more flexible child support system, it behoves us to provide a more flexible pension system that will relate as closely to future work patterns as to today's work patterns and to the old-fashioned patterns of secure employment that fewer and fewer people recognise.
<P>
By excluding approximately 150,000 people—I am grateful to the Library for its work on that—the Bill will result in a hidden cut in Government expenditure. My calculations show that the proposals will be hugely expensive in the long run. It looks as if the second option for rebates will cost £18 billion by 2050. The credits of 150,000 people will not provide a huge saving that will help the Department to balance the books, but it is a cut. Last night, the Secretary of State announced benefit savings of £200 million. He budgeted for inflation at 1.3 per cent., whereas in September it was only 1.1 per cent., so there is an extra £200 million skulking around the departmental budget.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> It is not a saving.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It is a budget saving because the Department's budget included a figure of 1.3 per cent. instead of 1.1 per cent., but I must say no more on that subject. I thought it was iffy to mention the subject in the first place, and wondered whether the Chairman would call me to order. However, there is potentially a hidden cut in current spending on national insurance and entitlement to SERPS. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point.
<P>
I want briefly to mention amendment No. 166, which relates to labour market attachment for disabled people. Again, it is not difficult to imagine that, as disabled people are helped increasingly to return to work, more of them will move through patterns of employment, such as self-employment. They may find that, because of their disability, it is easier to be self-employed, although the work will often be low-paid—hence, they will be looking for S2P credits.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In that situation, it is especially hard that such people will not get S2P credit for self-employment. I hope that the Government did not deliberately intend to do that, that they overlooked the issue and that they will be willing to reconsider. If not, I hope that they will give us an explanation that will stand up, which we might offer to the disabled people who will inevitably come to us for help, asking why they have been discriminated against. Will the Minister give us an explanation that we could give with pride to disabled people trying—desperately and with difficulty—to return to work?
<P>
I would be grateful if the Minister could explain why he is excluding the self-employed and whether our surmises as to why are correct, and if he could answer our questions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I shall not detain the Committee long; I shall be extraordinarily brief. The issue is important. There was a clear manifesto commitment to retain SERPS for those who wanted it. That was not honoured because, we were told, the state's second pension would be better. I seriously doubt that it will, and we shall come to amendments by which we may examine the proposition. We may consider, under the present amendments, those for whom it will clearly not be better and for whom the pledge has not been honoured.
<P>
The Government must explain how and why the situation has arisen. Clearly, the provision proposes lower eligibility than the old regime. People were meant to be able to retain the provision, but it was removed on the grounds that they would get something better. What are they getting, and in what way is it better?
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): I am pleased that we are proceeding to pensions, interesting and important as child support was. As I said when we discussed the timetabling of the Committee, I hope that we shall spend enough quality time considering the vital issues. That is crucial for two reasons—we must ensure, first, that we shall improve the existing system and, secondly, that the cost of improving it does not become exorbitant.
<P>
From my research, I understand that the change could be expensive for the Government—[Interruption.] I am sure that they have considered that, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) reminds me, anything expensive for them is expensive for the taxpayer. I wish to return to many issues, but you would rule me out of order if I considered them now, Sir David. I have concerns about whether the cost will have a proportionate benefit for people.
<P>
The Government intend to help the lower paid. I am all for that as I am keen to help them. However, a significant group of the lower paid might have earnings from different sources. It is not difficult to think of people who might work part-time for someone in the morning and work for themselves in the afternoon. I shall not discuss the many such cases that I can think of—I am sure that hon. Members will be able to think of people who will lose out.
<P>
Will we help those whom we say that we want to help if we do not agree to the Opposition amendments? We must consider the 160,000 people and ask what they earn. Are they not the people who have been excluded in the past, and should not we take the opportunity to help them now? As I understand the Bill, we can continue to provide for such people and to improve provision for them only if the amendments are agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> It is not so much that they have been excluded in the past. It is more a question of what little they had being taken away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> My hon. Friend, as ever, puts his finger on the exact problem.—[Interruption.] I am sorry, I thought that the Under-Secretary was about to intervene. I think that she was referring to scripture by saying that to he who hath shall be given and from he who hath not shall be taken away—even the little that he has got. I do not quote exactly, but I think that that was what my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) was getting at. If we do not agree to the amendments, we will miss an opportunity to help low-paid people. I accept that well-off people may have both employed and self-employed earnings. Indeed, I can think of many such people. We should concentrate, however, on helping the many people who do menial jobs and do not earn a great deal of money but who are both employed and self-employed.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): The Government's attitude to pension provision, especially in relation to self-employed people, is somewhat surprising. They have been critical of the pensions policies of the previous Conservative Government, but that attitude flies in the face of the huge success that the previous Government had with those policies and with the creation of private provision and private savings for pension policies, which transformed the balance sheet of UK plc for us baby boomers, who will be expensive to the Treasury as and when we retire. Those policies were a great success, but, as with everything, the success was pleasing but did not go all the way through the social spectrum.
<P>
There is still a need for more pension provision for specific categories of people, especially the lower paid. Many such people are self-employed, and are lower paid because of the uncertainty of contracts and of finding business. Whoever won the election, there would have been a need to help people without proper pensions, who should be encouraged to make such provision. Both parties were committed to that, and Labour Members were the most forceful in their rhetoric. They insisted that the people whose future needed to be sorted out and whose retirement would be made enjoyable by a little financial comfort were lower-paid and self-employed people.
<P>
Under the old regime, self-employed people could enter the SERPS arrangement. It is extraordinary that the Government are closing that door without opening another. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to that point, as the Government are abrogating their duty by leaving self-employed people floundering. Such people were the biggest omission in the pension arrangements secured for others. It is not good enough that the Government are excluding them from their arrangements, which my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham outlined. The Government have been in power for nearly three years and have had a long time to introduce pensions legislation. Pensions are a big issue. They involve many years of saving and most people are concerned about them. We all anticipate retiring, but that is when we become most financially vulnerable. It is extraordinary to leave the self-employed out of pension arrangements.
<P>
The self-employed cover a wide spectrum. My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said that many journalists are self-employed. If they work for The Daily Telegraph, they are on a reasonable income and will not be so fearful of the day when they are not earning a steady income in retirement. However, many self-employed people are on modest earnings. They are dependent on the economic climate and, depending on whether they can contract their services, they may not be guaranteed a weekly wage.
<P>
Casualisation of the labour market has taken place over the past 10 or 20 years. That facet of economic activity, which Labour Members criticise, is an extension of self-employment. It has been a major boost to the economy. More people are employed—and the Government want us to recognise that—because more people are becoming self-employed. They are earning an income without being in the formal labour market. There is a greater need for the self-employed to be part of pension arrangements because they constitute an increasing proportion of the work force. Despite the rhetoric about the Conservative Government's wicked labour laws, which contributed towards the casualisation of employment, the Labour Government are doing nothing about that because the simple economic reality is that more people are, or would choose to be, self-employed. They like the flexibility.
<P>
If we are to operate an economy that is heading towards full employment, which we would welcome, many people will be self-employed. There are no longer smoke-stack industries to soak them up, so they will have to be more flexible in order to operate around the edges of economic activity. That suits many people. We should not worry about it. The Labour party wants people to be fearful of it, but it is the way that the economy is going. It is one reason why the British economy has been incredibly successful at reinvigorating itself and producing high employment.
<P>
It is crucial that the Government's pension arrangements recognise the self-employed, especially those at the bottom end of the spectrum who should be eligible for the state second pension. People on lower incomes are most vulnerable. The Government should stand by their rhetoric of looking after the lower paid. They say that they want to increase fairness. All politicians believe in fairness. It is incumbent on Labour to argue that self-employed people on low earnings, whose careers are, by their very nature, uncertain, should look forward to comfort and security in their pensionable years. [Interruption.] That was not my pager, Sir David.
<P>
As I was saying, it seems surprising that a Government, who were elected on the basis of a great deal of rhetoric about how they would look after the poorer sections of society, now want to exclude from their pension arrangements the very people who are most in need of financial security in later years. We look forward to hearing the Minister's explanation for that. Whether he agrees with the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, will he say what else the Government will do to ensure that the whole British population can look forward to financial security in old age, which is a goal that I am sure everyone in the Room shares?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): We come now to the most important part of the Bill. It is not the part that generates the most controversy or difficulties for us as Members of Parliament, but it is important and, despite its complexity, it is an interesting part of our deliberations. There is nothing more important in an ageing society than the effective provision of pensions. Great strides have been made in pensions provision, and we can be proud of the way in which we have created the most sophisticated occupational and private pensions industry in the world. The rest of Europe looks to us as an example.
<P>
The difficulty with which the Government are grappling is at the lower end of the scale. For all our success with occupational and private pensions, it is still difficult to create an effective pension for those who earn less than £9,500 a year and who have interrupted earnings, a subject to which the amendment relates. People who are on low earnings drift in and out of employment, from full-time to part-time work, from small companies self-employment. Anyone who understands the pensions industry will say that, if a person who is in a pension scheme comes out of that scheme, even for a short time, there is a high price to pay, so I understand the Government's intention. I want to make a proposal that would help the employed and the self-employed to receive a proper pension, of which they could be proud and which would fulfil the Government's aims. As we know, people who earn less than £9,500 would be expected to stay in the new second state pension and those who earn more than that would be expected, if not compelled, to contract out of the state scheme by stakeholder or other funded pension. I suppose the Government assume that people who earn less than £9,500 are in steady, or not so steady, paid employment and must go down the Government route, but that people who earn more than £9,500 must go down the stakeholder and private route.
<P>
All those people who earn above the national insurance lower earnings limit, LEL, and below £9,500, will be treated as if they earn £9,500. I suppose that is quite generous, although it will not be helpful to those who are self-employed, but that is how the second state pension will be calculated. I am interested in why we cannot have a far more comprehensive system. If we were to consider the amendments positively, that would be an essential first step towards a more exciting and comprehensive system. I am interested in why the principle of treating people who earn less than £9,500 as if they actually earn that amount could not be extended to the system of rebates. People who earn less than £9,500 a year could, therefore, be given the same level of rebate as those who earn £9,500. I should like such provision to be extended to employed and self-employed people.
<P>
If my proposal were accepted, all people in paid work would be able to purchase a personal, funded pension and the entire second tier of pension provision would be privatised. There would be a basic state pension, but the state second pension, the stakeholder pension and the private occupational pension would be in the private sector. The split between funded and non-funded pensions or between stakeholder pensions and state second pensions would thus be removed.
<P>
That proposal is exciting and would give some credit to people on low incomes. Whether or not such people are self employed and whatever their work history, such credit would enable them to purchase a funded pension. As Opposition Members have said, the great difficulty of dealing with people on low earnings is that their work record is increasingly difficult to follow and to keep a tab on. The days of lifetime jobs are over, especially in the sectors under discussion.
<P>
I think that I understand what the Minister's approach to the amendments will be. He will say that the Government are creating a state second pension and that the Bill is the first step towards that. He will then tell us, however, that to try to extend that pension to self-employed people would be far too difficult. It will be difficult, unless people have personal funded schemes that they can take around with them as they go in and out of work, self employed or otherwise, as they stop work to look after children and so on. The difficulty hitherto has been that we have had no way of creating an effective funded pension for people earning less than £9,500 a year, who were simply not earning enough. If the Government are helping people in paid employment by assuming that they are earning £9,500 a year, even though they may be earning less, why cannot they extend that approach across the board? Why not extend such provision to self-employed people but also put them in personal schemes?
<P>
By chance, the basic pension plus scheme proposed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) when he was Secretary of State for Social Security would have operated in a similar way. The scheme was introduced shortly before the election, and would have given all those whose earnings exceeded the lower earnings limit a rebate of sufficient value to purchase a funded pension. Whether people were self employed, falling in and out of work or employed, my right hon. Friend's proposal, which was well worked out, interesting and exciting, would have given them rebates to purchase proper, funded pensions. The value of the rebate would have been calculated on the basis of actuarial assumptions that would have provided a pension of a value at least as high as that of a basic state pension. That is what the Government are trying to do with their state second pension, although they are keeping it in the state sector and ignoring self-employed people. My right hon. Friend's proposed pension would have been underwritten by a Government guarantee to make up the difference if a pension fund failed to produce benefits of an equivalent amount.
<P>
Interestingly, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who probably knows more about such matters than any hon. Member present, introduced a ten-minute Bill in November 1998, after his resignation from the Government. It was based on the ideas that he had set out in ``How to Pay for the Future: Building a Stakeholders' Welfare'', which was published by the Institute of Community Studies in 1996. The Bill proposed a stakeholder pension scheme based on proposals that he had already made and which would have compelled everyone to join a funded pension scheme. Presumably, the people joining would have been self-employed and employed, and, however much or little they were earning, they would have been compelled to join a proper, funded pension scheme. The Government would have had to pay contributions in respect of specific groups of people who were unable to do so for themselves because they were earning too little.
<P>
I assume that the right hon. Member for Birkenhead floated that proposal when he was in government. Although what we could call the Birkenhead scheme was more generous than the basic pension plus scheme, as it sought to provide people with a funded pension that provided benefits of 30 per cent. of average earnings, it was based on a similar principle to the proposal of my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchen and Harpenden. They advocated that state pension provision should be replaced by a wholly funded system, to be backed by a Government guarantee for everyone. One only has to pause for a moment to realise that that would transform the prospects of people who are in low-paid work, or who drift out of jobs and have nothing,
<P>
A real crisis is developing in our society. We have a comfortable occupational pension scheme that is one of the best in the country, but we must think of the millions of people who are struggling. We need to give them a system of which they can be proud and that is personal to them. It should not be a crumb that is thrown by the Government. We do not want to provide a basic but inadequate pension that produces an ever-declining proportion of national earnings and which, because it is impossible to live on, makes people fall on to income support when they reach old age.
<P>
The Government will say that they agree with that principle, which is why they are introducing the state second pension. But people do not own that pension. The Government are not giving them a great concession. It is not good enough. Everyone should have their own funded pension proposal. The proposals of my right hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Birkenhead would make it compulsory for everyone to purchase a funded pension scheme. That would be an exciting prospect. Perhaps the Government will open the door just a crack to give some hope that there is flexibility in their thinking and that they are not determined to deal with the problem by saying, ``We've got a basic pension. It works well enough and we're going to weld another plate on top of it.'' The basic pension is like an old liner that is chugging its way through the seas. It is an old-fashioned concept that does not provide adequate support because it is sinking. It is not good enough for the Minister of State to weld on another plate. We want a new liner—a new proposal—of which people can be proud and that is personal to them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): When my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham said that we would be debating clause 28, it was with some relief that I discovered that it related to class 1 and 2 contributions.
<P>
The clause is off message. It does not fit into what the Prime Minister or the Chancellor of the Exchequer would regard as a sensible provision. I am surprised that it has managed to escape their attention. I suspect that you, Sir David, like me, look forward to hearing the Prime Minister's latest pronouncements on our great nation. In a speech to fellow European leaders, he said that there was high unemployment in Europe and a lack of growth because our European partners do not have a flexible labour market. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer are keen to stress that. It may be why the new Austrian leader, Herr Haider, is so attracted to new Labour's policies. [Interruption.] I am delighted to hear that the Under-Secretary's voice is back to its robust self.
<P>
The clause makes a flexible labour market inflexible with regard to pension provision. We sometimes have an old-fashioned view of what a self-employed person looks like. It is not recognised that the self-employed occur in all sectors of society and to all income groups.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
A common feature of my hon. Friends' contributions has been that they have all noted that people move freely from being an employee to being self-employed. The new pension provision should take account of the situation. Why are there good arrangements for people on occupational pension schemes but not for those who will have to rely on the state second pension? Such people include those to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham referred—those who work in the coastal resorts. The work is highly cyclical according to the seasons; people move through different forms of employment and may be self-employed. We might also consider those on the fringe of agriculture, and also journalists, not all of whom receive handsome stipends or the high salaries to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) referred. People working on a weekly local newspaper might qualify for the state second pension given their take-home pay, as might people who work freelance.
<P>
The measure is harsh; amendment No. 166 would bring justice with regard to disability. We know the number of people who come to our surgeries who would fit the category. The most important thing that my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham said was that the trend was likely to grow—we are beginning to see only the tip of the iceberg.
<P>
Our aim is to get people off means-tested benefits. The measure will be a conduit through which people are likely to move closer to such benefits, especially to the minimum income guarantee. The Government are especially sore about the guarantee—it is being exposed as having nothing to do with minimum incomes and as being no guarantee. It is the old income support rules dressed up with a fancy label. The promise to pensioners represents little improvement on what existed before.
<P>
In common with many hon. Members, I am deeply conscious that a great pension provision crisis is likely to occur in the early 2020s. That happens to be the time when I hope to retire. We seem to be imposing a further burden without recognising what has happened in society.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) referred to the need for greater flexibility. I was on the final flight out of Chile before Senator Pinochet was made an enforced visitor to these realms. I went partly to study the Chilean system of pension provision. Given the movement between being self-employed and being an employee, I was impressed that a section of society—people on modest incomes now have the security of a pension in retirement, which would have been undreamt of a few years ago.
<P>
We want the same kind of security to be offered to pensioners on modest incomes in this country. It makes not a jot of sense to start this second part of the Bill by finding ways to confine people in a straitjacket. What the clause represents above all is a straitjacket on employment practices. It would be a good start to the Bill if the Government reflected on that and looked towards ways of making this much more responsive to a changing and more flexible labour market. That is after all what the Prime Minister preaches. He wants to see a more flexible labour market. The problem is that the more flexible our labour market becomes, particularly at the lower range of income, the more the state second pension seeks to find ways to constrict and punish that flexibility. This is just so tremendously off message. Why lecture us yet at the same time punish flexibility?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not want to introduce a jarring note into the Committee but the first thing that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam should have done this morning was to apologise for voting against the biggest ever increase in child benefit before lecturing us about poverty and poor people. I do not wish to dismiss anything that has been said by the Opposition and I hope I can say yes to the very last words of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) about being reflective and flexible. I want to say yes to that, as we want to be as flexible as possible. We do not want to be hard and fast but to have a system that is workable. Many interesting points have been made this morning. I will probably wait until he comes back into the Room before I deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough.
<P>
I will never hold Opposition Members responsible for things for which they not vote, but as they are loyal members of their parties, we know that, had they been here, they would have voted, for example, for the cuts in SERPS, which the hon. Member for Bromsgrove did not mention. There were cuts in SERPS in 1985 and in 1995 that will come back to haunt them during our proceedings on the Bill. They take effect this April, which is why parts of the clauses that we shall discuss today and at our next sitting have to accommodate cuts that we cannot do anything about. I am not talking about inherited SERPS either. The last Government's record on pensions is not that good. I shall not even deal with the misselling,
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The Minister must recognise that if he resents what the last Government did to make SERPS affordable for the taxpayer, he is at liberty to change it and restore it to what it was.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is precisely what we are seeking to do partly through the state second pension. As anyone who has looked at the briefings will see, we are not considering increasing national insurance contributions to pay for it. They will be higher than they would otherwise have been, because of the cuts in SERPS. The Government actuaries report clearly shows what would have been the case. We are seeking to redress that for the low-paid.
<P>
I do not want to be derogatory about the amendments, which are a valid vehicle for raising an important issue, but for the self-employed there is a maximum of 43p a week as a result of the present anomalous position. Pensions for the self-employed are a wholly different issue.
<P>
The bottom line is that self-employed people are not included in SERPS. That is reflected in the payments that they make to the national insurance scheme. In the same way, they will not be included in the state second pension from the outset. I must add a caveat, as hon. Members will be aware that we conducted a consultation on whether they should be included in future. It is clear, as we shall see when we debate subsequent clauses, that state second pensions will be earnings-related for a few years—say five or thereabouts, although we shall debate that in relation to future amendments—and then go to a flat rate. They will not be the be-all and end-all from the outset.
<P>
We are still considering how the matter affects the self-employed, having already consulted on it. The issue is extremely complicated—that is not an excuse, but the reason why we have not introduced anything yet. We have not ruled anything out, as we must respond to the consultation.
<P>
Now that the hon. Member for Gainsborough is back, I shall deal with the matter that he raised. I almost intervened on him, as he made a proposal to scrap clauses 28 to 31 and replace them with a blockbuster Bill. That proposal was not in the amendments, so I am not briefed to speak on it. The kernel of his argument related to all categories of people, including the self-employed. As I said, we shall discuss the matter later.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a seductively simple case. We propose that anyone over the lower earnings limit who earns up to £9,500 will be treated as earning £9,500. He showed the other side of the coin and said that such people should be given all the rebate to put into a stakeholder pension. The matter is complicated by arrangements for the self-employed and what they get for their contributions. Matters will not be simple even with the state second pension. Obviously the figure of £9,500 will change over the years, and some people will be on a level between £9,000 and £11,000 during their earning life. What is the best thing to do if that looks like their long-term earnings? It is a moot point whether it is better to stay in the state second pension or, in due course, to opt out and take a stakeholder pension.
<P>
The Government actuary's report has an interesting graph, showing that under the state second pension there will be gainers all the way up the income scale to about £21,000 a year. There is no stop at £9,500, although the lower earners' boost makes that a cut-off. People earning less than that are automatically topped up to that level.
<P>
Notwithstanding the fact that the hon. Gentleman proposed a brand new scheme, we consulted on whether the self-employed should be included and we shall re-examine the matter, but it is highly unlikely that we will do that in relation to the Bill. I do not want to give the impression that we will reconsider the matter and tackle it on Report, but we must address it because, as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, work patterns have changed and continue to change. We must ensure that we can accommodate that, but it is not a simple thing to do and we do not want to rush it. We must remain flexible.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As hon. Members have said, there are some anomalies in the current SERPS scheme. Some self-employed people who also have earnings on which they pay class 1 national insurance contributions in the same year—normally the self-employed would pay class 2 contributions, so they would get the basic pension and not much else—may qualify for SERPS even when the amount of their class 1 earnings is below the lower earnings limit. That is certainly anomalous. We are not sure whether those people know that that is happening. I emphasise that the same does not apply to those who have been both self-employed and contracted-out in the same year. Paragraph 222 on page 57 of the notes on clauses states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This section''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, clause 28—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``has the effect of treating members of State Second Pension in the same way as those contracted-out by taking account only of their Class 1 earnings when calculating the amount of their State Second Pension entitlement or the amount of their rebate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, there is some consistency in the way in which the state second pension is operating for self-employed people who are in that situation.
<P>
There is a similar effect for someone who works solely as an employee; he must have annual earnings above the lower earnings limit before he earns any entitlement to additional pension. Of course, he will need that for his basic pension as well. Employees must be above that limit before they will earn any additional pension under SERPS or the state second pension.
<P>
There is a difference between the state second pension and SERPS. In the former, everyone will be treated the same way—the amount of state second pension will be based solely on class 1 earnings, which will need to be at or above the lower earnings limit in a given year to qualify.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham asked about the effect on other people and whether they had to claim for the whole year to qualify. With regard to child benefit, the invalid care allowance for carers and the disability allowances, recipients would need to be on them for the whole year to qualify, because the figures are calculated over a year. But for an earner, the only requirement is that the employee's earnings exceed the lower earnings limit of approximately £3,400. Those earnings could be earned in a short time; they do not have to be earned over the whole year. Thus, they do not have to be in for the whole year; they merely have to be above the lower earnings limit.
<P>
We want to achieve consistency for everyone, regardless of how they build up any additional pension. To continue with the anomaly, which we admit exists—I will give some more accurate figures about the people involved shortly—whereby class 1 and class 2 earnings can be aggregated would, under the second state pension, give the low earners boost to a group for which it was never intended. The low earners boost is a crucial—and expensive—part of the scheme. It will assumed that someone earning less than £9,500 actually earned £9,500. That low earners boost is a crucial trigger for helping the low-paid build up a better pension.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> If someone is working in the way that we are describing, on low earnings, both self-employed and employed, does the Minister concede that, as they could still be low earners, they should therefore be eligible for the credits?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Not in this case. We are trying to treat everyone the same for the state second pension, notwithstanding, as I said, that we have consulted on and are considering separately the issue of the self-employed. We do not want to build in more complicated arrangements than we need to. They are complicated enough as it is. However, I do not accept that the arrangements are massively complex, although operational matters, especially rebates, might be more complicated. The simplicity of the state second pension arrangements will shine through as the hours go by. Self-employed people who do as little as a week's employed work at the weekly lower earnings limit could have benefited from the low-earners boost, but that would have created a massive loophole.
<P>
The figure of 150,000 is our worst case scenario of the number affected. The shadow Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo), seems to have made another announcement: abandon all opposition and support the state second pension. He once wanted to be the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr, but we saw him off.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Did he stand for the Minister's seat?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, in 1983, but he does not talk about it much.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Let us stick to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Sorry, Sir David.
<P>
Our new, more accurate estimate is that approximately 68,000 people are in an anomalous position. About 18,000 people are high-earning losers and about 50,000 people have combined class 1 and class 2 contributions for SERPS, but their class 1 contribution is less than the lower earnings limit. Some people will move between self-employment and employment, so we are not dealing with a stable group—the numbers vary from year to year.
<P>
The amount of SERPS currently received by those affected is less than 50p a week. In fact, we are talking about a maximum of 43p a week, not a princely sum in anyone's calculations. I shall not play around with words—they are occasionally quoted back, whether from Green Papers, manifestos or whatever—people in that anomalous position will patently be losers. We are not totally convinced that they know that they will be losers. We are not wholly convinced that they understand what effect their class 2 and their bit of class 1 contributions will have in future.
<P>
We do not want that anomaly to continue under the state second pension, although it is not a cause célèbre; it involves 43p a week. We shall consider the self-employed separately. We want the arrangements to be level and based only on class 1 earnings at or above the lower earnings limit.
<P>
Amendment No. 166 deserves a response. There are some gateways to the state second pension. I freely admit that the idea is that the state second pension is tied to work. The bedrock is that it is a work-based benefit. It would be wholly anomalous if we were to create a gateway into the system for people who had not met a work test threshold.
<P>
For long-term disabled people to benefit from the second state pension, they must meet not only the qualifying criteria in a given year but the labour market attachment test when they reach state retirement age. In other words, for 10 per cent. of their working life since 1978, which will be a maximum of five years from 2024 onwards, they must have worked and paid class 1 contributions; so the state second pension includes a minimal work test because it is a contributory benefit designed to reward work. It makes no attack on disabled people and is not discriminatory. It is no more discriminatory than other work-based benefits. Provision is made for the state second pension for a group of people who would never get anything from SERPS and for a group of people who would have got peanuts from SERPS. As SERPS was earnings related, it was no good for the low paid. There is unquestionably a redistributive effect.
<P>
When we form a view about the self-employed in future, it would be appropriate to look at these things. If the self-employed were coming into the state second pension, we would need a set of technicalities, rules and gateways. Amendment No. 166 would allow periods of self-employment to count towards satisfying the work-based test for class 1 contributions. At present the pension is as anomaly free as we can make it, while being beneficial to specific groups. It is targeted and we make no apology for that. People who are above certain income levels will undoubtedly be advised to get themselves into a funded scheme as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister referred several times to the possible future inclusion of self-employed people. He also said that it is unlikely that that will be dealt with during the passage of the Bill. It would be useful, even if he cannot put a specific date on it, if he could give us some sense of the time scales, as they are clearly at the heart of the amendments. We are trying to establish how willing the Government are, and how soon they might make their proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I cannot be precise about that. It is now February and I would expect that to happen some time before the end of the year. We have consulted and one of the advisory groups is looking at the pension. We still have a lot of work to do. The work that has been done on the self-employed has been done without a Government commitment. Pensions for the self-employed and the effect of changing work patterns, compared with the post-war period, on the state benefit system and pension provision should be debated, but not on this Bill.
<P>
I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will withdraw the amendment. I hope that he will accept that I have shown some flexibility. I have not rubbished the hon. Member for Gainsborough. I have certainly corrected the hon. Member for Bromsgrove's description of the halcyon record of pension provision under the previous Government. We want to make this work for everyone so that there is a level playing field—that is a horrible phrase—but with class 1 contributions only bringing the benefit of the second state pension. Other matters will have to be dealt with in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. In his opening remarks, as he rightly said, he sounded a fairly discordant note to the start of our deliberations on pensions. I understand why he did so. I am sure that in his heart of hearts he understands the procedural reasons for our actions yesterday. Having said that, I look forward to seeing the press releases with which he threatened me and my colleagues. However, they may not beat the press releases that my colleagues have probably already issued.
<P>
I have listened closely to the Minister. We tabled the amendments to flag up a concern and to find out how the Government propose to address it. While the Minister's answer does not entirely meet that concern, it goes some way to addressing it and I hope that before the end of the calendar year the Government will be able to announce at least the outcome of their consultations. The definition of ``year'' is always rather vague: perhaps the Minister could clarify that.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I certainly did not mean a financial year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> One needs a dictionary to interpret terms used by Ministers, such as ``reporting in the spring'', and to know what they mean in practice. I am grateful for that clarification.
<P>
It was also useful to get clarification in respect of the figures and the number of people involved. The debate has been valuable in emphasising the fact that the labour market is increasingly flexible; patterns of work and types of employment, including self-employment, are changing. The Minister acknowledged that the statistics on the group of people concerned are constantly changing—it is not the same people for one year to the next. Apart from the discordant note struck at the beginning, his response was reassuring and I intend to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): The debate has brought into focus the difference between our approach, of delivering pensions to everyone in the UK, and that of the Government. The pensions system is in need of simplification but, whatever the Minister says, the Bill appears to complicate it.
<P>
Our debate has also brought some radical thinking, particularly from my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, on the pensions issue. We should reflect on his proposals, although I fear that they would not be appropriate in a Bill that makes life more complicated and ties more people to state provision and for which more taxpayers will have to pay. The debate also brings out the fact that it is hard to move away from the vision of long-term employment and into the much more flexible world that we all anticipate and to which the Minister referred. However, I am never convinced that the Government have grasped the realities of that flexible world.
<P>
In referring to the self-employed, was the Minister talking about people who are wholly self-employed, not those whom we tried to include in our amendments by the reference to class 2—those who move in one year between employment and self-employment?
<P>
The Minister said that he hoped to introduce proposals before the end of the year—which is what I assume is meant by the usual term ``shortly'', the word that the DTI uses about everything on which it consults.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Manana.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Manana is an extraordinarily good expression in regard to the DTI's use of ``shortly'', a period that seems to go on for ever—and we are still waiting.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that his reference was to self-employment and not to mixed employment and self-employment? The mixture concerns us, although I accept his point that only 68,000 people come into that category.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The sector of society that will be adversely affected by that are women, because they make up 60 per cent. of self-employed people, many of whom are on low incomes.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Indeed. My hon. Friend is right. Self-employed people who work part time have the least pension provision of all. The Government's proposals will reinforce the image of women living in poverty in retirement. No doubt the Minister will say that the Department will deal with those who are entirely self-employed, but I suspect that the flexible market to which reference keeps being made will not be recognised as we think it should be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> My hon. Friend will be aware that, according to the research paper on the Bill, only a third of women who work part time have occupational or personal pensions. Does she agree that they may be most affected by the measure that we are trying to correct?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Yes. My hon. Friend said that only 30 per cent. of women have pensions but, turned on its head, the more appalling figure is that 60 per cent. of women do not, They are most likely to move between employment and self-employment. It is unfortunate that it has not been made clear whether we are talking about entire self-employment or employment and self-employment.
<P>
Our amendments are devoted entirely to people who pay class 2 contributions. In the Green Paper, reference was made to the Martin Taylor report, and the Government acknowledged that, for people in mixed employment, class 2 and class 4 contributions would have to be brought together before class 1 and class 2 employed people could be brought into S2P. Perhaps that is too administratively difficult, but such an option was proposed on page 83 of the Green Paper. It is not one that the Minister has commented on, but we should like to know what the Government intend to do, so that we know whether it will be possible for people in mixed employment to benefit from S2P.
<P>
It is important for us to take into account the fact that those whom we are talking about will be on low income, in whatever form they receive it. The Library carried out some research for me. We must bear in mind the fact that the famous minimum income guarantee is—as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said—merely a replacement for the income support system that was in place under the Conservative Government. It will take until 2029 before the basic state pension and the state second pension are better than the minimum income guarantee. It will be nearly 30 years before anyone in mixed employment is likely to benefit from S2P.
<P>
If I received such an income, the last thing that I would want to do is to contribute to a pension. Living on £9,500 is not easy, even in the lowest cost environment in the country. People will not want to contribute to a pension when there is a family crisis, an extra bill to pay or the kids need shoes—a regular example that I cite. If they will not receive any benefit for nearly 30 years, that will seem a long way off when there is a struggle to meet the household bills.
<P>
The Government need to take a much more flexible approach to how people can provide for their pensions. We will certainly press amendment No. 161 to a vote, and I was not convinced by what the Minister said on amendment No. 166. Although I accept his point about disabled people perhaps being entirely self-employed, we still envisage a mixed market of employment.
<P>
I shall draw a simple example. Many disabled people become progressively more disabled. They may suffer from a degenerative disease. It is not difficult for many of us with experience of such cases to think about that. People will move in and out of the labour market as they feel capable. Someone with multiple sclerosis can continue in his or her job to begin with, but will have periods of disability as the MS attacks make it more difficult to stay in employed work. Perhaps he or she could take on a contract for three months or be a subcontractor for a period, and then become self-employed. That mixed pattern of employment will let such people retain their self-respect and income.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I ask the hon. Lady to be realistic. I gave the figures. There are 46 years between 1978 and 2024. Rounded up, 10 per cent. of that is five years, so someone would have to work for only five years of that time to pass the 10 per cent. rule For a work-based benefit, that is not onerous.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> But it can be exceedingly onerous for disabled people. That is the point. It again returns to the element of flexibility in the work market. The Government's proposal is to put people in straitjackets, but we should make everything as flexible as we can.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend will recall that last year we served on the Committee that considered a Bill in which certain changes were made with regard to disability benefits. The safeguard was to encourage people to take risks. Does she not think, by analogy, that that is precisely what we are trying to achieve? Why should that be worthy last year but derided this year? We are being consistent on the issue, and the Government are not.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> One of the problems of considering the whole pensions issue is that it is tempting to put everyone into the same straitjacket instead of creating possibilities. This legislation closes down opportunities. It is inflexible and unable to meet people's aspirations. We want to deal with the mixed pattern of employment in the amendments, and I want to put amendments Nos. 161 and 166 to the vote.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> This is more of a probing amendment, again reflecting our anxiety to ensure that the developing flexible labour market is provided for in the state second pension. I have a secretary who is over the age of 60. I continue to pay her national insurance contributions, but since her birthday she has not had to pay them.
<P>
The Committee has spoken a great deal about the developing flexible labour market, but so far we have not mentioned the fact that, broadly speaking, everyone is living longer, which is good, and living more healthily. A fundamental change has taken place in the structure of the population in the UK, and indeed in most of western Europe. In future, fewer people will be available to earn the money to pay for the baby boomers, of which I am one, after retirement age. That will create a huge problem, as fewer people will be earning money and paying taxes to maintain more people of pensionable age. That, indeed, was one of the fundamental reasons why SERPS was changed in the 1980s to allow people to make their own provision. The generational compact would be under huge pressure if people in work had to pay very large sums to pay state retirement pensions, Opposition Members are conscious that over time people object to increasing state taxation, and prefer to have the freedom to provide for themselves.
<P>
One of the ways in which people provide for themselves is by continuing in employment after the official state retirement age. Practically anyone who has been to a supermarket, and especially to BÿQ, which has a policy of employing retired people, will have seen lots of people employed who are clearly over pensionable age. They are, quite rightly, increasing their pension and income in order to provide for some of life's luxuries, keep themselves fit and interested and continue enjoying life. For many people, employment serves as the focus of their life. It breaks my heart to hear people who are about to retire say, ``The garden needs doing and the house has to be decorated.'' In a couple of years' time, many of them will not be terribly well because they will not have had an interesting, focused lifestyle to keep them fit and healthy.
<P>
As time goes by, more people will want to continue in work. What will our charities do then? More charities and voluntary organisations now pay their staff. More people are staying in the work force until retirement age, and those who are fit and healthy when they retire and who want to continue making a contribution would be happy to start a lower-paid charitable job.
<P>
As I understand the Bill, people of pensionable age and over will not be paying national insurance, and their contributions and their employers' contributions will not be taken into account when paying S2P. I know that that is the situation at the moment, and I am not arguing about that. Given that more people will go down that route, given that they will be in productive work and contributing to the economy, and given that many of them will be paying tax, I want to tease out from the Government why those people cannot continue to pay national insurance on their earnings if they so wish, and hence enhance their state second pension.
<P>
It would be sensible if the Government recognised the trend towards longer employment and the different forms of employment that are available. Although those people do not usually earn a huge amount of money, if they pay national insurance they will be contributing to the fund. We heard yesterday that the Liberal party would be happy to spend the surplus, but it is always useful to have a surplus. It would do no harm if people contributed to the national insurance fund in order to earn a larger state second pension and to improve their standard of living when they eventually retired.
<P>
It is a probing amendment. I should be grateful if the Minister could justify not encouraging people of pensionable age to pay national insurance contributions towards their S2P.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> A theme runs through this amendment and the previous group of amendments, which is to ensure, as best we can, that the state second pension meets the changes that we are likely to see in the labour market. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham admitted, we recognise that fact, but we know that things will change.
<P>
I snorted slightly when my hon. Friend spoke about BÿQ, because I remember the spotty youth who misdirected me to the ceramic grout last weekend. If a pensioner had done that, I should have wanted a little of what he had been drinking.
<P>
Things are changing. I recall that on finishing my A-levels, I took a summer job in Keighley council planning department. I recall that a couple of the building inspectors were of retirement age and that one wanted to continue in his post a little longer to try to maximise his retirement income. He had to go through an enormous rigmarole; it even needed a special resolution of the council.
<P>
The state second pension is meant to ensure that people on low incomes have that bit extra and are not pulled down into having to claim means-tested benefits. Given the nature of the minimum income guarantee to which my hon. Friend referred, it makes sense to ensure that people who make a conscious decision to stay at work beyond the current age of retirement can maximise their pension. It may be sensible for some people aged 60 or 65 years to retire, but it may not be so sensible for others. However, if people decide to stay at work, it is more than common sense for them to be able to maximise their pension.
<P>
The clause, as drafted, suits the present situation, but we must recognise that the next two decades will be a time of enormous rapid change to pension provision, and we want to ensure that it stands the test of time. We want to know the Government's thinking on this matter, and to ensure that we can meet the needs of people who decide to work beyond state retirement age and maximise their state second pension.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Although the amendments are probing amendments, they are very much on the right lines. The Minister helpfully said earlier that the Government wanted to be as flexible as possible, which is something that Opposition Members would applaud. The world is changing quickly. People are living for longer and the world will be a different place in 10 or 20 years' time. The Government's determination to be as flexible as possible is to be welcomed.
<P>
Our amendments are in line with our hope that the Government will be flexible. Many people, for all sorts of reasons, may wish not to retire at the official retiring age of 60 or 65 years, which is soon to be 65 years for both men and women. It is proper that they should be able to continue building up a pension provision. I am curious to know what will happen when the state retirement age for women is increased from 60 to 65 years and that starts to take effect. The previous Government were certainly nervous about announcing to women, especially of my generation, that they will be expected to work longer. However, we have not yet reached that time, because the legislation is to be phased in.
<P>
Such a decision had to be taken, however, because of the difference in life expectancy. It was made almost 10 years ago and, if life expectancy increases as we hope it will, given the advance of medical science, more flexible pension arrangements for people working after the official retirement age will be necessary Friends of mine are retiring at the age of 60. They enjoyed a good life while they were at work, but they now want to retire. They may have as much working life left in them as they spent at work. I presume that the age of 85 years, which is now the average life expectancy for women, will be pushed up nicely to at least the age of 90 in the next few years. Goodness knows how old some of us in the Room will be when we meet our maker. Whenever that is, it is a long time to spend out of the labour market on a retirement income set some years ago.
<P>
Inflation is mercifully low at the moment, but when it is compounded over the years, even at a low level, it eats into an income that seemed perfectly reasonable when the pension was taken out. Given that that income diminishes over time, and that things get more expensive as more options become available and we want to do more, an income that was reasonable at the time of retirement no longer looks after us comfortably as we grow older.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Because our health may be better than that of our parents and grandparents, we can do more and get out and about more. We want to run a car and go on holiday, and need an income to do such things. The Government must be flexible about operating pension policies so that people who take an intelligent decision to work beyond the state retirement age can build up pension contributions. If we are to grow old gracefully, and indeed grow considerably older than we once expected, it makes sense to continue to work until we feel that we cannot manage it. There is circumstantial evidence to suggest that people who stay in the labour market for longer, well beyond the state retirement age, tend to enjoy a better standard of health and perhaps, as a result of working, a better quality of life. into their older age. If we keep busy and mentally alert, we are only as old as we feel, not as old as we are. At least, we all hope so.
<P>
Making it as attractive as possible for people to stay in the labour market and continue their pension contributions is to be encouraged to help the individual and the state. As a result, the moment that they feel that their pension is no longer sufficient to maintain a comfortable life style gets further away. I hope that the Government will say something interesting about people being allowed the flexibility to continue to make pension contributions. They should encourage what is in most people's best interest, which is not being redundant at 65, but realising that their active life can continue far beyond that. It may be in people's interest to see matters in those terms rather than look forward to retirement age. As attractive as not having to get up in the morning is, having that luxury every day is not nearly as appealing. Staying in work and continuing to earn pension credits is to people's and society's benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson:</B> I was sorry to miss the beginning of the debate on the clause. I was encouraged by what my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove said, which brought home a personal point. My father is still working at the age of 69. I am not sure why he wants to do that, but it gets him out of the house. He does not earn a great deal. Indeed, I suspect that he is on slightly more than the minimum wage. We must wait for the Government's response, but my father would be rather concerned that his work would not benefit him when he ultimately retires.
<P>
I totally agreed with the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. He explained that, with such arrangements, no one owns their fund. Even if they do well, they do not necessarily get the benefit. That reinforces the point that my hon. Friend made. I hope that the Government will consider our questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I repeat what I have said throughout our proceedings: I am trying to be flexible, but I will not be revolutionary. Incidentally, that is my word—it is not written in my notes. The proposed changes to the national insurance system are revolutionary and are not part of the Government's plan in terms of the state second pension, basic pension, stakeholder pension, opt-outs, contract-outs and rebates—or whatever else. People past retirement age—60 to 65; moving to 65 for both sexes—who are still working are in one of two positions: either they collect their basic state pension, with whatever SERPS they have earned on top of their earnings, all of which is taxable; or they earn a decent wage that they can live on and do not draw their basic state pension but let it accrue, which at present they can do for five years at 7.5 per cent. interest. While they are working, they are not paying national insurance contributions because they are not accruing any more, except in the deferred portion; the employer pays secondary class I contributions—in other words, the employer's contribution—which does not in any way affect the pension of the employee, whether drawn or deferred. That is part of the national insurance fund of £50 billion a year, out of which the benefits are paid.
<P>
If that were not the case, one would say to employers either that they stop paying national insurance contributions, or use the money to affect the employee's pension. Administratively, however, it would not be possible to affect the employee's pension. There are more than 80,000 people above pension age who are working and thereby drawing employers' contributions into the national insurance fund, which creates around £500 million.
<P>
Nothing in the Bill changes that one iota. I am at a loss to understand why Opposition Members want that revolutionary change. If that £500 million were diverted by the Government Actuary toward the pension of the people concerned, it would be diverted away from the pool and the fund—in other words, it would have to be made up from somewhere else.
<P>
I hope that I have said enough to convey that it is not possible to attach the contributions to the individual's pension. The majority of people draw pensions; only a minority choose deferral because it is necessary to have a decent income on which to live. At present, the pension can be deferred for only five years. As part of the package that the previous Government introduced when the pension age was standardised at 65, it was arranged that, from 2010, deferral would be unlimited and would accrue interest at 10.4 per cent.
<P>
The proposal is administratively impossible; it would not be right to introduce it. The majority of people about whom hon. Members are talking are already drawing their pension. If not, they are deferring it out of choice and will get interest on it—an arrangement that has worked successfully for those who can afford to do it.
<P>
This has been an interesting debate; I am not quite sure why we have had it, but I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It is almost worth having a debate on all subjects. It has always been a mystery to me why people who do not draw their state pension and are in work cannot pay their own national insurance. There is no suggestion that employers should stop paying national insurance if they employ people over pensionable age. We did not expect the passion of the reaction that we received, but we expected the content of it. Given the way in which labour markets change, it is always worth exploring options and possibilities.
<P>
I accept that we do not have access to the expert drafting that the Minister has, but I hope that the drift of the amendments suggested that we were interested in people who do not draw their state pension, are over pensionable age, want to pay national insurance and could do so to enhance their pensionable entitlement. We are operating, as we always have done with the state pension, on a pay-as-you-go basis. It is not a funded pension, which is partly why some of us are concerned about the proposals. As the Minister said in the previous debate, that is not the point of the Bill and is perhaps a matter for future discussion.
<P>
We wanted to open up a debate about future patterns of employment. People will still be happily employed at over 65. In many cases, they may not be highly paid and there may be an uneven work pattern, which would be reflected in an uneven pattern of contributions to national insurance over the years. It is worth giving people the opportunity to contribute in their later years should they want to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> If that is the case, I have completely misunderstood the amendments. They are not about the employee continuing to pay national insurance contributions after retirement age, but about directing the employers' contribution to the employee, which cannot be done. I am astonished that the Opposition want people over 60 and 65 to continue paying national insurance contributions if they remain at work. That is what the hon. Lady is now talking about, but it was not in the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I apologise if the amendments are not drafted in such a way that the Minister could understand them. We were trying to promote a debate about people who are over retirement age being able to continue to contribute to national insurance if that is what they want to do. We thought that we had noticed that the Bill is unclear about whether income earned would contribute towards S2P. Having explained our amendments, I hope that the Minister will respond. We shall not seek to divide the Committee on this probing amendment, but it might be sensible for him to consider those points and write to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, I do not want to do that. I am perfectly happy to debate the amendment. I genuinely believe in this place. I may criticise the way in which we have to work, but I never criticise the tabling of amendments so that we can have a debate, whether probing or not. The amendments related exclusively to the employers' national insurance contribution, which I accept is a form of employment tax that goes into the national insurance fund. In no way does the employee continue paying any benefits, and I never dealt with that subject.
<P>
Employers have no upper earnings limit for their contribution, although employees do. Employees do not pay because they are over 60 or 65, as the case may be. I would withdraw the amendment if I were the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> As I said in moving it, this is a probing amendment. It is worth debating retired employees' contributions. I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 147, in page 24, line 18, after `year', insert `or part thereof'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 148, in page 24, line 19, after `year', insert `or part thereof'.
<P>
No. 149, in page 24, line 35, leave out `throughout the year' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in any week throughout-the year'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Now I know why I did not participate in the debate on the previous amendment, and why I sometimes believe that explanatory notes should be supplied with Opposition amendments, especially if others are supplying them. Sometimes it would be helpful to have explanations when we read amendments later and wonder what was intended. I hasten to add that that does not apply to the amendments to which I am about to speak.
<P>
The amendments are designed to clarify what the Government mean by the phrase ``throughout the year'', which appears in subsection (3)(2)(b)(i), and how other aspects of the crediting regime will work for making credits to the state second pension, especially for recipients of invalid care allowance, for whom that is the qualification for an entitlement to a contribution to the state second pension. The explanatory notes simply repeat the phrase, and do not amplify its meanings. For that reason alone, it would be useful to have a debate that will enable the Minister to put on record precisely what the Government intend.
<P>
The amendments would allow the weekly crediting of national insurance contributions. I know from written answers that I have received that the Government will say that that is technically impossible. I hope that the Minister will be able to expand on that and elucidate whether it is another consequence of the ancient and rigid computer architecture that the Government inherited from their predecessors, which makes it difficult for them to be flexible and responsive to that suggestion. Under the existing system, home responsibilities protection is given to a person caring for a—[Interruption.] These toys should be taken out of the Room.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> They can stay as long as they do not make a noise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Or move about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Of course, Sir David.
<P>
Home responsibilities protection is given to a person caring for a child or disabled person who fulfils one of the three conditions specified in the regulations. He must fulfil those conditions throughout the year or meet a combination of conditions during the year. The Government can therefore say that the provision is an established part of the system, and that the HRP regulations specify conditions that apply on the basis of being met throughout the year.
<P>
If the entitlement begins part way through the year, it is lost in terms of contributions and credits to the state second pension. For example, someone who starts to receive attendance allowance in May will receive no credits that year under existing home responsibilities protection conditions. Any earnings received during the year that are less than the lower earnings limit cannot be combined with home responsibilities protection. A recipient of invalid care allowance who develops a health problem and must claim incapacity benefit would not qualify for contributions under the state second pension as specified in the Bill.
<P>
I should like to describe a case that sums up one of the dilemmas about how the clause will work in practice, as opposed to the worthy principles that the Government espouse and we support. Elsie is a carer; she has a son, David, who has multiple disabilities, severe learning disabilities and physical disabilities. From time to time, David goes into respite care to provide a break for him and Elsie. Because of the linking rules, she becomes disentitled to ICA after her son has been in respite care for 28 days. As a consequence, she begins to be affected by the problem of how the qualifications for contributions to the state second pension work. That period of respite is a chance for her to recharge her batteries and recover. She cannot necessarily return to the workplace to try to earn a salary because she is too exhausted.
<P>
The respite care is not provided on a regular basis and when David comes back home, he needs 24-hour care and attention. Consequently, Elsie does not have a full year's contribution record and thus under the Bill she does not have the right to a contribution to a state second pension, so she cannot look forward to that entitlement; and yet she is providing substantial care and support of the sort that the Government and the Liberal Democrats wish to encourage and support.
<P>
In a sense, Elsie will be making a choice between the respite care that she desperately needs for her son and herself, and the possibility of a state second pension later in her life. That is the choice that the Bill appears to set up. Another option is for Elsie to go to work and make arrangements for her son to be cared for in residential care, at a greater cost to the taxpayer and also, potentially, at a greater cost in terms of David's institutionalisation and a lower quality of life for him.
<P>
That is the practical reality of the way in which the qualifications for entitlement to a contribution to the state second pension will work for carers, and it is why there should be greater flexibility. We have tabled the amendments to ascertain whether the Government are willing to consider making the entitlement and the gateway more flexible for more people. Far too many carers will be caught by this provision; because of linking rules, the lower earnings limit and other earnings rules, they will be disentitled to something to which they are clearly entitled. I hope that the Government agree that they should be entitled to it. Are they willing to explore ways of achieving greater flexibility, whether by weekly credits, increased accruals rates or some other device that will better reflect the care burden that many people are shouldering and will go on shouldering, but which the clauses as drafted do not address?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I find it difficult not having constituency cases to draw on, as I did for the earlier part of the Bill. My advice surgery has certainly not been inundated by constituents complaining about or drawing my attention to the limitations of the pension arrangements in this clause. However, it is interesting to speculate on the effect of these provisions on people who have come to see us for different reasons.
<P>
I want to talk about a couple of constituents who came to see me about other matters. As a consequence of examining the problems that they had with, say, respite care or gaining access to a special residential school for children with autism, I have become aware of their wider circumstances. In view of what the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said, I am concerned about whether they will qualify for the state second pension, but I am sure that the question has not yet occurred to them. There is a perception out there that the new pension arrangements for carers will be much more generous than the home responsibilities protection arrangements for the existing state pension. I suspect that they are not correct in making those assumptions. We might be missing an opportunity to deal with some of the limitations that currently pertain in respect of home responsibility protection.
<P>
I draw the Minister's attention to the case of a widowed father who cares for his autistic child. The child is beyond the age of childhood, but he attends a residential school near Totton in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis). The father takes on casual employment during term time, but his earnings are below the lower earnings limit. When the child comes home for the holidays, the father manages and cares for him full time. I am worried that the father will not qualify for the state second pension, despite the fact that he is now balancing his responsibilities for caring for his dependant with seeking employment when it is appropriate for him to do so.
<P>
The second case to which I want to refer concerns a lady who came to see me about her profoundly mentally handicapped son. I use that term deliberately. It is not appropriate in this case to refer to a learning difficulty. The boy is profoundly handicapped. Caring for that child is a 24-hours-a-day occupation. However, there is an expectation and a provision of respite care. It is available for a few days a year; it could be well in excess of one month. It is not always predictable, however, when that respite care will be available. Is it proper to expect that lady to work when it is? After all, that period is supposed to be one of respite because she is exhausted by the process of caring.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am receiving further and better particulars, but to avoid the hon. Gentleman getting deeper into the matter, I must inform him that, subject to the number of days of respite, the lady would not lose the invalid care allowance. Under the Bill, she would still be a carer. She would not lose the right to a second state pension. I have never met a constituent who has had 28 days' respite, but we are checking the rules. There are rules for holiday and respite within the invalid care allowance system, where the carer remains a carer. That will be covered by the Bill. I wanted to emphasise that, because of how the hon. Gentleman was developing his argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> That is reassuring. I was not saying that that would not be the case, but I was concerned that a loss of invalidity care allowance would result from the respite care and I feared that that would affect the right to the second state pension.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I listened to what the hon. Gentleman said with great interest and also to the Minister's brief intervention. I look forward to hearing more on the subject. The Government's national carers strategy has encouraged the development throughout the country of more respite care. An opportunity begins to be presented of more hours of respite care. If there is a potential anomaly in the Bill that may become a practical anomaly as a result of the Government's initiative, let us hope that they will seriously consider the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an effective point. He called for greater flexibility. Throughout the Committee stage, Ministers have shown that they are prepared to be flexible. I am concerned about the concept of ``throughout the year''. I wonder whether we should not move to a more flexible weekly consideration. I know that it might create an additional administrative burden, but it would be more just in providing for the nature of the commitments and life styles that carers endure. I nearly said ``enjoy'', but endure is a more appropriate word. That would not depart in principle from the existing arrangements. It is now quite proper to mix weeks of jobseeker's allowance with weeks of employment for entitlement to pension. I do not see why the same flexibility cannot apply for those who have to care for handicapped dependants.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West for illustrating so clearly some of the problems that people with a caring role may have in future. That is not to deny that they do not have such problems now.
<P>
The theme that has emerged in our debates is that the state second pension should be flexible. A number of examples have been given. Age Concern and the Carers National Association brought the matter to our attention, and the Fawcett Society is also concerned about how legislation affects women's lives.
<P>
I would be interested to find out why it is so difficult to give it a weekly consideration. However, I wonder whether the Minister would consider a six-monthly consideration. Family credit and the working families tax credit are based on a six-month period. The withdrawal of invalid care allowance, too, is based on a six-month period—[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is making faces at that suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I was reacting to a conversation that was taking place on the other side of the Room about the nature of the amendments, and not to what the hon. Lady was saying.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It is always interesting to pick up fag ends of conversation.
<P>
The Minister might care to consider the six-month option. The six-month rule on the working families tax credit and ICA is a problem for many people. They come to our surgeries complaining about the inflexibility of the system, but a six-month period could help the Minister if a weekly credit is administratively impossible.
<P>
The world is developing new patterns of work, and more people need care. It is a credit to our national health service that so many children are alive today. Doctors' medical skills allow them to keep children alive, despite problems at birth and despite the horrific motor accidents and the other problems that they suffer. An increasing number of carers have to shoulder an ever-increasing burden, and they rely increasingly on benefits. The Government wish to recognise their sterling work through the pension system. It would be rewarding if those people knew that their state second pension could be credited each week for the weeks and months that they spent caring. We heard of several examples of people being able to gain weekly credits for the state second pension only if it is done on an annual basis. At present, flexibility is built into the system for someone caring for 48 weeks a year. Like the Minister of State, I can say that people have not come to my surgery saying that respite care is freely available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I said 28 days.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> People are not even coming to my surgery saying that 28 days of such care is available. Indeed, sometimes it is a battle to get a week, two or three days or even a regular afternoon. However, we are not talking about credits for afternoons: we would not take credits for S2P down to a third of the day. We want more flexibility throughout the whole system of state second pensions proposed by the Government. It would help enormously if the Government told us how they intend to build more flexibility into credits for state second pensions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I pledged myself to remaining emollient and user-friendly throughout the passage of the Bill. However, the nit-picking and the fundamental attack that we have endured would lead anyone to think that the Bill did not bring new help to carers. An extra 2 million carers will get pension entitlement from the Bill. Two million long-term disabled people will get into a pension system, which must be compared with what we inherited. Let us put aside the nit-picking of pressure groups who, nevertheless, have an important role to play. Of course, people are saying ``We want some more.'' Weekly assessment, however, is impracticable.
<P>
People would be required to go from annual assessment to weekly assessment. We would be asking every employer in the country to put their national insurance contributions for a named person into the system on a weekly basis. Building up pension entitlement weekly would involve 52 times more calculations than are made at present and would break the computer. Indeed, such an arrangement is administratively impossible.
<P>
Amendments 146 and 147 reveal an anomaly, as they would allow someone to satisfy the low earners criterion. We must always bear in mind the low earners boost. Once someone is above the lower earnings level of approximately £3,400, he or she will be automatically credited as if they had earnings of £9,500, which is an extremely valuable boost. However, the amendments would result in people with earnings between the lower earnings level of £66 and £9,500 in one or more weeks being treated as if they earned £9,500 in the whole year, even if their earnings for the whole year were less than the lower earnings level. That would be a nightmare.
<P>
Such a provision would be unfair and would impose an insupportable burden on business. There would be a revolution if we asked industry to send in weekly returns of national insurance contributions.
<P>
I am always happy to receive advice. The hon. Member for New Forest, West raised an important matter, as I pointed out. If, for example, a person caring for an autistic child worked while the child was in residential school, he or she would not qualify for S2P. That would depend on the circumstances, but such people could probably earn more than the lower earnings level during the 30-odd weeks in term time. Once they earn more than that earnings level, even if they earn £4,000, it is automatically assumed that they earn £9,500, so they would come within S2P.
<P>
The same objections would apply to six-monthly assessments, because we are not changing the way in which the earnings factors are calculated. I apologise for the length of the clauses, but hon. Members who read clauses 28 and 29 will realise that they relate to the legislation that governs SERPS and that we are reforming and enhancing SERPS for low-paid people and carers. We are building on the system of earnings factors on which SERPS operates now. Those earnings factors are based on national insurance contributions over a year because annual calculations are much easier to administrate.
<P>
Up to eight weeks' respite care in a full year, or four weeks' respite care and eight weeks' hospitalisation over 26 weeks, will have no effect on the state second pension. I do not know whether there is a minimum or maximum period. In other words, some flexible rules have been built into the invalid care allowance for hospitalisation, holidays and respite care.
<P>
We want to do more for carers and we shall make announcements in due course, but I assure the Committee that, whatever proposal we introduce to help them, we will not undermine the beneflts that we shall give them under the Bill. We shall ensure that the proposals are joined-up.
<P>
If we accepted the amendments, we would have to revise the basis on which we calculate additional pension—the technical term for SERPS and S2P used in legislation. I just cannot get my head around the idea of doing the calculations on a weekly basis; it would mean calculating 52 times more than we do now. It is not a question of paperwork—the calculations are based on information technology and contribution records. However, such calculations would involve not only keeping weekly records of contributions but recording the accrual of pensions on a weekly basis. That would break the bank and the computer. We could not deliver any decent form of second pension in those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I understand the point that the Minister makes about weekly calculations, but will he deal with the points that have been made about six-monthly calculations, especially given the fact that precedents exist, such as incapacity allowance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, I have a note on that.
<P>
This has been am extremely useful debate, if only to clarify the position in respect of respite care and invalid care allowance.
<P>
The same objections apply to six-monthly calculations, simply because that would overturn the system that we are building on. We are not inventing a system of earnings factors; it already exists for SERPS, and it is based on annual factors. Six-monthly calculations would burden employers and Department of Social Security systems significantly. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Beckenham has discussed those matters with employers. We would still receive complaints if we calculated on a six-monthly basis.
<P>
I do not deny that carers who look after for someone for several years will lose out if that person dies 11 months into the year, but that could happen at five and a half months or six months. Hon. Members will understand, from examples in other walks of life, that there will always be difficult cases at the point of the break.
<P>
