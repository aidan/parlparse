<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 1, line 14, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(bb) to establish a register of groups and individuals who can act as mediators:".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment refers to the Parades Commission's powers, under clause 2, to promote and facilitate mediation. The amendment is lifted almost verbatim from a recommendation in the North report chapter 12.47 on page 144 which states:
"we recommend that the Parades Commission should contribute to the development of mediation through establishing a register of groups and individuals who can act as mediators, and itself work with other bodies in practical ways to support mediation."<P>

<P>
Clause 2(1)(b) states that one of the duties of the commission is
"to promote and facilitate mediation as a means of resolving disputes concerning public processions."<P>

<P>
What is meant by mediation? The dictionary definition refers to the involvement of intermediaries, without direct connection, to act as go-betweens or peacemakers. Will the Minister tell the Committee how the wording of that subsection meets the requirements of the strict definition of mediation, and also how it meets the requirements and recommendations of the North report?
<P>
Do the Government believe that the reference to promotion subsection (1)(b) would involve the commission in approaching various groups and foisting mediation on one or more non-receptive parties in a disagreement? Does "promotion" mean that the commission will have its own team of professional mediators on permanent standby? That was a point made by the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) during our sittings last week. The Unionist point of view was that, in some circumstances, the present wording of the clause could mean that certain parades and groups of organisers might have mediators foisted on them from a section of the community that they found unacceptable, even though the mediation might be necessary.
<P>
How would a team of professional mediators be selected? The dictionary definition of mediation notes that it is "without direct connection". In the context of the problems that we are considering, can the Minister tell us how to find people in Northern Ireland without direct connection to one side of the argument or the other? It is extremely difficult, as I know from my experience as a Minister. When we were appointing quangos, there were problems, which continue today, in finding people who were acceptable to a broad base in Northern Ireland. There were criticisms within the Unionist community that we often overlooked people with a Unionist connection, because the Government felt that such appointments would send the wrong signals or that those people would have too much vested interest in a particular direction.
<P>
Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland often accuse the Government of the day of seeking to place Alliance party supporters or people of no political affiliation into important positions on quangos rather than attempting a broad-based political solution. I recognise that it is an almost intractable problem and that the only solution lies in proper political and democratic accountability. Like the previous Government, this Government are keen to move towards that as quickly as possible.
<P>
Clause 2(1)(b) will give the commission powers to get involved in a hands-on and direct manner. The commission, as it is currently constituted, may not wish to become so involved and Ministers probably do not intend it to do so. However, my reading of paragraph (b) gives me the impression that it could get involved directly if it so chose. That runs counter to the recommendations of the North report.
<P>
Part B of chapter 12 of the North report refers to the commission's important education role in encouraging the two sides of the community at a local level to understand each other's perception of parades. Education in itself will not necessarily bring about the desired outcome, so the report refers to the commission's second important role, which is that of facilitating mediation. Paragraph 12.38 of the report states:
"It is clear from the submissions made to us that there is undoubtedly a huge network of goodwill which can be tapped."
<P>
The consultations that Dr. North and the other members of his team undertook revealed that there was a feeling in Northern Ireland that mediation was important and that a large body of people would like to be involved.
<P>
The existence of such good will is borne out by the Northern Irelandwide survey that the report instigated. Two questions were asked. First, people were asked whether it would definitely be a good idea to involve people in mediation. In response to that, 37 per cent. of Protestants and 61 per cent. of Catholics that is 46 per cent. of the overall population said that it would definitely be a good idea to involve people. Secondly, people were asked whether such involvement would probably be a good idea, and 38 per cent. of Protestants and 32 per cent. of Catholics that is 36 per cent. overall said that it would. If we add together the figures of 46 per cent. and 36 per cent. for the overall population, we find that 82 per cent. of the people consulted in the Northern Irelandwide survey were in favour, to varying degrees, of the commission having a responsibility for mediation. Members of both community groups support mediation.
<P>
The North report asked further questions about mediation. It did not answer all of them, but I hope that the Minister will take account of them when he responds. The report asked whether groups or[Mr. Malcolm Moss]
individuals should become involved in mediation and whether it should be organised by central bodies or through local efforts. It asked also what training needs there were, who should supply them and how they would be funded. Finally, it asked what other bodies had a similar interest in developing mediation capability.
 <P>
It is clear that the North report did not envisage a direct, hands-on approach to mediation. Indeed, the report states at chapter 12.44
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We doubt whether the Parades Commission itself would need to develop a professional mediation capability amongst its own staff."</FONT></UL>
<P>
However, clause 2(1)(b) allows the commission the freedom and powers to become directly involved in a way that I believe the North report did not intend. The amendment spells out clearly the need to set up a register and thus is a more direct development from the recommendations and a clearer interpretation of the intention evident in the report that mediation should not be centralised in the commission. It will be difficult and problematic enough to appoint people without centring that task on the commission, with its other roles.
<P>
The amendment would also allow the scale of the problem to be set into context more easily. We discussed during the previous sitting the number of difficult conflicts between various parties with respect to parades; the figure is probably something like 20 out of 3,000. Even if that number were doubled to 40 the scale of the problem would be fairly minor in the overall context. Vast numbers of mediators and a new structure would not be needed if mediation were really to be used in cases of genuine disagreement, when the commission proved unable, through its education role, to move the process forward to the point where both sides in a dispute accepted an outcome.
<P>
Setting up the register is important and the commission should have a role in doing that. It should be mindful of the question of scale the number of likely occasions for mediation in the parade season. It should also be mindful of the method of selecting for the register people who would be acceptable to both sides of the community by virtue of their standing there and their impartiality and non-sectarian bona fides.
<P>
In some ways this is a probing amendment. I want to tease out the Government's real intentions and their interpretation of the important provisions concerning mediation. I want to know how they envisage the provisions being implemented and how they believe the North recommendations about mediation can be carried out under the current wording of the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. William Ross </B>(East Londonderry): The amendment is very interesting and touches the heart of the thinking behind the Bill. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) said that it was a probing amendment, and I am happy that he put it thus because that means that if he withdraws it after hearing the Government response, we may perhaps return to it on another occasion. It raises a series of interesting questions.
<P>
You will recall, Mr. Butterfill, your strictures on me in the previous sitting when you said that I was speaking to amendment No. 80. The elements of the Bill are so intertwined as is always the case but perhaps more so in the present instance than most that it is almost impossible to keep one's remarks strictly within the confines of one amendment. The amendments hinge upon one another. Therefore, members of the Committee sometimes stray from the amendment under discussion and, in the words of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, try to tease out the Government's thinking.
<P>
In column 75 of last Thursday's Hansard report, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Given the difficulties, it is inevitable that the commission will not do everything right in the first year" [Official Report, Standing Committee B, 15 January 1998; c.75]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In view of the serious consequences that could arise from that, the Minister clearly hopes that the commission will have the ability to select people who will get things right most of the time. Such people will have to be acceptable to the community that we are discussing. They may exist in Northern Ireland, but they are few, and they will not come from among those who take the sort of stance that might be acceptable to people on this side of the Irish sea. We are considering a different culture, a different society and different ideas. We are dealing with people who are not, ultimately, arguing about the power to go up and down a road, but about whether the Union Jack or the Irish Tricolour flies over part of the United Kingdom or part of the Irish Republic. That background should guide the commission when it deliberates on the issues that we are considering.
<P>
The Minister knows the consequences of a bad decision, such as that to move Billy Wright in beside members of the INLA. The consequences of that became horribly clear in the past few weeks, not least yesterday, when two deaths occurred in Belfast. There are indications today that such actions are not haphazard.
<P>
Which individuals and groups have been approached? How are they selected? There are only 15 or 20 contentious parades. Half a dozen commissioners, in ones, twos or threes are perfectly capable of dealing with matters, but the Government are apparently leaving the door open for all sorts of people to act in such a capacity. That is the clearest possible indication that the Government expect more than 15, 20 or 30 contentious parades. What is happening? Clearly, money is currently being expended. Sums are being spent on civil servants who run around the country to talk to people, and on telephone calls and postage.
<P>
The money resolution states:
"for the purposes of any Act resulting from the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill [Lords], it is expedient to authorise the payment out of money provided by Parliament of any expenses of the Secretary of State incurred in consequence of that Act."<P>

<P>
However, the Bill is not yet an Act. Does the resolution cover the expenditure before the Bill becomes an Act; or is the Secretary of State currently spending money under different legislation? That is an interesting question. There is bound to be some expenditure. I may be wrong and the Government may not yet be embarking on this step, but we must be told what is going on.
<P>
We must also be told who is involved when people are approached to be possible mediators. What qualifications are sought among those individuals; do they need a university degree in mediation, conciliation or what? How will they be selected? What steps will the Government take to ensure that the right sort of people are appointed? What information will be made available about the groups of individuals involved in mediation? Clearly, they must be acceptable throughout the community.
<P>
We are dealing with an entirely new and different situation so a training programme must be devised. At the very least, those involved must be given a crash course: how are they to deal with the sort of people who go out murdering yesterday, for instance? We must remember that we are dealing with the IRA and possibly with other terrorist organisations. We must ensure that mediators have a clear understanding of the sort of people with whom they will have to work.
<P>
How will the Minister ensure that the mediators appointed will be acceptable to all parties? Will they go along to meet Mr. Rice and say, "I am very sorry, but you have got it all wrong about Mr. Graham. The truth is that Mr. Graham is acceptable to you but there is a slight misunderstanding in your attitude to him. He is going to do exactly as you say next time and make himself acceptable to you." Does the Minister really believe that that will change Mr. Rice's mind when he has said that he has no intention of talking to Mr. Graham?
<P>
Will the minds of people living near Garvaghy road be changed whey they have said that they never want to speak to that woman again after the events down that road last year? The Secretary of State is unacceptable to people living near Garvaghy road and the chairman of the commission is unacceptable to people living near Ormeau road. Yet these are the people who will have to find individuals who will be acceptable to leaders of the IRA, to opposition groups and to people taking part in parades and processions. That will be a difficult task.
<P>
If people are to spend their time taking part in these activities, salaries or payments of some kind must be made to those who are selected. That being so, we must surely be told who those people are, how they will be selected, what qualifications they must have, how much they will be paid and what training programmes will be in place for them? What understanding will they have of the individuals and institutions with whom they will have to deal? They will also need to understand people's background, circumstances and culture.
<P>
It all amounts to a major task, and I want to know how it will be done. The Minister mentioned the commissioners as public servants they have to be read in this context as one and the same but they will not get everything right in the first year. I would prefer it if they did not learn by too little experience and if they were more in touch with feelings on the ground.
<P>
I reiterate that the work should be done by the commissioners. These will be the great and the good selected to do the job. They believed that they were capable of carrying it out or they would not have taken it on. The resignation of the Rev. Magee suggests that at least one person had serious concerns that the shift from an advisory role could make matters worse. Others are bound to have considered the consequences that could flow from a wrong decision.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order The hon. Gentleman knows that this is a fairly narrow amendment but he is straying fairly wide towards a debate on clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I am always grateful for your guidance, Mr. Butterfill. These debates tend to widen somewhat  [Interruption.] The Minister laughs, but if the Government had had the wit to keep Mr. Wright away from the Irish National Liberation Army the situation in Northern Ireland would not be as it is today. Perhaps the Government will now stop laughing and start listening: when they do, perhaps there will be less violence and bloodshed on the streets. We are seeing, first, the police and the Government shrugging off their responsibilities on to the shoulders of the commissioners, and, secondly, the latter shrugging off their responsibilities on to others.
<P>
As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, inherent in these measures is the certainty that people other than the commissioners will be appointed and paid. The entire mediation process is glad that judgments will be made on the merits of cases, but what will happen if people do not judge on the merits of an argument?
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned opinion polls. As we know, the outcome of opinion polls depends on the questions asked, and the way they are asked. Many people respond to opinion polls from their own assumptions and not to the question asked of them. In this instance, people seem to respond on the general assumption that there is a genuine grievance about the annoyance caused, or insult offered, although we know that that was not the basis of the question.
<P>
That being so, we are asking mediators to examine carefully the position on the ground, to talk to people about very emotive issues and perhaps to talk to one another. We are also demanding that these folk go among opposition groups and speak to one another. The Minister knows well the difficulties inherent in any Unionist talking to Sinn Fein. In the talks process, the former Prime Minister said that it would turn his stomach to talk to Mr. Adams. It seems strange that the same structure does not apply to the current Administration yet it applies to the streets of Northern Ireland. Whenever we consider establishing a register of groups to act as mediators, the question arises, "Will they be mediators or will they simply say to the local Orange Order, `you've really got to go to talk to these gentlemen'?" Are some Unionists expected to walk down the street to talk to those whom they know have been involved in terrorist activity and have served long prison sentences for everything from murder down?
<P>
Is that what we are asking people to do? Will the mediators talk to everyone concerned and then make their own value judgment on the issue? What will happen? Who will be selected? Where is this leading? This is a probing amendment which asks questions to which we should receive reasonable, sensible and carefully considered answers.

<P>

<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): This is a good amendment. One of the difficulties with the Bill relates to the independence of the mediators. We have been told that the commission comprises individuals who are completely neutral and independent and who can therefore take decisions. However, their decisions will be based on the recommendations of mediators who are not part of the acting commission. It naturally follows that those who are involved in mediation and who will make recommendations to these independent commissioners should themselves be seen to be independent.
<P>
The amendment goes some way to establishing that. It refers to a register, which we would welcome. Presumably it would be a public register so that the ordinary man in the street could see who these people are, where they come from and their background and thus ascertain their independence. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry said, there is the question of their qualifications, their experience and their training. That is important because only if people can be assured of the complete independence of these mediators can one trust the advice that they give the commissioners which they ultimately result in a determination. For those reasons, support the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> I fear that if I try to deal with some of the detailed points made by the hon. Member for East Londonderry I would stray out of order. Perhaps I could deal with just one of the specific points that he made about the tragic murder of Billy Wright and its consequences. Twice the hon. Gentleman said that Billy Wright was in the INLA part of the prison: that is fundamentally not true. He was in a segregated wing of a separate block. Part of the reason for the separation of the LVF from other Loyalist prisoners was the death threats against Billy Wright from another loyalist group. That is the situation which the prison authorities had to deal with and which we inherited. That is why we are setting up two detailed inquiries under Mr. Narey and HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Sir David Ramsbotham to examine just what happened after the escape of Liam Averill and the death of Billy Wright. I do not think that I need go into greater detail; I do not want to further the debate of this.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We do not want too much of a debate on this matter. It is not before the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was concluding my remarks on that, Mr. Butterfill. As it was mentioned twice, I thought that I should put over response on the record.
<P>
Other valid points were made by the hon. Members who spoke on the amendment. The amendment is important, because it is consistent with a specific recommendation in the North report.
<P>
The drafting of a Bill is not merely a matter of taking everything in an in-depth report on an important and difficult issue and putting it into legislative form. That is not easily done and it is not always the best way forward. However, it should be clear that the Bill tackles the big and important issues examined by the North report.
<P>
On the issue of mediation, I hope that everyone agrees that local accommodation is the best way to deal with contested parades. It cannot be denied that some parades are contested on legitimate grounds by people in the community. There have been violent scenes in recent years but the vast majority of parades by the loyalist orders and those in support of the Republican cause pass off fairly peacefully because there is a fair amount of mediation involving a range of personalities and organisations, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
<P>
We are trying to introduce a much more constructive basis for mediation, dealing with issues such as who does it, what role mediators will have on the ground and how they have been trained. We hope that that will give mediators more impetus in dealing with contested parades.
<P>
As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, we discussed mediation in a previous sitting. Several amendments were tabled on how mediation should be encouraged. The hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) tried to separate the role of mediation from the secondary function of the Parades Commission. It would not be appropriate to return to previous debates, but we have explored some of those matters in that context.
<P>
Mediation is a matter for the Parades Commission. If we are over-prescriptive and try to define the term too much, it will remove the commission's flexibility in trying to achieve its objective of being accepted in the community. It has to have the flexibility to take acceptable decisions that will lead to less contention between groups, one of which claims the right to march, and others which say that a parade is an unacceptable intrusion in their area.
<P>
Mediation is difficult. The responsibility to determine whether to allow a parade to proceed, to re-route it, or to make any other judgment about a disputed parade, does not disappear merely because there is a Parades Commission, but such a body will allow us to proceed.
<P>
The Parade Commission's view is that it will try to facilitate mediation through a system of authorised officers who work under the auspices of the mediation network. They have already begun to gather information and build contacts with key people in areas where parades have been contested in the past.
<P>
I am surprised that the hon. Members for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) and for East Londonderry are not aware that such work has already been done. It was carried out even before the Parades Commission was set up, in an embryonic way, and 
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that we did not know about that work. We suspected that it was going on but nobody told us. There has been nothing in the press, to my knowledge, which sets out the circumstances and the limits within which such work is done. May we at least be told more about it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was saying that mediation was going on anyway. At a point of potential conflict, people of good will on both sides of the community try to reach agreement and consider matters on which there could be mediation. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman is not aware of that. Whether it is reported in the press is neither here nor there. We do not always have to get our information from newspapers.
<P>
I am equally surprised that hon. Members who represent the Ulster Unionist party have not contacted Alastair Graham and the Parades Commission to ask about their suspicions. If the Bill is enacted, the commission will have responsibility for such work. I would assume that as representatives of their community, hon. Members who represent the UUP and who have suspicions would want to make contact to ascertain what is happening. They should not wait until a Committee is considering proposed legislation. When work is already being done on the ground, why not speak to those who are taking that process forward?
<P>
It is right to ask a detailed question, but there is nothing to stop the hon. Gentleman speaking to the Parades Commission and I encourage him to do that rather than living in a world of perceptions and suspicions. If he speaks to the people involved, his perceptions and suspicions may be laid aside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The reverse may also be the case. Perhaps the Parades Commission could contact us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If the hon. Gentleman was organising a disputed parade, he would be contacted. As I have said, the Parades Commission functions in an embryonic way at present and it is making many contacts in the community. I take note of the hon. Gentleman's point; I shall ensure that the chairman of the Parades Commission makes contact, and I hope that there will be good spirit on both sides. If hon. Members have suspicions and anxieties, they should listen to our explanations and not merely rely on the press or rumour as sources for their perceptions and thus their accusations.
<P>
I considered whether the register of mediators, recommended in the North report, should be in the Bill. It is a difficult question because once a register is drawn up and names are on it one must consider whether they should be the only people upon whom the Parades Commission could call to mediate in given circumstances. My fear is that such a restriction might be place upon it by others, although I do not say that that is the intention of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, whose argument is in line with the North recommendations.
<P>
We step back from that recommendation and accept the principle of giving maximum flexibility to the Parades Commission to deal with difficult circumstances. If someone suddenly materialised who was acceptable to both sides in a disputed area, and the Parades Commission could draw only upon those on the register, it might mean that that person was precluded from participating in mediation. It might be argued that only those who were on the register, who had been trained and who were known to those in the community in which where there was a dispute should be at the point of contact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. The thrust of my admendment was that a register would be fluid as it would be set up and reviewed annually. Those who are asked by the commission to act as mediators would have to be acceptable to both parties, otherwise there could be no mediation. It is important that the public should know who those people are. Having a register would mean that the matter would be in the public domain; people's names would be known; they would have given curricula vitae and their bona fides would be established. If someone turned up who was acceptable, he or she could go on the register immediately. I do not ask for a prolonged selection procedure, merely that the list of names should be made public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am not against that suggestion. The answer to the question why the register needs to be in the public domain is that the mediators deal with those who are at the point of conflict. They would be known by virtue of the fact that they were mediating between those with whom agreement was being sought.
<P>
The circulation of a register may be of interest, but it will not help mediation merely because it is in the public domain. As the hon. Gentleman said, it will help mediation only if a mediator is acceptable to both sides. However, it does not necessarily have to work that way. There could be a mediator working on one side and another mediator working on the other side.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Mediation can take many forms. It will be a dynamic process that will be developed by the Parades Commission, which, as I have said, will be on a learning curve as it enters the marching season. It is a new venture and the commission will learn from it. If the Parades Commission is too prescriptive its capacity for flexibility might be contained and that would not help it in what it is trying to achieve.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the main thrust of the argument of the hon. Member for Nort-East Cambridgeshire and to his amendment, not least because it is included in the recommendations of the North report. However, we should examine the possibility that the work of the Parades Commission would be made more difficult as a consequence of the amendment. That is my main concern.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I have been following the Minister's argument. If there was a register of the names of all the mediators, parade organisers could be told by the commission that Mr. Joe Bloggs, whose name was on the register, would mediate. The organisers would then have some idea as to who was coming. They could look at the register and would know what type of people the mediators were, and would know that they were acceptable. If there was no register, and organisers were given the name of a mediator that was unknown to them, they could not accept that that person would be completely independent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> They could accept the person because the appointment would have been made by the Parades Commission. [Interruption.] Hon. Members accused me of laughing earlier. I do not know why the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) is laughing at that. The Parades Commission is charged with the duty to[Mr. Ingram]
mediate, to facilitate mediation. Its responsibility, therefore, would be to ensure that those engaged in that process meet the kind of criteria that has been requested by the hon. Gentlemen. There would be no point in the Parades Commission choosing someone who would take an antagonistic or an aggressive role towards those with whom the commission wanted to mediate. If that situation were to arise, the person would have been badly trained, or the wrong selection would have been made. That relates to my earlier point about learning curves, which was translated as being that mistakes would be made.
<P>
I said earlier that the commission would be on a learning curve. People might be appointed to undertake different functions of the commission, and some of those people might not be able to fulfil the objectives for which they were appointed. The commission would then have to tell such people that they were not performing the functions that they had been asked to carry out because of antipathy from one side or both sides in the discussion. Those people would have to be withdrawn and perhaps would no longer be used as mediators anywhere in Northern Ireland. The Parades Commission must have that flexibility. It will not reside with the Minister, because no Minister could undertake such detailed administration. The overall expertise will rest with the Parades Commission, and mediation will take place through authorised officers, operating in the name of the commission. They will be properly trained and resourced, and, hopefully, acceptable in the role that they will attempt to undertake. That is the best way forward.
<P>
I am not against the spirit of the amendment. I am prepared to examine it again as a result of the arguments advanced by hon. Members, but I ask the Committee to consider the importance of flexibility. That is why I do not agree that the Bill should include a provision for a register. It would be too prescriptive. It would not simply be the case that the commission would add a name to a list. Where would such a list be published? The hon. Member for East Londonderry said that at least those who were sent a mediator would know who the mediator was. I cannot envisage a situation in which there would not be previous contact. It would not be a case of someone coming in out of the cold and knocking on doors, saying, "Let me in because I am here to mediate". The commission could not work on that basis. It could not achieve its objectives if it expected individuals to perform in that way.
<P>
The thrust of what the Parades Commission is trying to achieve and its approach to its business will involve points of contact with those organising what might become disputed parades and with those organising against them. The points of contact will involve many sources within the community, which do not necessarily need the pre-approval of the hon. Member for East Londonderry. They need approval from the wider reaches of the community with whom we are trying to mediate.
<P>
I am mindful of the points that have been made and I am prepared to consider the arguments further. On that basis, I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> You will not be surprised, Mr. Butterfill, to see me on my feet again. The Minister wondered why I laughed. If he does not know, he does not know with whom he is dealing. The plain truth is that the Parades Commission is not acceptable to a large proportion of the people in Northern Ireland. It is treated with extreme suspicion across the Unionist and loyalist community. That is why a mediator appointed by the comission must be acceptable to the mass of the Unionist population never mind, in the light of what was said, to Mr. Rice and company.
<P>
The Minister did not tell us much. He suggested that the RUC had mediated in the past, but we are all aware of that. The RUC took decisions and had to enforce them. When it mediated, it was frequently able to arrive at sensible conclusions. My experience of these issues extends over most of my lifetime and, with the police, I have been involved in dealing with them. I know that such mediation took place.
<P>
The Minister told us that work on mediation is currently going on and he poked fun at us for not knowing about it. No one told us anything. The commission is supposed to be under the Minister's control and the Government will provide it with money. However, we have not been told how much is being spent or how it is being spent. We have not been told about methods of recruitment, what sort of people will be appointed or what sort of training they will receive. We are entitled to answers about the authorised officers or about who will form a sort of moveable feast.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that the proposals for mediators were fluid. That is self-evident. However, we need to know who will be part of that fluid group. It is clear that my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) will not be appointed to one area, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire to another and someone else to a third just because they are available. People for an area will be carefully selected. Does that imply that one small religious or social group or cult will be selected for one geographical area, or will a widespread group be chosen that spans the spectrum of opinion in Northern Ireland? Where will the mediators come from? If the names of the mediators are not made public, how will the Government, the police and, above all, the commission know that those selected for a particular area are acceptable?
<P>
We need more information than we have been given. The Minister said that he would consider the amendment, and I am glad of that. However, before we return to the matter on Report, those of us who want to consider the issue more closely should be given more information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I thank the Minister for the way that he has considered the amendment. In the light of his remarks, I am prepared to withdraw it. I hope that he will give proper and detailed consideration to what I am trying to achieve.
<P>
May I have another three penn'orth? It is likely that many of the small group of people whom the commission names as mediators will be unacceptable to one side or the other. That means that the commission will need to draw on a long list of people so that it can provide people who are acceptable. The commission cannot be terribly prescriptive or selective because, in some cases, people might surprisingly be acceptable to both sides of the equation. There may be some people who, in the normal scheme of things, would not be considered but who could come along on the day, put themselves forward and do an excellent job.
<P>
The register should have a large number of names on it and the commission should be free to dip into it as and when it needs. That is preferable to a small group of people within the commission itself, ordained and selected by the commission, who are not in the public domain. As we have heard, one community is deeply distrustful of the entire Bill. Anything that can help to build bridges and break down the barriers of mistrust is a sensible way forward.
<P>
When I talk about the register being in the public domain I mean it in the sense that those who are mindful to oppose such a scheme in principle can at least see the names of those people who can be considered for the role of mediator. That is an important role but in the end mediation will only succeed if two parties come together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman A. Godman </B>(Greenock and Inverclyde): The hon. Gentleman is an expert on these matters. Does the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service have a public list of mediators?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I do not know and I am certainly not an expert on these matters. I am approaching this issue from the point of view that here is a great problem in Northern Ireland. It stems essentially from the deep distrust felt by the two sides of the community. If the Bill is enacted and part of it is deeply distrusted by one section, we will have failed as legislators to achieve what we set out to achieve.
<P>
This recommendation is in the North report that was prepared by Dr. North and his team. They thought about it very carefully and said that they doubted whether the commission should have its own in-house team. In other words, if it does not have that, it will have a list of people on whom it can call and who can demonstrate some expertise in this area. Why not publish that list and have it in the public domain?
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ross:</B> In a real sense these amendments carry on from where we have just left off. The same questions are raised in much more specific terms in this group of amendments. For the past 25 years the previous Administration and its predecessors made it their basic duty to ensure that there was fairness and proper representation across the board in Northern Ireland. There is an enormous amount of legislation. There are all sorts of bodies which are dealing with the question of fairness and proportionality in Northern Ireland. It is essential that that is written not only on tablets of stone but seen to be carried through.
<P>
I am trying to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland, and especially those who are most affected by the Bill have some confidence that their point of view is being represented fairly within the membership of the commission. Our previous debate was about the possibility of having named individuals and the necessity for those to be acceptable. However, the amendments concern a body that will be at arm's length from the investigators on the ground. The commission will take decisions based on the arguments of officers. The amendments are intended merely to stress that the membership should represent the Northern Ireland community.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have proportional representation in some elections in Northern Ireland. We had an abomination of an election for the forum. It did not matter, of course, although some people immediately walked out and wanted nothing to do with it. The Government ensured that those who commanded 1 or 2 per cent. of the population and could not get elected were still admitted to the forum.
<P>
We have proportional representation in local government elections and for the Northern Ireland Assembly elections will everybody win then? and the Government are now introducing similar legislation for elections in Scotland and Wales. Everything is being done to ensure that the membership of those bodies is representative of the communities that elect them. I have grave reservations about all forms of proportional representation and I know that other hon. Members feel the same. I have particular hopes concerning the prospect that the Government will apply that proportionality to councils, committees of councils, committees of elected bodies in Northern Ireland, the present forum or employment bodies. There is also the question of broad religious grounds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Godman:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman's amendment embrace membership of Orange or masonic lodges? What of the Chief Constable, who is advised by senior officers on matters relating to processions and marches? Presumably he would want to know whether those officers had such affiliations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I have no objection to that. I do not see why anyone should be ashamed to publish the full list of the organisations to which he or she belongs. That is the point that I am making by my amendment. Those people should have to make matters public. If the hon. Gentleman wants to table a further amendment on Report to widen the scope of my proposal, so be it. I should be perfectly content. I am not a freemason. I am a member of he Orange Order, the Apprentice Boys, the Unionist party and my church. I have no objection to those facts being well known to the community. I have published them time and again.
<P>
If someone is a member of the Irish National Forresters organisation about which I know nothing, except that it exists the Ancient Order of Hibernians, or even of Sinn Fein, the IRA or the UDA, let us publish the lot, and know with what we are dealing. The more information and openness there is, the better for that which we are planning.
<P>
A voice from the Labour Benches has expressed agreement that what I have outlined is a good thing, but 
<P>
<B>Mr. Godman:</B> First, the hon. Gentleman must learn to address his remarks to the amendment that we are debating.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I will decide whether the hon. Member for East Londonderry is addressing his remarks to the amendment. The hon. Gentleman knows that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Godman:</B> Yes, I do, Mr. Butterfill, but I was offering the hon. Gentleman some advice and pointing out that simply by asking him 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman was offering advice to the Chair by proxy and I will not have that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Godman:</B> You are right, Mr. Butterfill. I simply wanted to tell the hon. Member for East Londonderry that my asking him a question does not suggest in any way that I agree with his argument or his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> That is surprising. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was asking whether I would have any objection to the relevant information being on the list of affiliations, and I do not. Am I to understand that the hon. Gentleman does have objections to people telling us whether they are or have been members of terrorist organisations Orange Order or whatever? I have none: it would be a good idea; it is what people are asking for.
<P>
The Government have been insisting as have previous Administrations for donkeys' years on fairness and proportionality. Now we have the concept of open government. The amendments powerfully endorse the demand for open government and make it clear that in such a sensitive domain, it is essential for the relevant knowledge to be made available to the general public especially for those who are most directly affected by it.
<P>
The question of proportionality comes into play. Perhaps the Government will object to the greater number of Unionists on the commission: I do not know. If so, will the Minister tell us? If the Government do not object, will the Minister tell us who actively reflects that position? The Government may tell us that the Bill deals specifically with loyalist parades, so how are we going to reflect, in the privacy of committee proceedings, what that element of the community believes? Who will reflect the views of genuinely concerned residents, who may not be of only one political or religious persuasion? We do not know.
<P>
A group of people are being selected God knows how on the basis of criteria that have never been published. An important and sensitive task is being undertaken so we need to know all about it, open government being the cry of the day. Why cannot we be given a clear understanding of precisely who these individuals will be?
<P>
Earlier, the hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Mr. Godman) drew attention to the role of ACAS. Appointing a chairman whose roots lie in industry and who has experience of solving industrial disputes may not be enough. We are not dealing simply with an industrial dispute but with matters of economics and social well-being.
<P>
ACAS will be fairly well known to those involved in the negotiations. ACAS conciliators will be experts in the field and recognised as such over a long period. They can bring a form of expertise that is clearly understood by people on both sides of the argument. However, in Northern Ireland, we are dealing not with an industrial dispute but a political dispute about the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. The failure to recognise that has been the problem with legislation. In that context, I am suggesting that we should apply to the commission the simple standards of proportionality that have been laid down by Governments over many years.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 asks simply that the membership is
"representative of the Northern Ireland community".<P>

<P>
Is that true at present? Where is the evidence for it? I see no sign of any such evidence. That is why the body is so unacceptable to so many among the Unionist community.
<P>
There is also the question of quangos and proportionality. When it comes to various other bodies, it is a question no longer of proportionality but of merit. If the Government select, they do so on merit: everyone else must select on religious affiliation. There are two different standards. Are we to assume that this desire to conceal names, membership details, and political and religious affiliations for example, membership of the Orange Order, the Apprentice Boys, the freemasons or Sinn Fein is an effort by the Government to apply merit rather than proportionality of representation? Is representation being set aside so as to appoint those whom the Government decide have merit, on standards which they alone will determine?
<P>
My amendment No. 7, which I have touched upon, relates to making public the names and religious affiliations of members. However, the name John Smith does not convey much to anyone because there are thousands of John Smiths. The name William Ross would not convey much, although it might make some people think that I had been appointed when someone from 50 miles away had been. Perhaps there should be addresses as well so that appointees are known.
<P>
It is difficult to know for sure what a person's political affiliation might be, but there can be a perceived political affiliation. Religious affiliations however, have been lessening for many years. Individuals could simply be asked. Religious affiliation, which, of course, is always perceived, is always useful, but we could go beyond asking whether a person was Protestant or Roman Catholic and ask whether someone was Presbyterian, Free Presbyterian or even Muslim. Publication of such information would be interesting and people would know who was acting on their behalf. They could then decide themselves whether the people appointed had knowledge of the relevant matters.
<P>
Persons and bodies will be able to recommend people as members of the commission. Perhaps these bodies should be indentified. It is always of interest to know why a person's name has been put forward. In this context, we know that in the past it has been claimed that names put forward and accepted for various bodies in Northern Ireland were of individuals who had had an input into decisions to ban parades. This might be an opportunity for the Government of the Irish Republic to recommend a person for membership of the commission. If that happened, the people of Northern Ireland should know about it: people should be made aware of what the Government are doing in their name or perhaps not in their name, but to placate others.
<P>
There is no good reason for the Government to reject my three amendments. They would ensure, first that membership was representative; secondly, that names, addresses and political and religious affiliations were made public I am quite happy about that, in the interests of open government and, thirdly, again in the interests of open government, that the Minister made public the identity of the persons or bodies recommending people for membership of the commission. These aspects are important if there is to be confidence building in the commission.
<P>
Given that current members of the commission have been in post for some time, perhaps the Minister does not know who recommended them, or how they were selected. However, he must have some idea of how he will select people in future, in order to achieve the balance on which the Government insist for other, much less controversial measures.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Of course, the last two amendments, Nos. 121 and 122 rehash three earlier amendments, but would also provide for publishing the professions and public positions held by the appointees. There is a suspicion in Northern Ireland that some Government appointees get on to several different quangos, and make a lot of money out of it. It is suspected that those individuals, who get a lot of money from Ministers and depend on them for appointment and reappointment, are more than willing to carry out the Government's wishes. I am sure that the perception is wrong, because the men and women are of the highest integrity and are appointed on merit and would not allow financial rewards to influence their decisions on sensitive matters. However, the suspicions remain. Not everyone in Northern Ireland will share my cold-blooded view. Therefore, making appointees' qualifications clear to the public is the only way to ensure that their standing is not undermined. It should also be made clear whether they have been considered worthy of appointment to serve the public in Northern Ireland in other ways. There is no reason for refusing to make such information available.
<P>
Amendment No. 122 requests the curriculum vitae of staff, and the education, community background and religious affiliation of each individual. It would apply the same criteria to commission staff as those that are applied to any other body. Councils and other organisations have to supply such information. However, a distressing policy provides that organisations have to supply a breakdown of employment only for the body as a whole. As the Minister knows, that can conceal grave imbalances in one grouping in a specific sector of an organisation.
<P>
We are considering a small group, and it should not be difficult to provide the information that we seek. If the amendments were accepted, the body might gain a measure of acceptance that it currently does not enjoy.
<P>
I am curious to find out why the Minister omitted those vital requirements from the Bill. If he objects to publishing the information, I hope that he will provide detailed reasons for his views. Public perception is all; it is the vital element. I look forward to hearing the Minister say that the scope of the Bill will be widened to encompass the point made by the hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde, and that he accepts the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Eddie McGrady </B>(South Down): I am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the amendments. The most benign attitude that one can take to the thought processes that lie behind them is that they are designed to help the establishment of the commission.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have not formally proposed the question, so I shall do that.
<P>
Question proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> That mechanical alteration will not deter me from pursuing my argument, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
The most benign interpretation that one can put on the amendments is that they intend to help the establishment of a commission that is generally acceptable to the variety of communitiesusually described as twoin Northern Ireland. However, methinks that, notwithstanding the honeyed words of the hon. Member for East Londonderry, that interpretation does not truly reflect the true driving force behind the amendments. In fact, they would make it much more difficult to create a reasonably acceptable commission in the north of Ireland.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 is not necessary. A statutory provision is not needed to ensure that the representatives on the commission reflect the various communities and aspirations. It goes without saying that, if the commission is not representative, it will not be acceptable. It would be a foolish Government who made representation on the commission lopsided. By its very nature, it will have to be representative of the community generally. It does not require a statutory obligation to do that.
[Mr. McGrady]
<P>
Representatives of the community must be persons of high integrity and impartiality. However, they will, as they must, emanate from some community, and they will carry the baggage of their upbringing and education with them. Therefore, impartiality will be difficult to attain, but it will not be impossible to appoint people to the commission.
<P>
In a previous sitting, the hon. Member for East Londonderry automatically referred to one member of the outgoing commission as being tarnished and contaminated simply because she came from a community with which he does not agree. If that attitude were common, we would never have a commission. We must all accept that the commission must reflect a broad cross-section of the community.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 would make the names of the commission's members public. The names will be made public, so I query the need for statutory obligation. The community of Northern Ireland is relatively small; it numbers about 1.25 million. The seed, breed and generation of anyone appointed to the commission will be known down to the last detail within minutes of the appointment.
<P>
It is not possible to be dogmatic about political affiliation. Is it determined by card membership, what one does in a secret ballot at the polls or by expressions that are heard in public? These are not the proper bases on which to appoint a person to any position.
<P>
As the hon. Member for East Londonderry suggested, religious affiliation is a matter of some difficulty. Fair employment legislation refers to the need for political affiliation to be disclosed, but it contains a provision dealing with perceived religious affiliation, if a person does not provide that information. It is not appropriate to have a statutory obligation. It is not even necessary, as a person's perceived religious affiliation would be known immediatly in the community in which we live.
<P>
Amendment No. 8 proposes that the identity of the persons and bodies who have recommended the names of members of commission should be made known. That has no great or immediate political and public interest, if the persons appointed to the commission are of the calibre that we would hope for and expect.
<P>
Amendment No. 121 proposes that, among other thingsincluding religious persuasion, political affiliation, profession and details of public appointmentsthe Secretary of State should publish details of the community background of members of the commission. How can community background be statutorily determined and defined? It does not mean anything. It is a subjective description. We know what is meant by the words, but to have a statutory obligation to assign someone to a community background is very dangerous and not appropriate to the circumstances in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The most amazing of all the amendments in the group is No. 122, which relates to the commission's staff. They would be additionally burdened by having their curricula vitae exposed, with the publication of their educational and community background, and their political and religious affiliations. I am not aware that this happens in any other area in Northern Ireland. When he moved the amendment, the hon. Members for East Londonderry said that councils have to comply with such regulations. All the councils that I know treat files containing the personal details of their staff with the utmost secrecy and privacy. That is right and appropriate. There is no requirement to publish such information about the civil servants servicing committees. Why would it be appropriate for the commission?
<P>
The amendments are not driven by a benign influence; they contain a series of possible entrapments, designed to make appointment and acceptability much more difficult in a community in which it is already hard to convince people that any impartiality exists. I ask the committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
If we take the most benign attitude to the amendments, the absence of any statutory requirements or obligations from the legislation would not diminish the desirability of having a broad cross-section of honest men or women on the commission. They should be as impartial as possible and yet representative, because those are the qualities that the commission will need if it is to work effectively.
<P>
I commend the hon. Member for East Londonderry for his latest conversion to proportional representation. I hope that he will take it up in other forums. I remind him that the forum elections, on which he cast aspersions, were strongly proposed by his party.
<P>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendments because the more difficulties that we put in the way of the appointment of an acceptable commission, the more difficult it will be for the commission to do its work and the more difficult it will be to establish a working relationship. Against the backcloth of what we have suffered during the past 24 or 36 hours, God knows that anything that contributes to our coming together in normality and hopefulness is very precious to us.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): The hon. Member for South Down said that the most benign interpretation of the amendments was that the hon. Member for East Londonderry was trying to be helpful and was promoting the Bill's acceptability. I believe that those were his words.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that he did not believe that such a benign interpretation was the driving force of the Bill because, if passed, the amendments would make the commission less acceptable. I find that argument a bit rich from a member of the hon. Gentleman's political party. Time and again we hear calls from the nationalist community and the SDLP for equal representation in virtually every area of public, and sometimes private, life in the Province. They call for equality in housing, in employment, in the allocation and distribution of public funds, and in representation on quangos. It is inconsistent with the political views expressed by nationalist representatives that the hon. Gentleman should say that the exception should be the commission, which must be cloaked in anonymity. That argument is unconvincing.
<P>
I listened carefully to the hon. Member for East Londonderry; there is considerable strength and merit in the amendments and I shall speak briefly in support of them. I hope that the Government will listen carefully to arguments for the amendments and take note of the theme that underlies them. There should be no illusions: the proposal is extremely unpopular among a large part of the community in Northern Ireland. It was greeted with cynicism and widespread hostility and there is little confidence in it. There is a perception, right or wrong, that it is a disguised means of assaulting the rights of the Loyalist orders to assemble and march. What is needed, as in so many other aspects of life in Northern Ireland, is an injection of confidence in the Government's good intentions that the proposed institution will work. That would be achieved if they accepted the amendments.
<P>
It is entirely reasonable that the commission should be representative of the community of Northern Ireland? Why should it not be? Why should not that be in the Bill? In the light of the political climate in Northern Ireland, it is entirely reasonable that the public at large should know the political and religious affiliations of those who serve on the commission, which has to conduct such sensitive work. It is utterly reasonable that those individuals and organisations that promote others to become members of the commission should have their identity revealed so that whatever machinations there may have been behind any recommendations are out in the open for all to see.
<P>
To reduce my argument to simplicity, I say merely that there is great strength and merit in the amendments and I urge the Government to consider them extremely carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I support the amendments. The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) gave substance to the argument for them; membership should be representative of the Northern Ireland community and their names and as much information as possible about themfor example, their political and religious affiliationsshould be known. We are now in the age of transparency, and we are supposed to know what is going on in government. We are supposed to know what lies behind some of the decisions that are made and it therefore seems perfectly reasonable that we should know as much as possible about the members of the commission.
<P>
It is possible, however, that we might not know something about some members. There is an anonymous member who is on the police authority; we have not been able to find out who he or she is. The identity of anyone who serves on a public body in Northern Ireland should be public knowledge. He or she should not hide behind some form of anonymity. It is therefore essential that everything known about these people is revealed as well as about those who recommend them as members of the commission.
<P>
I understand that under the iniquitous Anglo-Irish agreement, southern Irelanda foreign countrywill have the right to nominate people to the Parades Commission. If it is seen that anyone who is appointed has been nominated by the Irish Government, it will be the immediate kiss of death. We do not accept for a moment that a foreign country should have the right to suggest who sits on any commission or any body in Northern Ireland.

<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> My hon. Friend will appreciate that if we do not have this information, it will be asked whether certain individuals have been appointed at the behest of the Irish Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> That is a very important point. If we do not know, assumptions will be made when we see the names. It is therefore important that there is as much knowledge and transparency about the members of this commission as possible.
<P>
The fact that we move amendments does not mean that we accept the principle or content of the Bill. The Bill is being imposed upon the people of Northern Ireland without the consent of their elected representatives. The Government have decided that that is the way forward. We reject the Bill, and during its passage we have to seek to make it as amenable to us as possible. But at the end of the day the Bill is rejected by the people of Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Anthony Worthington.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington):</B> I have not been called that, Mr. Butterfill, since my mother last spoke to me.
<P>
The amendments are basically about the representativeness of the Parades Commission. The key statement made by the hon. Member for East Londonderry, and I hope that I paraphrase him accurately, was that this is a political dispute and that the sooner the Government recognise that the sooner we shall make progress. I think that that is a fair summary. He also talked about putting people on the commission to represent "our own interests".
<P>
The Government realise that this is a political dispute. We are seeking to depoliticise, to take this issue out of politics and to create a body that is concerned not with representing sides and political dispute but with the competing rights to which the North commission report referred.
<P>
The North commission report and the great majority of people in Northern Ireland, as shown in the public opinion poll, recognised that an independent body was needed to move away from the "My side, right or wrong" approach into an area where the right to free assembly was recognised but without it being taken so far as to damage the interests of others. The issue needs to be taken into the realm of competing rights.
<P>
Mercifully in Northern Ireland there are many people who set aside the personal and the issue of representing "My side, right or wrong." That was acknowledged by the hon. Member for East Londonderry. He said that there were many men and I am sure he meant women as well of "the highest integrity and merit" in public life. Frequently such people when they accept public appointments would not want to be classified as one side or another. These amendments are trying to force people into compartments to represent the interests of that community. We are walking a tightrope. We are trying to ensure that the body is representative of the full spread of people in Northern Ireland and their interests without making it into a political body by appointing them on the basis of their political or community affiliation.
[Mr. Tony Worthington]
<P>
I shall deal first in detail with amendments Nos. 7, 8, 121 and 122, and later with amendment No. 6 The guidelines laid down by the independent commissioner for public appointments in Northern Ireland provide for the names of people appointed to public bodies in Northern Ireland to be published together with information about those persons' political activities, in so far as they are a matter of public record, and information about other public appointments held. I can assure the Committee that the Government will comply with these guidelines in the case of appointments to the Parades Commission where, as with other public appointments, the merit principle comes first. It is not community affiliation or political background that comes first, but merit for the post.
<P>
Obviously, in order to ensure that there is balance, we need to take into account community background and religious affiliation, but that is provided in confidence for monitoring purposes only and is therefore not published. We do not, for obvious reasons, ask candidates about their personal political views nor would we consider doing so. As was pointed out, that would set precedents for a range of other public bodies. We would not want to go down that route.
<P>
Applications to the Parades Commission, as to other public bodies in Northern Ireland, are made on merit to ensure that those appointed have the necessary competence to do the job. To make known, as amendment No. 8 proposes, who nominated people to such bodies would be incredibly complicated. In many instances one would not know that this was done formally. Once again, it is part of a route that we do not want to follow. We are trying to take the process out of the realm of "Our side, right or wrong" and into the realm of community rights. Making known in addition the names of those who suggested the appointees to the commission is going in the wrong direction. We can see little purpose being served in publishing the information and we urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 122 is about the staff of the Parades Commission but accepting it would be a retrograde step. Publishing the names, backgrounds and community affiliations of people in the UK civil service would undermine the principles on which it operates. The Minister of State and I deal with civil servants all the time: their backgrounds are irrelevant; what we measure is the quality of the advice that we receive. Publishing information about their community backgrounds, religion and so on would be damaging.
<P>
We should also remember that in the Northern Ireland context many people do not want personal information to be made available to others: they view it as endangering them and that has to be respected. We are effectively setting up a quasi-judicial body to make determinations and cause mediations: politicising that process would be wrong.
<P>
I can be more encouraging to the hon. Member for East Londonderry about amendment No. 6. We agree that the Parades Commission will need a geographial spread and a community and gender balance. We have no difficulty with the principle behind that amendment. Balance is clearly desirable and we shall seek to achieve it whenever possible. We shall therefore consider the matter further with a view to tabling an appropriate amendment at a later date. In view of that assurance, I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> The Minister has made some interesting remarks. I am pleased that the Government have recognised that it is a political dispute, but the Minister failed to point out that the politics arise from the constitutional dispute over Northern Ireland whether it is part of this kingdom or part of a foreign state. That takes the issue far beyond the limits of the normal political disputes that take place in the House how the health service should be run, how much money should be spent on defence or a hundred other social and economic issues. That is why I stress that it is not only a political but a constitutional matter.
<P>
People who oppose parades are often on the street not because they are annoyed at what is coming down the street but because they want to make it appear to the eyes of the world not only that Northern Ireland is not well governed but that it is not a viable entity. If the Minister is half way to recognising that, I hope that he will take the final step and accept the accuracy of what I have said. If he does, he will have a fuller understanding and will be more inclined to listen to our sensible arguments.
<P>
The Minister dealt with the issue of competing rights. Such rights do have some place but the issue is not being fought mainly on the merits or otherwise of such rights but over the first matter to which I drew the Committee's attention earlier in my brief remarks.
<P>
The Minister also said that I was seeking changes to ensure that the interests of each community will be represented and that each interest group will have some of its people involved. If so, I should like to clarify my aims. I am trying to ensure that the real concerns of communities can be put to the commission in a way that they presently cannot be put.
<P>
On amendments Nos. 7, 8, 121 and 122, the Minister told us that the Government would comply with the guidelines and the merit principle. He did not, however, tell us what the decisive merits would be for appointment to the commission. Perhaps, we could have a word on that.
<P>
The Minister took amendment No. 6 to mean that representatives would be decided according to geographical spread and gender spread. I am sorry that he is translating it in that way. If [Interruption.] The Minister shakes his head. If he is translating the matter into political and religious terms, we might look again at what he says and what the Government may come back with at a later date.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will take account of my words in this important debate. However, in light of what he said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 1, line 22, after "proposed", insert "any new".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: amendment No. 20, in page 2, line 1, after "of", insert "a".
<P>
No. 21, in page 2, line 1, after "proposed", insert "new".
<P>
No. 171, in Clause 10, page 6, line 16, after "proposed", insert "non-traditional".
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The Committee will be aware from what I said earlier that I am deeply concerned that all existing processions will be brought within the ambit of the commission. It seems to me that some processions have been picked out deliberately to create points of confrontation on the streets.
<P>
The amendments would, as far as possible, remove existing processions from the compass of the Bill, so that it would encompass only those that are new. There are strong reasons for doing that. I do not want to dwell on my experience of these matters, but I must point out the North commission is aware of this that processions by various Loyalist bodies follow a set pattern.
<P>
For example, the Black Institution parade takes place in one area once every 47 years, which is a remarkably long time for the celebration to come round. That happens because of the organisation's structure, the size of the groupings within it and the location of halls and meetings. Although other factors are involved, those constraints mean that the organisation visits each of its district in turn. In some areas, it may be back within 10 years, but it returns to the area I mentioned after 47 years and to another after 49 years. Those are long cycles, and some people see the procession in their village at most twice in their lifetimes.
<P>
The Nationalist population might think that a procession has not taken place for donkey's years, but that does not mean that it has ceased to take place. There is a long cycle before it returns to a village or town. Most cycles are much shorter than that parades are usually held every three to five years and some major processions are held annually.
<P>
Some processions follow a long cycle, but they are held regularly. New processions have also been created, and I shall come to them. My concern is that all processions or parades are covered by the Bill. The Government and many others have often said that there are only 12, 15, 20 or 30 possibly contentious processions. Anyone who knows anything about Northern Ireland knows that that is not true if one considers what could be contentious.
<P>
The concerned resident groups that have sprung up in Northern Ireland in recent years, which Mr. Adams told us were two years in preparation and I think that that process is continuing were set up not just to allow people to express their alleged anger, but to cause confrontation. They have in many cases been associated with attacks on Orange halls. Some halls have been burned down my own has been burned down twice in the past 30 years, the most recent occasion being two or three years ago. Dozens of Orange halls have been attacked. I was told by some Belfast Orangemen about an Orange hall in an area that had changed its character. A digger and a dumper turned up one day and took it away. Gone. Nothing left.
<P>
The issue that we are dealing with is not about minor assaults involving a few folk sitting in the street, but a co-ordinated campaign intended to lead to violence and confrontation, and heaven knows what horrors to follow.
<P>
Bellaghy is a place that I formerly represented. It is now represented by Mr. Martin McGuinness and it was the scene of several confrontations. Some time later an unfortunate official of the Gaelic Athletic Association was murdered as he left the association premises one night last May. The local Protestant population rang me up and said, "Willy, no Protestant shot that man. That was a decent man." Some of us took the view that perhaps it was a botched robbery. Perhaps he had seen or heard something that he should not have seen or heard. There were all sorts of theories, but eventually it emerged that he was likely to have been a victim of the Loyalist Volunteer Force. On examination of the murders that those people have committed, a nasty pattern begins to emerge. I know that I am straying from the amendment, Mr. Butterfill, but such matters cannot be considered in isolation from consequences on the ground.
<P>
Several murders happened in areas where sectarian murders by Protestant paramilitaries had not been committed for a long time. Bellaghy's Protestant population suffered grievously. Several dangerous IRA people have come from there.
<P>
The circumstances that I have outlined all tie together. Of course stories went around that, "The Orangemen and the Black Institution were stopped in the street and this is the Prod retaliation." That is a clear effort to build on the confrontations. Ministers should be careful about the matter that we are considering. Confrontations can be caused in various places and can give rise to unforeseen consequences, depending on the outlook and decisions by terrorist organisations about retaliation. All existing processions should be allowed through on the general American principle.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
An equally strong case would arise for considering new processions, as well as the traditional processions that are one-offs, such as banner unfurlings, openings of Orange halls, or even the opening of an Ancient Order of Hibernians hall.
<P>
We all know about them and we can live with them. In my experience, people are more willing to live with such little launches than most hon. Members believe. Too many hon. Members are willing to listen to propaganda.
<P>
The creation of new parades and new processions crosses a line in the sand and gives rise to a different set of circumstances. The police should consider each proposal and ask why a new parade is proposed for a new area. I do not care who proposes the parade. We should direct our attention to those eventualities.
<P>
It is possible to engage in coat-trailing exercises, to use a popular term in Northern Ireland. Such exercises should be stopped. For example, several new Sinn Fein processions have taken place. The Unionist population does not like them, but Unionists have not taken to the streets and caused confrontation. I sometimes wonder what would happen if they did. Would they be swept[Mr. Ross]
aside to allow the parade to pass, or would the parade be stopped? A sinn Fein procession consists of people who do not believe in the existence of the state in which they live. Therefore, powerful emotions are involved. Sinn Fein procession have taken place regularly for many years in Guildhall square, in the centre of Londonderry. Some of those large processions have become riots. Sinn Fein processions have taken place in the centre of Belfast, and they have been tolerated. The Unionist population is willing to compromise and let nationalists walk wherever they like within reason.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Without necessarily quarrelling with the hon. Gentleman, I seek clarification. The increase in parades in the past two or three years has often taken the form of more parades on existing routes. The hon. Gentleman referred to new processions. Did he mean new routes that had not been approved, or additional marches on existing routes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> The hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct. I referred to both at different times. New routes are created on, for example, new housing estates. Different bodies may wish to parade on existing routes. In a town in which Orange parades have taken place for many years and where there has never been a nationalist parade, a group claiming to consist of concerned residents, may express a wish to process along the route. The community may be completely loyalist, yet discover that the group turns up with Irish tricolours and known Sinn Fein members. That is a clear attempt to cause trouble. Many different connotations exist. Therefore, the matter needs careful consideration, by the police more than anyone else, because they know what goes on in the communities.
<P>
Parades are emotive in many parts of Northern Ireland. The Unionist, Protestant, loyalist community has largely come to terms with changed circumstances. There is a greater willingness among that body of opinion to allow processions to pass through areas that might not normally be regarded as acceptable. Yet that has been matched on the other side Sinn Fein-IRA with the desire to create violent confrontations which portray a bad image of Northern Ireland.
<P>
Nor is this all youth. I go back a long way to the procession run by the Peoples Democracy, when the leading lights included the then Bernadette Devlin, now Mrs. McAliskey, and Eamon McCann, a well-known journalist on the extreme left though I often wonder whether his leftishness is but a cloak. That procession went from Belfast to Londonderry and it was planned to pass through some of the most strongly loyalist areas in the country. To the loyalist population it seemed a coat-trailing exercise that led to all sorts of mayhem. The Government must know that we are not dealing with simple matters. The best people to advise the Government are not the commissioners whom they appoint but the police.
<P>
Bands are another problem but they have one great advantage. There is a musical acadamic drift: they start off very rough but 99 per cent. of them eventually move up market. They want to get better at music. I remember some bands that were pretty wild 25 or 30 years ago; but they have evolved with age not just on account of the older ages of members but because the band has evolved over time into a more respectable body. One or two perhaps moved the other way.
<P>
Many bands are independent: they have processions and band parades, which are interesting to band members and others who make music. I know some people who would not miss a band parade within 40 miles of their homes. I am not a musician myself, which may be an advantage or a disadvantage. When everybody stands up, all I know is "God Save the Queen". That is the extent of my musical ability: to the horror of some members of my family, I missed out completely on a musical education. However, I enjoy going out and listening to bands occasionally.
<P>
Parades with bands have grown enormously over the years. They tend to process in town centres and many people are often there with them. In my experience, relatively little trouble breaks out. Occasionally something may brew up, but not too often. I hold no brief for these bands. Some want to march up and down the street: one of my local bands attended more than 50 processions last year and displays much enthusiasm; it is quite good musically, too.
<P>
Many processions simply have nothing to do with loyalist institutions. Occasionally some bands may cause offence, but I believe that by and large the problem can be handled without a complete ban. The best way of handling the problem is to get the events over and done with as quickly as possible.
<P>
Let us consider what happens when offence is caused and confrontation takes place. On every occasion the loyalist orders have avoided confrontation by drawing back to leave a clear space. What happens is that that free space is looked upon as a vacuum which is immediately filled by those intent on violence. They do not treat the withdrawal as grounds on which to build conciliation, but as an advance for their cause and to ensure that there is more confrontation for the next year.
<P>
That is what lies behind these amendments. I want to ensure that the Government, the police, and everyone concerned, accept that existing, long-standing, processions will be treated, if not as having a right to proceed along the traditional routes, at least as having a strong element of such a right. The routes may occasionally be slightly modified, but they should not vary much. Any explosion in new processions and new routes or in the numbers of new bodies taking part in those processions must be considered with great care. I hope that the Minister will take on board what I say, as I am serious about this matter.
<P>
I do not want another group with bands, or whatever else, to appear on the streets, demanding the right to hold a procession in a certain area, although I believe that the easiest way to get rid of them is to let them march once or twice and they will never come back. However, they may be intent on wrecking the place and there have been serious incidents in the past. We must ensure that in future equally serious or more serious incidents are not created deliberately. The way to do that is to protect the existing parades, and to ask questions about the new ones.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Not surprisingly, I support the amendments. Traditional marches should be exempt from restrictions imposed by the Bill.
<P>
As a Unionist, I believe that the laws of Northern Ireland should, as far as possible, be the same as those in the rest of the United Kingdom. As I understand it, under British law the law for England and Wales traditional parades have the right to go ahead; they do not have to go through the procedures that will apply to new parades. I understand that there is a similar procedure in Scotland; if a parade is of long standing and is traditional, it is allowed to go ahead.
<P>
When a traditional parade is stopped those in the parade get the impression that there has been a serious attempt to curtail their civil liberty and their rights. In Northern Ireland that impression is particularly acute: it is felt by Orangemen and members of other loyalist institutions who have marched on certain routes for generations that there is a serious attempt by the enemies of Ulster to stop them. It seems to be a deliberate attempt to force people into showing their resentment. It is necessary to allow parades of long standing that are regarded as traditional to go ahead. A definition of what is traditional would be needed, but that is not beyond the realms of possibility or the capability of legislators and draftsmen. Even the Royal Ulster Constabulary could provide a fairly good list of what could be considered a traditional parade.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The police know about most of the parades that are held. Therefore, there is no reason why there should be so much bureaucracy to hold a parade. They have been going on in Northern Ireland for so long that they have become an accepted way of life. On numerous occasions, organisers have forgotten to give the police notice of a parade because they have accepted that there would be no trouble.
<P>
Under the Bill, organisers of parades will have to comply with a 28-day procedure and cope with a lot of bureaucracy. An application will be sent to the commission. It will advertise the fact across the country that a parade is going to be held, which will invite opposition to it. Mediators will be sent to mediate, and the Orange Order, which believes in civil and religious liberty, does not believe that it should have to mediate with anyone in order to walk the Queen's highway. That is an absolute right.
<P>
I know that the Minister has reluctantly accepted the fundamental principles in the Bill because he has been fed with information from the Northern Ireland Office. He has been brainwashed by the Northern Ireland Office and brainwashed by the enemies of Ulster so that he accepts the principles. They will make the position worse.
<P>
Last year about a dozen parades got into trouble, but far many more will do so this year because people will be invited to cause trouble. When the day of a parade arrives, the police will have fewer powers to act than they have now. We are likely to face more trouble, not less. The amendments seek to avoid that problem by saying that traditional parades, which have taken place for years, should have the right to march. Such marches should be protected by the police and should not have to go through all the procedures in the Bill.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry about parades. I have advocated for some time that the system in Northern Ireland should be the same as the American one. Every parade should be allowed to take place. However, I have told Unionists that there are two sides to that coin. Our parades would be allowed to go ahead, but, equally, parades held by the other community would be allowed to take place, too. That may mean that certain parades held by the Nationalist community would take place in areas where it has not paraded before. In such circumstances, the Unionist community would have to give way and let them go. When such parades are allowed to go ahead, the marchers will soon get tired of marching and the problem will be solved.
<P>
The Government should have considered that system rather than developed the nonsensical one in the Bill. It will create bureaucracy and more trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> My hon. Friend will recall what I said about parades held by the Ancient Order of Hibernians. In some instances, the Ancient Order of Hibernians and Orangemen parade on different days in the same village. Maghera, where an atrocious murder took place the other evening, is one. In the past, the Ancient Order of Hibernians was a much larger organisation and it held parades in many more areas, generally on only two days in the year. As the AOH organisation has diminished, so has the number of its parades. However, it still has a surprising number of processions, in relation to its total membership in those areas in which it is active. In most villages and towns, the Protestant and Roman Catholic organisations reached an accommodation 100 years ago over who walked where. During the past two years my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone and I have come to the conclusion that what he has said is the only way out of this mess and it will at least have the merit of exposing those who are intent on evil.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thank my hon. Friend: The Minister should seriously consider the proposal.
<P>
It is not true that there is a vast Nationalist or Roman Catholic opposition to parades in Northern Ireland. In most of the country people live together harmoniously; when there are two bands from different communities they often exchange instruments. At times people from different communities train different bands because there is a general interest in music. In a village near my home there used to be an AOH band and an Orange band and their leaders communicated amicably; they exchanged instruments and music. They got on well. It is only Republicans those who wish to take Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom who wish to create trouble and destroy the British way of life and all that we stand for. They cause the trouble, not those who march on the Queen's highway.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The backcloth that has been created by the proposers of the amendments is not one that I have experienced. When I was a boy in my community and through my adolescence and adult years, there were many occasions when parades resulted in violence and[Mr. McGrady]
riots. It is not a recent phenomenon. It is not solely related to the creation or resurgence of resident's groups organised to represent their communities in opposition to certain parades contrary to the impression that has been given.
<P>
Over the years most of the parades were not cultural or religious expressions; they were expressions of political dominance. They were expressions of the oft-quoted phrase, "Croppy lie down". In earlier days force was used indeed the proposers still recommend that to put parades through communities which did not welcome them. The hon. Member for East Londonderry stated that traditional parades should be forced through by might irrespective of right. He said that this morning and he also said it on Second Reading. The only way that can be done is by force and we cannot afford to go forward in that way.
<P>
The articulation of opposition to "traditional" parades has evolved as society has evolved. It has evolved with the demographic changes in the community, even with the topographical changes to the places where people live and to the structure of their environment. Even the definition of tradition is difficult. In July, representations were made to me about parades entering an estate every Friday night up to midnight, causing concern to some of the residents. I cannot name the place because I do not want to exacerbate the situation. I suggested to the police that this was an unnecessary extension of parades. They refused to do anything on the basis that it was a traditional route. The traditional route was through a new housing estate; its roads had not even been made up and its entrance was one carriageway, 100 yards in length, to a hammerhead and back again.
<P>
That interpretation of traditional does not make sense. The sole purpose of that parade was to extend the domination of the village to that new estate. That is the backcloth to which many of these parades take place. If the truth were known, there would be many occasions on which the fact that the so-called traditional parades were unwelcome in certain communities would be much more strongly articulated. Believe it or not, tolerance is abroad in many areas in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross; Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I will when I have finished this point. If the amendments are accepted, all parades that have taken place hitherto will be considered traditional and will be put through and will not be dealt with in any way by the commission. The whole purpose of the commission is to deal with the problems that have beencreated by the so-called traditional parades. Under these amendments they would be exempt from any examination by any working commission, and that seems totally illogical.
<P>
It is often diminished in debate, but it is important that the ethos and requirements of residents are taken into proper account in assessing where and when these parades should take place. Some recognition should be given to the sensitivities of those who, while not physically opposing parades, are quietly resentful of the intrusion into their communities and life.
<P>
Every Friday night in towns and villages in my area throughout the so-called marching season there are parades and marches up to and beyond midnight. That is difficult to accept. The greatest danger in this proposition in the amendments is that the police, and no one else unless they are aided and abetted by the army which makes the matter even worse, will be required to put through all traditional parades. That means all parades up until now.
<P>
If that is the suggested recipe for resolving the problems that traditional parades have created or are now embroiled in, there is no purpose in trying to address the violence that has emanated in this limited number of instances. I do not understand how the hon. Member for East Londonderry can propose amendments that would ensure that the commission would not, in any circumstances, address the issue of those parades that have caused conflict in past years.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> The hon. Gentleman spoke about a procession going through a new estate. I hope that it would be caught by the amendment and would be treated as a new route or partly a new route. It does not have to be a completely new route. My drafting may be incorrect but I would have thought that the very points that the hon. Gentleman makes would be caught by the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I am afraid that the proposals before us would basically mean that traditional parades, irrespective of their consequences and of demographic or topograhic changes would be forced through by the police. That is a recipe for disaster for the community and the police and is totally at variance with what we all should be striving to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> We can see that this is very much determined by the issue of whether it is possible to define traditional.
