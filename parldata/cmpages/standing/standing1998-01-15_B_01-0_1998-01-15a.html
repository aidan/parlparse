<H2><center>Standing Committee B</center></H2>
<H4><center>Thursday 15 January 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Andrew Welsh in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/101/1997101.htm">Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill [Lords]</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during the proceedings on the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand, Mr. Welsh, that this is the first Committee in which you are in the Chair and I wish you well in that new role. I hope that our proceedings will be enlightening and interesting for you. I will do my best to help in achieving that objective.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross </B>(East Londonderry): It would be helpful to the Committee if the Government would tell us how they intend to take the business of each sitting. I am not in favour of guillotines, but I am sure that not everyone would want to stay here all night, although we could do that if we wished to. Most people would like to go home on Thursday nights. Can the Minister tell us when he wishes to finish this evening?
<P>
I would also be grateful if the Minister would tell us which of the half-promised or half-considered changes have been made to the Bill. A number of changes were made as a result of the debates in Committee in the other place, and there were suggestions that the Government were considering further changes. How many of those changes were made and do the Government intend to make more changes in Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The duration of today's and future sittings is in the hands of the Committee. It is not for me to determine at this stage. I will make judgments according to the progress in each sitting. I hope that we can make steady progress and that we can give each clause due examination, and I am sure that hon. Members and my ministerial colleague will agree. A large number of amendments has been tabled and that will lead to extensive debate, which will help us to examine the detail of the Bill.
<P>
The Bill was extensively examined in the other place and, as a result of co-operation between those who spoke to the legislation, some amendments were made. It is not for me to enumerate them. Members of the Committee can examine what happened in the other place to see whether they are satisfied with the changes.
<P>
There were some significant changes on the harmonisation of the maximum sentences for offences by participants in public processions and by protestors to such processions. There was agreement on raising the threshold for penalties, relating to the Secretary of State's power to ban public processions. There was also a significant change in the way in which parliamentary scrutiny of the many statutory documents under the Bill would be carried out.
<P>
A number of other matters were considered, which we will examine in detail in our discussion of some of the amendments that have been tabled for this morning's sitting. Our attitude to amendments will depend on the strength and quality of the arguments and, in some cases, on the technical factors affecting implementation.
<P>
I am not opposed to changes to the Bill per se. We want it passed quickly, for the obvious reason that we want the Parades Commission to be up and running well in advance of the marching season, as it is called, so that it can do its job effectively. I am not against reasoned, structured debate. Reasonable amendments will be duly considered and we will respond to them in a positive way. I do not intend to be obstructive and I hope that Opposition Members will approach the matter in the same way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Welsh. It is a pleasure to serve under you. The Bill is very important and a good one on which to start your Committee chairmanship.
<P>
I welcome the thrust of the Minister's remarks. The Opposition have no objection to the sittings motion. The Bill was initiated by the previous Government, when I was a Minister, and we considered it important. The Government have proceeded following the North report. We now enter upon the Committee proceedings in a spirit of bipartisanship, wanting to be as constructive as possible. The Minister's comments about the quality of argument, and his openmindedness about considering amendments if they arise from an approach with intellectual integrity, are welcome. We do not intend to delay proceedings and we hope to progress as speedily as the giving of full weight and time to the arguments will permit.
<P>
Given the spirit of the Minister's remarks and of my response, we hope that we shall proceed sensibly and not be forced into late night sittings, which Opposition co-operation will make unnecessary.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during the proceedings on the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Room. I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<p><center>Clause 1</center>
<CENTER>The Commission</CENTER>
 <B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 6, leave out "established" and insert "provision made to establish".
<P>
It is a pleasure to serve on a Committee under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Welsh. I am sure that you can look forward to many long, happy and interesting years in your present role, and we look forward to that too. That role comes with long experience in the House, but I suspect that on first assuming it, one's experience of the workings of the House does not seem as substantial as one might wish. However, I have no doubt that you will rapidly acquire the skill and experience that all our Chairman exhibit and that the Committee's proceedings will be conducted swiftly and well within the bounds of order.
<P>
The consequences that would arise from passing amendment No. 1 are obvious. The right hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) mentioned that the present matter originated under the previous Administration. All kinds of claims, counter-claims and inquiries were made. My views are well enough known not to require repetition here. I refer those who are not familiar with them to the Second Reading debate. I want more time to be given to thinking about the consequences of the Bill, and particularly about the changes that have taken place and the knowledge that has become available since it was first mooted.
<p>
<center>[Mr. John Butterfill in the Chair]</center>
 <p>Initially, the commission seemed to be an advisory body that could also negotiate, arbitrate, talk to various factions and try to reach agreement between those who are at variance on the streets of Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, the Bill turns it from being an advisory body into one with legal authority. That amounts to a massive change which will impinge on the Chief Constable's decision-making power, and we should not go down that road lightly; we must give it very careful consideration.</center></H4>
<P>
Objections to processions in Northern Ireland are seldom spur-of-the-moment. We are told that the leadership of Sinn Fein-IRA spent two years preparing for consultations. In those circumstances it follows logically that much of the decision-making can be made only when true knowledge of the facts is made available to the commission and to the security forces.
<P>
The Chief Constable more than anyone else knows the security background and understands the dangers that are inherent in any given situation. He also knows the identities of individuals who are involved. If we want clear evidence of his knowledge and ability to advise, we need only consider the decision of the Orange Institution on 12 July when it voluntarily withdrew from some processions. Members of the institution who saw the Chief Constable and other senior officers will confirm that it was clear that if the processions were to proceed, there would be violence and bloodshed on the streets. In such circumstances, the only person whom the loyalist bodies are likely to believe is the Chief Constable and his senior officers. Loyalists are extremely unlikely to believe an appointed quango which does not contain a single person whom they could regard with any confidence as independent and competent to make the right decisions or put forward their point of view.
<P>
Given that the Chief Constable was able because of his background knowledge and the information that he was able to impart in the run-up to 12 July to persuade the Orange Institution of the merits of not continuing with some traditional parades down some traditional routes, it is clear that he is the person best fitted to convince people of the merits of the case in hand. Can the Minister assure us that members of the commission will be given comparable knowledge? Will they have access to reports on the security background of particular parades? Without that knowledge, will they be able to make a valid decision that they can persuade other people is the correct one in the circumstances? If they are given such information, will they be empowered to impart it to other people? If so, that will raise many security concerns.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Chief Constable knows exactly what he can tell people. He knows that he enjoys the trust, and possibly even the respect, of some of the people with whom he must deal. That will not be so of the commission. The Chief Constable will know the identity of those who might attack a procession and of those who have opposed processions in the past.
The leadership of the Loyalist orders also knows the identity of many of those people. We have seen Mr. Rice seen on the streets, and we have seen Mr. McGlinchey, the brother of the late gentleman known as "Mad Dog" McGlinchey, directing operations on the streets of Bellaghy. His cohorts were there, and they are all well known as active members of Sinn Fein in that area. The Unionist, Protestant and loyalist population takes the view that, as the Government themselves say, Sinn Fein and the IRA are inextricably linked. They have no doubts about with whom they are dealing and who is orchestrating the objections. In those circumstances, I suggest that the Chief Constable, with his knowledge and with the knowledge possessed by the people with whom he is talking, is in a far better position to convince Loyalist orders.
 <P>
In Northern Ireland, this is seen as an anti-Orange Bill. We should not sweep that fact under the carpet; that is how it is perceived. It does not matter what the Minister says is the truth. That is the perception, and perception counts on the streets of Northern Ireland, as Ministers well know.
<P>
It is time to draw back and give careful consideration to the Bill's consequences. Since it was discussed and just before it was debated in the House, we have been provided with more evidence on the source and the nature of the opposition to processions. I refer to the Apprentice Boys procession in Londonderry shortly before Christmas. Information was clearly available to the police that enabled them to take preventive action and launch a pre-emptive strike against Sinn Fein-IRA, which was clearly intent on mayhem and violence and, indeed, massive violence it caused. It did that because it wants to be able to determine who walks up and down the streets. If the Minister does not understand that, I assure him that that is the perception of people in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The information that the police had on that occasion was accurate. Would that information have been given to the commission? If the commission had been given information that people of evil intent were willing to ensure that violence and trouble would take place on that day, what view would it have taken? Would it have[Mr. William Ross]
taken the same view as the police? If it had come to a different decision from the police, would the police or the Secretary of State have overridden it?
<P>
Lay people, no matter how well meaning they are, do not have the professional qualifications of senior police officers. They do not have the long experience and detailed understanding of what they will have to deal with. No matter who is selected for the commission, they will not be capable of taking as sensible, as balanced, as wise, or, as is sometimes necessary, as firm decisions as the police.
<P>
The result is that we need to pause and think through all the consequences of the proposed legislation. My concern, and that of the Committee and the House in general, should be greatly increased by the fact that the Rev. Roy Magee, the only person on the commission who had any standing with those most affected the Loyal institutions in Northern Ireland has resigned over the changing nature of the commission's powers.
<P>
One other member of the commission is a leading member of the SDLP and naturally will not enjoy the confidence of the Unionist population. When we see that that woman, who will inevitably bring her political baggage with her, is now to be the predominant voice in Londonderry where she lives, and will determining what the Apprentice Boys will do in their native city, we need go no further to make people think seriously about the consequences of going down this road.
<P>
The Rev. Roy Magee has done a great deal for Northern Ireland over the years. He has enjoyed the trust and confidence of the most violent and dangerous people in the loyalist community. I do not believe that the Government or the House have come to terms with the effect of his resignation, of the host of questions that it has raised in that community, of the dangers that flow from it and the fears that are aroused. They have not seen his replacement yet and, quite frankly, trying to find someone to replace him who will enjoy his standing is a task that no one can contemplate with any confidence.
<P>
This is a bad Bill and the Minister knows that; it makes changes and gives powers to people who are not qualified or fit to exercise them. It will cause the most horrendous difficulties. The commission will be put in the position of making decisions that it does not itself have to enforce: these will have to be enforced by the police. That will put the police on the street in a position of which the Chief Constable will not, to put it mildly, always fully approve. That is wrong.
<P>
While it was barely acceptable to some people that there was an advisory body, it is much less acceptable to a much larger number of people that we are creating a body with these executive powers to make criminals out of people who believe they are simply exercising their traditional rights and privileges. We are going too far. The capacity of the commission to appear as an independent arbitrator and acceptable neutral voice went out of the door with the Rev. Roy Magee. It did not have much credibility anyway in the eyes of those who are most affected.
<P>
Giving the commission these powers creating an organisation that will make and hand down decisions in defiance of the wishes of a great section of the population in Northern Ireland is not the way to bring peace and stability. It is a road to more confrontation and difficulty. It opens the door to the most violent elements of society to capitalise on it because they are saying quite bluntly, "The IRA by their violence and confrontation have created this body and therefore we will do the same." It is not a road down which I want the Government, the police or anyone else to travel. The proposed legislation, which has been accepted in principle by the two Houses, could be passed, but it should not be implemented until we see how things work out over at least the coming year.

<P>

<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): I support the amendment, in which there is considerable merit, as it is widely known in Northern Ireland that nobody wants the Bill. It does not have the support of the majority of Northern Ireland Members and that is significant. I know, of course, that those who now sit at Stormont have not been elected by the people of Northern Ireland and they think that they know what is best for the Province. However, they should have some cognisance of the views of the majority of its elected Members, whose view of course, is that the Bill, if enacted, will create more trouble than it will solve. The body has been in existence without legal status for the past year and it has done some advisory work and mediation. To give it additional statutory powers would be dangerous because that would affect the operational role of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in respect of the conduct of parades where they will go, for example, and what opposition will show itself. Such things change almost instantaneously and only the RUC, the police on the ground, can deal adequately with situations as they arise.
<P>
Some people do not want to support the police, never have supported them and want to put obstacles in their way. The belief that a body that is set up to take decisions away from the police will somehow solve those problems is erroneous because it is most likely that in some cases the police will have to override any determination by the Parades Commission.
<P>
The commission's independence will be called into question. It will consist of people who have not been elected but who are appointed by the Government, presumably to implement their views. Those of us who live in Northern Ireland have enough experience of quangos to know that they are not independent. The composition of the existing commission shows that it could hardly be claimed to be independent.
<P>
Anyone who knows anything about Northern Ireland must acknowledge that this is an anti-Orange Bill. The Bill and the codes of practice that will result from it are designed almost exclusively to deal with Orange parades and bands and the culture that they represent in Northern Ireland. The Bill is an attack on Orange parades. It concerns the type of music that the bands will play, when they will play, the type of banners that they will carry and what will be on them, all of which relates specifically to Orange parades.
<P>
The great omission from the Bill is its failure to deal with the real problem of parades, which is not the parades themselves but those who seek to oppose them. The Minister should acknowledge that those who organise parades have never sought to do so against the wishes of the police. All the Orders have at all times co-operated and negotiated with the police on such matters as when a parade will be held and its route. However, decisions that have been taken and agreements made may be overturned by the police on the day of the parade because people who wish to stop the parade threaten to sit down in the streets 
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will turn his attention to the amendment. His remarks may be more appropriate to amendment No. 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. I am new to the Committee, so perhaps I have strayed into areas where I should not have gone. I trust and respect your judgment in these matters.
<P>
If the Bill is enacted as drafted it will cause more rather than less trouble in more areas in Northern Ireland. The amendment is wise and prudent; the word "establish" should be removed and "provision made to establish" should take its place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eddie McGrady </B>(South Down): The substance of the argument for the amendment seems to be that the status quo is desirable and that that is the opinion of the people of Northern Ireland. But it is not the opinion of the people of Northern Ireland who, be they Unionists or Nationalists, certainly in the area that I represent, want something to be done about the recurring annual problem of parades, which cause great community division, social problems and economic devastation year by year. The status quo is not an option.
<P>
Most of the people I talk to want a change; they want greater openness in decisions which result in the ultimate permission to march, to do something else or to vary a route. It is vital that such decisions are firmly in the public domain. The issue of permission, which had a false, non-statutory start is seen by most as a good opportunity to address the problem. Even those who are doubtful about it have said to me, "We don't know, but at least it is better than what is there. Give it a chance." That is the basis on which I oppose altering the substance of the legislation by means of amendments to clause 1.
<P>
Much has been said about the Chief Constable, but he has said constantly that he is piggy in the middle and that he does not want to be put in that position. In response to the events in Drumcree in July 1997 he said he was quoted several times that he had to succumb to the greater evil. It is no basis on which to administer law and order that people must succumb to the greater threat of force. The Chief Constable called it the greater threat of evil. Those are not my words, but his. It is incumbent on us all, whether we like it or not, and whether or not we are worried about the future, to give the commission a fair opportunity to discover whether it can solve the problems that occur year after year. To give that degree of openness, hopefully to know the broad parameters on which any decisions are made and thus to gain the confidence of all communities, would make it much more difficult for those people who want to exacerbate the situation and create violence and disturbance to justify their actions in terms of community support.
<P>
Reference was made to one of my party colleagues, a lady of great honour who has given great service to this community in many other fields, including education. I am not sure whether there was an innuendo of impropriety. I hope not, because it would be grossly undeserved. I would like to put that straight.
<P>
Let us give the commission a chance to redress that which no one else can redress. During our proceedings, many of us will table amendments to make the Bill more effective or amenable. Fair enough, but the broad thrust of the Bill will give us a new mechanism and a new openness to these decisions, which will, as far as possible, remove the opportunity for violence. That is welcome by the people of Northern Ireland be they nationalists, loyalists or republican, except those who want to use these parades for violence purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter (Basingstoke):</B> I do not share the opinion of the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) that the purpose of the amendment is to seek to maintain the status quo, at least the status quo in its entirety. As I see it, the amendment seeks further time to consider one important principle: the appropriateness or otherwise of the RUC being obliged to enforce decisions of an appointed quango. That is quite different from defending the status quo in its entirety.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) pointed out that there were reasons of both practicality and principle why one must consider very carefully the radical departure that the Bill makes. The practical grounds are that the RUC alone will have the necessary knowledge, expertise and experience to make a decision about security issues. The argument of principle is whether it is right for the RUC to be obliged to enforce the decisions of an appointed quango that than a democratically accountable Government. I support the principle of the amendment simply because I do not believe that that issue has been sufficiently addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> A number of points have been raised in the debate. I shall deal with those first and then with the detailed points on the amendment. The hon. Member for East Londonderry raised the whole issue of the Parades Commission and its membership and the recent resignation of Roy Magee. As these comments are likely to play throughout our consideration of the Bill, I should say from the outset that the Government have full confidence in Mr. Alastair Graham and all members of the commission to act in an impartial, even-handed and independent way. <P>
The Government were sorry that Roy Magee resigned from the commission, and we are in the process of appointing a replacement for him. I hope to be able to make an announcement about that in the near future.
<P>
Hon. Members have spoken about the role and function of the Chief Constable in relation to the function of the Parades Commission. Those matters were debated on Second Reading, and the Bill has passed through both Houses. We have made it clear that the role and function of the Chief Constable in relation to public order is that if he needs to intervene to maintain public order on the day of a particular parade, he has the powers so to do. His powers to maintain good[Mr. Ingram]
public order on a particular day are not being stripped away from him in any way, shape or form. The Chief Constable can ask the Secretary of State to review a determination of the Parades Commission. In those circumstances the Secretary of State has the power to uphold or revoke a decision of the commission on the Chief Constable's advice.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry raised the issue of security advice. It would flow to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in her capacity to respond to a request for reconsideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The Minister said that the powers of the police would remain the same. They will not, however, because on the day of a parade the police will no longer be able to issue a notice to halt it. The Bill will deprive them of that power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood what I said. The powers of the Chief Constable will remain in his capacity to seek and maintain good public order on the day in question. That power to make a judgment and act accordingly on the day remains with him. It is thus the power to maintain good public order that remains with him.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The Chief Constable will of course retain the power to keep public order but he will not have the facility now legally available to him to issue a notice halting a parade on the day it takes place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The reality of how the security forces will operate in the event of a major breakdown of public order could mean effectively that a parade could not continue. The power to decide that will reside with the Chief Constable and the security forces at the time of determination. Those matters will have to be judged at the time by the Chief Constable. If public order is going to disintegrate because a parade is going ahead, the Chief Constable will have to take appropriate decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We have dealt with the point now. I want to move on to another point about the Chief Constable's relationship with the Parades Commission.
<P>
There appears to be concern over the Chief Constable's separation from the work, function and role of the Parades Commission. The reality let us refer to reality rather than perceptions in Committee is very different from the account of the hon. Member for East Londonderry. There has already been co-operation between the Chief Constable and the Parades Commission and it will continue. The Chief Constable will judge what information needs to be passed to the commission to enable it to carry out its function. He is an experienced chief of police who knows what is happening on the ground. He will be able to pass on relevant information to the commission, which will be aware of the issue of confidentiality in relation to such information.
<P>
I do not accept the accusation that the commission will immediately divulge confidential information to the world. If it did so, the commission would not be fulfilling its function of giving proper and balanced consideration to all the material and information that comes before it. Members of the commission will act responsibly and discharge the important function with which they have been empowered.
<P>
<b>11.15 am</b>
<P><B>Mr. Moss:</b> The matter is vital. From an operational point of view it is sensible for the Chief Constable and the commission to meet regularly to discuss such issues. However, I have not been able to find that provision in the Bill. Clause 5 states that<p>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Commission shall issue a set of guidelines",
<P>
in order to exercise its functions under section 7, and possibly under others sections.
<P>
One of the guidelines might state that the commission must have regular consultations with the Chief Constable. Is that where that mandatory function of the commission is provided for, or is it somewhere else in the Bill.?
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</b> The point was made that the Chief Constable would be prohibited from consulting the Parades Commission. That is not the case. The Chief Constable may, if he wishes, impart information and give good advice to the commission. That could be included in the code of guidance or remain outside it. The best practice will be decided according to the circumstances. If the Parades Commission wants to consult the wider community of interest, which would automatically include the Chief Constable, then it would do so. The commission will have to try to take account of the wide range of opinions and views about particular parades or marches, or to the whole situation over a particular period. That is how the code of guidance would function operationally. If we tried to list everything that could possibly need a decision, some matters could be excluded. It is better to leave the Parades Commission free, in that sense, to hold those consultations that it considers necessary. Clearly, the Chief Constable would have a vital role in any discussions.<P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman may not have had the opportunity to read the published guidelines; in paragraph 2.1, page 4, it is stated that the commission would consult with the RUC on public order issues. That provision is in the code of guidance, but even if it had not been included, such consultations would occur as a matter of course. The advice of the Chief Constable and the RUC is an important element in any consideration about what could or could not happen in relation to an individual march or parade.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. The matter is important. We heard earlier about the perception of the Bill in a section of the Northern Ireland community. The perceived reality of what the Government are seeking to do must match the reality, so that there will be overall acceptance of the Bill. It is important that the Bill or the guidelines should include the provision that the commission will consult the Chief Constable, and I am delighted that it is in the guidelines.<P>
<P>
Clause 5 is about the issuing of a set of guidelines
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as to the exercise by the Commission of its functions under section 7."
<P>
Under section 7 the commission has powers to impose conditions on public processions, including, presumably, stopping them. Later the Chief Constable has the right to appeal to the Secretary of State on that decision. Therefore it is important that the commission and the Chief Constable should discuss such matters at an earlier stage before the commission arrives at a conclusion.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I think that I have answered the point. In any circumstances in which there is a contentious, or potentially contentious, parade or march, consultation will be a dynamic process. The Parades Commission is charged with a range of processes through which it can examine, consider, mediate or facilitate accommodation. It will talk to as many people as possible to assess what is likely to happen, and the RUC and the Chief Constable's assessment of what would be a contenious parade will be crucial to that process. The powers exist and they are set out in the code of guidance.<P>
<P>
I know that you, Mr. Butterfill, are a little concerned that I may be wandering away from the amendment, so I shall return to its specifics. The hon. Member for East Londonderry said that it was a "little" amendment. I do not want to be too unkind, but it is a wrecking amendment. Although the hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) spoke to the amendment, the hon. Member for East Londonderry did not say much about it.
<P>
I shall explain why I consider it to be a wrecking amendment. Government policy, as set out in the Bill, is to implement the full recommendations of the North report. As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) said from the Government Front Bench [Hon. Members: "Opposition Front Bench."] Yes, from the Opposition Front Bench. We might have been in government for nearly a year, but we are still getting it wrong. Perhaps, we shall learn in due course.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that, when the Conservative party was in government, it initiated the North report and set forth the process on which the Bill is based. The report proposed a new structure for handling contested parades, and this Government, immediately on coming into office, committed themselves to bring those structures into place as soon as possible.
<P>
This "little" amendment, as the hon. Member for East Londonderry described it, would not put any new structures in place; it would merely give the Government unspecified provisions to establish a commission with the powers outlined in the Bill. The amendment does not suggest how the commission would later be established and whether that would be by subordinate legislation, by order or simply at the Secretary of State's discretion.
<P>
More crucially, the amendment would leave a gaping hole in Northern Ireland legislation. The Bill will repeal existing provisions in the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 that relate to public processions. The amendment would leave a vacuum. Until the parades commission were established with the powers set out in the Bill, there would be no legal provision for dealing with parades in Northern Ireland. Surely, that would be in no one's interest.
<P>
The Government, like the previous one, have fought long and hard over the handling of disputed parades. Avoiding events such as those at Drumcree in recent years has been a priority of this and the previous Government. The establishment of a Parades Commission with the powers recommended by the North report will give us the best prospect of achieving that aim. I call upon the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I have listened to the Minister and to the hon. Member for South Down. All that the Minister's closing remarks have done is confirm the transfer of large chunks of powers, which currently reside with the Chief Constable, to an unelected quango. That is all the more reason for accepting the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Down said that everyone wanted something done about parades. The question is: what? He also said that there will be a degree of openness about where decisions are made. We already know where decisions are made: by the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State on the advice of the Chief Constable. We all know that.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Down also complained about the Chief Constable being the piggy in the middle and that, at Drumcree, he succumbed to the greater evil. At what point did the greater evil enter into things? Surely the greater evil was Sinn Fein-IRA blocking a traditional and, until then, legal procession. The issue is how one draws the line to describe the greater evil and whether it is drawn before or after those events. My view is that the Chief Constable drew the line on the wrong side. We need to face up to a grave moral argument, but the Bill attempts to avoid that.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The hon. Gentleman has misinterpreted what I said. The Chief Constable said that he had to make a decision that succumbed to the greater evil. He made a decision in favour of the mobs that were assembled to force the parade through which presumably is a greater evil.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ross:</B> What was the mob, then, that assembled to stop them which was led and organised by the IRA, the most murderous terrorist organisation in western Europe since God knows when? If there is to be talk of the greater evil, great care should be taken about use of language. I do not approve of the Chief Constable's use of language on the occasion in question.
<P>
The Minister said that the Government had confidence in the Committee to act independently. It does not matter what the Government think; it is the perception on the street that matters. Anyone who knows anything about Northern Ireland knows that perceptions on the street are the motivating force. It is on those that people will act.
<P>
I do not know whether the Minister or anyone else in this Room has ever organised a parade. I have, so I have some idea of the work that goes into them the organisation and the getting people in place on time. I also know that once a hullabaloo of objection has been raised, the organisers of a parade can have no control[Mr. Ross]
over who else turns up. That is where the problems begin. It has always been much easier to put a contentious parade through than to stop it. That applies across the board. I have long believed that the only way out of the difficulty is to put them all through. We should have adopted the American principle. Once they all went through, after a few years those with a real desire to parade would do so and those trying only to cause trouble would disappear.
<P>
Let us consider how things happen. After a commission decision that a procession could go ahead, there might, when the participants turned up on the day, be a mob in the street to stop them. The Chief Constable could decide to stop them. The organisers would have the double jeopardy of the commission and the police who would be trying to avert violence. Also, security advice to the Secretary of State might cause her to change her mind, depending on the amount and timing of advice reaching her and the commission. The possible public order breakdown would be due not to the procession itself but to the counter-demonstration something that later amendments are intended to deal with.
<P>
It would not matter that the procession had been permitted by the commission after it had taken advice and soundings. The commission could talk to as many people as it liked. The matter would be decided not by the majority view of those who spoke to the commission, but by the few who were intent on violence. At that point the Chief Constable would have to step in and stop proceedings. The underlying theory of the commission and its powers breaks down at that point. It is just not valid.
<P>
The Committee should keep clearly in mind one of the most horrific incidents in Northern Ireland, concerning a parade not an Orange parade, but a Remembrance day parade in Enniskillen. What is not remembered is that on the same day the IRA had set up another ambush of children who were attending another Remembrance day parade where there was a very small number of ex-service men. Most of those present were from groups such as the Boys brigade, Girls brigade and scouts. The ambush was stopped and the bomb, fortunately, did not go off. It is because of the involvement of people such as those who planned that ambush that what we are considering is nonsense very dangerous nonsense. That is why the amendment should be accepted.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Thank you for your strictures, Mr. Butterfill. It is always nice to know where we stand. We will have to think of ways of getting around it. This is a very large group of amendments and many are shared with the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss). Our only difference is that he refers to "counter demonstrations" and I refer to "counter demonstrations or processions" which is also relevant.
<P>
I am curious to know why amendment Nos. 177 and 209 have been included in the group, the first referring to intoxicating liquor and the seizure thereof the second to the maximum period for which the Secretary of State can impose a ban. Perhaps the Minister can explain.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not the Minister who makes these decisions. I make them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> In that case Mr. Butterfill, perhaps I can repeat my question and ask you why that decision was made. It is an interesting decision as apparently the policeman can consume the intoxicating liquor once he has seized it because he can get rid of it in whatever way he wishes. It would seem a great waste to many policeman to pour it down the drain. I remember an uncle who was in the police pouring many gallons of poteen down the drain one day. That said, I shall return to those amendments at a later stage.
<P>
The Bill deals with processions. There is no way that one can say that only normal processions take place because there is also the whole question of opposition to those processions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Having taken advice, I can tell the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) that if he would like a separate debate on amendments Nos. 177 and 209 we would be happy to accommodate that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Butterfill. That makes our lives easier, because we can deal with it in one fell swoop. However, neither the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire nor I have missed many processions or places where they turn up.
<P>
I shall go through the amendments. The first two or three and others would promote greater public understanding of procession issues. If we want to promote greater public understanding why should we not also want to promote greater and more detailed knowledge and understanding of people who oppose public processions, either by static protests sit downs in the street or by trying to run another procession at the same time? If the public are to be informed about public processions, people throughout the United Kingdom should know why people feel the need to process. They should also be told why people feel moved to oppose them and a detailed investigation should be carried out into the reasons for that. After all, many people enjoy public processions regardless of who is in them.
<P>
In my village, where the vast majority of residents are Roman Catholic, many people watch the Orange processions. Some travel regularly to watch the Twelfth of July parade, and have always done so. I even know of members of the Orange Institution who used regularly to attend the Ancient Order of Hibernians demonstrations on 15 August and 17 March, simply because they liked bands and music. Many people come to the town of Garvagh in my constituency every year to watch the large band procession, which is run for the benefit of cancer research.
<P>
There are so many reasons for processions that no one can come to a sensible conclusion about why they are held and why some people foolishly object to them, and that will continue unless a greater understanding is promoted across the board.
<P>
Clause 2(1)(b) lines 12 and 13 states that it shall be the duty of the commission to promote and facilitate mediation as a means of resolving disputes concerning public processions. That is why the commission was formed in the first place. I cannot see why people who want to mediate should not also have a duty under the Bill to talk to those who might oppose a public procession by sitting down or by other means. Judging from what has been said, that is what the commission has done in the past 12 months, at the time of the processions and long before then. Whenever the merest hint of opposition has appeared over the horizon, the members have trotted off to talk to those involved. The Secretary of State went to see all sorts of people to discuss how to resolve the protests. She promised the people in Garvaghy road that she would come back to them, but she did not do that and we have seen the sort of mess she got herself into as a result.
<P>
If we are to promote and facilitate mediation it should be across the board. Why should there be mediation only with those who are holding the procession? Why not talk to those who are opposed to it and convince them of the error and foolishness of their ways? That is an essential duty that should be laid on the commission.
<P>
Clause 2(1)(c) states that the commission should keep itself generally informed as to the conduct of public processions. What is the point of that if there is not also a duty on the commission to keep itself informed in detail of counter processions and demonstrations? Surely, that is essential. Why is the measure limited in that way? It does not seem sensible. If the Government are serious about dealing with the matter they should make absolutely certain that it is in the Bill that the commission must talk about how opposing factions conduct themselves. That would provide a clearer understanding of the almost impossible situations faced by the police, who are often piggy in the middle or the meat in the sandwich. Surely the police have a duty to be fully informed of the whole picture rather than deal only with the minor element of public processions.
<P>
I could explain to the commission how Orange processions are organised and run. I could tell the commission about the difficulties of receiving replies, of trying to determine how many people will be attending, and of deciding on a route and a return route. Anyone who has taken part could fully inform the commission of how the processions are organised and run.
<P>
There is much less information, however, about how those who oppose the processions go about their business. How do they get their people gathered up to oppose? We know that some people travel 40, 50 or 60 miles to be insulted when public processions take place. We know that people such as Mr. McGlinchey, now resident in Donegal, and or good reason, have taken part. It would be interesting to know how he and his cohorts organised their activities in Dungiven and Bellaghy. How did they arrange 14 bombs to go through the armoured glass at a post office in Dungiven one evening?
<P>
These are matters of grave concern to the Committee. Surely the most detailed inquiries for example, into how 300 or 400 gallons of petrol can be made into 1,000 petrol bombs in Londonderry in December and into who pays for that petrol should be made by the commission. A great deal of potential information is being ignored, and the commission should be made aware of it. Is there a fund from which the petrol can be bought? Are people sent out with bottles to buy five gallons each? It can be costly to buy five gallons around 15 or 16 and that would make only 40 petrol bombs. Then there are all the necessary rags. Think of the rich field of research for the commission in inquiring how these peaceful, petrol-bomb-throwing mobs can be organised to oppose a parade. As I said, the commission has a duty to be informed about all these matters, and the Bill should specify what its duty is.
<P>
Clause 3 deals with the commission issuing a code of conduct to provide
"guidance to persons organising a public procession".
<P>
What sort of guidance will be necessary? As I have already said, people such as myself who have organised processions know that we have to involve the report groups of the Orange Institution in the case of an Orange parade or those of Apprentice Boys in order to obtain the addresses of secretaries and others. We need to organise the bands, write to individuals, call them up, provide them with the date, time and place and so forth. Plans of the roads down which the parade will march have to be drawn up. Details of other matters such as unfurling banners and platform proceedings are also important.
<P>
Many details are relevant and the people who organise public processions know about them. However, people who are out to oppose such[Mr. Ross]
processions are not nearly so professional in their methods of organisation. It is essential that they too should be informed about what needs to be done.
<P>
The Government may have drafted the provision so that the commission knows that it has to get involved and talk to people. Members of the commission will gain from the experience of folk such as myself who have organised public processions and who can provide information on what needs to be done to ensure that they run smoothly.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Such information needs to appear in the notice to the police. They must know who is organising the event and be reassured that the organisers are aware of their responsibilities and have read the law, although, admittedly, the law is being changed. It is essential that those organising public processions should receive advice under clause 3(1)(a). Perhaps even those organising counter-demonstrations and sit-down, petrol-bomb-throwing or stone-throwing sessions should be given advice on how to do that. It would be a pity to leave them out, although they have proved fairly efficient at what they do. Perhaps they could tell the commission how they do it.
<P>
Clause 3(1)(b) states that the commission shall issue a code
"regulating the conduct of persons organising or taking part in a public procession."
<P>
That is a particularly rich field for those organising counter-demonstrations. They behave in a most lawless and violent fashion. They throw stones, sit down in the streets, throw sticks, shout insults, throw petrol bombs, burn down buildings, and engage in riots. They have caused enormous damage to Londonderry. Why is the commission neglecting the opportunity to tell them that they should not do that? If they are going to hold a counter-demonstration, it should be limited in time and scope. The commission should tell them that counter-demonstrations should be peaceful and that those on them must behave themselves and be under the control of certain individuals whom they will obey.
<P>
Mr. Martin McGuinness and a number of other well-known gentlemen were in Shipquay street in Londonderry in December. Whether they were there for a peaceful protest or as organisers was not clear. One thing is certain; it was a most violent and costly day. That had nothing to do with the Apprentice boys, who would have been out of the way in 20 minutes. It would have been a pleasant spectacle with no harm to anyone. However, rioting took place where the Apprentice Boys were, and for half a mile around that area in the main commercial part of the street. Of course, preparations were made. "SS-RUC" banners were hung over the Richmond centre and those opposing the procession conducted themselves badly.
<P>
In such circumstances, the commission should surely take Mr. McGuinness and the other Sinn Fein members in Londonderry city by the hand, lead them into a quiet, little backroom and explain to them that such actions are completely wrong and that they should desist from violent and dangerous activity. The commission should explain that the RUC is not the SS. If it were the SS, there would be no trouble with the IRA, Sinn Fein and their cohorts in Shipquay street. If it were the SS, any trouble would not last very long.
<P>
I have spoken to a friend of mine who, in the 1940s, had personal experience of the SS from El Alamein to northern Italy. His explanations of how the SS dealt with demonstrations shows that the RUC are not an SS force. They are mere beginners in copying the SS's methods and would not know where to begin.
<P>
Guidance should have been given to the organisers of the counter-demonstration in Londonderry. Why will the commission not take on that duty? The chances of the conduct of the loyalist orders taking part in a legal parade being unbecoming is remarkably small. It occurs only when a violent attack is launched upon them. That was the case in Londonderry last year. I have seen stones thrown at processions, but I do not think that I have ever seen any thrown by the people processing.
<P>
I wish that every member of the Committee had taken the opportunity to observe a procession, to see how well-organised it was. Hon. Members from Scotland will have seen Orange processions there. As the Minister will know, they are large processions, but on the occasions that I have attended them I have not seen much trouble. The Minister will also be aware that, as far as the police are concerned, the chance of trouble at the average Orange or loyalist procession is minimal. The chance of trouble during an AOH procession is also minimal.
<P>
I have seen a certain amount of difficulty at all processions, but it has rarely been caused by those taking part; it has always been the hangers on who set off the trouble. The problem for the procession organisers is that they do not know who will turn up. There are always some nut cases who will appear at any procession.
<P>
I have never been to the Durham miners' gala. I have often thought that I should like to go, as it would be well worth looking at.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It no longer takes place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Perhaps it has gone. I am sorry about that, because when I saw it on television it was a wonderful occasion. I do not think that there were many objections to it, or that there was any stone throwing or petrol bombing. Why should we not accept that most processions are peaceful?
<P>
In clause 7(6)(a) on page 5, line 7, states that the commission shall have regard to
"any public disorder or damage to property which may result from the procession."<P>

<P>
As I have joint pointed out, that gives a completely wrong perception. There is not much difficulty, public disorder or damage to property from the people taking part in the procession. It is those who lawlessly attempt to prevent the procession, for whatever reason, who are normally engaged in such activity. That was the case in Londonderry in December. I am not aware that any damage to property was committed by any member of the Apprentice Boys or by any band member taking part in the procession. Those who opposed it Sinn Fein-IRA caused up to 5 million of damage in Londonderry city. That damage was aimed at two targets: the RUC, to prove that it was unacceptable, and the Apprentice Boys, to ensure that the maximum number of voices of ordinary citizens was raised against them.
<P>
Should we ban processions because violent people are prepared to use violence and to murder? When someone throws a petrol bomb, it is not for love of the individual who is the target. The bomb is thrown to cause serious injury or death and maximum damage. Is society to run away from the inherent consequences of such a ban on processions? Are we to be bulled by mob rule which, as I have said, is orchestrated by Sinn Fein-IRA, that violent and dangerous organisation into banning processions that would otherwise be peaceful? Are the law abiding citizens really to be driven off the streets?
<P>
If the commission is to have regard to the public disorder and damage to property that might result from a procession, it is absolutely essential that it should also have regard to the damage and disorder that would result from a counter-demonstration. The commission must ensure that the counter-demonstrations are controlled, because they are the source of the trouble, not those who hold the procession.
<P>
There is also the question of the disruption to the life of the community. The major processions are those on 12 July and 15 August. They can take some hours to pass a given point which causes some disruption to the life of the community over several hours. But, as many of these processions pass through the commercial hearts of towns, and as 12 July is a bank holiday, the disruption to the business community is minimal.
<P>
The Apprentice Boys marches in Londonderry bring a large number of people to the town and commercial interests are delighted. The amount spent must be extremely large. Although there might be some disruption, there is an awful lot of spending: it is like Christmas coming in the middle of summer, and it is widely welcomed by those who benefit. Certainly, I have never seen a procession in Londonderry when there was not a lot of money spent much of it in pubs but mainly by those who come as spectators rather than as marchers. The disruption to the life of the community is minimal, even on those large occasions and it is certainly very profitable when the shops are open.
<P>
Many of the minor parades take place in the evening, when there is no commercial activity. Similarly, others, such as church services, take place on a Sunday. Many others are of very short duration anything from 10 minutes to half an hour so the disruption is minimal. The disruption that could arise here is caused not be the procession, but by the counter-demonstration and counter parades, the stone-throwing and all the rest. In such circumstances it is surely essential that the words in the amendment are included in the clause.
<P>
We must also consider the impact that the procession may have on relationships within the community. As everyone says, only a small minority of people really object. On many occasions they have to be carted in from a 30-mile radius. I should have thought that many in the community could be even more offended by a procession being stopped than by it being allowed to go ahead.
<P>
Another educational process needs to be carried out here with the protesters, who should be taken gently to one sid and told that their actions will cause great difficulties for relationships with the nationalists and Unionists, and with the protestant and Roman catholic members of the local community, who until then probably took little notice of each other's processions, as they attended only their own. That is another good reason why the amendment should be accepted.
<P>
I have lived in the nationalist community all my life. My family have lived there for 250-300 years. We have very good relations with 95 per cent. of the population. There was one chap who, 20 years ago, blew up and killed three RAF officers at Glenshane. My relationship with him would not be all that good; it would not be close and warm, to put it mildly. He is still in prison having served 17 years for those murders. But such people are a tiny minority. Whenever I walk up and down Dungiven street, the reception that I get from my neighbours whom I have known all my life is perfectly reasonable. They all know that I am an Orangeman. They know that I take part in these processions, and most of them have no objection. It is over within 15 minutes. That is it. The only people who have brought about an increase in the length of time and a disruption to the community are those who have objected. They are a tiny minority of the total population.
<P>
Clause 7(6)(d) includes the phrase
"(whether in relation to the procession in question or any previous procession)".<P>

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not sure to whom the relevant wording applies. I suppose it could apply to someone who took part in a procession and misbehaved. Perhaps that was the intention; I am not sure. However, I am certain that many people who are involved in objecting to processions would be covered by the wording. Yet they are excluded, because the words in my amendment are not in the Bill. If they were, the commission could have regard to the fact that Mr. Hassan in Bellaghy, for instance, was very prominent in stopping an Orange and Black procession there. It could call his behaviour into question. It could call into question the behaviour of Mr. Rice in the Ormeau Road and that of many people who have deliberately set out to disrupt and prevent processions.
<P>
Without my amendment, those people would not have to be approached and the commission would not have to point out to them that their behaviour was wrong and lacked benevolence and willingness to get on with their neighbours. The inclusion of the amendment would create a good case for the commission telling people such as Mr. Rice and Mr. McGlinchey if he should ever come back that their past bad behaviour meant they could not be allowed to take part in a counter-demonstration. They could be told to go home and behave themselves.
<P>
If such people had to go home when required by the commission, what a wonderful change it would make on the streets. There would be no counter-demonstrations, thuggery, stone throwing, petrol bombing, disruption, riots, buses and shops burnt or looting. That is a rich field which the Government have totally ignored. I wish that they would take on[Mr. Ross]
board the vital need to deal with counter-demonstrations. I know that a little element right at the end of the Bill is relevant to that, but it is not comprehensive enough. If the matter is to be dealt with it should be dealt with comprehensively throughout the Bill.
<P>
I judge from the Minister's face that he has been growing more and more impressed by the force of my argument. I hope so, because if he does not take it on board people will see the measure as an anti-Orange procession Bill. As I have already said, there are grave dangers in people's perceptions in that regard.
<P>
Clause 10(1) contains the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in the case of any proposed public procession"
<P>
and that is a further case showing the need for the amendment. If the Secretary of State is to have an opinion, he should base it not only on the actions of people who intend to be in a procession, but also on those of people who intend to oppose it or rather, she should do so. I keep forgetting that the Secretary of State is a lady. I am not sure whether the legal concept of one gender encompassing the other still holds good here. I hope so. In considering whether to prohibit a procession the Secretary of State should have regard to the possible behaviour of those who oppose it and to the need to control those who have wicked intent.
<P>
What I have said in the past few minutes applies to clause 10(2)(a) on serious public disorder or serious damage to property. It is interesting to note that no mention is made of damage to people as opposed to property. Is there no possibility of damage to life and limb? I have already mentioned the attempt to disrupt a children's procession on Remembrance Sunday some years ago and there have frequently been other occasions when young people it is often young people who get involved in these sad events have been badly hurt, burned or killed as a result of public disorder arising from opposition to processions. The Government should carefully consider those aspects of the problem.
<P>
I have already covered "serious disruption" of life in the community and argued that it is not likely to be serious unless a procession is opposed. As I have said, we should be more concerned with those who oppose a procession than with the procession itself. As to "serious impact" on relationships, in view of the small number of people who object to the processions, there cannot really be a serious impact. It might be serious for a few individuals, but the concept of serious impact on relationships across the community is grossly overstated.
<P>
Clause 10(2)(d) brings us to
"undue demands ... on the police or military forces".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is interesting. I wonder how many processions where there is no opposition make such "undue demands"; and what does the term mean? If heavy demands are made on the police and military forces, they are by and large not the result of the procession but of opposition to it. The demands are largely the result of violence and we should consider who foments it.
<P>
I can recall Protestant involvement requiring a permanent police presence only in connection with the Roman Catholic church in Ballymena. In recent years that was the only occasion on which demands were made on the security forces as a result of a demonstration or protest by the Protestant community. In all other cases, the problem arose as a result of opposition to a procession and for no other reason.
<P>
Why do the Government believe that the "undue demands" placed on the security forces by counter-demonstrators should not be taken into account? What means do they propose to deal with attempts to prevent the free expression of culture and of loyalty to the Crown exhibited by the loyalist orders in all their processions?
<P>
We are told that the Secretary of State may "in the public interest" prohibit the holding of a procession. Again, I argue that after the word "procession", the provision should include the words "or counter-demonstration". If counter-demonstration is not inserted, how will the Secretary of State deal with the problem of prohibiting a procession that is peaceful? It becomes violent only when violent objections are made to it. We are not talking about minor objections, but about major attacks in which many people appear on the street and are prepared to behave in a grossly offensive and illegal fashion, throwing petrol bombs and so on.
<P>
If the Secretary of State is to prohibit processions, it should be clear that it is not the procession but the counter demonstration, involving sit-down protests and a riotous mob, that should be dealt with. The Bill should not deal with people who are trying to behave in their normal, peaceful and reasonable manner.
<P>
Clause 10(2)(a) refers to
"any serious public disorder ... which may result from public processions of a particular class or description in that area".<P>

<P>
Public processions of a particular class or description are normal, legal processions. I am not sure what "particular class or description" means in that context. Perhaps we will be told. If the Bill does not cover counter demonstrations of a particular class or description as well, it will ban legal processions of a particular class or description, but not have the power to ban another particular class or description of assembly that is organised by Sinn Fein-IRA or anyone else.
<P>
It is essential that the concept of counter demonstrations and counter processions is covered by the Bill. That would enable the Secretary of State to take into account the evils that those organising them are intent on causing. Evil does not result from the procession: it arises from those who oppose it. Because that is so, it is essential that the Government make it clear that they are concerned not only with those who behave legally, but will take into account the behaviour of those who are out to stop the right, which has always been exercised, to walk along the Queen's highway. Of course, the objectors would not call it the Queen's highway.
<P>
Clause 10(2)(b) relates to the banning of processions because of
"any serious disruption to the life of the community".<P>

<P>
My earlier arguments apply now. I do not see any good reason why the Secretary of State should ban a procession because it is causing serious disruption. A procession does not cause serious disruption; the counter procession causes it. I do not see why on earth those who are out to cause serious disruption and to fracture good relationships in the community should get away with it. Relationships within the community can be built up only through mutual understanding, and mutual understanding and tolerance demand that processions should be allowed to proceed.
<P>
Paragraph (2)(d) refers to the
"undue demands which such processions may cause to be made on the police or military forces".<P>

<P>
All that I have said earlier applies in this case: I do not see why the Secretary of State should not also have to take into account the need to deal with those who are intent on violence. That should be inserted in the clause.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
At the end of that subsection is a statement that if
"it is necessary in the public interest to do so, he" <P>

<P>
the Secretary of State 
"may by order prohibit the holding of all public processions of that class or description in that area in that period." <P>

<P>
that is, 28 days. Again, there is the matter of banning only one particular type, class or description of public procession. In other words, the Secretary of State could say, "right, we intend to ban the AOH procession in Dungiven on 17 March but I will allow an Orange procession on the same day." That would not be very sensible and I would object to it. If we propose to take full account of all the consequences of a ban, surely the Secretary of State needs to take account of the fact that there might be objections and counter demonstrations. All sorts of things may go wrong and it should be in the Bill that such matters can be taken into account. At present that cannot be done as there is nothing in the clause to that effect.
<P>
Subsection (3) repeats in one form or another all that went before. Again, the Secretary of State needs to take into account all that I have said in respect of the previous subsections. It applies with equal force to subsection (3) which mentions the life of the community, the impact of processions on relationships and the serious damage to property caused by disorder, but says nothing about the damage to limb and the danger to life that may result. Perhaps that should be inserted at some stage.
<P>
The last part of the subsection states that the Secretary of State may
"prohibit the holding of all public processions in that area in that period."<P>

<P>
The only difference between subsection (3) and subsection (2) is that subsection (2) states "that class or description", and subsection (3) states "all public processions". I should have thought that other amendments might have taken care of that point so that there would be no need for two subsections. We may come to that matter in due course.
<P>
Clause 10(8) states:
"A person who organises or takes part in a public procession the holding of which he knows is prohibited by an order... shall be guilty of an offence."<P>

<P>
Here, an individual who takes part in a public procession which is prohibited is guilty of an offence. There is no mention whatever of those whose behaviour caused the public procession to be prohibited. They get off scot-free. That is tilting too much in one direction. In such circumstances, the Minister should tell us clearly why the words in the amendment are not already in the Bill.
<P>
Clause 12(1) relates to circumstances in which
"a constable... reasonably suspects that a person is... consuming intoxicating liquor".<P>

<P>
The powers of the constable apply to someone who is taking part in a public procession. What about a destructive group drinking on the sidewalk? What about people in a counter-demonstration? Apparently, they can drink and carry on as much as they like nothing can be done about them. Surely, that is wrong. It is essential that the police should have the power to act in those circumstances. I am merely trying to insert in the Bill the power for a constable to take action against those in the opposing faction who are misbehaving and drinking alcohol, not necessarily to excess. There is no good reason why the clause should not be so amended.
<P>
Clause 12(2)(b) states that subsection (1) applies to a person
"who is among those who have assembled with a view to taking part in a public procession".<P>

<P>
Such people fall within the same critria as those who are taking part in a public procession but, again, the paragraph does not apply to those engaged in a counter demonstration. The amendment should therefore be inserted in the clause after the words that I have quoted.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. I agree with the main thrust of his argument, on which I shall expound when I speak to my amendments. Does not clause 12(2)(c)(i), which states:
"who is otherwise present at, or is in the vicinity of, a place on the route or proposed route of a public procession"
<P>
take care of the hon. Gentleman's point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I am not sure, because it goes rather wider than my amendment. The clause states "in the vicinity of"; and someone down a side street, in a pub, in a private house, or in his neighbour's front garden could still be in the vicinity. The phrase has a much wider implication than the amendment. Someone who is having a drink in a front garden and watching the procession should not be subjected to the law in that way. If someone wants to sit in the front garden and drink a glass of wine while watching the procession go past, why should not he be allowed to do so? If he wants to sit in his front room drinking a glass of wine and watch the procession go by, why should he not do so. Such totally innocent people would be caught by the measure, but not those in the street who are violently opposed to the procession. The Government have got it wong and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply to my point.
<P>
Clause 12(4) refers to the application of subsection (3) to those in a passenger vehicle being used for the principal purpose of carrying passengers. That has a clear legal definition: I think it must carry at least eight passengers. It seems that the police can stop people on the route or in the vicinity of the route or proposed route of a public procession. By and large, that would not be much use. There will not be many people in the vicinity of the route who are drinking. But if the subsection is[Mr. Ross]
intended to ensure that people going to processions are prevented from carrying intoxicating liquor, I am all in favour of it. The strictures should also apply to those who are involved in any counter-demonstration. People can go to a counter-demonstration with their bus full of liquor and drink all the way there and the police cannot take it from them. But if people are going to the procession, they will be caught.
<P>
The powers of the constable in subsection (9)
"may only be exercised in relation to a particular public procession in the period ... beginning 6 hours before".
<P>
I find that odd, and interesting because it seems that those who are going to a public procession can be stopped from drinking six hours before it. A person may say to a constable, "I am not going to the public procession. I have no interest in it and I am not taking part in it. My interest is in opposing it. I will be sitting down in the road and taking part in a counter-demonstration." The constable may be able to nail him for breaking the law in that respect, but he will not be able to take the alcohol from him. That applies six hours before the procession starts. That is a very long time. I do not know how on earth that can have the force of law or how it can be implemented. In any case, if people have gathered several hours before a public procession with the intention of stopping it, the law should be applied to them as well as to those who intend to take part in that procession.
<P>
Then there is the matter of ending at midnight
"on the day on which the persons taking part in the procession disperse."
<P>
A situation could occur in which the procession might be over if it had been allowed to go ahead and everyone might have gone away, but if it had been opposed, and perhaps abandoned as a result, the people who opposed it could celebrate until midnight. Midnight might be several hours away, or half an hour or five minutes away. Those people should also be caught by the proposed law, and that can be done only if the Government insert the words that I have tabled in the amendment.
<P>
The same need for clarification applies to subsection (10) of caluse 12. The law should apply to everyone concerned, and every time that the word "procession" appears, the words "and counter demonstration" should be added. In that way people will know that if they demonstrate against a public procession, they, too, will fall foul of the law.
<P>
I have some final observations on the general issue of drink at processions. We all know that drink can inflame passions on such occasions. As the people who want to oppose processions will be trying to get themselves hyped up in order to do that, and as it is in the interests of those organising them that they are as uncontrollable as possible, it is even more essential that drink be denied to them for as long as possible. The law should come down heavily on those who are organising or taking part in counter-demonstrations to ensure that the consumption of alcohol is kept to a minimum because that would have a calming effect.
<P>
I have spoken at some length to this large group of amendments. I hope that the Minister will consider them and that he will accept them.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has done the Committee a service by pointing out that amendment No. 209 was incorrectly grouped. That was an error and it will be dealt with when we consider clause 10. He also mentioned amendment No. 177, but that is not included in the group. I think that he is mistaken about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I welcome the opportunity to speak to the amendments tabled in my name and grouped under clause 1. Later on I wish to seek some guidance about the two new clauses among my amendments.<P>
<P>
There is a general theme to all the amendments that is in line with the views of the hon. Member for East Londonderry. The amendments are intended to introduce some form of balance into the legislation. The organisers of parades or processions are being asked to jump through a number of hoops; the amendments would ensure that those who want to oppose lawful processions will have to jump through the same hoops.
<P>
I start by reading the North report which, as has been pointed out several times this morning, was instigated by the previous Government because of the serious problems described on Second Reading and this morning. They had problems with Drumcree and similar problems were inherited by the current Government.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let us get this whole matter into context. Of the 3,000 or more parades taking place in Northern Ireland every year, there are problems with only a small number where there tends to be well organised opposition, such as in a few key areas like the Ormeau road. We know about the events at Drumcree; the recent incidents in Londonderry also suggest that there are and have been problems with marches in that city. I do not want to rehearse the arguments used on Second Reading as I would doubtless be called to order if I did. I simply want to stress that there are not that many problem areas. Where there are problems they tend to be where there is well organised opposition.
<P>
I referred to the North report and will refer to it on many occasions this morning because it provides the moral, intellectual and practical imperative to look again at the Bill. I am not coming up with original ideas. Most of those encapsulated in my amendments are contained in the North report, not specifically in many instances, but their main aim and thrust is in that report. I shall refer to it to underline that important point.
<P>
I trust that the Minister and his officials, who like me have no doubt read the North report from cover to cover, are aware of some of these suggestions, but have not yet chosen to incorporate them in the legislation. I ask them to revisit that report and to seek ways of taking some of the amendments on board. Along with the hon. Member for East Londonderry I think that the amendments will introduce some much needed balance to an uneven and unbalanced piece of legislation.
<P>
The perception in Northern Ireland, certainly among a large section of the Unionist community, is that the Bill is an Orange-bashing measure. I know that it is not. The Minister knows that it is not. But we have to deal with that perception. This morning, and probably this afternoon too as I will not have finished by lunch time, I want to encourage the Minister to look afresh and see whether he can build in some balancing factors that will give that perception a fillip and encourage Orangemen and Unionists to see that those who are causing the difficulties also have responsibilities under the law, just as they have rights under the law.
<P>
We do not need to look at the North report to recognise that at the heart of the whole problem is the antagonism between two sections of the community and the polarisation that results when there is confrontation between those two groups which then pervades the whole of society in Northern Ireland. People tend to take sides and the whole community is influenced by events such as those at Drumcree in a way that can shatter confidence. That can put back for months, if not years, the very careful, confidence-building work that the Government are attempting and doing successfully and continuing on from our work when we were in Government.
<P>
As the North report says, at the heart of the problem is the fact that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the present procedural arrangements provide no structured opportunity" 
<P>
the emphasis is on structured opportunity 
<P>
"for those of whatever background to whom a parade is unwelcome to make their views known, either to the organisers or to the police."
<P>
That appears in paragraph 16 on page 5 of the executive summary.
<P>
Paragraph 21 of the executive summary acknowledges that
<P>
"there were competing rights the marchers' and residents'/community's which had to be taken into account".
<P>
All the way through the report the balance between the rights of marchers and of residents and communities appears. Those rights and responsibilities are not evenly distributed in the Bill.
<P>
The North report carried out a Northern Ireland survey, the results of which are in paragraph 22 on page 6 of the executive summary. Some of the findings are illuminating. Paragraph 22 states that
<P>
"in the event of a dispute between residents and marchers, 88 per cent.")<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the people who responded to the survey 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"said a negotiated accommodation should be sought".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It adds that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if an accommodation is not possible, 79 per cent. said a binding decision should be taken by someone else".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Among the survey's other findings, it found that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"85 per cent. agreed with the statement that a set of rules should be developed for all marchers from both traditions."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The public are responding in a way that seeks even handedness. Finally, the survey found that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"well over 90 per cent. of all respondents said that civil disobedience would not be jusitified either if a contested parade was allowed to go ahead or if a parade was re-routed or banned."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All the responses are in the 80 per cent. plus category.

<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that many Unionists do not accept the bases for such surveys? If one surveys a certain number of people and asks them the right question, one might get the answer that one requires.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I cannot say that I am grateful for that intervention.
<P>
We must accept the integrity of eminent people such as Dr. North. I do not think for one moment that the survey was conducted in anything but the most appropriate and proper manner. I certainly believe its findings; it is statistically significant.
<P>
The survey sends a powerful message to us. As legislators, it is up to us to take that message on board. I concur with the hon. Member for South Down that we must try something new. The responses to the survey very much reflect that view.
<P>
Given that only a few parades and processions cause problems, surely we can find a way through the maze to sort the problem out. It is not big in terms of geography, location or incidence. However, it is powerful in the size of the groups that confront one another in the key areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> The hon. Gentleman touched on an important point when he said that problem involved only a few parades. Does he accept that many on this Bench and in Northern Ireland share my view that the problem reflects the number of manifestations of opposition that Sinn Fein-IRA can manage at this time? Once the problem of some parades is disposed of in a manner that is favourable to Sinn-Fein-IRA, the number of other objections will grow. There are not merely a dozen or so objections, but as many as the IRA want to create.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. That is why my amendments and new clauses seek to tie down the IRA and Sinn Fein in the way that the Orangemen and the Unionist community feel that they are being tied down by the possible implications of decisions taken by the commission on their historical parades. I shall develop that theme, but my essential aim is to achieve balance and even handedness, and to ensure that the IRA, Sinn Fein and anyone else who wants to disrupt parades must comply with the law and are seen to do so.
<P>
The Minister will say that clause 13, which deals with the breaking up of public processions, does what the North report required. Offences under that heading are listed under the clause which I do not want to remove from the Bill. It is important, but it deals with individual circumstances, not with massively organised opposition on the lines of the IRA-Sinn Fein in Drumcree and what we saw in Londonderry not so long ago. I want to focus on the organised groups and to get them to give the commission, in good time, information that allows it to reach the right decision about a parade and that also equips it to invoke sanctions later if the law is broken. Such provision is included in my new clauses.
<P>
To return to the subject of the survey, I find the figures reassuring. They send a powerful message. We are not doing our job as legislators if we do not take cognisance of that. Most importantly, the majority of people do not want parades to be banned. They want them to go ahead. They believe in the freedom to parade and march and that counter-demonstrations and protests against an agreed march are unacceptable. That is at the heart of the problem and we need to deal with it. Most law-abiding people are offended by the events of Drumcree.
[Mr. Moss]
<P>
The North report discusses the need to accommodate competing rights. I refer the Committee to page 13 of the executive summary, paragraph 47 of which states:
"We have looked in particular at the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the United Kingdom Government has signed. It is clear from the documents that there is a right of peaceful assembly. This right, on which is based 'the right to march', while important is not absolute. It is subject to limitations which are to be found both in the international documents and in the general law to protect the rights and freedoms of others or for the prevention of disorder or crime."<P>

<P>
It continues:
"The important rights of residents, while less clearly stated, can nevertheless be inferred from the same sources; but they again are not absolute."<P>

<P>
The next paragraph states that changes proposed pursuant to the report, in legislation, must provide for even-handedness. It continues:
"It is clear that since the rights of neither group are absolute, our proposals for legislative and other changes must provide for reasonable proportionality in the balancing of those rights. In a democratic society this may mean that some people potentially of any background or tradition may have to put up with things that they would prefer did not happen."<P>

<P>
The thrust of the report is even-handedness, balance and words which I like "reasonable proportionality". My argument about the Bill is that it does not display that reasonable proportionality. Hence my amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has dealt with European legislation. Does he accept that under British law people have the almost absolute right peacefully to parade the public highway?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I agree entirely, but nowhere in the Bill or in the North report is it suggested that that should not happen.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I think that under English law there is no right to parade at all. As the law stands, one is entitled under the common law to do that which is not prohibited. There is no inherent right, but under the European convention on human rights, which the Government plans to incorporate, such a right will plainly exist thereafter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am indebted for that intervention to an eminent barrister who has put me in my place. I had assumed that as a common man I had a right to do something unless I was prevented from doing it. We seem to agree on that point.<P>
<P>
Let us return to the meat of the North report recommendations. In following through its views on even-handedness, it was considered necessary to treat both sides of the parades equation the public procession itself and the potential protest against it.
<P>
I want to consider paragraph 65 on page 18 of the executive summary of North report. It deals with identifying three different documents that it was proposed should be drawn up and published by the commission the guidelines, the procedures and the code of conduct. What does North say about them? Paragraph 65(b) mentions
"the procedures to be followed by the police, the Commission, and organisers of parades, open-air public meetings and protests"<P>

<P>
Under (c) it refers to
"a code of conduct governing the behaviour of participants and protesters at a particular event."<P>

<P>
The summary enlarges on the subject in paragraph 70 on page 19. It states in (f) that the procedures should cover
"what is expected of protesters".
<P>
There is long list there but I am homing in on (f). Paragraph 71 deals with the code of conduct which should, it states, cover the behaviour of protesters as well as protesters.
<P>
Chapter 13 of the main report goes into greater detail on all the issues. Paragraph 40 recommends that
"a Code of Conduct should be introduced covering the behaviour both of participants in a parade and of protesters."
<P>
It continues:
"This even-handedness emphasises again the need to exercise rights with responsibility and restraint. The Code itself would butress the right to peaceful assembly and evident respect for the views of others."
<P>
The report falls shy of being prescriptive regarding the detailed contents of a code but it provides a demonstration on page 181. Under the heading "possible elements in a code of conduct for parades", part I deals with general behaviour for anyone participating in a parade; part II with detailed arrangements for behaviour in the vicinity of sensitive locations; and part III with general behaviour for anyone participating in lawful protest against a parade.
<P>
Some of the provisions relating to behaviour are important and I shall read some of them out. For example,
"While lawful protesting is a right, it is to be exercised responsibly. All participants and protests should avoid behaviour which could reasonably be perceived as threatening, abusive or insulting; obey their stewards; abide by the conditions in this Code of Conduct; must not display paramilitary-style emblems; avoid using any words or behaviour which would be likely to cause offence or to stir up sectarian antagonism; must not attempt to stop a legal parade; must behave with due regard to the rights and feelings of others; must not deface or destroy any symbols treated as important by the other tradition; must comply with police direction in line with the legislation."
<P>
I could continue, but everyone in Committee has a copy of the report and can read it. This is a major recommendation in the North report that does not appear anywhere in the Bill.
<P>
A very important element of balancing is missing from the Bill, and that is why I tabled amendments. I have called them counter-demonstrations, but I am more than happy to change the term to protesters or protests, or even to use both words. That is open for discussion and negotiation. Essentially, we are talking about implementing some of the recommendations which have been hitherto ignored by those who framed the Bill. I appeal to the Minister to look carefully at this. Here is a partial solution to reintroduce some balance and change the perception in the Unionist community that the Bill is terribly one-sided.
<P>
Dr. North perceived that. He and his colleagues understood that. They discussed the issue. They talked to many people in Northern Ireland and they received a balanced view. It is an excellent report. We should implement its full thrust rather than simply choose elements of it which lead many Unionists to believe that the Bill is directed solely at them and what they perceive to be their historic legal right to parade.
<P>
Amendment No. 5, which I tabled with the hon. Member for East Londonderry and his colleagues, simply requests the insertion of the words "and counter demonstrations" at the end of clause 2(1)(c) so that it would read:
"to keep itself generally informed as to the conduct of public processions and counter demonstrations".<P>

<P>
There is every reason to accept that amendment. In paragraph 12.29 on page 140 the North report recommends that the commission's remit should include
"arranging for contentious parades and protests to be monitored".<P>

<P>
That recommendation is also repeated on page 187 in chapter 13 at paragraph 51. The report states that the commission should be responsible for monitoring not only the contentious parades but the protests that go with it. Amendment No. 5 does just that. I hope that the Minister will accept that that ought to be part of the commission's remit as it was clearly stated in the North report.
<P>
In paragraph 52 of chapter 13, under the heading "Sanctions for Breaches of the Code", the report examines ways in which the commission could have the powers of sanction made available to it. It concludes that it should have those powers but not just against breaches of the code of conduct for parade organisers. It adds:
"We envisage that similarly the Commission should be able to have regard to a breach of the Code by protesters."<P>

<P>
First we need to insert a code for protesters in order to have a breach of it. There is a logic to what I am attempting to do. If one puts in a code for protesters, there will be powers for the commission to take sanctions against breaches of that code by protesters or those involved in counter-demonstrations.
<P>
The North report adds that the commission should have regard
"in considering any parade proposal to any evidence of previous breaches of the Commission's or of an approved Code of Conduct, whether by participants or protesters."<P>

<P>
The entire thrust of the North report is to consider both sides of the equation.
<P>
I shall describe my amendments in a logical sequence. Clause 3 deals with a code of conduct for those organising parades. Amendments Nos. 82 and 83 would add the requirement on the commission to set up codes of conduct for those involved in counter-demonstrations.
<P>
Clause 5 deals with the guidelines that the commission will have to set up. The Minister told us that that has more or less been done. It would be nice to see them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> They have been published.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Very well.
<P>
Amendment No. 84 would require the commission to set up guidelines of its functions under section 7, and new clause 2 would require it to set up guidelines for counter-demonstrations.
<P>
Clause 6 deals with advance notice for public processions. Organisers of the processions must give notice to a local police station, which presumably will pass it on to the commission. New clause 1 would require those who intend to organise a protest or counter-demonstration of the kind that has been witnessed in certain locations to give notice to the commission of what they intend to do. They should inform it how many people will turn up and what type of protest it will be. A peaceful protest is entirely reasonable and acceptable, but some protests involve the sort of petrol bombing and mob violence that we saw in Londonderry.
<P>
By requiring the protesters to set down the nature and scale of their protests, we would give the commission the potential to at least make a balanced and sensible decision. Under the Bill, parade organisers will have to go through that hoop, but a massive protest could be organised against the parade at the 11th hour or within a day or so. We know that IRA-Sinn Fein is able to do that. The only recourse that we will have in those circumstances will be for the Chief Constable or other senior police officers to step in and either ban or postpone the parade.
<P>
The advance notice that would be required by new clause 1 would place a responsibility on the organisers of counter-demonstrations. That means that not only will the commission have information on what is likely to happen, but a clear statement of intent will be required of the counter-demonstrators. If they do not adhere to what they say they will do, they will break the law as defined in other clauses. Similarly, if parade organisers do not do what they say they will do, they will be guilty of breaking the law and will be subject to a penalty.
<P>
Clause 7 deals with the commission's powers to impose conditions on public processions, including the power to ban them. New clause 2 would give the same power to the commission to set conditions for counter-demonstrations or protests or to say that, in absolute cases, protesters cannot counter demonstrate or that they cannot counter demonstrate in the form that they say they want to.
<P>
Clause 10 refers to the Secretary of State's powers to prohibit processions.
