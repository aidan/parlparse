							<a name="07012365000384"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> Good morning, Sir John, and welcome back to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07012365000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
emphasise that amendment No. 20 deals with the release of official
statistics, not their pre-release. It is about run-of-the-mill
statistics, not national
statistics.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000385"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
that introduction, as we will come to pre-release statistics in clause
11.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000386"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> Thank you, Sir John. The rules would apply to
people issuing statistics and a Minister commenting on the statistics
and it is the view of those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 160</div>in the statistical community outside this House thatthe rules
need to be codified and clarified. This amendment and amendment No. 85
have the support of the Society of Business Economists.</div>
					<a name="07012365000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rules and principles are
matters for the board to decide in detail, but we are perfectly
entitled to suggest in the Bill at least some of the areas that the
board should include when it decides that detail. By tabling the
amendment, I am simply suggesting some of the matters that should be
included. It is unlike the Minister&#146;s drafting of clause 8,
which prescribed exactly, and only, what the board&#146;s areas of
concern should be. The amendment states only that among the things that
it must decide in detail it would be useful to include the location of
the release, the issuer of the release and the time period for
commentary on it. I shall consider each of those in
turn.</div>
					<a name="07012365000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Location is
fairly obvious. Most official statistics will be released by the
Departments and some will be released by the board, but it should be
for the board to decide the location of the release.</div>
					<a name="07012365000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the manner of the
release, the Treasury Committee was concerned about that point.
Paragraph 145 of the report
states:</div>
					<a name="07012365000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Finally,
in the interests of improving public confidence in official statistics,
we recommend that the independent statistics office release alongside
National Statistics its own considered and non-partisan
interpretation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, it would not simply be left to the Minister, his advisers
or his press officers; therewould be an independent commentary
from the new independent board itself. That is extremely
important.</div>
					<a name="07012365000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important that there would then be an interval before
politicians&#151;the Minister, his advisers or the press
officers&#151;get involved, so that for a period of perhaps two or
three hours the public could see the virgin statistics presented with
an independent, non-partisan commentary alongside them. It would later
be open to the Department, the Minister or his advisers, to add any
top-spin if they wanted to do so. The board must decide on those three
important matters when it draws up its code. The amendment does not
tell the board precisely how to do that; it merely states that these
are three matters at least which the code oughtto
cover.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07012365000387"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Vincent Cable</b> (Twickenham) (LD): I wish to speak in
support of this amendment and also amendment No. 85, which is part of
the same group, under the name of myself and my hon. Friend. It is a
little confusing, as my amendment relates to clause 11 but it is
subsumed within the group because issues of release and pre-release do
come together when we are considering where the authority
lies.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000388"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Order. We are aware of that and, of
course, grouping amendment No. 92 here also deals with both release and
pre-release. We thought it might be simpler for hon. Members to confine
this present area of debate to release and then deal with the
pre-release issues when we come to clause 11, which specifically deals
with pre-release. I hope that that is
helpful.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 161</div>
					<a name="07012365000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000389"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> Yes, indeed, it is very helpful. Thank you. The
central point which unifies the debates about release and pre-release
is where the authority should lie for setting the rules. The point that
we are trying to make in our amendment&#151;the hon. Member for
Sevenoaks made precisely the same point&#151;is that the rules
governing both release and pre-release should be set by the board in
the interests of statistical integrity. It is the details of those
processes that determine the integrity of the system. They should not
be set by the Minister operating through secondary legislation. That is
the essential point about this.</div>
					<a name="07012365000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I simply want to reiterate what
the hon. Member for Sevenoaks has just said. The rules regarding
release cover several different aspects, one of the most important of
which is location. There is a very strong view in the statistical
community that the rules governing location should provide for a split
between the two functions of announcing the results of statistical work
and commenting on them. The best way of preserving that distinction in
the release process is physically to separate them. In order to
preserve the integrity of the process, it should be the board, rather
than Ministers directly acting through regulation, which determines how
that is done.</div>
					<a name="07012365000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
not simply a question of getting it right in relation to location, the
number of people, or the timing, but also of embedding in legislation a
clear mandate for the board to set the rules under which release as
well as pre-release takes place.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07012365000390"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): I, too, would
like to speak in support of amendment No. 92 and amendment No. 20,
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks, which is more or
less completely included in amendment No. 92.</div>
					<a name="07012365000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following the guidance of the
Chairman, I will not address pre-release, although amendment No. 92
does contain a very important provision that pre-release should be a
matter for the board, which I will come to in the next set of
amendments. It is valuable to have an opportunity to discuss release
practices separately from the rather higher- profile and more
controversial issue of pre-release. It tends to be overshadowed by
pre-release as an issue, but actually it is probably as important if
not more important in getting the structure of the Bill right. The
approach taken by the Chairman is very useful for the Committee as it
considers important issues in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07012365000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not only are release rules
important in relation to the trust that we are trying to rebuild with
this Bill but clear and well-enforced rules on release of statistics
are an essential part of a strategy for economic stability. The release
of key economic indicators, such as the inflation or unemployment
rates, can have dramatic effects on financial markets. Providing for
orderly and controlled release of such figures is vital to prevent
unnecessary market volatility. If we are to retain a flourishing City
of London, it is vital that rules on release of statistics are properly
enforced and complied
with.</div>
					<a name="07012365000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s announcement on Second Reading that there would be a
move to a single hub for the release of statistics was welcome. I
understand that that approach has already been adopted successfully in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 162</div>Wales. I acknowledge that the Minister has moved on a number of issues
during the consultation, and this further response to the concerns
raised by the statistical community is welcome. However, I look forward
to hearing further details about his plans, and I have a number of
questions for him.</div>
					<a name="07012365000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Done right, I think that the
idea of a central statistical hub could do much to mitigate what the
Royal Statistical Society described as</div>
					<a name="07012365000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an impossible tension at the
heart of the release
process&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012365000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition
Members have already adverted to some of those problems. Political
control over the release of statistics is responsible for some of the
most significant spin problems that the Bill should be tackling. We
believe that the perception, and very often the reality, of the spin
placed on figures by Ministers at the time of release is a significant
factor in undermining public trust in official
figures.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000392"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I was going to come on to one, but briefly, I
was concerned about the decision of the Department for Education and
Skills to issue GCSE figures, which were good, on the same day as
keystage 1 and 2 figures, which were poor. The Statistics
Commission concluded that policy advisers had put pressure on the
statisticians to release the figures on the same day in order to divert
attention from the poor
ones.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07012365000393"></a>
							<b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I
recognise her concerns, although from my experience a lot of this seems
to be made up by the media. Does the hon. Lady agree that there is
equal concern about the way in which figures are picked up by the
media? Very often, they are misinterpreted because not enough
information is provided about the context of the
figures.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000394"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. There is concern about the way in which the media deal
with figures and statistics. That is certainly true. But political
interference is the greater concern, and the Bill should focus on
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000395"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> Does the hon. Lady agree that the media regularly
whip up concerns, often in collusion with Opposition parties, and that
the Bill needs to provide clinical precision on the way in which
figures are dealt with in order to remove those concerns as well as
those that she is expressing about Government
interference?</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000396"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I do not agree that there is a problem with the
press whipping up concern about political interference in statistics.
For example, on the problem with the GCSE results, it was not tabloid
journalists who intervened or expressed concerns but the Statistics
Commission&#151;the very body set up by the Government to deal with
such problems.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 163</div>

							<a name="07012365000397"></a>
								Rob
Marris:
						</b> The hon. Lady gave one example, not two. However,
I caution her. These matters are delicate, as she pointed out. Had
those statistics been released separately, allegations might well have
been made in the press that the Government were sitting on poor key
stage 1 and 2
statistics.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000398"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point&#151;we
do not want the Government sitting on figures for a sustained period.
The commission recommended that there be a set date every year for the
release of particular statistics in order to deal with his concerns and
to ensure that statistics were released in an orderly fashion and that
the public could look at them individually, rather than having the news
on some displaced by the news on
others.</div>
					<a name="07012365000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is
that the first person to issue the news and analysis of a certain set
of statistics has significant power to influence how the figures are
understood. If the reforms in the Bill are to be successful, they will
have to put in place measures to prevent that power from being abused
for political ends. The Opposition believe that that can be achieved
only if we allow the board to set the rules on how Government
statistics are released to the public. We have received many
representations from organisations such as the Royal Statistical
Society and the Society of Business Economists on the importance of
that approach. For the RSS and its president, Tim Holt, it is one of
the most important components of a successful reform of statistical
services.</div>

					<a name="07012365000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The British
Society for Population Studies has expressed the concern:</div>
					<a name="07012365000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ministers continue to
decide what National Statistics will cover, decide who will have access
to National Statistics before their release...and then release
those statistics through their departmental Press Offices, often
accompanied by their own press releases. This has been a key reason why
the description of roles set out in the Framework has not achieved the
desired improvements in public
confidence.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">They are
referring there, of course, to the 2000 framework.</div>
					<a name="07012365000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the difficulties that
can arise have been illustrated by the reference to the problems
regarding the publication of GCSE results. Essentially, positive GCSE
figures were deliberately released on the same day as poor key stage 1
and 2 results, which showed a decline in reading standards, in order to
distract attention from those poor results. In the view of the
Statistics Commission, there was concern that policy advisers had
deliberately intervened to bring the release days together, precisely
to distract attention from the bad
news.</div>
					<a name="07012365000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving aside
cases such as that, where there seems to have been deliberate political
manipulation, even in cases where those who are issuing the release try
to be impartial, there is a tension when they are responsible for both
explaining what the numbers mean and justifying the policy and
performance of their Department. A key problem that has been brought to
my attention is that it is not always the departmental statisticians
who are in charge of the content of the release and the release
process&#151;often it is the policy advisers who take control. Bill
McLennan put that problem as follows:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 164</div>
					<a name="07012365000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;The
reality of statistical life outside the ONS...is that with all
statistical releases from...departments, statisticians do play a
part, but so do bureaucrats, economists, ministerial advisers and even
ministers. In general, it is not the statisticians who decide what is
released, when it is released or how it is released, although they may
give some advice. The bottom line is that the final decisions lie with
the Minister. In fact, all national statistics that are not released by
the ONS are ministerial releases. I&#146;d be very surprised that
when push comes to shove if political expediency doesn&#146;t always
take precedence over
objectivity&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012365000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now,
Mr. McLennan had a very cynical view of how politicians
operate, but it is worth emphasising that such a state of affairs
contributes to a lack of trust in the process.</div>
					<a name="07012365000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also worth recognising
that we have a problem that seems to relate to departmental statistics
and not really to the Office for National Statistics. As I understand
it, there are strict procedures for the release of ONS statistics,
particularly in relation to sensitive economic matters. There is an
argument for extending the ONS model and procedures to the release of
other important statistics from
Departments.</div>
					<a name="07012365000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
some questions for the Minister. The most important of all is this:
will the board have the authority to set the rules on how national
statistics are released? The views of the Minister on pre-release are
clear&#151;he does not believe that the board should set those
rules&#151;but does he accept that other rules relating to release
should be set by the board? Also, would he have any objection to the
code of conduct covering release practices, and does he envisage it
doing so?</div>
					<a name="07012365000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
his proposal for a new statistical hub for the centralised release of
official statistics away from Departments, who will manage that new
central press office? Will it be the board, and will the cost of
managing it come out of the board&#146;s budget? Will this central
hub cover only national statistics, or will the board have the choice
of including other official statistics and the power to require that
they are also released through the central statistical hub? Will any
statistics other than national statistics be released through that
central hub?</div>
					<a name="07012365000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important, as hon. Friends have said, that the new hub is physically
separate from the Departments to try to mitigate some of the problems
that we have heard about. That separation seems to be more or less
implied by the Minister&#146;s statement on Second Reading, but
perhaps he could confirm that. Does he envisage the hub being located
on ONS premises? Does the closure of the London headquarters of the ONS
have any impact on that? Those operational questions may be too
detailed, but if the Minister can give us an indication of how he sees
the system operating, that would be of some reassurance to the
statistical community.</div>
					<a name="07012365000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">A key issue is who will be in
charge of issuing the release. Will it be the statisticians in the ONS
or will those who prepared the statistics in the individual Departments
come to the new central hub to issue the release? Will policy advisers
take part in preparing and issuing the release or will the board be
able to determine who is involved? Again, if the board wereto
have control over the process, that would do much to mitigate the
concerns that we have heard about spin.</div>
					<a name="07012365000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the board be able to set
rules to prevent ministerial comment for a certain period after the
release, as advocated in the amendments? If the board 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 165</div>can produce its own interpretation of the numbers before the Department
gives its justification for the policies that underlie them, that could
contribute significantly to securing the impartiality and integrity of
Government statistics. Even a fairly short period would do much to
separate the analysis and presentation of what the numbers mean from
the ministerial justification for the policy. That would do much to
restore the trust in statistics that the Government seek to achieve
through their reforms.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07012365000399"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): It was my intention to
address amendment No. 92 to clause 10(4), but with your indulgence, Sir
John, I shall address the issue of pre-release, as per your guidance,
in the debate that follows.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000400"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> That is most helpful. Amendment No. 92 relates
to clause 10, but also to the issue of pre-release, which arises in
another clause. I did not want to prevent debate on the second aspect
of the amendment, but it is perfectly appropriate for the hon.
Gentleman to deal with it in the debate on clause
11.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000401"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):
						</b> May I
welcome you back to the Chair,Sir John, and hon. Members back
to the Committee? This group of amendments deals with release
arrangements and, as you helpfully said in your guidance, with
pre-release. That is also dealt with in the next group of amendments,
which relate to clause 11.</div>
					<a name="07012365000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn first to the subject of
release practices. Under clause 10, the board already has the ability
to prepare, adopt and publish a code of practice. That code may well
include guidance on all aspects of release practices, except
pre-release access, for which clause 11 proposes special arrangements,
and we shall discuss those in due course.</div>
					<a name="07012365000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad that the hon. Member
for Chipping Barnet recognises the importance of the orderly release of
statistical data to financial markets and the City of London, and that
is why the current code covers the handling of release practices. That
should lead her, as it does me, fully to expect the board to include
similar rules and guidance on release practices in the new code. I hope
that that clear statement is sufficient to reassure the hon. Member for
Twickenham, too.</div>
					<a name="07012365000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is precisely to separate policy commentary from statistical releases
and to remove the perception of political interference in releases that
the Government are committed to the principle of a central publications
hub. I therefore suggest that amendments Nos. 85 and 20 are
unnecessary. Nothing in the Bill prevents the board from laying down
principles and guidance relating to the location of releases, the
persons responsible for issuing releases or the timing of releases;
indeed, as I said, I would expect it to do so.</div>
					<a name="07012365000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the matter of the location
and the person responsible for issuing statistical releases, the
principle of the hub is important, as I outlined on Second Reading. The
hon. Lady asked me a series of detailed operational questions, and we
are continuing to work on the new arrangements. I will report to the
House when I can appropriately. We will examine the questions she posed
this afternoon.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 166</div>
					<a name="07012365000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">An additional feature when
considering the principle of setting up a central publications hub is
how to accommodate the particular circumstances of the devolved
Administrations. The hon. Lady mentioned the arrangements in Wales. The
devolved Administrations will retain responsibility for wholly devolved
statistics. However, when I am in a position to confirm arrangements
for such a central publications hub and when it will become
operational, I hope that some of the concerns expressed in the
amendments today and by commentators can be
settled.</div>
					<a name="07012365000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
generally, as I have already argued on earlier amendments, the
intention, which I believe that the Bill captures, is for the content
of the statistics board&#146;s code not to be prescribed in
legislation but to be left to the determination of the independent
statistics board, with the exception of pre-release and of data
sharing, which we will come to presently. Specifically, the hon. Member
for Sevenoaks argued in amendment No. 20 that the code should include
rules and articles relating to the release of official statistics,
including details about the location of release, the person responsible
and the period of time after publication during which departmental or
ministerial comment is not permitted. Quite apart from the amendment
resulting in a farcical situation, where the press and Opposition would
be free to comment on releases while the Department and the Ministers
responsible for their preparation and for the policy were not, I cannot
accept the amendment. I believe that the content of the code should be
left tothe independent statistics board. As I said, I expect
the board to follow through on many of the features of the current code
of practice and to cover the concerns of the hon. Gentleman. The board
will certainly have ample scope under the Bill to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07012365000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 85
makes a similar pitch to amendment No. 20. On the basis of my
explanation of the Bill and of the Government commitment I
gaveon Second Reading to the principle of a central
publications hub, which should settle many of the concerns behind the
amendments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his
amendment.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000402"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I should like to respond briefly before my hon.
Friend the Member for Sevenoaks returns to his amendment. I welcome the
Minister&#146;s statement that the new code will be expected to cover
release practices. I regret that exceptions still make the pre-release
book, but we will come to that. I recognise that some of my questions
blend into operational matters, on which the Minister can obviously not
give a detailed response today, but not all do.</div>
					<a name="07012365000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would briefly like to put two
key questions to the Minister again. Will the board call the shots on
how the new central publications office is run? Will the board decide
which statistics have to be released and which do not through the
central publications hub? Will the central publications hub cover
statistics outside the national statistics system or will it be
confined just to national statistics? In closing, I would hope that the
Committee will be prepared to vote on amendment No.
92.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000403"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The hon. Lady asked me again at least two direct
questions. Let me give direct answers. The principle of the central
publications hub, which the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 167</div>
						Government are committed to setting up, would be to
ensure that all national statistics were published through that hub.
Secondly, I would expect the board to have ultimate responsibility for
the operation of a central publications hub, although I am not in a
position to confirm that because, as I have explained, we are still
working on the details, many of which have yet to be determined. As I
have explained, beyond national statistics, the board, through the
code, is free and has the scope&#151;indeed we have the code
already&#151;to set standards and procedures for the release of wider
official statistics.</div>
					<a name="07012365000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that is clear, direct
and, as far as I can give at this point, an answer to the hon.
Lady&#146;s questions. If the Opposition press the amendment, we will
have to ask my hon. Friends to resist
it.</div>

							<a name="07012365000404"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> I am slightly disappointed by the
Minister&#146;s reply and I am a bit puzzled. He is arguing two
things simultaneously. He is saying that the code can include all these
various things and that, although it is up to the board, it will
probably get around to doing them. At the same time, he has told the
Committee that the principle of a central publications hub is important
and that it is something that the Government is going to do. He cannot
have it both ways. He cannot say these are matters for the board to get
around to and that they probably will and then, on the other hand, say
there is one really important thing that the Government are going to
do. That is
illogical.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000405"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Has the hon. Gentleman not just argued, and is not
the amendment designed to ensure, that a central publications hub will
be an essential feature of the architecture of the new system? If
itis, I would have thought he would welcome our commitment,
which is entirely consistent with a belief that the board should draw
up independently the code of practice covering the range of matters set
out in the Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000406"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> I hope that we are not misunderstanding each
other. If the Minister is saying that the principle of a central
publications hub is vital, I do not understand why he is not prepared
to ensure that the code will include the things that I have
discussed.</div>
					<a name="07012365000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously
the Committee does not have the full details of how the central
publications hub will operate, but we know two things. First, the
Government are going to set it up, as the Minister explained. It will
not be done by the board or the existing ONS. Secondly, the Minister
conceded that it was likely that the new board would have
responsibility for operating the hub. That is not quite the same as
ownership. It is not the same as saying that the hub will belong to the
board and that it will be totally responsible for it. So it looks as if
the board will be managing the day-to-day operations of the central
publications hub on behalf of the Government who have set it
up.</div>
					<a name="07012365000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am still
slightly puzzled as to why the Minister wants to reject the amendment.
Perhaps we are simply debating the difference between
&#147;may&#148; and &#147;shall&#148;. Given that this code is
not enforceable, a weakness to which the Opposition have constantly
drawn attention, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 168</div>I think it is useful to put into statute the key areas that Parliament
wants the code to cover. That is why I tabled amendment No. 20 and that
is why I think it would be useful to have something along its lines in
the Bill. However, having looked carefully at the drafting of amendment
No. 92, I think that it would be preferable because it is slightly more
comprehensive. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Of course there is welcome agreement
across the Committee that the code&#146;s content should be a matter
for the board. However, we are considering one or two things that
relate to its content, and in order to strengthen the new code, we
should learn lessons from the current non-statutory code.</div>
					<a name="07012365000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Statistics Commission has
expressed concern that there are ambiguities in the current code which
have made it difficult to enforce. We touched on that when we discussed
my amendment to require authorities to look to the board for
interpretation of the code, and I need not go over that again. However,
according to the commission, the fact that much of the current code is
non-prescriptive makes it difficult to make an independent judgment on
compliance. It seems from its experience that the commission needs
something shorter, simpler and more imperative in style.</div>
					<a name="07012365000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be useful to know how
the Minister thinks that the new code of practice will interact in this
context with the civil service code. It is important that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 169</div>efforts are made to ensure that the two can be reconciled and operate
rationally alongside one another.</div>
					<a name="07012365000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I re-emphasise that in drafting
the code it is important for the board to look to the international
treaties to which the UK is subject to learn lessons and to draw useful

is appointed and up and running it will find it useful to draw on that
work.</div>

code and the provisions of the code that the statistics board is likely
to produce. I have confirmed that the board is likely to draw on, and

service code, as the hon. Lady suggests. On that basis, I hope that she
is prepared to give a fair wind to the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000428"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Under your expert guidance, Sir John, we
come to the issue of pre-release. The thrust of amendment No. 21 and
consequential amendments Nos. 22 to 25 is that, as has been stated so
often, pre-release should be a matter for the board ratherthan
for Ministers. I am not alone&#151;it is almost universal&#151;in
my belief that the provisions on pre-release are the biggest single
mistake in the entire Bill. The amendments give us an opportunity to
put it right and put the independence of statistics beyond all
doubt.</div>
					<a name="07012365000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will be for
the Minister to explain why he believes Ministers should keep control
over the arrangements for pre-release. The Government have adopted an
extraordinary position: in essence, they are saying that Ministers
should decide how Ministers should behave. I do not know whether you
are a cricketer, Sir John, but that is like giving batsmen the ability
to decide whether the leg before wicket rule should apply to them. It
is wrong in principle and wrong in practice.</div>
					<a name="07012365000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The practice of pre-release has
grown to a large extent. When the Treasury Committee considered it, we
rapidly came to the conclusion that it was far too extensive and
involved too many people. Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 would oblige the
board to publish a list of people granted pre-release access. At the
moment, it is necessary to trawl various websites to establish exactly
who is entitled to pre-release access to each statistical series. I
would start the other way around: if pre-release is to exist at all, it
ought to be a privilege. The board should therefore be obliged to
maintain a register of persons entitled to
it.</div>
					<a name="07012365000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who is entitled to
pre-release access? It might interest you, Sir John, to know how
extensive the practice is. To take relatively humdrum statistics such
as the series on weekly deaths in England and Wales,14 named
civil servants get two and a half days&#146; advance notice of how
many people have died. Three of those 14 are in the Health Protection
Agency. One might think that it is a little late to inform the HPA of
deaths in the previous
week.</div>
					<a name="07012365000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">A series of
statistics of more obvious economic importance are those on the labour
market. Of course, they were the statistics famously abused by the
Prime Minister in his speech to the TUC annual congress this
year&#151;he leaked them two days before they were due to be released
and then sent the Cabinet Secretary, of all people, to apologise. How
many people would the Committee estimate have pre-release access to the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 171</div>labour market statistics? There are 18 people in six Departments who get
more than two days&#146; notice of them and a further 22 in nine
Departments who get pre-release access &#147;through the press
office&#148;.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07012365000350"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div>
					<a name="07012365000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words,
40 named officials have two days&#146; advance notice of the likely
unemployment figures. One might well ask, &#147;Why?&#148; The list
of those entitled to that information of course includes important
figures such as the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor.
There might be a case for arguing that the Governor should have two
days&#146; advance notice of the unemployment figures. However, the
last two officials on the list of those 40 people are referred to as
&#147;Treasury official clearing brief&#148; and &#147;Treasury
official preparing brief&#148;. Do 40 people, including Treasury
officials preparing a brief, really need two days&#146; notice of the
unemployment statistics? I think
not.</div>
					<a name="07012365000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us turn to
the consumer price index&#151;the key index of inflation on which the
Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee has to base its judgment, and
which was the cause of some excitement last week when inflation edged 3
per cent., which was very close to the target range. Some 12 people
have advance access to the consumer price index, &#147;through the
press office&#148;&#151;11 in the Treasury have two days&#146;
notice of the inflation figure and one hapless official in the
Department of Trade and Industry gets one day&#146;s notice. The
Committee might be surprised to learn that a further 12 officials have
access to the CPI, including a Mr. Gareth Jones from the
States of Guernsey policy and research unit and a Ms Hayley Harris from
Customs and Excise who gets the figures in advance only in February.
All 12 officials seem to get differing amounts of
notice.</div>
					<a name="07012365000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
mess. It is an abuse, and it has spread far too widely. There is no
justification for 12, 20 or 40 different officials having far more
advance notice than everyone else of what the figures are going to be.
Nobody in Parliament gets that degree of notice, so we need to clean
things up. I have not argued, and neither did the Treasury Committee in
its report, that there is no case whatever for pre-release. There might
well be a case for some very senior officers of the state, such as the
Governor of the Bank of England or the Chancellor, having access to
information as early as it is available&#151;a day or two before
publication. However, 40 people should certainly not have two
days&#146; advance notice, and certainly not Treasury officials in
charge of
briefing.</div>
					<a name="07012365000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Treasury Committee looked at that matter, it concluded that pre-release
was far too extensive and needed to be cut back. Our recommendation was
three hours. It is worth pointing out that the Committeewas
Labour-dominated and included six former Ministers&#151;people who
had experience of pre-release and who saw no case for the extension.
Furthermore, the Minister himself accepted that the practice had got
out of hand. He gave evidence to the Committee on14 June and
said, in answer to question
287:</div>
					<a name="07012365000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;First of
all, I would certainly accept that the pre-release arrangements
contribute to the perception of interference in
statistics.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 172</div>
					<a name="07012365000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be fair to him, he went on to argue
that there had been very few proven cases of abuse, but then
said:</div>
					<a name="07012365000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nevertheless,
there is a perception
there.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is a
perception that the independence of statistics is threatened by the
extent of the pre-release arrangements, we should take the first
opportunity in the Bill to put the independence of statistics beyond
all doubt. I cannot understand the point of setting up a new
independent board but then saying that only Ministers should continue
to be allowed to regulate the arrangements that apply to themselves,
albeit with the approval of Parliament, and that that is the one matter
with which the board should not deal. That is wrong in practice, as I
think I have demonstrated, and certainly wrong in
principle.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000429"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> I wish to speak in support of the amendment. Other
amendments in the group relate to the issue&#151;including those that
stand in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and
Camborne&#151;particularly amendment No. 82, which would specify a
time period for pre-release, in line with what we believe to be good
international practice. Amendments Nos. 43 and 86 give effect to the
proposal that we should clearly specify a non-political process for the
determination of
pre-release.</div>
					<a name="07012365000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
focus on the time period and on why it is seriously bad practice for
the UK to have long periods of pre-release. There are several reasons
for that, the first of which is that the longer the period of
pre-release, the greater the opportunity for political mischief,
through spinning and interpreting the data. I mean
&#147;political&#148; in the broadest sense&#151;I am not talking
just about Ministers, but about advisers and press officers. That could
also include civil servants, who might not act in a political capacity
but who might feel that a set of statistics puts their Department in a
particularly bad or good light, and will want to emphasise certain
elements, given the opportunity to do so. We have seen many examples of
that happening with social
statistics.</div>
					<a name="07012365000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
even if the practice that I have described was exaggerated&#151;it is
possible that we exaggerate what goes on&#151;there is none the less
the issue of public perception. We discussed at considerable length on
Second Reading the figures showing poor public perception of Government
statistics. The pre-release process has helped to forge those negative
political
perceptions.</div>
					<a name="07012365000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">A third
reason is that the longer the figures are out there, the greater the
likelihood that they will be leaked inadvertently, with damaging
consequences. There have been some examples of that; for instance, in
2003 somebody leaked the retail sales statistics. They are a key
market-moving indicator, but they got out in a way that they should not
have.</div>
					<a name="07012365000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s argument is that there is a case for pre-release,
which we concede in the amendment. We do not take the extreme
fundamentalist view that there should not be pre-release, although some
countries do take that hard line. I understand that the Nordic
countries have no pre-release at all. Norway, Finland and Denmark have
no pre-release, and neither does Austria. However, we concede the
principle thatthere is a justification for pre-release under
certain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 173</div>
						circumstances, which are quite clear. There are some
important economic statistics that move markets, whether it be the bond
market or foreign exchange markets. The shift in numbers might be such
that action by Government is required to deal with it. If the
Government have not been given at least some opportunity to take
action, market movement will be considerably influenced by the release.
There is therefore a need for a certain time period, in order to
prepare action. Many developed countries accept that principle, which
is also accepted in the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07012365000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it
is worth reviewing what most other developed countries actually do,
which is quite different and much less permissive than what occurs in
our country. I shall just go through some of the key examples.
Australia, for example, has a three-hour period, which is a little more
generous than this amendment allows for, but of the same order of
magnitude; I think that the Select Committee suggested a figure of
three hours. Crucially, that three-hour pre-release provision applies
to only a handful of key economic statistics&#151;it does not apply
at all to social data. France has a period of only one hour, which is
again restricted to key economic data, unemployment, trade and
inflation figures. Ireland gives a period of one hour for the most
important economic statistics and two hours for national accounts, with
no pre-release for anything else.</div>
					<a name="07012365000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">One would have thought that the
United States was at the frontier of good practice because its
statistics affect the world, not just the US. As I understand American
practice, the President has pre-release access of only 30 minutes for
key economic statistics. We have not got around to this topic at all in
the Bill, but the Americans hve not only release and pre-release rules,
but post-release rules. Civil servants are not allowed to comment on
the data for at least an hour after they have been released. The
American practice is very severe, disciplined and restrictive in terms
of both the amount of pre-releases allowed and the statistics that are
pre-released. If we are to adopt good international practice, we should
be aspiring to something much closer to the American model.</div>
					<a name="07012365000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, by way of contrast, I
cite Canada because its position is much closer to what the Government
aspire to. The Canadians allow 15 hours for Ministers and18
hours for civil servants. Essentially, they pre-release data at the end
of the afternoon, the day before they are due to be published.
Ministers and civil servants get a night to reflect
on the data and react to it, but crucially again, that is allowed for
only a handful of key economic statistics, and does not apply to social
data.</div>
					<a name="07012365000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can have an
abstract argument about the pros and cons of pre-releasing data, but
the question the Government have to answer is why British practice,
even as modified under the Bill, is so far out of line with that in the
rest of the developed world, and in a way that perpetuates either bad
practice or the public perception of it. This is a key clause in the
Bill and I hope that the Minister is listening to the criticisms that
are coming from those on the Opposition Benches and the profession, and
I hope that he will respond sympathetically to the
amendments.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000430"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The Opposition believe that it would
significantly strengthen the proposed reforms if the board were given
the power to decide the rules on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 174</div>ministerial pre-release access to statistical information prior to
publication. That is why we tabled amendment No. 92, which the
Committee just had the opportunity to vote on, to put pre-release into
the code of practice. That is also why we support amendment No. 21 and
why we will be voting against clause 11 when we get the opportunity to
do so.</div>
					<a name="07012365000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government genuinely wish to devolve power over statistics, as they
claim, and make a genuine step towards &#147;modern economic
governance&#148;, they should not exclude pre-release rules from the
devolution proposed. In theory, under the logic of the scheme expected
in the Bill, one would expect pre-release rules, at least in relation
to national statistics, to be included in the code of practice and thus
to be determined by the new reformed structures that the Bill will set
up.</div>
					<a name="07012365000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s decision to put pre-release into legislation, by
making a specific exception to the principle that the board decides how
national statistics are dealt with, significantly undermines the
credibility of the reforms they propose. It seems to us that there is
nothing inherent in pre-release rules that makes them qualitatively
different from other rules governing the treatment of statistics. Not
only should the board have the power to decide the rules, but I hope
that it would choose to exercise that power to restrict the current
scope of pre-release access. Like many others who expressed a view
during the consultation process, we believe that the time has come to
tighten the rules on
pre-release.</div>
					<a name="07012365000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pre-release
should be restricted by limiting the range of statistics to which it
applies, reducing the number of people who are granted access and by
shortening of the period of access.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000432"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> As a provisional view, I believe that
fundamentally the board should decide. There is a case, however, for
allowing Ministers four hours advance notice of data that are not
market-sensitive. That is a little more than the Treasury Committee
suggested, but it is still a significant tightening of the rules. In
the case of market-sensitive data, and drawing on the conclusions of
the Treasury Committee, I think that there is a case for allowing
Ministers access after the markets close on the day before release at
9.30 the next morning. I stress that those are provisional views. The
board should decide: taking into account all the relevant factors and
bringing its expertise to bear, it should make an impartial decision.
There is a case for pre-release access, but it should be more
restricted than under the current rules. Retaining limited pre-release
access for Ministers could be useful in relation to the points made by
the Minister on Second Reading, in providing for emergency measures
that need to be taken in relation to sensitive statistics and allowing
Ministers to prepare a response to them.</div>
					<a name="07012365000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is my provisional view of
the minimum justifiable duration of pre-release access. I am prepared
to let the board decide, as it is more likely than the Minister or I to
get the answer right. We both havean interest in the
outcome&#151;neither of us is truly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 175</div>disinterested. The board, on the other hand, will have to consider only
the public interest and is therefore most likely to be impartial and
objective and to be seen as such. The thrust of the reforms presumes
that the board making the decision is more likely to inspire trust in
the integrity of that decision than if it were made by Ministers, as
the Financial Secretary proposes. Let us take the decisions out of the
hands of the politicians. We believe that we can trust the board to get
the decision right. The premise that we can trust the board to make
sensible and objective decisions surely underlies the thrust of the
reforms.</div>
					<a name="07012365000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat the
appeal that I made to the Minister on Second Reading to publish the
draft secondary legislation that he intends to propose under the
clause. Only then can the Committee have an informed debate about the
consequences of clause 11 and the regime that the Government envisage.
When does the Minister plan to publish the secondary legislation? Will
he propose any changes apart from the reduction of the access period to
40.5 hours to align the pre-release access period for market-sensitive
and non-market-sensitive statistics? That was the change that he
announced on Second Reading. Apart from that change, are the current
rules to be replicated? Will pre-release access apply to the same
number of people? If not, what restrictions does the Minister envisage
imposing? Will pre-release access apply to the same statistics as it
does now? If not, what restrictions does the Minister propose? Will any
distinction be made in the pre-release rules between official and
national statistics? Will the National Statistician or the board have
any discretion to extend early access in particular cases in which they
feel there is a pressing need to do so? Will the procedures for
investigating pre-release access be strengthened, given that the
Statistics Commission has expressed concern that they are
insufficiently robust?</div>
					<a name="07012365000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">That the time for reform has
come is clearly illustrated by the responses to the consultation, of
which virtually every one expressed dissatisfaction with the present
rules. The Minister&#146;s announcement of a reduction in the access
period for non-market- sensitive data, from five days to 40.5 hours, is
welcome, but it does not go far enough to allay the real concern of the
statistical community and the general public about pre-release access,
about which my hon. Friends and other hon. Members have already
spoken.</div>
					<a name="07012365000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
UK&#146;s rules stand out as being out of line with best practice and
International Monetary Fund standards. As we have heard, many countries
do not allow pre-release access at all and in those that do, the
longest period is considerably shorter than it is here. Tim Holt, the
former head of the Government statistical service, makes a compelling
point when he says that the UK
rules</div>
					<a name="07012365000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;give pre-release
access to more people, for a longer period and for a much wider range
of statistics than in any other...country&#148;.
</div>
					<a name="07012365000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Sevenoaks highlighted the lengthy list of people to whom pre-release
access is given. When I sent to Tim Holt a few examples of the people
listed by Departments as having pre-release access, he told me that he
was dismayed by the number of people who have been granted access since
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 176</div>Government&#146;s framework for statistics in 2000 explicitly gave
Ministers authority over pre-release.</div>
					<a name="07012365000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact that Ministers get
figures days in advance of the public and their political opponents
fuels the understandable concern that that time will be used to prepare
the ground and spin figures. The Prime Minister&#146;s leak of
unemployment figures to the TUC was a clear and blatant breach of the
rules, which moved the markets. Still worse, the Prime Minister put a
misleading spin on the figures. He said:</div>
					<a name="07012365000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Tomorrow I think we
shall see&#151;for the first time in some months&#151;a fall again
in unemployment which will be very welcome indeed&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012365000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact, the International Labour
Organisation measure of unemployment increased that month, although
there was a modest fall in the claimant count. Thatis an
example of a leak that was spun for political reasons.</div>
					<a name="07012365000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading, the Minister
pointed out that the cases listed by the Statistics Commission in which
figures have been leaked in that blatant manner prior to publication
are limited and sometimes the leak was inadvertent. More prevalent is
the use of pre-release access to give Ministers an advantage in
preparing the ground for bad news. Professor Roger Jowell of City
University highlighted the fact that</div>
					<a name="07012365000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the period during which ministers
have sole access to new statistics is a great deal
longer&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">in the UK than
elsewhere. He
concluded:</div>
					<a name="07012365000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
allows bad news to be discounted in advance and generally encourages
leaks.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The discounting
of bad news identified by Professor Jowell is the more prevalent
problem. Simon Briscoe, statistics editor of the <i class="I">Financial
Times</i>, told the Treasury Committee:</div>
					<a name="07012365000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there is an awful lot of
softening up that goes on.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">To illustrate that he talked about a
story on the importance of animal testing in medical research that was
placed in the media shortly before the Government were due to publish
statistics on the rising levels of animal testing, so a controversial
statistic was softened up in advance by a story that might reduce the
public&#146;s concern about the statistics.</div>
					<a name="07012365000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liam Halligan, economics editor
of <i class="I">The Telegraph</i>, has also provided evidence that the Government
routinely use their early access to statistics to assist their news
management. He
said:</div>
					<a name="07012365000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I can
tell you from personal experience that pre-release is constantly used
by the government to divert the media from numbers which make for
uncomfortable reading. It allows pre-emptive spin, with government
departments sometimes putting out data designed to contradict evidence
about to be revealed by the industrious, independent boffins at the
ONS.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should remember that even a few cases in which inside information on
the content of upcoming statistical releases is used to massage the
news agenda can significantly undermine confidence in official
statistics. Len Cook said of the problem:</div>
					<a name="07012365000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In my time as National
Statistician, I was never made aware of any statistics that were
falsified, but I believe that the prevalence of practices by Ministers
to influence the context of release for politically sensitive
statistics has led to some believing that even the worst practices
could occur.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The laxness
of the rules on pre-release significantly contribute to undermining
trust.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 177</div>
					<a name="07012365000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many have called for a
restriction on ministerial access to pre-release, including the
Statistics Commission. Professor David Rhind said on its behalf:
</div>
					<a name="07012365000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commission starts from the position that Ministers and departments must
accept the principle that no political capital should be made from
statistics before they are in the public domain and that the
opportunity to do so should be severely
restricted.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
official Opposition share many of the commission&#146;s concerns in
this matter. Charles Bean, chief economist at the Bank of England,
acknowledged:</div>
					<a name="07012365000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do recognise that
narrowing, or even eliminating, existing arrangements for Ministerial
pre-release access might have significant benefits on the
public&#146;s perception of the integrity of the statistical process,
which might outweigh the gains in policy formulation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In the
light of the concerns that have been expressed, I appeal to the
Minister to accept that if his reform is to restore trust in
statistics, it should embrace fully the controversial issue of
pre-release. If we can trust the board to make decisions on how other
statistical matters are determined, we can surely trust it to make
decisions on an issue that has such a significant impact on public
trust in official statistics and on Ministers&#146; ability to spin
them for their own political purposes.</div>

							<b class="B">Ms
Celia Barlow</b> (Hove) (Lab): I rise to defend the principle
of pre-release access to statistics for Ministers. It is sadly cynical
to claim that the privilege automatically leads to abuse as Opposition
Members have tried to make us believe. It is right, for example, that
the independent Phillis review of Government communications considered
the practice and questioned the 40.5 hours advance notice for
Ministers. That is an arbitrary figure, and although I agree with the
hon. Lady that the time can be changed according to circumstances, to
cut it to four hours would surely prevent Ministers from giving the
statistics any serious treatment&#151;<i class="I">[Laughter.]</i> The Phillis
review did not question the principle.</div>

Braintree is referring to. However, all the evidence shows that abuses
have been extremely rare&#151;I acknowledge that they have
happened&#151;and that if they have happened, they have been minor
and the Government have apologised where necessary.</div>
					<a name="07012365000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The general principle of
pre-release access needs to be kept. Ministers are publicly
accountable. We have talked about market-sensitive statistics. Let us
imagine 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 178</div>a time&#151;I hope it is far away&#151;when an official economic
statistic sparks an extreme reaction by the financial markets. We know
that that has happened in the past, albeit not recently. That would
have disastrous consequences for mortgage lenders, pension savers and
shareholders. We simply cannot leave the Government unprepared or leave
them only four hours to prepare and expect Ministers to come up with a
reasonable policy reply. How the statistics are used by the media is a
side issue compared to the need for the Government to have the
information on how to govern effectively.</div>

What I find difficult to understand is why the hon. Gentleman feels
that giving Ministers sufficient warning to deal with something that
might affect the livelihood of our business leaders is a mistake. To be
honest, the media spin is less important than Minister&#146;s ability
to deal with problems as they arise. In the past, we have had

					<a name="07012365000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
number of difficulties with the deliberate exclusion of pre-release
from the purview of the board&#146;s code of practice. In many ways,
it is the black hole at the centre of the Bill. We heard much about
&#147;perception&#148; from the hon. Member for Twickenham and my
hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks. The Financial Secretary told the
Select Committee inquiry that he</div>
					<a name="07012365000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would certainly accept that the
pre-release arrangements contribute to the perception of interference
in statistics.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">He then
said that</div>
					<a name="07012365000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Part
of the drive to legislate now to entrench the independence is to try to
deal with some of the problems that are still there in
perception.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
is therefore simple. Does the omission of pre-release arrangements from
the remit of the board&#146;s code of practice harm the perception of
independence? I believe that it does. If the Financial Secretary
disagrees, let him give his reasons.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 180</div>
					<a name="07012365000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The greater
problem is that pre-release has not simply been forgotten, but has been
deliberately removed from the arrangements that are intended to
guarantee independence. We have ended up with a Bill to entrench
independence that does not entrench a significant perceived failing of
independence. The Bill may actually make the problem worse because it
could reasonably be thought that the Government have something to hide
by dodging the bullet on pre-release. Delegating pre-release to the
Treasury and the devolved Administrations puts it firmly out of sight
and out of mind.</div>
					<a name="07012365000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary himself drew the Select Committee&#146;s
attention to the fact that pre-release is a widely accepted principle
internationally, but when it comes to international practice there is
little common ground, and the Government have admitted as much. What
has happened to his commitment to the Committee to look at the details
of current practice? The Government&#146;s response to the Select
Committee&#146;s recommendations was uncommunicative, to say the
least, with four promises of ongoing consideration and precious little
else.</div>
					<a name="07012365000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to probe
further why this specific matter is reserved to the Treasury and the
devolved Administrations when such a decision seems entirely contrary
to the avowed principle of the Bill. Allowing Ministers&#146;
pre-release access to be controlled by ministerial fiat could not give
a more effective shot in the arm to suspicions that there is Government
interference in statistics. The situation is hardly helped by the
requirement of an affirmative resolution procedure.</div>
					<a name="07012365000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The perception of independence
will not be boosted by reassuring the public that if Parliament does
not approve of what the Treasury and the devolved Administrations are
up to, we can just throw it out. Parliament has not managed to do that
since 1969, when I was 11 years old. There is not much chance of the
House getting fired up enough about statistics to choose that issue to
break with that past habit.</div>
					<a name="07012365000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want the Government to
clarify their position. On Second Reading, the Economic Secretary wound
up the debate with a promise that the debate on
pre-release</div>
					<a name="07012365000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will be held
in the House when details of the regulations are published. They will
then be debated in Committee under the affirmative resolution
procedure.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 8 January 2007; Vol.
455, c. 109.]</div>
					<a name="07012365000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may well be
able to debate the regulations made under clause 62 in Committee, but
we can only hope to accept them or reject them. If parliamentary
scrutiny is required, the proper time for a debate on the precise scope
of pre-release would be now, in this Committee, not in a hypothetical
future Committee. It would be preferable if the whole issue were turned
over to the independent board as part of the new code of practice.
</div>
					<a name="07012365000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assuming for the
moment that the House will not reject the Treasury&#146;s proposed
code outright, there is still no scope for it to be improved. It is
therefore cold comfort for the Financial Secretary to argue that the
pre-release code has &#147;special status&#148;. Does he believe
that the rest of the code will be weaker than the previous codes
concerning pre-release because they are merely backed but not
prescribed by statute?</div>
					<a name="07012365000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am curious about how the
Government intend to square the circle. Why did they go to the trouble
of exempting pre-release from the code of practice? The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 181</div>Financial Secretary was clear on Second Reading that the pre-release
arrangements would be vetted and reported on to the House by the board.
He also reassured the House that the board&#146;s general duties
towards coverage, good practice and standards will extend to the
oversight of ministerial compliance with the pre-release code. But if
the board&#146;s oversight of the ministerial pre-release code is so
strong, why not go the whole hog and turn over control of pre-release
arrangements to the board?</div>
					<a name="07012365000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conversely, if the argument is
that the board cannot both propose and police a code of practice, there
are implications not just for clause 11 or the previous clause but for
the whole Bill. The double standards that have been set up between the
board&#146;s code of practice and the ministerial code on pre-release
threaten to undermine the perception of independence. The amendments as
proposed will therefore restore a crucial balance to the code of
practice and to the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="07012365000453"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I have some short points to make onthe
amendments proposed by the hon. Members for Sevenoaks and for
Twickenham. The thrust of the amendments, as I understand it from the
hon. Member of Sevenoaks, is to do with the time limit on pre-release
access and with the number of people to whom information is
pre-released, yet as far as I can see none of his amendments directly
addresses either of those issues. They simply say, to put a gloss on
them, that the board will decide. At least the hon. Member for
Twickenham sets a two-hour limit&#151;which may be a little
tight&#151;in his amendment No.
84.</div>
					<a name="07012365000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to say to
my hon. Friend the Minister that I have some sympathy with the
proposition that there should be a short time limit for pre-release
access&#151;much shorter than the 40.5 hours, which is now apparently
to apply to market-sensitive and non-market-sensitive information.
There seems to have been a convergence in that respect. The Government
have shortened what they inherited in 1997 from the previous
Government, but the limit is too long. Where I disagree with the
official Opposition and favour the position advertised in amendment No.
84, proposed by the hon. Member for Twickenham, is on the proposals
that the limit should be decided by the board. I think that that is a
matter for Parliament. Certainly the time limit and possibly the number
of people who have access&#151;although that would be more
difficult&#151;should be framed in primary legislation, not decided
by the board or approved by an affirmative resolution. The time limit
should be a much shorter period than40.5
hours.</div>

Friend the Financial Secretary to look again at pre-release. Both he
and, on Second Reading, the Economic Secretary said that it would be
reviewed in 12 months&#146; time. I hope that following that review
the time limits will be shortened considerably and included in primary
legislation, not left to secondary legislation or, certainly, to the
board, as the amendments would
have.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 182</div>the Government is that we believe that the board should decide the rules
on pre-release, but the Government believe that that should remain in
the hands of Ministers. Given that within pretty much all other
statistical areas and all other areas of the Bill such matters are left
to the statistics board&#151;which is the purpose of the
Bill&#151;the onus is very much on the Government to make the case
that Ministers should retain control in what is, after all, an
exception to the general rule. The case is not unique&#151;we will be

their case, although we have a specific argument to make in that

					<a name="07012365000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely agree with those
remarks. Given the opinions that my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping
Barnet quoted, and the views expressed by many in the statistical
community on the arrangements for pre-release as they will stand
following the passing of the Bill&#151;if it is passed in its current
form&#151;it would seem that the Government&#146;s proposals will
continue to contribute to a lack of public trust in our
statistics.</div>

					<a name="07012365000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the onus is on the Government to make their case, I hope we will hear a
number of examples from the Financial Secretary. He implied on Second
Reading that he would provide examples of cases in which the Government
have been able to make use of their pre-release access to statistics in
order, not to spin a story, but to develop policy
announcements&#151;in other words, to be able to respond in a way
that the hon. Member for Hove was referring to earlier and in a way
that will allow the Government to react to events.</div>
					<a name="07012365000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Hove
painted a picture that rather suggested a Government micro-managing the
economy and responding to every single statistic, as perhaps was the
case in former times. I think even the Government would argue that a
successful economy requires a framework rather than a number of
discretionary decisions made from time to time. My argument, and the
argument made by many Members, is that pre-release access is used not
for the purposes of developing policy and being able to produce policy
in time for economic statistics so that the Government are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 183</div>able to adapt very quickly but instead for presenting the figures in as
favourable a light as possible for the Government.</div>
					<a name="07012365000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading, when pressed
to illustrate the way in which the Government are able to change policy
or make a policy announcement along with an announcement of statistics,
the Economic Secretary gave an example. As is his wont, he referred to
the workings of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England
and specifically to the way in which it would be useful for the
Government to have access to the consumer prices index some time in
advance of publication so that, in the event of the Governor of the
Bank of England being required to write an open letter explaining why
the inflation target had been missed, the Government would be in a
position to make a policy announcement very quickly. Such a letter has
not had to be written to date, but I am not sure whether the Economic
Secretary was quite aware of how topical his example was. None the
less, it was a useful example and highlights one or two issues about
pre-release that are directly relevant to some of the amendments in
front of us today.</div>
					<a name="07012365000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">While preparing for this Bill,
I looked at this issue and was aware of the 40.5 hours limit on the
pre-release of market-sensitive information. I was interested in some
of the news stories relating to the last meeting of the Monetary Policy
Committee of the Bank of England as it was very obvious that the Bank
of England and the Monetary Policy Committee had access to the CPI
figures not 40.5 hours ahead of their release at 9.30 am on 16 January,
when we learned of the increase in inflation, but some time before
that. For a moment, I got a little excited about this, which is not
something I thought I would ever do. It appeared that the Bank of
England had access prior to what would be required under the usual
rules. My interest was further developed when I noticed the evidence
given by the Governor of the Bank of England to the Treasury Committee
in June of last year when he stated that his committee had 36 hours
pre-release access. At that point I thought, &#147;There is something
quite wrong here,&#148; because the Bank of England clearly had
access before that. However, I am grateful to the good offices of the
House of Commons Library and, in particular, to Mr. Ross
Young, who pursued the matter and made inquiries with the Office for
National Statistics and the Treasury.</div>
					<a name="07012365000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">What emerged was that there is
an exemption to the usual 40.5 hours rule when the Monetary Policy
Committee meets the week before the inflation figure is due to be
announced. That is entirely sensible: the committee clearly needs
access to all the information, and if evidence is available, it should
be provided with it. One can make a distinction between the Bank of
England and the Treasury, notwithstanding the fact that a Treasury
official is present at all Monetary Policy Committee meetings. However,
there is an argument for pre-release access for the Bank of England in
those circumstances. The case highlights the fact that we can trust the
board. The Bank of England has access in those circumstances because of
an agreement between the then National Statistician, Len Cook, and the
Governor of the Bank England that there were good reasons for
it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 184</div>
					<a name="07012365000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">That leads me to the broader
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet. The Bill
gives significant powers to the statistics board. We can argue about
its composition and exactly which roles will be performed by whom, but
there is agreement in the Committee that it is right for the statistics
board to have substantial powers. We trust the board to drawup
methodologies, definitions and so on. Why do Ministers not trust it to
develop sensible, pragmatic rules on pre-release? It is a sensitive
matter and one on which there is concern about ministerial involvement,
and I am yet to be persuaded or hear a sensible case. I look forward to
the Minister addressing those concerns and providing clear-cut examples
of Ministers making use of pre-release statistics in a way that helps
with not just the presentation of policy&#151;that has been the
problem&#151;but its
development.</div>
					<a name="07012365000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">On what
the limit should be and whether it should be four hours or left to the
board to decide, there is a body of opinion that the current period of
time is far too long. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West
acknowledged that. The inevitable result of letting the board have that
power would be that, in most cases, there would be a substantial
reduction in pre-release because the chances are that the board would
be in tune with the consensus among statisticians that a shorter time
is necessary. I do not know whether it would decide on three, four or
five hours, but it would be likely to reduce
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000455"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I am opposed to the board-centred approach, and I
draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to the example that he gave
on the arrangements between the Office for National Statistics and the
Monetary Policy Committee. I understand his point, but given that the
statistics in question are published regularly, a much simpler way of
working would have been for the Monetary Policy Committee to change the
date of its meeting. Instead Len Cook, who has been prayed in aid of by
both the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet,
suggested a longer period. Let us be honest: he did not exactly have a
distinguished career at the ONS. It kept correcting major statistics
when he was at the helm. So the one example that the hon. Gentleman
gives is of a lengthening of the
period.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000456"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I was about to make a point on that. On Second
Reading, the hon. Gentleman asked my hon. Friend the Member for
Chipping Barnet whether she would support the right of the statistics
board occasionally to lengthen the period for pre-release access. I was
going to make that point because there might be circumstances in which
it is right to do that. He makes a fair point: the MPC could meet on
another day. However, I do not intend to explore that issue
now.</div>
					<a name="07012365000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the less, I
believe that a pragmatic approach could be to put powers in the hands
of the board. For the most part, that would involve a reduction in
pre-release access, but there might be exceptions, such as in matters
involving the Bank of England, to which I referred. In such
circumstances, we should trust the board, assuming that the right
people are in place, to make the right decisions. I hope, therefore, to
support a number of these amendments.</div>

							<a name="07012365000457"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> As several hon. Members have said, this is a
considerable group of amendments dealing with some of the most
substantial issues of concern in the Bill. Our debate has reminded us
of the interest in pre-release, which extends beyond the House. My hon.
Friend the Member for Hove mentioned that the Phillis review looked at
those arrangements, as have a number of other external independent
reviews. However, she rightly pointed out the importance of pre-release
to the Government.</div>
					<a name="07012365000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Braintree queried the term &#147;appropriate
authority&#148; and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West pointed him to clause 11(6). I thought that he might have
referred him to the explanatory notes, which the hon. Gentleman might
find helpful as well. However, in a moment, I shall deal with the
reason for the term &#147;appropriate authority&#148;&#151;the
Treasury and devolved Administrations.</div>
					<a name="07012365000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend said that he
sympathised with shortening the time scale for pre-release access.
Although we might differ on the detail, we agree that pre-release is
important enough to be dealt with by Parliament. I am encouraged that
the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire is getting excited about
statistics and that he admits it to the Committee. If he will forgive
me, I shall deal with his points in the body of my comments.</div>
					<a name="07012365000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet made a serious point when she said that no political capital
should be made of statistics prior to release. She is absolutely right
and the new arrangements will help with that: shorter periods of access
for non-market sensitive data, tighter arrangements codified in
secondary legislation and complemented by the release of national
statistics through a central hub and the separation of statistical
figures and commentary from policy or political
commentary.</div>
					<a name="07012365000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
clear case for pre-release access to statistics. That was recognised by
the Treasury Committee in its July 2006 report and acknowledged on
Second Reading and again today by the hon. Member for Twickenham. The
principle is accepted and established internationally with many
countries, including Canada, Germany, France, Spain, Japan and the USA
providing pre-release access to some statistics to Ministers and policy
officials at least a day before publication. The hon. Member for
Twickenham mentioned the United States and my hon. Friend the Member
for Hove asked how tight the systems are elsewhere in practice compared
with the understanding of how they operate in
theory.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07012365000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07012365000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">In particular,
it is worth dwelling on the question of the United States and the
assertion that pre-release access by the US President is restricted to
30 minutes. That assertion seems to be based on evidence given to the
Treasury Committee during its inquiry. I have to say that the Treasury
Committee was misinformed. Witnesses asserted that the President gets
pre-release access that is restricted to 30 minutes, but they misread
the US official guidelines. Let me quote from the Office of Management
and Budget&#146;s statistical policy directive No. 3, published in
1985. It clearly states:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 186</div>
					<a name="07012365000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The agency will provide
prerelease information to the President, through the Chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, as soon as it is
available.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">It then
states:</div>
					<a name="07012365000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
agency may grant others prerelease access only under the following
conditions&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">and it then
lists four conditions,
including</div>
					<a name="07012365000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
prerelease of information under an embargo shall not precede the
official release time by more than 30
minutes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012365000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">That applies
not to the President through the Council of Economic Advisors, but to
&#147;others&#148;.</div>

							<a name="07012365000458"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> I thank the Minister for that correction, but as we
are dealing here not with political debating points but with statements
of fact, could the Treasury produce an explanatory note on this point,
because what he has said directly contradicts what the Royal
Statistical Society said in briefing us? I am referring to its very
helpful little note on international practice on pre-release access to
national statistics. That certainly gave us the impression that, as a
matter of fact, the United States rules are much more restrictive than
the Minister has stated. As it is important that we are all starting
from the same correct basis of fact, could he produce a note explaining
why the Royal Statistical Society is
wrong?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000459"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I am happy to let the Committee have such a note.
It is important that we deal with matters of fact, and that when we
cite figures in our debates we get them right. I will include reference
to the formal returns that the US makes to the International Monetary
Fund on data dissemination and standards, because they confirm that,
for data on national accounts, employment, unemployment, wages and
earnings, consumer prices and producer prices, the President receives a
copy of the actual data release the evening prior to release. I am sure
that the mistake is an honest one and that the Royal Statistical
Society would want to recheck its information sources and correct any
error in the figures that it has been using and has released to the
House, so I will certainly, if it is of benefit to the Committee, as
the hon. Member for Twickenham suggests, prepare a factual note on the
issue.</div>

							<a name="07012365000460"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> This is an interesting exchange, and the Minister
is absolutely right to suggest that it is important for us to be sure
of facts, but does that not make the point that not all scrutiny of
figures before they are released is about spin? Much of it may be about
checking the context and things like that, which are potentially very
illuminating to the reader and the user of
statistics.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000461"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> My right hon. Friend is, as he has been
consistently in our discussions, spot-on. He makes a point in support
of the general principle of pre-release access, particularly for the
Government, although other bodies&#151;the Statistics Commission, for
instance&#151;have made submissions to the Treasury Committee arguing
that pre-release access should be granted also to the media and to
those on the Opposition Front Bench. In fact, the Treasury Committee
recommended that, and although none of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 187</div>the amendments directly proposes it&#151;to be clear, I am dealing
with the general point because it is widely made&#151;amendments Nos.
21 and 22 and amendment No. 92, which we discussed in the previous
group, would allow it. If the concern about pre-release access is for
well
ordered&#151;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000462"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> Amendment No. 92 would just give the board power
to set the rules. It does not say that the board must allow access by
Opposition spokesmen or by the media. I do not understand the point the
Minister is
making.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000463"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I am making the point that if the hon. Lady placed
the responsibility on the board, as under amendment No. 92 and the
proposals in amendments Nos. 21 and 22, such an arrangement could be
put in place. I am not saying that the board must put it in place; that
is not the tenor of the amendments. However, pre-release statistics are
an important issue that has been widely discussed and two of the
amendments that we are considering in this group would allow that to
take place if they were passed.</div>
					<a name="07012365000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">On pre-release, if the concern
is for the well-ordered release of statistical information into the
public realm, to distinguish more clearly between statistical
information and policy comment, and to reduce the risk of disclosing
new figures before the officially planned and appointed time, frankly
there is no better way of achieving exactly the opposite than to allow
the press and Opposition pre-release access&#151;other than perhaps
the requirement to pre-release by uploading to YouTube or
MySpace.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000464"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> The Financial Secretary is making a case against
giving the Opposition and the media pre-release access, but why does he
think the board would not be persuaded to give pre-release
access?</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000465"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The board may or may not be persuaded. There are,
as I have said, a wide range of voices including the Treasury Select
Committee and the Statistics Commission, which, if they are consistent,
would urge the board to do just that. I am arguing why in principle and
in practice pre-release is a sufficiently bad idea to warrant our
ensuring that the framing of the legislation does not accommodate it.
However, it is an interesting question and I would be interested to
know whether the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet agrees with the
Treasury Select Committee and the Statistics Commission that
pre-release access to statistics should be available to the official
Opposition and/or to the
press.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000466"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I am open-minded and open to be persuaded on
that if the board want to go down that route. The thrust of what this
reform should eventually lead to is restricting pre-release access.
That makes me sceptical of the idea of access being extended to
Opposition spokesmen. I am not persuaded of the arguments for such an
extension at the moment although I remain open-minded to persuasion on
it.</div>

							<a name="07012365000467"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that
clarification. She has been very clear and is right to be sceptical. It
is interesting that she takes a position that may not be consistent
with the views of some of her colleagues on the Treasury Select
Committee or on other wider bodies.</div>
					<a name="07012365000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pointed out some of the
perverse practical effects that such a provision may lead to, but
perhaps we should leave those aside and consider the principal case for
such arrangements. Again, I struggle with that. The principle of
restricted pre-release access to named officials and Ministers is well
established in this country and others. That principle is widely
accepted by us and by those on the Opposition Front Benches, which I
welcome. The principal case for pre-release arrangements is surely
based on the fact that it is the Government and not the Opposition or
the media who are responsible for policy and Ministers who are
accountable for it.</div>
					<a name="07012365000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pre-release access allows the
Government to account for the impact and implications of policy when
important new statistics are released&#151;as the public have a right
to expect and as the British media have come to demand. That also
provides a fundamental safeguard and enables the Government to consider
and plan contingency measures that may be needed alongside a
statistical release to guard against a disproportionate or costly
market or public reaction. That is an important point and is
particularly true for market-sensitive statistics. Governments are
ultimately responsible for maintaining economic and financial stability
and pre-release access to data may be necessary to meet that
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="07012365000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire urged me to set out specific
examples where a facility for pre-release statistics has been used. The
importance is more as a safeguard against circumstances in which they
may be needed, not because it is regularly required and used. On Second
Reading, both the Economic Secretary and I gave the example of the open
letter system, under which the Governor of the Bank of England is
required to write to the Chancellor should the inflation target not be
met. Pre-release access to inflation data enables the Bank to write the
letter and the Government to respond at the point at which the
inflation data are published. The publication of the Governor&#146;s
letter and the Government&#146;s response would aim to reduce market
uncertainty and any consequent market disruption, but that would not be
possible were sufficient pre-release access removed.</div>
					<a name="07012365000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pre-release is also required to
enable Ministers to respond immediately when non-market-sensitive
statistics are sometimes released. For example, if a survey showed that
drug use among young people had risen dramatically, my ministerial
colleagues in the Department of Health would rightly be expected to
explain, accurately and promptly, to Parliament andto the
public what steps the Government were taking to deal with the
issue.</div>
					<a name="07012365000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although there
is rightly some debate and differences of view among us over the
precise pre-release practice that might be appropriate, I hope that we
can achieve some clarity and consensus in the Committee on the
principle of Ministers and officials having such
access.</div>

Cable:
						</b> Does the Minister agree that although there is a
wide consensus, across parties here and across countries, about
pre-release for market-sensitive information, there is no such
consensus anywhere outside the UK that that principle should also apply
to non-market sensitive social data? Does he agree that, unless the
Royal Statistical Society has again shown itself to be not infallible,
every other country specifically precludes the release of social data
in the way that he has
described?</div>

Healey:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has wide international
experience in such matters and he is right: there is no consensus or
consistency among the systems that different countries have for
compiling or releasing data, or for putting in place pre-release
arrangements for their statistics. The arrangements, including on
pre-release, tend to be fashioned to reflect the individual
country&#146;s needs and circumstances. In Britain, the public
expect, the media demand and Parliament requires Ministers to be able
to account fully for their policies and their implementation. The
statistics that are released in public show significant features that
require
explanation.</div>

Marris:
						</b> In moving the amendment, the hon. Member for
Sevenoaks made a slight joke about the Health Protection
Agency&#151;I think it was two and half days before we had the
statistics on that. The hon. Member for Twickenham has also talked
about social statistics. However, if, for example, people involved in
health protection found out that in the past week 15,000 people had
died from avian flu, the Government would wish to move swiftly on that.
That is a social statistic. If it were simply released and there had
been no preparation whatever by the Government, there could be mass
panic.</div>

the essential point a little more rapidly than some Opposition Members.
However, none of the amendments in the group would abolish pre-release
entirely. I welcome that degree of consensus, which has also been
apparent in this
debate.</div>
					<a name="07012365000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
in the group seek to place the pre-release arrangements with the board,
for it to determine as part of the code of practice. Under such a
system, the board could do away with pre-release arrangements
altogether. I disagree with that approach. Given the importance of
pre-release, the Bill has been drafted to ensure that the pre-release
arrangements will be tightened and given a special status within the
new system. It is important that the Committee should be clear about
the elements of the new arrangements, which I am happy to spell
out.</div>

Healey:
						</b> My argument is, first, given the importance of
pre-release, it is appropriate that Parliament, not the board,
scrutinises and finally approves the rules and procedures that relate
to pre-release access. Secondly, the process should have special
status, which it is given by the Bill, requiring such scrutiny and
approval of Parliament, and the devolved Administrations, where
appropriate. Thirdly, the process should reflect the proper devolved
settlement so that the devolved Administrations have responsibility for
the fully devolved statistics. Fourthly and finally, there will also be
an important role for the independent board. It will assess and monitor
compliance with the rules set out in the secondary legislation,
approved by Parliament, as part of its assessment of general compliance
with the terms of the code. That is the approach that we believe to be
correct, which is reflected in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07012365000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
clear that there is a case for tightening the system, and the hon.
Member for Sevenoaks mentioned this when moving amendment No. 21. I
said so in oral evidence to the Treasury Committee, in response to the
consultation and on Second Reading. I also said on Second Reading that,
after taking into account concerns about the extent of pre-release and
the perceptions of potential abuse of the system, the Government had
decided to tighten current pre-release arrangements by aligning the
pre-release access for non-market-sensitive national statistics with
that for market-sensitive statistics, so that pre-release for all
national statistics will be set at 40.5 hours. In other words, a time
of 5 pm would be set&#151;after the markets have closed&#151;two
days before a 9.30 am release.</div>
					<a name="07012365000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also announced that the
Government would provide in secondary legislation guidance to
Departments that access should be limited to those individuals who
really required the data. Following our debate on Second Reading, I
have written to the Committee, as has been referred to, setting out my
expectations of the types of issue that the principles in the guidance
will deal with.</div>
					<a name="07012365000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that I have answered some of the questions that hon. Members asked
about. I have ensured that the process will be subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure, and that Parliament will have a
further scrutiny and approval role in the arrangements. Suffice it to
say that I am confident that the new arrangements will provide greater
clarity, certainty, transparency and enforceability than the current
ones and they will help to reduce perceptions of ministerial
interference in statistical release.</div>
					<a name="07012365000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I explained on Second
Reading, the Bill establishes a general statistical system that can be
developed in light of experience&#151;a point to which my hon. Friend
the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West referred&#151;and we shall
review the operation of the new pre-release system 12 months after it
starts.</div>
					<a name="07012365000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
21 is similar to amendment No. 92, and was tabled by the hon. Member
for Sevenoaks. It would require the code of practice to deal with any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 191</div>matter relating to pre-release access to official statistics. Clause
11(3) already ensures that the code will apply in relation to any
official statistics as if it included the rules and principles
established by order under subsection (2). That reflects the fact that,
given the importance of pre-release, Parliament and not the board
should ultimately approve the rules and procedures relating to
pre-release access to statistics in the final form prior to
publication. The code will be backed by statute but not set out in
statute, so pre-release access has been given special status under the
system. That means that Parliament will be required to scrutinise and
approve it through an affirmative resolution under clause 62 with
appropriate arrangements in the devolved Administrations.</div>
					<a name="07012365000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 22, tabled by the
hon. Member for Sevenoaks, would allow the board to determine rules and
procedures for pre-release via such an order. Although there are some
examples of non-ministerial offices or bodies with the powers to make
secondary legislation&#151;including the Registrar General, who is
the subject of part 2 of the Bill&#151;that is a relatively unusual
provision, as the hon. Gentleman will concede. I must make it clear to
the Committee that there is no legal or technical reason why an
independent body could not be given the power to bring secondary
legislation, but it is unusual for the simple reason that when such
instruments are subject to a parliamentary procedure, as they would be
under clause 62, no member of that body can participate in the
discussion or any vote on the substance.</div>
					<a name="07012365000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the rare occasions that a
non-ministerial body has powers to make subordinate legislation, a
Minister is required to speak on behalf of that body in the House.
Clearly, that would result in the slightly bizarre situation that a
Minister who had no involvement in the making of the order or in the
policy behind it would be expected to lead a parliamentary discussion
of the order. I do not see that that is a sensible arrangement for the
future.</div>
					<a name="07012365000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 83 and 84 when read together are designed, as the hon. Member for
Twickenham made clear, to limit the length of pre-release access that
could be provided to the Government or the devolved Administrations to
two hours before general release. I think that the hon. Gentleman might
accept that two hours is simply not sufficient for consideration or to
allow the sorts of measures that might be required.</div>
					<a name="07012365000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 43, tabled by the
hon. Member for Twickenham, also essentially supports the contention
that it should be the board rather than Ministers who set the
pre-release arrangements. I hope that I have already set out why
Ministers in the devolved Administrations rather than the board should
set the arrangements and why Parliament should be allowed to scrutinise
those arrangements through the order-making process. I do not accept
his argument. I cannot accept the amendments and, if they are pressed
to a vote, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose them.</div>
					<a name="07012365000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 were
tabled by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks. The protocol on release
practices establishes the requirement that Departments publish lists of
who is entitled to have privileged early access and for how long for
each statistical release. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 192</div>Indeed, the hon. Gentleman read from those lists earlier in the debate.
I expect that requirement to continue into the new system. As my letter
to the Committee last week made clear, I expect the secondary
legislation to set out the rules and principles for deciding the number
of officials in each Department who receive pre-release access with a
view to tightening and making more consistent the arrangements across
Government, including for the reporting and public confirmation of such
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07012365000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that on that basis hon. Members will be prepared to accept clause 11
and will not vote against its standing part of the Bill. I hope that
they will reflect and not press their amendments to a vote, but if they
do I shall have to ask my hon. Friends to
resist.</div>

							<a name="07012365000474"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I appreciate this opportunity to make a brief
intervention, Sir John. There are one or two questions to which I have
not received answers from the Minister, although I may have missed
them. It would be useful to know when he will publish the draft
secondary legislation. Will it be in time for us to consider it before
the next stage in the parliamentary
process?</div>
					<a name="07012365000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
confirmed that the rules should be tightened and he gave us one example
in relation to the changes to the five-day rule. Are there any other
ways in which the periods for pre-release access will be tightened in
the draft secondary legislation? He said that he would expect a
reduction in the number of people who have pre-release access to
statistics. Is he prepared to give any further detail about how that
restriction will
operate?</div>
					<a name="07012365000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman did not address the issue of whether there are at present
statistics to which pre-release access is granted that should be
knocked off the pre-release list altogether. Can the Committee conclude
that the draft secondary legislation will continue pre-release access
for all the statistics to which it currently applies? Are the
Government mindful of the concerns expressed by the Opposition about
the extent of the different statistical series that are covered?
</div>
					<a name="07012365000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter was
referred to by Dr. Ivan Fellegi in his evidence to the Treasury
Committee as something that concerned him. He said that in Canada,
where he is the chief statistician, pre-release access applied only to
those statistical series where there was a strong and powerful reason
for pre-release. Are the Government still contemplating tightening the
rules in that respect?</div>
					<a name="07012365000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate the
Minister&#146;s lengthy clarification of the position, but I would
welcome the opportunity to vote on amendment No. 21. I also want to
vote against clause 11 stand part to reflect our concerns, fully
expressed in the debate, that the board should determine the
pre-release access rules. Clause 11 would significantly undermine the
strength of the proposed
reforms.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000475"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> The Minister has earned the respect of the
Committee by giving good answers to most of the questions on the
clauses, even when we disagreed with him. However, on this clause he is
clutching at straws. There are two basic issues. We are no longer
debating 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 193</div>
						the principle of pre-release in respect of
market-sensitive data, but we are still debating the issue of principle
in relation to the release of social data.</div>
					<a name="07012365000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">One example that was plucked
out of the air by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West related
to avian flu, which the Minister seized upon like a desert traveller
grasping at a bottle of water. The more I thought about that example,
the more bizarre it seemed that we would discover an epidemic of avian
flu as a result of trawling through annual statistics on animal
husbandry&#151;</div>

							<a name="07012365000477"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> Well, whatever they are, the point is that even if
such national emergencies came to light as result of that statistical
work, they could easily be allowed for. Indeed, several OECD countries
such as New Zealand allow for special cases when the Government can
have pre-release access in order to deal with those problems. That is
subject to the proviso that access is announced when the statistics are
released and that the National Statistician gives a certificate of
approval that it is the correct procedure. If that is the way the
Government want to go, then we could table an amendment at a later
stage to deal with that
contingency.</div>

							<a name="07012365000478"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> Given the likelihood that thousands of deaths
would be noticed, perhaps the example given by my hon. Friend the
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West was over-dramatic. However,
agricultural statistics might show an impact, and I expect that the
hon. Gentleman can think of several situations in which the rapid
spread of disease has had serious consequences for business. Does he
accept that there are issues in relation to a variety of statistics
other than basic economic statistics which need to be
handled?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000479"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> The right hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly
reasonable point. Market-sensitive data do not have to be core economic
data. However, requests for the pre-release of data could be made in
individual cases and it would be for the professionals to judge the
reasonableness of such requests. We are talking about statistics in
general, of which there are thousands. Only a handful of them could
possibly satisfy those
criteria.</div>
					<a name="07012365000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if
there is a good case for pre-release access not only of
market-sensitive data but more generally, why do the Government believe
that it is uniquely necessary to have such long periods in the UK? I do
not understand what the arguments are. British officials are recruited
from the top echelons of higher education, so we must assume that they
are bright people who can think on their feet and react quickly, so it
can have nothing to do with that. What is it then about British
institutions that requires Britain to be particularly slow in that
respect? No arguments for that have been given. What is it about the
relationship between Ministers, officials and others that requires us
to have an exceptionally long period in which to digest the
statistics?</div>
					<a name="07012365000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
theory was put forward by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth&#151;that it is because of the media. The argument is that
the British 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 194</div>media might conceivably be so mendacious and misleading that we have to
have some special protection. I do not know who he was thinking of when
he said that. Perhaps it was Rupert Murdoch, but he is active in
Australia and other countries, and they seem to be able to cope with
fairly robust and demanding time periods for the release of statistics.
The Government are putting forward exceedingly weak arguments, in
contrast with their position on other matters. I hope that they will
pay us the compliment of advancing something a little more
solid.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000480"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> I shall be brief, as I sense that the Committee
wants to decide on the amendments and the clause.</div>
					<a name="07012365000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal first with
amendments Nos. 26 and 27. I think that the Minister was trying to give
me some reassurance that the lists will not be part of the new
codification. All that I have to say to him on that issue is that the
lists are not in good order&#151;I gave the Committee some
examples&#151;but are mixed up. Some officials are named and some are
listed by title. There is the issue of having the two separate lists
for each set of statistics and the curious arrangement in which some
officials are given access through the press office.</div>
					<a name="07012365000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The lists are also frequently
out of date. If the Minister visits the website and looks at certain
statistics, he will see that some of his Treasury officials are listed
who have since moved on to other Departments, as are other people who
have retired. The lists are not kept in particularly good order. I
shall certainly welcome the new codification if it will help us to
improve that
aspect.</div>
					<a name="07012365000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had an
important debate on amendment No. 21. I am encouraged by the support
for it among Opposition Members, and even by some of the Labour
Members&#146; speeches. One can always tell that the Government are
on particularly flimsy ground when a Labour Member suddenly decides to
break his or her silence and contribute to the debate for the first
time with a supportive argument. That is what the hon. Member for Hove
attempted to do, but unfortunately, her supportive argument almost gave
the game away. She said that the purpose of pre-release&#151;I wrote
her words down&#151;is to allow Ministers &#147;to give statistics
treatment&#148;. It is precisely the purpose of amendment No. 21 to
get away from Ministers giving statistics treatment. Although she said
that the Phillis review had not found many examples of abuse, the
specific abuse that happened in the summer, when the Prime Minister
leaked unemployment figures, came after that review. If the hon. Lady
thinks that that was not an abuse, she must explain why the Cabinet
Secretary was sent out apologise for it.</div>
					
					<a name="07012365000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000481"></a>Ms
Barlow:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman correctly quotes me, but
neglects to continue with the rest of my argument. It was that the
treatment was required to deal in a governmental way with the problems
that arose. As I stated clearly later in my speech, the media are a
minor issue to the Government and to the public compared to the
disasters in which statistics are involved and correct guidance is not
given by Ministers, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West mentioned in respect of Black
Wednesday.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 195</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012365000482"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> The hon. Lady makes her argument even more
supportive&#151;it almost falls into the category of a job
application. She mentioned correct guidance and treatment; we will
reflect on that. I shall read her speech.</div>
					<a name="07012365000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West made an interesting suggestion. He was in
favour of tightening some of the pre-release arrangements, but he
thought that it should be a matter entirely for Parliament rather than
the board or Ministers. That is an interesting point. Under the
Minister&#146;s proposals, it would be a matter for Parliament, but I
think the hon. Gentleman wanted to do it through primary legislation. I
ask him to reflect on the inflexibility that might be introduced, as we
might have continually to amend such
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07012365000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire made the important point
that if we accept what the Minister proposes, we will be trusting the
new board to a lesser extent than the ONS in the arrangements that it
has already set in place with the Governor of the Bank of England and
so on. It is extraordinary that we should set up a new independent
board, but say that it is not to be as trusted as the old
ONS.</div>
					<a name="07012365000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Chipping Barnet suggested limiting access to four hours,
but she was pressed as to why. I believe that everyone ought to be able
to make their case. That is why I want the independent board to make
the decision, and why the amendments specify that the board must
consult. It should consult the devolved Administrations, and it must
consult the Treasury. I would expect the Opposition parties to express
their views on the appropriate time limits. I would expect the board to
study practice in other developed economies, which seem able to operate
such arrangements in a much more rational and scientific way. Indeed,
evidence was taken from some of those countries. We might argue about
whether it should be 30 minutes or whatever, but the plain fact is that
those countries do not have the extent of pre-release that we do. It is
for the Minister to try to justify
that.</div>
					<a name="07012365000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the
Minister understands that there is a problem. If he did not, he would
not already be suggesting, as he has done this morning, even before he
has anything specific to put to Parliament, that there should be
shorter periods of access&#151;I wrote that down&#151;and that the
arrangements should be tightened generally and codified. He has already
proposed that some of the time limits should be changed. The problem,
however, is that if he is saying that the arrangements can be
determined only by Ministers, it is all the more important that the
board and not Ministers should have the final say on what is proposed
to Parliament.</div>
					<a name="07012365000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not accept the Minister&#146;s argument or, indeed, the logic of the
position of hon. Member for Hove. If a set of statistics suddenly
appears saying that drug use has increased among young people, I do not
accept that Ministers should have to respond at that very instant. How
can they be in the privileged position of being able immediately to
say, &#147;Yup, the problem has increased and here is what we are
doing about it&#148;? That does not happen elsewhere with social
statistics, and there is no reason for it to happen
here.</div>

what the Minister is saying is that Ministers should be allowed to
continue their practice of issuing statistics with simultaneous spin
saying exactly how they are going to deal with a problem. I give way to
the Minister. It appears that he is not now going to
intervene.</div>
					<a name="07012365000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
problem is genuine, so is the solution. As my hon. Friend the Member
for Braintree said, this is a black hole in the Bill, a fatal flaw. If
we accept, as the Minister has repeatedly accepted, that there is a
problem with the perception of the independence of statistics, and if
he is setting out, as he said he was in the Queen&#146;s Speech, to
enhance confidence in official statistics, it is nonsense to suggest
that the new, independent board cannot be trusted to make such
arrangements in the public interest. We want&#151;he wants&#151;the
board to be independent. It should be independent in this
matter.</div>

Healey:
						</b> I sense that the Committee wants to move on, so I
will be brief. We have had a full discussion on the relative merits and
the principled basis on which Ministers should propose but Parliament
should decide on and finally approve the pre-release arrangements, as
opposed to leaving that entirely to the statistics board. Members of
the Committee will make up their minds on
that.</div>
					<a name="07012365000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to the second
major point that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks raised, he is right that
the current lists of statistics are not in good order. The new

that he welcomes that.</div>
					<a name="07012365000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the hon. Member for
