<P>
I shall briefly explain the amendment and say why I should like the Committee to take it on board. The Government, in their press releases publicising it, the Bill, acknowledged that on certain issues it was difficult to draw the line, so they made the scope of the Bill as wide as possible. However, it should be recognised that the Bill may be drawn so wide that it could include people who should not be covered.
<P>
Subsection (2) sets out three circumstances in which a defence can be mounted. If we analyse the reasons why the Government have included those defences, we see that their motives were to exclude people who, for the sake of natural justice, should not be included in the provisions.
<P>
I am sure that all members of the Committee accept that any relationships that might fall within the wide ambit of the Bill should be condemned. Such activities were, at best, errors of judgment and, at worst, malicious exploitation for which there must be come-back on the perpetrator.
<P>
The review group examined the existing professional codes of conduct. It recognised that some were not of the standard of the best and work is now being undertaken urgently to improve them. the Bill is extending the criminal law to acts that were previously considered to be covered satisfactorily by professional codes, but are nevertheless to be condemned in almost all circumstances. In 1981, the policy advisory Committee of the Home Office considered whether the criminal law should be so extended and reported, but it did not consider that to be appropriate.
<P>
The Government drafted the Bill because of the outrageous occurrences that have taken place, particularly in children's homes, and because of the unease that is felt about exploitation. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that, when drafting wide-ranging legislation, attention must be paid to possible defences. The provisions in subsection (2) are reasonable. The first states that it would be a defence for A, the accused, to prove that, at the time of sexual intercourse or other sexual activity he did not know and could not have been expected to know that B was under 18. We see that sort of defence elsewhere, including homosexual offences in Scotland, which have a statutory defence of ignorance of age.
<P>
Subsection (2)(b) would allow a similar defence if someone was ignorant of the fact that the person with whom he was accused of committing that offence was in a position of trust. Most relevant to this discussion, paragraph (c) allows an exemption or a defence if A was lawfully married to B at the time of the offence. That is a reasonable defence; indeed, it is difficult to see how a court could find such an offender guilty. It is possible that even professional codes might not cover such a situation.
<P>
The Government will be aware, however, that only those who are lawfully married can use that defence. The Bill clearly states that the two parties must have been married at the time of the offence; nevertheless, that defence is possible only for those who are, to coin a phrase marriageable. The purpose of the amendment is to examine whether the reasons for that exemption&#151;other than the ceremony of marriage itself&#151;can be extended to include those who are not married.
<P>
Only those in a heterosexual relationship can be lawfully married. Homosexuals cannot be married. However, under the marriage provisions of the Children Act 1989, children of 16 or 17 can be married if they have the permission of a parent or guardian. It is from that Act that I draw the provisions of the amendment.
<P>
This is not the time or place for an in-depth discussion of what discrimination exists under other Acts against those who cannot be married, particularly those, of any age, who are in committed homosexual relationships. Those wider issues may not be a matter for this Committee, but it should be noted that the matter has been debated in the House. Indeed, on Second Reading, when I expressed my concern about the lack of an extra defence for those who cannot lawfully marry, the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton) indicated that he saw no problem&#151;in general terms; I do not wish to ascribe to the hon. Gentleman views that he may not hold&#151;with extending such a provision.
<P>
If one accepts that the defence of being lawfully married provided in subsection (2)(c) can apply only to heterosexuals, albeit those who have the permission of a parent or guardian, one must therefore accept that it discriminates against people who have the same level of commitment to each other as a married couple and almost entirely the same relationship but who, whether or not they wish to get married, may not be married.
<P>
It is clearly reasonable for the amendment to ensure that the parent's or guardian's consent is given, because it was considered necessary under the Children Act 1989 and earlier legislation to protect 16 and 17-year-olds from marriages that might not be in their best interests. For that reason, I do not propose a wide defence for people in a committed relationship, because that would be difficult to define; I propose a narrow one.
<P>
The conditions to be met that would give such people the equivalent of the lawful marriage defence written in subsection (2)(c), include the consent of the parent or guardian, which is required by 16 and 17-year-olds seeking to be legally married. It is not unreasonable to include a provision that would allow them to be exempted&#151;particularly those who are homosexual, who do not have the option of marriage.
<P>
The Bill criminalises an act that is legal in marriage. It therefore discriminates against people who, according to the rest of law, especially if clause 1 is passed, are capable of a consensual sexual relationship, but, because of marriage law, cannot marry.
<P>
Let us take the example of a 17-year-old gay person of either gender who has a relationship that may have been inappropriate when it started, but who is committed and who, if heterosexual, could marry with parental consent. That person and the partner should receive the same protection that the marriage exemption provides if they have obtained the parent or guardian's sanction. The reason why that sanction is important in marriage should be obvious. People who have the same level of commitment and parental or guardian consent should be considered to have a defence under the law.
<P>
If we do not want to discriminate, deliberately or indirectly against homosexual people, but want the same protection for 16 and 17-year-olds offered by the condition of the parent or guardian's consent for marriage, which implies consensual sexual activity, the amendment would not weaken the legislation but make it fairer. I cannot envisage any circumstances in which the parent or guardian's consent, as specified in the amendment, would not offer the same protection to 16 and 17-year-olds as the parent or guardian's consent that is implicit in the marriage defence, which is already included in the Bill. Anxieties have been expressed that the Bill as drafted discriminates against homosexual people. During the passage of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, I understood that if the Government legislated on abuse of trust measures following the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton), they would do so in a non-discriminatory way.
<P>
I understand that the Government may not really want to exempt relationships sanctioned by parent or guardian, whether marriage or otherwise, and have been forced into including subsection 2(c) by the need to make the Bill compatible with the European convention on human rights. However, I ask the Committee briefly to examine those motives. The point of our commitment to the European convention on human rights is to recognise human rights, not to recognise that, like it or not, we have to comply. In considering the incorporation of the European convention on human rights and discussing how applicable it was to British law, I understood that the Government believed that those rights were worth safeguarding in British law. I understood that we would adopt a positive approach to compatibility with the European convention on human rights because we recognised those rights, not because we felt, without must enthusiasm, that we had to amend legislation to ensure that we complied. I would worry if the Government told us that subsection 2(c) was intended to achieve compatibility with the European convention on human rights, but that they would not include it if they had a choice other than mere compatibility with the convention.
<P>
If marriage and, therefore, consensual sexual relationships, are legal for 16 and 17-year-olds with the parent or guardian's consent, the human right to marry is worth writing in statute. The right to marry and have a consensual sexual relationship in that marriage is a human rights matter, especially under articles 8 and 14 of the European convention on human rights. The Government should therefore recognise, as a human right, a defence for people who cannot marry but whose parents or guardians consent to a relationship that is equivalent to marriage. It is hard to understand why people should be exempted from the remit of criminal law on the basis of a ceremony. That exemption is really made on the basis that parents and guardians are responsible people charged with overseeing the best interests of 16 and 17-year-olds, and have approved a marriage and, by implication, a relationship.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
What concerns do the Government have in opposing the amendment? What do they object to in parents and guardians approving a relationship? What gives the Government the right to say that they know better than parents and guardians, while&#151;laudably&#151;impressing on parents and guardians the need for them to look after the interests of young people within the context of a family? It is anomalous for the Government to say that parents have the right to sanction marriage, with the long-term commitment that that involves, while bringing into criminal law relationships that have also been sanctioned by parents and guardians.
<P>
I return to my original point: no one suggests that relationships where one of the parties is put in a position of trust to the other, when or after the relationship starts, are to be welcomed. Indeed, there is a strong argument for the Government to consider amending the Marriage Act 1949 to ensure that the giving of parental and guardian consent to marriage cannot apply where a position of trust is involved. That would also remove any discrimination and some aspects of the lawful marriage defence in paragraph (c). The Government have to explain why they are introducing legislation that can be seen as discriminatory&#151;I acknowledge that its purpose may not be to discriminate&#151;and why they seek to intervene by means of the criminal law in relationships that have, perhaps reluctantly, been approved by parents or guardians.
<P>
I hope that the Government accept good notice of my intention to table an amendment on the matter on Report to ensure that we can have a full discussion on it. I would like to know how the Government can prevent the clause appearing discriminatory and how they can overrule the views of parents and guardians by using the full force of criminal law in difficult situations.

<P>

<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's arguments. However, I am troubled by the likely effect of the amendment. Throughout the Bill, we are outlawing sexual relationships between 16 and 17-year-olds and older people who are in a position of trust to them. If we are serious about that, we have to ensure that there are as few gaps as possible of which people could take advantage. If we leave gaps, the legislation would soon come into disrepute and be seen as full of anomalies and inconsistencies.
<P>
Three defences are available under subsection (2). It is right that they exist; they need to exist to be consistent with the interest of justice and with defences that exist under similar legislation. The hon. Gentleman referred to the defence of marriage; that defence is different from the issue of parental consent about which he spoke. I am worried that the amendment would leave a loophole of which people in a position of trust, who are minded to use that position of trust to have sexual relations with 16 and 17-year-olds, could take advantage. I can foresee circumstances in which such people&#151;who will also, because of their position, be trusted by the parents and families of 16 and 17-year-olds&#151;will take advantage of that position and get around the provision. Sometimes peoples in such positions develop genuine feelings towards those in their care, but the world will not end if they exercise a little self-control and abstinence. Allowing such relationships creates a loophole that is inconsistent with the spirit of the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Robathan </B>(Blaby): I listened to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) with interest and growing incredulity. He might have made a good case for raising the age at which it is legal to marry. Most parents&#151;indeed, most people&#151; would say that is is unwise to marry at 18, although many people who wed at 16 have gone on to have happy marriages.
<P>
	However, the hon. Gentleman made a case in which, for instance, a step-parent&#151;regrettably, many cases of child abuse take place in step-families&#151;gives himself or herself permission to abuse the child over whom he or she has authority. Foster parents can also perpetrate such abuse. Eighteen months ago, a foster father in Brighton killed a girl in his care. Such cases drive a coach and horses through the principle of establishing trust that must not be abused. My position, not surprisingly, is therefore different from that taken by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
	The hon. Gentleman has given a clear indication of where the homosexual agenda doth lead, as he has kept on about how discriminatory it is that homosexuals cannot marry. The logic of his case is that homosexual marriages should be permitted. He may, however, wish to intervene and say that he is against such marriages.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am happy to be diverted, but I do not want to make too many points about raising the age at which it is legal to marry.
<P>
Many hon. Members wish to see the same protections and rights afforded to heterosexuals and homosexuals, as far as possible. That does not necessarily include homosexual marriage, but simply invovles recognition that committed relationships&#151;regardless of sexuality&#151;should have equal consideration under civil law, especially benefits and pension law. People who condemn homosexual relationships often allege that such relationships are transient or promiscuous and do not demonstrate the same level of commitment to be found in heterosexual marriages. But such people&#151;including the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr Robathan)&#151;also say that protections and incentives for committed homosexual relationships are a bad thing. Under his proposed regime, homosexuals would appear to be in a no-win situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> We are talking about people in positions of trust. Homosexuals should not be in a win situation&#151;that is a position of trust&#151;with young boys and children.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that many hon. Members believed that there should be no discrimination on marriage. However, he did not say that he was against homosexual marriage. Most people outside the House, who may not have been subjected to politically correct lobbying on the homosexual agenda, take a different view. They do not want to see homosexual marriage legalised. That is not to say that there cannot be long-term, committed relations between homosexuals. I know of some as, I am sure, do most hon. Members here, but there is a difference between a homosexual relationship and a heterosexual relationship. I for one, and I hope that my party will not have it in its manifesto, do not wish to see homosexual marriage allowed. I hope that the hon. Gentleman puts what he just said in his next electoral address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): My hon Friends have made general points and I want to make a point of detail about the amendment, which is quite strangely drafted. In general it seeks to water down the provisions in the Bill relating to abuse of trust, but subsection (2)(c) reads:
<P>
	``where a care order is in force . . . the consent of the local authority designated in the order''.
<P>
In other words, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is trying to persuade the Committee that a sexual relationship will be allowed with a child when the child is in care. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. That is why I am making this point. I shall finish and he can respond later.
<P>
	As I understand the amendment, where the child is in care the local authority can decide, in conjunction with the parents, whether the adult involved, presumably a care worker, can have sexual intercourse with the young person. The local authority will decide, as it is in charge of that young person. The mind boggles as to how the local authority is to decide whether a young person in its care will be allowed to have sexual relations. Will it be a committee of the full council? Will it be the mayor? Will it be just the social services committee?
<P>
	The hon. Gentleman should think his amendments through a bit more carefully before putting them to the Committee and consider how, leaving aside general philosophical points, the amendment will work in practice. Why on earth should any local authority want to license particular care workers whom it employs to have sexual intercourse with children in its care? Can hon. Members conceive of any local authority taking such a decision?
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): That almost says it all, but not quite. There are one or two other points that the Government may still care to hear. If it is deemed necessary for people in a position of authority to be restrained in this way because their position gives them increased influence on a young child, the amendment would enable them to put pressure on the parent or the guardian of the child, which might be given added force by that position of authority. That would turn children against parents who rightly were not prepared to give consent to a relationship of this sort. The amendment would be an open invitation for elopements&#151;if one wants to call them that, as we are making all these relationships gender-neutral. At the very least, it could sour relationships between children and parents who are trying conscientiously to look after their interests when they are at an age at which, in the parents' view, they are not capable of making a sensible choice for themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> This has been an interesting debate. First, let me tell the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, who raised the issue of parents' expectations, that the Government's view is that parents are entitled to expect that both good practice and law will protect their children from inappropriate relations.
<P>
The whole point of the abuse of trust provision is to give those parents with that expectation the certainty that the law, as opposed to simply good practice, will protect their children from those who seek to abuse positions of trust. Therefore, of necessity, the categories of defence to abuse of trust must be limited. They are limited. It is not the Government's intention to extend the current exceptions and defences in any way.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We must understand clearly what the effect of the amendment would be. It would add an extra defence&#151;which, as I have said, is unacceptable to the Government&#151;and it would make that defence one which required parents, or the equivalent of parents, to give consent if the defence were to come into force.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) highlighted a serious technical flaw in the amendment: it would place local authorities in a highly invidious position. It is not the Government's intention to do that. We can accept nothing that would put pressure on parents to give their consent to a relationship that they would regard, or be likely to regard, as highly inappropriate.
<P>
The hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) has referred to the pressures that might be put on parents. Given the nature of such relationships, all sorts of pressures are put on the relationship between parents and children when they are beginning to experience sexual awakening and relationships for the first time. For us to institutionalise in law such a pressure would be pure folly, and we do not intend to do so.
<P>
The defence in the Bill is drafted in such a way as to make it absolutely clear that we do not regard marriage as a sort of bolthole into which those who have offended against the law may retreat so that culpability for an inappropriate action before marriage would somehow be removed from them. The defence is very narrowly drafted so that an inappropriate relationship will be culpable of itself and, indeed, subsequent marriage will not excuse that culpability.
<P>
It is necessary in law, and as a matter of good public policy, to recognise that marriage is special. It is entitled to special recognition under the law. The obligations and responsibilities as well as the rights that flow from marriage mean that the institution of marriage, of itself, provides a defence for any abuse of trust. Marriage, of itself, carries obligations and responsibilities that are, of themselves, likely to deter predators. The sort of person who preys on and abuses the trust of children and young people is usually the last person in the world who wants to enter into any sort of relationship that is sanctioned by law. There may be some exceptions, but to the overwhelming majority of predators&#151;whether they are heterosexual or homosexual&#151;marriage is the last thing on their minds. We all know what is on their minds&#151;their own sexual gratification.
<P>
We need to be clear in our minds about the measure, but we also need to live in the real world. It is the Government's intention, in legislating in this difficult and complex area, to found legislation on reality, and we believe that we have done that. We have recognised our specific obligations under the European convention on human rights, although we are by no means seeking to pray those in aid as an excuse for doing the right thing. We have obligations under the convention that arise not only from article 8, referring to private and family life, but from article 12, which makes it clear that people have a right to marry and found a family according to national law. We entered into that obligation under the European convention on human rights. Therefore, for reasons of law and sound practice, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>

<B>Dr. Harris:</B> A number of points of varying degrees of logic and credibility have been made in this interesting debate. The first was made by the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan), who said that there was a strong case for me to argue that marriage should not be allowed&#151;as it is at present&#151;for people between the ages of 16 and 18. I intimated that I did not want to delve into that point on this narrow amendment, but given the current age of consent for heterosexual relations, it would be bizarre if one were legally sanctioned to have sex with someone, but not legally sanctioned to marry that person. Indeed, many people take the hon. Gentleman's view and believe that sex should be allowed only in marriage. They accept that the current age of consent for heterosexual relations is not unreasonable and would prefer to see marriage at ages 16 or 17, with existing safeguards, prior to the commencement of a sexual relationship, than a ban on marriage until the age of 18.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> The hon. Gentleman is putting words that I did not say into my mouth. I said that he could make a good case for raising the age of matrimony and a very good case for raising the age of consent. It is not a case that I shall argue, but many people would say that, in an ideal world, a higher age of consent and less sexual activity among teenagers would not be a bad thing for society in general&#151;not least teenage births.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I could agree with the hon. Gentleman on that last point&#151;probably the first with which I have been able to agree. However, in the real world, as the hon. Gentleman recognises, sex does occur&#151;certainly above the age of 16. To criminalise it by raising the heterosexual age of consent to 18 would not allow agencies to pass on important information on family planning and sexually transmitted diseases. Some people talk about equality at 18, but when it comes to tabling amendments, their deafening silence makes many suspect that their real aim is to ensure differential ages of consent for homosexuals and heterosexuals. The sometimes expressed wish to see the heterosexual age of consent raised to 18 is a shield to defend themselves against accusations of prejudice. Some of them accept that they are prejudiced, for the reasons that they give, and some deny it. Many who deny it say that they would prefer the age of consent to be 18, but we have yet to see an amendment to that effect in this Session of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr Robathan:</B> To continue the conversation with the hon. Gentleman, he should know firmly that I do not accept that there is equality between heterosexual and homosexual sex. I have said that all along, which is why I should like there to be a differential between the ages of consent. I make that clear to the hon. Gentleman so that we can disagree about it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I accept that the hon. Gentleman's position is born purely of that prejudice with a small p, although many people in his position claim not to be discriminatory but disapprove of any sex between the ages of 16 and 18. There are good reasons for my disapproving&#151;where there was a choice&#151;of people entering into sexual relationships at such a young age, but we live in the real world and must recognise that a balance has to be struck.
<P>
	An alternative way of removing what I consider to be a discriminatory provision would be to suggest that the marriage provision for 16 and 17-year-olds should not apply for heterosexuals. That would be difficult to justify. It is not an option available now to those of us who wish for non-discrimination in this matter. I hope that hon. Members who suggested it as an option will understand why it is not realistic regardless of one's views on the wisdom of sex between the ages of 16 and 18, or on beginning a family before finishing education.
<P>
	It has been argued that the provisions in the clause would be a licence for stepfathers&#151;or stepmothers&#151;to abuse children in their care. The term ``young child'' was used. In using the term ``child'', we must remember that the provision generally relates to 16 and 17-year-olds who are children by law. However, if there is to be sensible discrimination between younger and older children, the use of an emotive term such as ``young children'' in respect of 16 and 17-year-olds rather debases the value of using the word ``young'' when talking of those aged between five and 13 years.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I regard all children as young, and sexual relationships between children as inadvisable. I would regard legalisation of buggery with children of any age as an act of unmitigated folly.
<P>
<B>Chairman:</B> Order. I remind hon. Members that the debate is going rather wide of the issue. I should be grateful if all members of the Committee would bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson. I am attempting to address the point raised earlier about the potential problem of step-families by clarifying that the provisions of the amendment would not allow step-parents to abuse children&#151;we need not be tautological&#151;in their care. Members of the Committee need to realise&#151;I know that the Minister does&#151;that truly non-consensual offences are already covered by the crime of indecent assault. The working party considered that and made recommendations on that law. I believe that indecent assault is the most appropriate charge to bring where there is not consent. We are not therefore talking of offences that would be covered by indecent assault, or covered by laws applying to incest.
<P>
Even if the defence provided by the amendment were to be misused by defendants, it must be remembered that it is only a defence, not an exemption. a reprehensible offence would still be chargeable and the courts would decide. That deals with just one of the red herrings produced by Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): May I ask for clarification on one point? Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting in his amendment that where young people between ages 16 and 18 have a care order and are in residential care&#151;presumably having been taken from the family home because of a breakdown in relationships or for some other reason&#151;the parents should have a say in whether a young person should have sex with a person looking after him or her in care?
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I was about to come to that. Exactly the same provisions would apply as in the marriage provision in the Children Act 1989. Where someone is removed from the parental home into care, it may be that the legal guardianship changes&#151;which is why other categories are in the amendment. It would be appropriate&#151;if the problems in the parental home were of such an extent that parents were unqualified, or could not be trusted, to make the recommendation or approval for marriage&#151;to take the power from them and give it to other authorities as listed in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am trying to clarify my remarks and I would welcome an intervention after I have developed the point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough argued that my amendment would give local authorities carte blanche to give their staff the power to abuse their position of trust. However, they do not have the power indecently to assault those in their care, and indecent assault and other such offences carry stronger penalties than those proposed in the Bill. Hence we are talking here about abuse of trust as part of the treatment of children but not abuse of children in itself.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I cannot conceive of any local authority that would give permission, under the amendment, for an inappropriate relationship. Nor can I envisage a local authority giving permission, under existing law, for marriage between someone in its care and someone in a position of trust.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> In a moment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's question&#151;and perhaps the hon. Lady's too&#151;should be why a provision in the Children Act 1989 allows local authorities to permit marriage in appropriate circumstances. I presume that it exists in other circumstances in which there is not a position of trust. I am happy to put on record the fact that I regard it as inappropriate for the provision ever to be used by local authorities. In drafting the amendment, I found it difficult to decide between allowing an identical set of authorities to sanction relationships and marriages by including all the provisions of the Children Act 1989 and thereby going for full equality&#151;even if some of those provisions would never be used&#151;or dealing with a different set of people and thus creating inequality by ruling out the inclusion of some of the provisions of the Children Act in the Bill.
<P>
I shall give way to the hon. Member for Gainsborough and later to the hon. Member for Don Valley if I have not yet answered her question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I presume that in the past, Parliament, in its wisdom, decided that in extreme cases it might be necessary to allow young people in an authority's care to be married. However, I and the Minister believe that the hon. Gentleman is putting councils in an impossible position. He must be confident about whether such cases will arise. He is saying that in certain circumstances a council would sanction someone in its employment&#151;that must be so if we are talking about a breach of trust&#151;such as a teacher or a care worker, to have sexual intercourse with someone in care. That will never happen, so the amendment is defective.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> If the amendment is defective, the marriage provisions of the Children Act 1989 are also defective. Despite what the Minister said, it would therefore be inappropriate for local authorities to have the power to sanction lawful marriage between someone in care and someone in a position of trust. Yet the terms of my amendment were taken exactly from provisions in the Children Act 1989.
<P>
I may reconsider my amendment in the light of the comments made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough, but I want to stress that I was not unaware of his criticisms. If the amendment is a problem because it makes provision for something that ought never to be used, the same criticisms apply to local authorities already giving sanction to sexual relationships within marriage between someone in care and someone who is caring for them. If this can of worms has been opened through the review, will the Minister look again into whether local authorities should be allowed under schedule 12(5)(2) of the Children Act 1989 to sanction sex by sanctioning marriage in that way?

<P>

<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> The hon. Gentleman cannot have been listening to what the Minister said. The Minister explained that the clause is designed to protect children from predators. It is probable that a person who wants to marry at 16 or 17-year-old is not a predator, because, on the whole, predators are not inclined to marry. If the amendment were accepted, circumstances that are currently rare would become common. That is why the Minister&#151;I hope that I am not putting words in his mouth&#151;is minded to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> Both the hon. Gentleman and the Minister should be careful when they talk about predation and marriage. I am sure that the Minister did not mean to imply that willingness to marry was a test of predation. Otherwise, it would signify predation if an older person who had a relationship with someone who was 16 or 17, said no when asked, ``Would you marry this person if the opportunity arose?'' If that is the view of the hon. Member for New Forest, East and the Minister, it implies that all homosexual relationships are founded on predation, because marriage is not an option for homosexuals. I am sure that the Minister did not intend to give that impression; indeed, his remarks did not give such an impression. However, there is a view in society that homosexual relationships that involve 16 and 17-year-olds are founded on predation. That view should be challenged.
<P>
What evidence does the hon. Member for New Forest, East have to show that willingness to marry means that there is no predation in a heterosexual relationship? Many marriages break down when people marry young. A piece of paper and a ceremony in a registry office, church or other establishment do not prove that a relationship is not based on predation. The matter must be given greater consideration. If hon. Members believe that a marriage certificate proves a lack of predation, they are on dangerous, unsubstantiated ground.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): The hon. Gentleman has a firm grip on the wrong end of the stick. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby made clear, there are many long-standing, settled and happy homosexual relationships. One can accept that without accepting the principle of homosexual marriage. I wish that the hon. Gentleman could put his prejudice aside and deal with the merits, such as they are, of the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are straying from the amendment again.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I have already made it clear that the amendment does not propose homosexual marriage ceremonies sanctioned by the state. However, the protection that applies in law to heterosexuals, who can get married, should also apply to homosexuals, who cannot legally do so.
<P>
The amendment does not propose that marriage between homosexuals should exist in law, but that equal consideration should be shown to those who can marry, and those who do not have the option of marriage. The hon. Member for Eastbourne referred to those in stable, long-term, committed relationships who are not married because they are homosexual. Those whose commitment to a relationship is almost identical to commitment to a marriage can be thrown out of the common home on the death of their partner. Many hon. Members, including some Conservative Members, have expressed through an early-day motion their anxiety that current criminal and civil law discriminates against people who cannot marry but who show the same commitment and want the same rights and privileges as those who can marry.
<P>
In summary, I believe that the accusations that the amendment is a licence for abuse cannot be substantiated. One of the tests of abuse is the surreptitious or predatory nature of the approaches and the fact that they are kept secret from other people in positions of responsibility. The necessity for advance consent to the relationship from parents or guardians&#151;however unsatisfactory or wrong that relationship might be in general terms&#151;would be protection against abuse of trust. That is the reason for the state of affairs that we have discussed with regard to marriage in this context. Hon. Members have said that the sanctioning of the marriage by the parents suggests that, however unsatisfactory and inappropriate the relationship may be in the circumstances, it is not based on predation. Such parental sanction is an effective defence against such a consensual relationship, however inappropriate in prefessional terms, being a criminal offence.
<P>
I stress, in response to an argument made by the Minister, that if parents are permitted to sanction marriages as I have described, it is not opening up a huge exemption to allow them to sanction relationships that, while similar, are not covered by a marriage certificate. I take the point that because of the phrasing of the Children Act 1989, in respect of amendment of the Marriage Act 1949, local authorities are involved. It might be more appropriate, particularly as this is a free vote matter, for the House to consider a narrower amendment removing provision for local authorities to sanction the relevant relationships. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, leave out lines 20 to 25.
<P>
Clause 2(3) would provide another defence for a person over the age of 18, in that it would not be an offence for such a person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to have sexual intercourse with, or engage in any other sexual activity with''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a 16 or 17-year-old if the sexual relationship existed between them before the commencement of the Act.
<P>
The Minister said a few moments ago that the Government&#151;rightly, in my view&#151;did not want to creat too many exceptions to the general prohibition on sexual relationships between 16 and 17-year-olds and those in a position of trust who were older. However, when I first read sub-section (3) many questions occurred to me, and I shall want the Minister to answer them.
<P>
We are, in general terms, creating a new criminal offence in the Bill. When it is passed it will, for the first time, be an offence for a person in a position of trust to engage in sexual activity with, or have sexual intercourse with, a 16 or 17-year-old boy or girl. We are owed some justification of the exception in subsection (3). A wider question of principle perhaps arises&#151;whether it is right for an act that is to be made criminal to be treated as not criminal by dint of having started before the relevant legislation commenced. Other examples of criminal acts being afforded a defence if they began before the statute that created the offence do not spring readily to my mind. It may be that I am just not aware of them, and that there are precedents. Perhaps the Minister will tell us if any exist.
<P>
All that the explanatory note to the Bill tells us is that the provision is a transitional one. Perhaps it is intended that the Bill should be fair and reasonable to people in existing sexual relationships of the kind that we are considering. Would it be entirely unreasonable to expect those people to abstain from the sexual side of their relationship in what would otherwise be a breach of the law for as long as the young person remained under 18? I am repeating that suggestion, and I may do so again later in another context. What is the Minister's response to the suggestion?
<P>
The Minister must also tell the Committee how the proposal will work in practice, because some practical problems were noted when the working group considered the measure. The Bill defines sexual activity but not sexual relationship; the existence of a sexual relationship would afford someone aged over 18 a defence in such circumstances. What does sexual relationship mean? We know that from time to time various people have difficulty&#151;
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will finish my point and then give way to the Minister. Sometimes people have problems if they think that they are not having sexual relations, but others think that they are. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am surprised tht I should be asked to explain to the hon. Gentleman, whether he is a young or an old fogey, what a sexual relationship is, but I shall do my best: a sexual relationship is one characterised by the sexual activity which we have referred to and outline in the Bill. The nature of the relationship is defined by the activity; it is a commonsense approach which, in the main, works.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison</b> I have listened to the Minister with interest. In that case, it might have been common sense to use the term ``sexual activity'' which is defined in the Bill, rather than introduce a new term, ``sexual relationship'', because my next question to the Minister is, does ``sexual relationship'' include both sexual intercourse, of whatever nature&#151;anal or vaginal, as stated in the Bill&#151;and sexual activity?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am happy to say that it does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Well, perhaps the Minister can come to the next problem that arises: what about the intensification of sexual activity that takes place after the enactment of the Bill? Does the subsection provide a defence when some sexual activity takes place before the Bill becomes law and is followed by full sexual intercourse after it somes into force? I was tempted to call it the carry on cuddling defence, but it amounts to more than that.
<P>
There is a serious side to the matter: to get down to brass tacks, as even young fogeys know how to do, what if the older person in a position of trust engages in petting or kissing with a 16 or 17-year-old before the Act comes into force and then has full sexual intercourse after that time? Would that fall within the terms of that defence? The Minister has a pained look; I am sorry to spell it out, but I need to do so, because if that is the case it would be against the spirit of the Bill and leave what many would regard as a gap. I am not the only one to regard it as a gap which would create practical difficulties: the Minister's working group came to the same conclusion. It reported that there were major evidential difficulties in making an exception for pre-existing relationships, since that would be easy to raise as a defence and difficult to disprove. Will the Minister comment on the views of his working group? It would be easy in such situations for people to try to get around the Bill's provisions, at least for a time, by raising such a defence&#151;claiming, for example, a secret relationship. As the Minister knows, that would be all too difficult to disprove, as the working group believed.
<P>
The Minister owes the Committee a further explanation, especially on the matter of the intensification of sexual activity and the practical difficulties involved. It seems to place a large question mark over the operation of the Bill immediately after it comes into force.

<P>

<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I have just one point to make. I hope that the analogy is not too bizarre, but even if it is, I will draw it. It used to be asked in arms control debates how one would know whether someone was observing the agreement. That was the argument for zero-zero option measures. In other words, if the opposing side agreed that no missiles of a certain category would be permitted, that was much easier to verify than if they agreed only to reduce the missiles to a specified number. In that case, one could never be sure whether the missiles spotted were within the specified number. However, if a zero option were in force, one could be sure that the agreement had been broken if any such missiles were spotted.
<P>
To apply that analogy to the clause, how could a case be proven if someone in a position of authority who wished to engage in a relationship with someone of 16 or 17 claimed falsely that the relationship has been going on all the time and the young person could be persuaded to corroborate it? If such relationships were allowed to go on, they will create enormous practical problems about whether they pre-date the Bill's enactment or whether they were an invention to enable people to embark on a relationship that did not exist before the Bill came into force. How on earth could such a claim be tested?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison). Perhaps the Minister will elucidate in respect of the following example. If a teacher is currently having a secret homosexual relationship with a pupil of 16&#151;it would, of course, have to be secret&#151;when the Act comes into force, will he be allowed to carry on the relationship on the grounds that it is covered by the Act, although it was illegal when it started? Such a relationship would still be deprecated by any local authority. Will the Minister explain what will happen in such cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I should like to continue my hon. Friend's point about the teacher. Members of the Committee accept that it is at present a serious disciplinary offence for a teacher to have an affair with a pupil. It would be bizarre if the teacher could escape the legislation simply by maintaining that that relationship pre-dated its coming into force. That would set at nought what Parliament is trying to achieve.
<P>
Let us consider a situation in which a social worker misuses his position. It would be odd if he could say in court, ``Well, I may have been doing something wrong, but it was not a criminal activity under this Act of Parliament because the relationship started one week before the legislation came into force.''
<P>
The Minister is a distinguished criminal practitioner&#151;he is far more distinguished than I am. His experience in the courts will tell him that it will be far easier to defend an action with an argument about dates and to say, ``Well, yes it is true that there was a relationship, but it took place on such and such a date.'' That could cause further distress to the person who was abused because that person would have to go into the witness box and talk about dates. It is far easier for a defendant to take that line than to convince a court that no activity took place. That is what worries me.
<P>
I cannot understand why the Government should want to resist this perfectly sensible amendment. It simply tries to make absolutely clear what Parliament obviously envisages. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan (Sheffield, Hallam):</B> I wonder whether the Minister will clarify a few points, to allow us a better understanding of the scope of the amendment.
<P>
First, subsection (3) will be utterly redundant within two years of the Act's coming into force. Secondly, the Government anticipate few prosecutions under the Act&#151;they estimate between 10 and 15 cases. The provision may never be used, but if it is, only a small number of cases will occur.
<P>
Thirdly, disciplinary procedures brought under professional codes and so on, which already apply to those caught in such circumstances, would apply whether or not the Act was in force. We are talking about a very small number of cases, possible none, which will in any case be covered by other procedures. It is simply that the additional, heavier criminal penalty will not be brought to bear immediately.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Borrow </B>(South Ribble): On that point, the hon. Member for Blaby said that if the provision remained in the Bill, a homosexual teacher in a relationship with a male pupil that started before the Bill became law would still be open to criminal prosecution, whereas a male teacher having a relationship with a female pupil of 16 or 17 could escape criminal conviction because the relationship was not a legal offence when it started. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with my interpretation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I believe that the hon. Gentleman is correct. I suspect that the Minister, in his wisdom, will be able to give us a detailed interpretation of that and the other retrospective effects of the Bill or of changes in other legislation.
<P>
When dealing with marginal cases, and if other sanctions are in place, I am willing to allow existing exemptions. I am uncomfortable about the general principle of moving the criminal law backwards to cover things that people were previously doing quite legitimately&#151;although ill-advisedly&#151;and which were open to other sanctions.
<P>
I would rather see those other sanctions brought back into play for the small number of cases that is expected until the law has filtered through during those first two years. By then, the law will be absolutely clear to people. Once the deterrent effect that the Government hope for is clearly in place, we can be up front with the people concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) and my hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow) for their interventions, because they have summarised exactly what will happen as a result of the provision that the hon. Member for Hertsmere seeks to amend.
<P>
I must tell the hon. Member for Blaby that the provision does not make something legal that was hitherto illegal. Nevertheless, he raises an important point. He gave an example of a teacher who had a sexual relationship with a boy before the commencement of the Act. However, such a teacher would still properly be liable to prosecution after the commencement of the Act for acts committed before it came into force.
<P>
The provision that the hon. Member for Hertsmere seeks to amend is designed to address the other issue in relation to retrospectivity. It is a basic principle of our law and constitution that Parliament should not criminalise an action that was legal before the coming into effect of an Act. The activity should not be criminalised retrospectively; the people concerned could not have had a guilty mind, whatever the mischief we are seeking to address. The actions in which they were engaged, although thoroughly reprehensible and covered by the codes of practice, were at that time illegal. As a nation, we have long stood by that principle of fairness and justice and we do not intend to overturn it, something which the amendment would stand the risk doing.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is throwing in a red herring. We are talking not about making past activities illegal but about what happens in the future. Under the Bill, it will be okay to continue such activity if it began before the commencement of the Act. Does a similar provision exist under the law? Can the Minister cite a precedent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Let me finish my point. When the relationship commenced, it was legal. It will become illegal after the commencement of the Act. It would be unjust and unfair to penalise people who had initially entered into a legal relationship not knowing that their action was likely in the future to attract the penalties of the criminal law. The essence of what the hon. Member for Hertsmere says is that we should tell them that if they stop doing it they will not risk prosecution.
<P>
I said in response to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, and I say now in response to the hon. Member for Hertsmere, that we sought to root the Bill in the real world. Given its complexity, it is not easy to apply rational decision-making to the real world, particularly in respect of sexual activity. Notwithstanding the concerns of the working party, we decided that it would be right not to require two people who had previously innocently entered into such a relationship to stop that relationship. They did not know Parliament's subsequent intention. However reprehensible the activity, it was an innocent relationship under the law when they first entered into it.
<P>
I wish to make one thing absolutely clear. It underlines the point made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam. Under the codes of practice, the drafts of which should be on hon. Members' desks, the activity remains reprehensible. It should attract the opprobrium of the employer and be subject to disciplinary action, but we do not think that it warrants the application of the criminal law.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> In the real world, what will be in place for the next two years to prevent anybody who wishes to engage in such a relationship from claiming falsely that it predated the introduction of the Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> There will be two things. First, the code of practice will apply to those people anyway; it will bear down on them and should lead to disciplinary action. Secondly, we can rely on the good sense, wisdom and judgment of a British jury and bench. I speak as a hack of 20-odd years in the criminal courts and, in my experience, they see through that sort of bogus defence.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere invites me to go down a route into the various gradations of sexual activity, but I have no intention of doing so. The mind boggles about what would happen if I were to surrender to that temptation. I shall say only that if anyone tried to use a Clintonian defence in front of a British jury or bench, they would soon be slapped down. We all know what the nature of sexual activity is and how it intensifies in the real world.
<P>
I have absolute confidence that the magistracy and juries will blow out of the water any such defence. The hon. Member for Hertsmere remains sceptical, but I have confidence in the criminal justice system. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary and we have no intention of acceding to it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That was an extraordinary performance. If the hon. Gentleman ceases to be a member of the Government&#151;that will not happen; he is such a good Minister&#151;because he has trouble with his mortgage and returns to the criminal courts&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister knows perfectly well that there will be relatively few cases in the next two years. Let us put this into perspective. However, we know perfectly well what defence will be used by any lawyer who advises a client charged with this offence in the coming year. The easiest defence to conduct in a court of law will be that the relationship pre-dated the commencement of the Bill. That will be easy to argue.
<P>
Remember that the jury must convict beyond reasonable doubt; it must be sure. If dates and the matters referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere are mentioned, there will be room for confusion and, as the Home Office has admitted, precious few prosecutions under the Bill. I confidently predict that that defence will figure largely in the first 10 or 15 such cases. That is the real world, which the Minister has inhabited as a hack barrister for the past 20 years.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I should like to follow on from that point. I agree that there will be relatively few prosecutions, but the concern is that there might be many mischievous or malicious allegations, especially in school settings. I agree with all the reasons that the Minister has given for the clause, but it is important to describe how it provides an additional safeguard.
<P>
Such a defence would allow the prosecuting authorities rapidly to kick into touch mischievous and malicious allegations, especially those made in school settings. Otherwise, such allegations are only seen to be malicious, only when they come to court.
<P>
Throughout our debates, we must bear in mind that many unfounded mischievous or malicious allegations are brought under professional codes, especially those that apply in schools. Therefore, we must have a sense of proportion when bringing in the criminal law, especially as those who are minded to be mischievous or malicious might hear of a new criminal offence and make a false allegation to get revenge on someone. That is a further argument, over and above that which the Minister has used, for the provision of such transient defences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> After hearing the Minister's performance, I do not know whether I am expected to be a young fogey or an old hack, but he certainly gave us an old-hack performance that was worthy of the name. He was convincing but dealt with none of the points that I made&#151;least of all, the question whether there is a precedent.
<P>
The Minister is very modest about his legal credentials, but we know that he is an experienced advocate and lawyer and, of course, he has other assistance on which he can draw. However, he has cited no precedent in any other statute in the criminal law that contains such a provision. I should be interested to hear of a precedent, so perhaps the Minister will write to me if he thinks of one later.
<P>
It is a strange provision on the face of it. From time to time, Parliament decides to make criminal certain behaviour that was not an offence before the commencement of the statute. That has happened for all sorts of activity, but I cannot readily bring to mind a statute that says that certain behaviour will in future be criminal, but that it is okay if it began before the commencement of the legislation.
<P>
I can cite a different example, although it is an extremely serious one in its way. A few years ago, Parliament decided that it was wrong for people to drink and drive because it caused so many accidents. Drinking and driving became an offence from the commencement of that provision. The legislation did not say that it was all right for people who had a drink or two before the law came into force to continue drinking and driving. The same goes for any other example of criminal activity. It is not a matter of retrospection&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I can give a better example. Despite my hon. Friend's skill, he has not yet convinced Labour Members, and I know that they will want to judge the amendment on its merits before they decide how to vote. I remind my hon. Friend of the Sexual Offences Act 1956&#151;which is on a par with the Bill&#151;whereby we introduced laws criminalising indecent assault. We did not insert a proviso that, if the assaults occurred before that Act came into force, they were not criminal. There was no such proviso, and it is not true that, as the Minister said, it is built into our constitution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend has produced a far better example than I did, and he has hit the nail on the head. If we are serious about making the activity an offence, let us say seriously that it will be an offence from day one. We are talking about making illegal, not something that has happened in the past, but activities in the future. The Minister has much explaining to do if he is trying to make a defence of allowing an activity to continue not to be an offence in the future because it began in the past.
<P>
The Minister must be realistic. I note the point that he made about gradations of sexual behaviour, and the fun that was had from that. I shall not draw upon the same international example as the Minister&#151;I need not go into it at such length. The subsection leaves open a glaring gap&#151;a defence of, as it were, ``Well, it started with a kiss''. The Bill defines rigorously what is sexual activity. Clause 2(5)(b) states that it includes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any activity which such a person would regard as sexual in all the circumstances.''<P>

<P>
That could include a kiss and a cuddle; it could even include sexy dancing. A couple dancing sexily together might be regarded as taking part in a sexual activity&#151;it is a matter for the reasonable man to decide.
<P>
Anyone who, in future, is hauled up on a charge under this clause, however serious the sexual activity is after the commencement of the Act, will be able to pray in his aid sexual activity&#151;any sort of sexual activity&#151;that began before the commencement of the Act. I draw a distinction&#151;as does the Bill&#151;between sexual activity and full sexual intercourse, whether vaginal or anal. There is an important distinction between the two; full sexual intercourse is a substantial intensification of activity. Full sexual intercourse of either type&#151;homosexual or heterosexual&#151;will be permissible after the commencement of the Bill if any sexual activity between the couple had taken place before then.
<P>
I know that there is a distinction in law, because of existing law, to which the hon. Member for South Ribble drew attention. Full sexual intercourse is a substantial intensification of activity. A coach and horses is being driven through the Bill. Apparently, not many prosecutions are expected, but I wonder how many there will be when so many difficulties exist.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I want to support one of the Minister's arguments about the state of mind and intention at the time that the relationship was entered into and when the sexual activity was not a criminal offence. The Sexual Offences Act 1956 makes provision for people who marry under-age girls in a foreign country and then come and live in this country. Such people are not prosecutable, because they did not commit an offence in the country in which they married. The Marriage Act 1929 and the Marriage Act 1949 amended legislation that permitted very young girls to marry. However, prosecutions did not take place when sexual acts within those marriages became potentially criminal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not take much comfort from the hon. Gentleman's intervention. He has argued his points honourable and sincerely, and has tried to drive as many coaches and horses as he can through the measure. He wants a large number of exemptions because he does not like the Bill at all, but he is not prepared to admit that. However, the hon. Gentleman's intervention in support of the Minister is an exception to that.
<P>
The Minister made a good speech, but he did not address some important principles and practices. Although I am anxious about those unanswered questions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 31, leave out `two' and insert `five'.
<P>
The Bill makes provision for a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment for abuse of trust. Amendment No. 2 would increase that penalty to five years, and would be far more likely to achieve what the Bill intends.
<P>
	The Govenment may be influenced by the working group which examined penalties on offences in the field of abuse. The working group said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The type of mischief being penalised can be seen as analogous to some existing offences, in particular administering drugs to obtain or facilitate sexual intercourse; unlawful sexual intercourse with a female defective and unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is most important that we consider the matter of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16. It is a little strange that the maximum sentence for breach of trust with a girl over 16 is five years, when the same offence with a girl under 16 carries a maximum penalty of only two years. The maximum sentence for unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 is far too low, and has been left behind by increases in maximum sentences for other offences. In recent years, the maximum sentence for indecent assault was increased to 10 years; it might have been advisable to increase the penalty for unlawful sexual intercourse at the same time.
<P>
There are anomalies in the law. Sexual activity falling short of full intercourse carries a maximum sentence of 10 years; however, the act of intercourse itself carries a maximum sentence of only two years. I am fortified in my submissions because Conservative Members moved amendments to similar effect when the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 was in Committee.
<P>
It would be wrong to chain the maximum sentence for the new offence of abuse of trust to an unrealistically low maximum sentence for unlawful sexual intercourse. There is a strong case for a maximum sentence of five years for the breach of trust in such cases.
<P>
The Government have embarked on a review of the law on sexual offences, which may well result in an increase in maximum sentences. The maximum sentence that we are debating may then be too low. I recall the thoughtful and constructive reply that I was given when I moved amendments to the Crime and Disorder Act to increase the penalty for unlawful sexual intercourse to five years. The then Minister of State, Home Office, the Secretary of State for Wales, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Given the Government's position on these issues, we shall certainly consider whether there is a case for increasing the maximum penalty for unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16.''&#151;[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 9 June 1998; c. 819.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Ministers are always cautious in these matters, but there is a strong likelihood that that sentence will be increased. My simple argument to the Committee is, let us not fix this offence by reference to something that is generally accepted to be too low. Let us try to get it right. Let us not have something that may well be an anomaly in future.
<P>
I believe that a higher maximum sentence is needed to cater for the worst cases which could arise as a result of abuse of trust. All these offences are serious, of course, but offences will vary in seriousness. I do not want to rehearse sentencing arguments but, at the lower end of the scale, 18 or 19-year-olds, or people slightly older than that, may have sexual relations with a 17-year-old that amount to the lighter forms of sexual activities and fall short of full intercourse. That would be an offence, but not one that should necessarily attract a sentence of up to five years.
<P>
More serious offenders would also be caught by the provision, such as the much older man in his 30s or 40s, who is in a position of substantial authority over the young person and who blatantly uses that authority to lead a possibly naive and inexperienced youngster into new sexual experiences without any regard for the welfare of the youngster involved and purely for his own sexual gratification. Is two years sufficient to deal with such a predator? Will it be sufficient when, as tragically often happens, it has a permanent effect on the life of the youngster? I have wondered, and come to the conclusion that two years is not enough to deal with a bad case. Someone who behaves like that deserves longer in prison.
<P>
Finally, I come to perhaps the most important reason for proposing a higher maximum sentence, which is to send a message that we are serious about protecting youngsters from abuses of trust. Would not a maximum of five years send that message much more clearly than one of two years? If we want to send a strong message about this and say that we are serious about abuses of trust, which I believe is the wish of the Committee and the House, let us have a higher maximum sentence of five years, which sends that message loud and clear.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am nervous about the last argument used by the hon. Member for Hertsmere: that sentences should be set to send messages. They should be set according to what maximum sentence we want to be given. If we say five years, we want judges to hand down sentences of five years. We do not want to send a message without expecting it to be used. I am also nervous of the prospect of five-year sentences. Two years is more appropriate. I am concerned about the ratcheting effect.
<P>
We must always bear in mind that a range of other sexual offences already exists. If someone commits indecent assault, whether against a 16 or 17-year-old, he must be prosecuted for indecent assault with the heavy penalties that that carries. If someone commits an offence against someone under 16, and thus outside the rules of the age of the consent, that offence must carry a heavier penalty than an offence against a 16 or 17-year-old. 
<P>
We must always have a proportionate response, starting with the most heavy response for non-consensual acts, for which we must offer very lengthy sentences. We then move to another range of responses for this new hybrid category of consensual acts, where the Bill somehow overrules the consent and declares it invalid. Finally, we should have another range of measures for consensual acts that, in general, we believe should carry no criminal sanction.
<P>
It is a question of getting an appropriate scale of charges. The scale should start with serious charges for non-consensual acts, which must always be prosecuted as such, and then move towards a level of charge or penalty more appropriate than the two-year maximum sentence, for an act that was essentially consensual, but which we deem invalid because consent cannot be valid in that particular relationship of trust.
<P>
If individuals are to be prosecuted under the proposed legislation, they must have been given what they thought was consent at the time. I hate the idea of this law coming into operation if consent had not been given, because we should use the more serious laws that govern non-consensual acts. I do not wish to see a ratcheting effect, although I have sympathy with arguments for heavier sentences&#151;for example for those who abuse people under 16. However, we believe that the provisions in the Bill are broadly correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman talks about ratcheting. I may be wrong, but I understand that the maximum sentence for someone convicted of anal intercourse with a boy under 16 is already life imprisonment. Not much ratcheting could apply to those cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I will take legal advice from the hon. Gentleman, who is more skilled in these matters than me. Certainly, ratcheting could apply across the range of non-consensual acts, and the sentences could be bumped up. He has said that the sentence for indecent assault was 10 years now, and that could certainly apply to assault of those under 16. If the sentence is changed to five years, the sentence for assault of those under 16 would have to go up to something like 10 years in order for a differential to apply. Otherwise, there would be no distinction between the sentence for assault of a 16 or 17-year-old and someone under 16. I do not think that that is appropriate in law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My point is that as the law stands today, consenual acts of buggery with someone under 16 carry a life sentence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am sure that that is an issue that the Minister would want to throw into the pot when the Government consider their amendments to sexual offences legislation. I consider that the maximum sentence set out in the Bill is appropriate. I do not think that we should put a higher sentence into the Bill if we are not serious about using it.
<P>
The maximum sentence set out in the Bill, is, I consider, the maximum that should be applied to the kind of act that we are talking about, even in some of the more severe circumstances. We must bear it in mind that we are talking about 16 and 17-year-olds engaging in what they thought was a consensual act. We are not talking about non-consensual acts, for which there are plenty of other remedies that can and should be taken.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I reiterate the fact that such offences are described in the review as ostensibly consensual. I draw the attention of the hon. Member for Hertsmere to the fact that the offences can be prosecuted under the laws covering indecent assault or rape, if the consent is not valid.
<P>
For example, where someone in a position of trust uses duress, threats, punishment or offers of preferment or advancement to obtain consent, where it is possible, those offences may be prosecuted under the laws of indecent assault. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere has made clear, such offences carry 10-year sentences. The right comparator for consensual offences, where that option is not available to the prosecution, should be with other consensual offences. The hon. Member for Hertsmere has drawn attention to the fact that those sentencing provisions are a bit of a mess at the moment.
<P>
It could be argued, although I do not subscribe to this argument, that the sentence of two years for the offence of unlawful consensual sexual intercourse with a girl who is under 16 but over 13, is too low. A consensual homosexual act between men, one of whom is under 16&#151;that is illegal at the moment and, I hope, will continue to be illegal&#151;should not attract a life sentence when the sentence for a similar crime of unlawful consensual sexual intercourse is only two years.
<P>
I look forward to the contribution and, I hope, the support of the hon. Member for Hertsmere on measures to amend those provisions either as part of the wider review or as amendments to clause 1. It is vital to stress that consensual acts involve difficult areas of human relationships, however wrong those relationships are. It is not always the older person who 10takes the lead. Whatever the circumstances, we all agree that in appropriate relationships, albeit consensual, 10.25are to be condemned. Simply to ratchet up the sentences above the existing sentences for non-consensual offences sends the wrong message about consensual offences compared to non-consensual ones. We need to act in an orderly way, and I believe that the current sentencing provisions are correct.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I think that the Committee is looking at consensual acts and asking itself whether it can conceive of any court imposing a sentence of more tham two years. I can conceive of that. Surely, if we are giving power to a court, that court must have the flexibility to deal with those who have committed especially serious offences&#151;acts of manipulation or coercion.
<P>
Members of the Committee will say that we are not talking about coercion, but I can envisage a young person being manipulated by someone in trust; that is why we are creating the offence. In many cases, it is likely that the young person may be confused in his or her mind about whether he or she gave consent&#151;that is often the nature of that sort of relationship. In that event, the Crown could decide to prosecute for that offence, rather than for the others available to it for which much more severe penalties are available.
<P>
We have had serious problems in some of our residential homes. If someone in authority had been prolific in his relationships or especially manipulative in his behaviour, or if a case attracted a large amount of publicity, the public might regard a maximum sentence of two years as derisory.
<P>
Two years may seem a long time to members of the Committee who do not have experience of the criminal courts, but a sentence of two years means, with good behaviour, probably less than one year.
<P>
	Some low-grade motoring offences attract penalties more severe than two years. For instance, forgery of a certificate of motor insurance incurs up to two years in prison; mishandling or faking a parking ticket would result in up to two years; causing danger to other road users&#151;a serious offence&#151;would incur seven years. I am sure that the Government are honest in saying that they consider the offence that we are debating to be a serious one, but they are putting it on a par with forgery of a certificate of motor insurance or faking a parking ticket. I cannot believe that that is their intention.
<P>
The hon. Members for Oxford, West and Abingdon and for Sheffield, Hallam, who speak for the Liberal party&#151;
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> Liberal Democrats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I apologise. Liberal Democrats argue that it is inconceivable that a court would impose a sentence of five years. I am not sure that that is correct in the circumstances that I have described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to his suspicion that the courts might try to use the offence rather than other offences such as indecent assault; they could override any implied consent by stating that the perpetrator was reckless. Is the hon. Gentleman concerned about that? The law should not be used as an easy means of avoiding having to prove indecent assault.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. The simple answer to his question is yes, but we all know that it is difficult in such a case to bring a successful prosecution. Young people may have been severely manipulated, and their minds may be confused. It is likely that the abuse of trust legislation will be seen by the Crown Prosecution Service as a convenient tool to use in grey cases.
<P>
In highly publicised cases and in those involving an especially manipulative person who has had several relationships, the public may think that a sentence of less than one year in prison is derisory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The debate has been extremely helpful and some important points have been made. I am especially grateful to the hon. Members for Hertsmere and for Sheffield, Hallam for their analyses of the offence. Reference has been made to sentencing in relation to unlawful sexual intercourse, and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam referred to the need for proportionality in sentencing.
<P>
We have discussed the proper approach to sentencing, the length of maximum sentences and the length of sentence that such an offence should attract. Whether a sentence is set at two, three, four, five or seven years, we must approach the question of the sentencing of a convicted offender on a proper basis. When setting maximum sentences, Parliament must have in mind a figure that is appropriate and proportional to the offence, and which we are prepared to see a court impose.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere takes the view that five years is an appropriate maximum sentence. I suspect that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam is not convinced that a maximum sentence of five years is correct and thinks that, on balance, two years is right.
<P>
We arrived at a maximum sentence of two years on the basis that that was a proportional and balanced approach to the offence. We considered the existing law relating to unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged 13 to 15, and the hon. Member for Hertsmere was right to mention that. That is another consensual offence with which there would be an anomaly, as the hon. Gentleman points out, were his amendment passed. If we accepted the amendment, we would set a sentence of five years for a consensual offence involving older people but leave in place a sentence of two years for an offence involving a girl aged 13 to 15.
<P>
I said on the Floor of the House that I thought that a more severe sentence might conceivably be appropriate for unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged 13 to 15. We have a genuine dilemma in setting appropriate maximum sentences. Our approach is designed to avoid the anomaly of the comparison with the offence of unlawful sexual intercourse. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I said on the Floor of the House that we intended to carry out a review of sexual offences generally.
<P>
The hon. member for Hertsmere referred to the caution of my responses to him and other hon. Members on the Floor of the House on the question of sentencing. The reason for that caution was that, having set in train a review, it would have been improper for Ministers to arrive at a fixed and firm view before that review had had an opportunity to reflect on the totality of the picture of the diffiicult and complex question of sentencing.
<P>
I must resist the temptation to express a fixed view now, however great that temptation might be&#151;and it is great. It would be wrong to entrench yet another glaring and obvious anomaly in relation to the offence of unlawful sexual intercourse by accepting the amendment's provision for a maximum sentence of five years.
<P>
I have been informed by this morning's debate, and I should be pleased to take into account any other points&#151;including written ones&#151;that members of the Committee would like to make about the appropriate level of sentencing for this offence. I am not persuaded that it would be right to up the current maximum sentence for unlawful sexual intercourse. I do undertake, however, to reflect on it, and it would be right for all hon. Members to do so between now and the final stages of the Bill's passage.
<P>
There is an argument that a higher maximum penalty would be appropriate and, as I say, I am happy to reflect on it&#151;not least because Labour members of the Committee were addressing the issue as the hon. Member for Gainsborough spoke. One could envisage a scenario in which a 16-year-old was propositioned by a person in a position of trust saying, ``Have sex with me or you fail your exams''. In those circumstances it would be perfectly proper to bring a charge of rape and, if I were the prosecutor, I would argue strongly for such a charge to be brought.
<P>
However, it would also be open for the Crown Prosecution Service to bring an alternative charge under this provision. If the jury found that the prosecution had not discharged its duty to show beyond reasonable doubt that consent had been overborne by fear of failing exams, it would be open for that jury to find that the defendant was responsible for and culpable of the abuse of trust. In those circumstances, two years may arguably not reflect the gravity of the offence. It is possible then that a court may want to impose a sentence higher than the current maximum.

<P>

<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I apologise in advance if this point has already been addressed, but has the Minister considered what would happen when someone who has committed and been sentenced for such an offence proceeds to commit a similar offence again? Does the Minister believe that the sentence should be higher for such a multiple or serial offender?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Such a scenario is indeed possible, although I hope that it would be unlikely under the scheme that we are proposing. We are not relying solely on the abuse of trust, which will be a reportable offence in relation to the Sex Offenders Act 1997. There will be a mechanism for ensuring that offenders are checked up on and identified, and we also want codes of practice to bear down heavily and reduce opportunities to commit such offences.
<P>
Certainly serial offending should be punished commensurately. A case has been made for a higher maximum than two years in such circumstances. I do not want to pre-empt the review. However, regardless of that I shall reflect on the matter, because it is possible that we might take another course, which would not create too glaring an anomaly but would make it clear that we considered the offence, at its gravest, to be serious indeed, and in need of condign punishment.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's considerate and thoughtful reply. Will he go so far as to reflect further on the matter and possibly come up with a different maximum at a later date?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I shall certainly reflect further on the matter, because we should not have a closed or fixed mind on the point at this stage. I hope that, in the light of that fact, the hon. Gentleman may not want to press the amendment to a vote, but that is a matter for him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful. I want now briefly to deal with the remarks of other hon. Members.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam referred to the ratcheting effect, and I quoted to him the example of the consensual act of buggery of a younger person, which already attracts a light sentence. Whether that is right or wrong, the hon. Gentleman would probably agree that there can be no question of any ratcheting up in that instance. As to the two years for unlawful sexual intercourse, ratcheting up is very likely in due course in any event. I am concerned about not changing the maximum in question to an unrealistically low one.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough made some important points. We need to make provision for the worst cases. The Minister said something similar. Our judgment was strongly that the maximum sentence should be five years. I intended to press the amendment to a vote, but as the Minister is prepared to reflect on the matter and possibly suggest a different maximum, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is to an extent a probing amendment, which I hope may stimulate thought in the Home Office, in the period before the forthcoming review of sexual offences. There is much talk of the importance of the family and the devastating impact that teenage pregnancies can have on the children involved and the children who have the babies. I apologies to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, but the provision is definitely discriminatory and does not apply to homosexuals.
<P>
I should like the Minister, particularly during the forthcoming review, to ascertain how far we can use the law to discourage teenage pregnancy and reduce its occurrence. That is an aim that I am sure would be shared in the Committee and throughout the country. It applies not only to 16 to 18-year-olds but to children under the age of 16. Other hon. Members may have read a report in the weekend newspapers about a girl of 16 giving birth in the bath, not having known she was pregnant, and her 15-year-old sister saying, ``That's marvellous, because I am pregnant as well.'' That seemed to me not to be marvellous either for the children or for the children who were having them.
<P>
Consensual sex between a person in a position of trust and a girl of 16 or 17 may not destroy that girl's life. It probably will not. However, the implications of pregnancy will stay with her for a very long time. I should like the Minister to explain how he might envisage the criminal law discouraging pregnancies, and whether he considers the amendment appropriate. That is particularly relevant in the light of the Home Secretary's remarks about adoption. The subject is currently in the public domain and we should consider it.
<P>
How many older men or teenage boys who father children by mothers who are under 16 have been prosecuted? I believe that the number is small. However, it is appropriate to prosecute them, especially those who are older than 16 or 18, and thus send a message about taking precautions, the law that applies to girls who are under 16, and the undesirability of teenage pregnancy.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I was not going to speak about the amendment, and I shall be brief.
<P>
The amendment has implications that should be examined. I share the anxieties of the hon. Member for Blaby about teenage pregnancies. I have been pressing Ministers about proposals to stop the increase in teenage pregnancies. However, imprisoning the fathers in cases of consensual intercourse was not top of my list of suggestions for action.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that our debate is on sentencing, not teenage pregnancies.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> Imprisoning fathers is not an appropriate way of dealing with teenage pregnancies. Why is it that, although causing pregnancies has been singled out for stronger sentences, the passing on of sexually transmitted diseases has not? Perhaps recklessly transmitting such diseases or causing pregnancy could count as an aggravating factor that the courts could bear in mind when sentencing without increasing the maximum sentence.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's comments about 15 and 16-year-olds reveal a failure of sex education rather than problems with sentencing fathers.
<P>
A further problem is that, although abuse of trust is outrageous, we are considering consensual sexual activity. Sometimes the abuse of trust ends, and those involved stay together for some time. In such cases, taking the father from the child contradicts some of the other aims of social policy.
<P>
So I understand the anxieties of the hon. Member for Blaby about the increase in teenage pregnancies, and that amendment No. 27 is only a probing amendment. But it is peculiarly specific, and clearly inappropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I think that my hon. Friend&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Careful, Edward!
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby has done the Committee a service by raising the matter that we are discussing. But can he enlighten me about the exact meaning of the amendment? I appreciate that amendment No. 27 is a probing amendment, which highlights the problem of teenage pregnancies.
<P>
In most cases, an offender has a good idea of the result of the offence. If I punch my hon. Friend in the face&#151;of course, I have never wanted to do that&#151; he will feel pain or anguish. However, the offence that amendment No. 27 describes is different. Pregnancy may not result from sex, although that seems to happen more often in some families than in others! Is not my hon. Member for Blaby being unfair on the defendant in such a case?
<P>
I know that the amendment is a probing one, but it seeks to insert into our criminal law a dangerous new provision which carries the implication that because our society perceives teenage pregnancy as an ill, we should come down especially hard on someone who causes a teenage pregnancy&#151;so that if a pregnancy did not occur, the offender would get a much lighter sentence. I therefore cannot support my hon. Friend's amendment&#151;I am sure that he will want to argue his case further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Blaby made an interesting speech, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, who drew attention to some of the problems that might arise if the amendment were accepted.
<P>
	My hon. Friend the Member for Blaby&#151;who obviously feels strongly about the issue of teenage pregnancy&#151;has done the Committee a service in raising the matter, although I question whether the amendment is the right way of dealing with the issue. I do not wish to go over old ground, but I should like to repeat a point that I made about the maximum penalty that can be given for the offence of breach of trust. I said that we needed to cater for the worst type of case&#151;such a case would be one in which serious, permanent effects ensue for the young person concerned. Pregnancy is obviously a serious effect, but I do not know of any other instance in sexual offences legislation where the resulting pregnancy of a victim so aggravates the severity of an offence that the offender receives a heavier sentence. I am therefore unsure of the amendments legal soundness; we should be concerned about the act committed and about the breach of trust involved. That breach of trust is the real mischief that we are targeting, although we cannot totally ignore its possible consequences.
<P>
	Although there are therefore practical difficulties with my hon. Friend's amendment, it highlights the permanent effects that can follow from serious breaches of trust. One need only refer to the chapter and verse contained in the Utting report on the terrible, lifelong effects that abuse can have on young people. Pregnancy is one of the many such effects. My hon. Friend has stimulated an interesting debate; I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The amendment is idiosyncratic and eccentric&#151;even for a probing amendment. The hon. Member for Blaby was surely having a little not-so-innocent fun by tabling it. However, the amendment touches on two serious issues, one of which is teenage pregnancy&#151;an issue that is being reviewed by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health. I think that I can say with certainty that no recommendation issuing from her review will bear any resemblance to that of the hon. Gentleman. Nevertheless, unwanted teenage pregnancy is a serious issue, and no one should doubt the harm and damage done by it.
<P>
That point leads to the question of the extent to which the offence under discussion should be aggravated by the creation of an unwanted pregnancy. I believe that it would be perfectly proper for the court to take such circumstances into account when sentencing&#151;as happens in existing law in relation to rape, and will for this offence. If an unwanted pregnancy results, the courts are entitled to take that into account when sentencing. In my experience of cases of rape, the courts do take that into account, and take an extremely dim view of it, as they should. I cannot give any time whatever to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Blaby.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> Given the Minister's legendary ability with the use of language, I suppose that the word ``idiosyncratic'' was quite polite, given what I suspect he might have considered saying.
<P>
This important issue needs to be considered. In response to my hon Friend the Member for Gainsborough, I am not trying to get it into criminal law; I am attempting to raise an issue that should be given more serious consideration, legally and otherwise.
<P>
I was interested to hear that pregnancy could be considered an aggravating factor: I was unaware of that. For perhaps the only time this morning, I am in agreement with the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. I, too, think that the passing on of sexually transmitted diseases should also be an aggravating factor. I trust that that will be so. I do not consider the amendment unfair. The unfairness would rest with the child mother whom this abuse of trust would create. The consequences should be considered in the amendment, as the Minister said.
<P>
I may table a question to the Minister at some stage rather than delay the debate. Can he tell the Committee now how many fathers of children born to girls under age 16 are prosecuted? The number is minute, and there is definite proof of sexual intercourse if a girl becomes pregnant. That is one of the messages that the House should send, partly through reviews in the Department of Health or the Home Office. Perhaps one of the Minister's civil servants could let me know.
<P>
I shall not pursue the amendment to a vote&#151;idiosyncratic or otherwise though it may be. I am even surprised that it was selected.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. So was I.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have one question for the Minister. This is the clause that creates the new offence of abuse of trust. There was a mood across the House during the original debate on the Crime and Disorder Bill last June that Parliament wished to visit the issue of positions of trust. A working party has been set up since that time, and that offence was born of that concern.
<P>
My simple plea is that, having made breach of trust an offence, we take it seriously. We want to send a message to people that engaging in sexual intercourse or other sexual activity with a younger person while in a position of trust with that person is an offence in itself. We are anxious not to allow it to be whittled away by too many exceptions that would enable people to get around the provisions.
<P>
Sadly, the type of person who takes advantage of positions of trust may sometimes be persistent and dedicated and exercise great ingenuity in avoiding committing criminal offences. We do not want to leave loopholes that could be taken advantage of. The clause has been scrutinised, and we shall continue to reflect on it in that light. We want that to be taken seriously, and we want the law to be effective. We realise that not many prosecutions will take place, but, in the event of a need to prosecute and to bring someone to justice, we do not want such a person to escape through a legal loophole. Nothing offends the public more than the perception that someone has committed an offence against public morality and the law, but that a loophole has allowed such a person to get away with it. We shall continue to consider the Bill in that context, and that is the message that we want to send out on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I believe that the clause deals with abuse of trust so as to leave no one in any doubt about our seriousness as a House in addressing the problem, and that it will provide parents with the assurance that the people to whom their children are entrusted will nurture and care for them as we expect. Those who do not should be under no illusions about our determination to ensure that they are properly punished, and that the law enables those who bring prosecutions to secure convictions. We want to ensure that the context in which prosecutions are brought is of a professional discipline, with codes of practice that will also bear down on such unacceptable conduct.
<P>
I welcome the detailed consideration that hon. Members have given the clause in a useful and worthwhile debate which has explored the arguments and, in some cases, developed them in ways that will ultimately prove beneficial. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I was conscious of the time, and did not want us still to be debating clause 2 when the Committee adjourned, but I should like to ask several questions about the clause.
<P>
When hon. Members like me ask questions about the scope of the clause, it is wrong to infer that they oppose the introduction of the new criminal offence&#151;an accusation that has been made against me by some Conservative Members. On balance, I support the introduction of a new criminal offence to cover abuse of trust. My anxieties relate to its scope, especially as suggested by some of the provisions in the clause.
<P>
It is not helpful to refer to election manifestos. I am completely relaxed about that, because my views on equality, especially relating to sexual orientation, were made clear before my election, and I continue to make them clear. I am pleased to say that the bishop in whose area I reside supports my view. [Interruption.] That is always helpful. It is also helpful to have the support in some of my campaigns of the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward), a Conservative member of the Committee, who spoke eloquently on a related matter on Second Reading.
<P>
I should like briefly to draw the Minister's attention to the definition of sexual activity. The National Association of Head Teachers, which is not necessarily perceived as entirely liberal on all matters that relate to the criminal code, has mentioned concerns about activity that becomes a criminal offence as a result of the Government's decision when drafting the Bill not to define sexual activity further than that specified in subsection (5). It points out that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``At present, the Bill would allow the possibility of a 23 year old male teacher''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and&#151;perhaps we need to explore this further&#151;an 18 or 19-year-old student teacher
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``being prosecuted, convicted and registered for five years as a sex offender, for kissing a 17 year old girl with her consent, even where it was one moment of stupidity.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am unclear whether the Minister expects prosecutions to take place in such cases. If not, how does he intend the court to interpret ``sexual activity'', given that some kisses may be sexual in some circumstances, but may not constitute the extent of sexual activity that would justify criminal prosecution?
<P>
[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Member with the mobile phone please switch it off?
<P>
<B>Laura Moffatt </B>(Crawley): Forgive me, Mr. Atkinson. I did not realise that it was on.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> How does the Minister expect such issues to be raised?
<P>
My greater concern is how the Minister envisages that a mischievous or malicious allegation will be dealt with. A substantial proportion, possibly a majority, of complaints, especially against teachers under professional codes of conduct, are unfounded; they are based on mischief or malice by accusers. Obviously, the accused has the protection of anonymity or the low publicity given to false accusations when the criminal law is not involved. There is a greater risk of the outing of homosexual teachers who have committed no offence, or of the embarrassment of intolerable public scrutiny, when a false accusation is made under criminal law. Will the Minister say now how that issue will be dealt with, or undertake to do so later?
<P>
Finally, I return to the problem of gay teachers who are not out and who can be outed by means of an accusation without their having committed an offence or, indeed, without their being sexually active in any way. I am anxious that malicious or mischievous accusations will be made, especially against gay teachers, by the effect of bringing the criminal law into such matters. I hope that the Minister will reassure me that consideration has been given to my concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Gentleman should consider the real issue. He must understand that the proposal is genuinely neutral in respect of issues of gender and sexuality. False allegations can be made against gay or heterosexual teachers; an allegation against a married, heterosexual teacher is as potentially devastating to his life as it is to the life of a single gay teacher. Malicious and false allegations are always dangerous and damaging and the codes of practice will address that issue.
<P>
Similarly, the Crown Prosecution Service is experienced in weeding out the malicious and false complaints and in testing the evidence before bringing a prosecution. The same standards and safeguards will apply to this provision as apply throughout the criminal law.
<P>
It must be understood by people tempted to bring a false allegation that they can themselves be prosecuted for wasting police time. One would expect them to be prosecuted in such circumstances and for the full weight of the law to be brought to bear on them. I cannot accept the view of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon that we should not introduce the provision, which we believe to be right, and of which he recognises the force and importance, simply because it is open to false allegations. All offences are open to false allegations. We have to ensure that the evidential basis, the codes of practice and the approach of the Crown Prosecution Service will bring to bear the appropriate balance and judgment in the launching of such prosecutions. I have no reason to believe that that balance and judgment will not be there.
<P>
The issue of sexual activity raised by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is addressed within the context of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
