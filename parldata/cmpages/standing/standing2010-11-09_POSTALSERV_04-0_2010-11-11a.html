Hooper:</strong>
                           </em> Thank you and good morning, Chairman. I
believe I am the warm-up act for your final session, when the
Ministers, Vaizey and Davey, will be interrogated. It was very kind of
Opposition Front Benchers, during Second Reading, to give me a peerage
and for the Government Front Benchers to counter with a knighthood, but
the Chairman has my title
right.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000007">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
a serious note, given that this is 11 November and I am in front of a
House of Commons Committee, I would like to pay tribute to my father,
Edwin Morris Hooper, who was killed on active service returning from a
bombing raid on 16 February 1942 while serving as a navigator in Bomber
Command. By all accounts, he was a great man.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000008">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would also
like to pay tribute to my team. In 2008, when I was doing the work for
John Hutton and then Peter Mandelson, I had a panel made up of Ian
Smith and Dame Deirdre Hutton. They played a major role in this. It was
a team effort. Civil servants often get a bad press, but I have had
three years of considerable support, courtesy and hard work from the
civil servants in the Department of business, ShEx—the
Shareholder Executive—the Treasury and No. 10. Some of them are
behind me today, and I want to pay tribute to them.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000009">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
three reports. The first was in May 2008, and it was a diagnostic
report. Interestingly, that was apparently a thought from the then
Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who said, “Why don’t you
split the reports into diagnostic and solutions, because then you may
actually get agreement on the diagnosis.” If you put a diagnosis
and the solutions in the same report, everybody jumps to the solutions
and disagrees with them, so in May 2008 we had a diagnosis and
everybody agreed with it. The CWU came to my publication of the report,
and went straight to Millbank and promoted the report and the
diagnosis. So we have got considerable buy-in on the
diagnosis.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000010">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The report
itself was 16 December 2008. As you know, it was fully supported by the
then Labour Government in both the House of Lords and the House of
Commons. It went through the House of Lords and, just as it was poised
for the House of Commons, Lord Mandelson stood up in the House of Lords
and said that, due to market conditions, the Bill was being shelved.

Hooper:</strong>
                           </em> I have been careful to keep away from the
issue of minority and majority shareholdings. In the original 2008
report, I talked about strategic partnership. Indeed, it was the
Government of the day who decided that that should be a minority
shareholding and that public ownership should, therefore, be in the
majority. The coalition Government’s view is different. They are
looking at a much larger shareholding—it could be 100% minus the
10% for the employee share trust. I genuinely think that that is more a
political matter. As chairman of an independent review, I try to keep
to what I think is the important point. The important point I want to
make is that private sector capital is needed in this
business—it is needed urgently, it was needed two years ago and
it is needed now. Whether it is a minority or majority shareholding, I
would prefer to leave that to the political
process.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000013">&#160;</a>

                           </em> No. All I am saying is that I believe private
sector capital is required for the reasons that I have set out. That
needs to happen urgently. Another issue is when the Government, as
shareholder, come to sell Royal Mail, they need some flexibility. When
you are selling shares in a company—whether it is a trade buyer,
a private equity buyer or an IPO—the sellers need to have
flexibility on what amount of shares to sell. That could, indeed, be
packaged over two or three
years.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000015">&#160;</a>

that was said by some of the Communication Workers Union
representatives whom we were speaking to on Tuesday. They seemed to be
of the opinion that they could almost pick and choose some of the
measures suggested in your report. That suggests that if we address the
problems with regulation and look at pensions—if the Government
were to sort out pensions separately—that would be sufficient.
Can you elaborate on why you think or do not think that the measures in
your report should be treated as a package and should be implemented in
full?<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000016">&#160;</a>

reports in 2008 and in September 2010 were quite clear that the three
big hitting recommendations—parts 1, 2 and 3 of the
Bill—were locked together. You cannot go à la carte; this
is a three-course meal and you have to consume it as such. The unions
and I have had many discussions, and we agree on a very large number of
things. The one thing that we have never agreed on is private sector
capital, but there is no disagreement on part 2 and part 3 of the
Bill—deregulation, moving to Ofcom and the pension
deficit.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000017">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In my view,
the unions’ feeling was that you could do two or three and not
one. My main argument against that is as follows: I think it is
unreasonable for the taxpayer to take on the pension deficit, which the
taxpayer—the public purse—is going to do, without a cast
iron guarantee that the modernisation of the Royal Mail will continue
to accelerate. Modernisation of the Royal Mail was at the heart of the
2008 report and is at the heart of the 2010 report. The issues that
private sector capital will allow are, for example, that you will be
able to insulate the management more effectively from political
intervention in commercial decisions. One of the issues that we face is
a significant reduction in the number of sorting centres. In 2008 there
were 69 sorting centres; there are now 64. Seventeen sorting
centres are out for consultation, and I guess that we will end up with
something like 35 sorting centres from those 69. Obviously, there is
ample opportunity for people to try to intervene in those decisions. I
think that private sector capital helps to insulate the commercial
management of the enterprise from overmuch political
intervention.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000018">&#160;</a>

ago was that my team and I felt that there were a whole lot of issues
that, for whatever reason, the management and the unions would not sit
around a table and discuss. So when Billy Hayes and Dave Ward came to
see us, they would say things like, “We never get to see the big
picture from management. What is the five-year vision of this company?
How many sorting centres? How many delivery offices? How many job
losses? All we get is salami-slicing cuts to opex, or operating
expenditure.” The management said to us, “The moment we
sit down with the unions, strikes are threatened if we mention cost
reduction.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000022">&#160;</a>

the original report—for goodness’ sake—a very
strong case was made to the management and the unions. We did not take
sides on the matter; we just asked them to get around a table. That has
actually happened, and what is so impressive about the March 2010
modernisation agreement is that it is a very long and very detailed
document. In the preparation, which took three or four months, there
was a clear statement by the management and a clear discussion with the
management on the big picture—what is happening to the future of
the business across the main dimensions. For that reason, I think that
there has been a significant improvement.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000023">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">They
are looking at things on a much more sensible basis. The real issues
have been discussed, but, from experience, there was a pay agreement in
2007 that came unstuck by 2009, which led to industrial action. So we
have to be eternally vigilant, and the unions and management have to be
eternally vigilant, but I believe that there is great
willingness.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000026">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
important thing is that the unions, particularly Billy Hayes and Dave
Ward of the CWU, said to us from the beginning that they accept that
modernisation of the Royal Mail will involve job losses. They were not
sticking their heads in the sand and saying, “You can have
modernisation, but, by the way, don’t reduce the number of
jobs.” They were quite clear about that. They, for example,
criticised the management for never talking about anything other than
cost reduction. When one looks at modernisation—you will see
this in my report—it has a number of dimensions, one of which I
call diversification, which is the ability to move Royal Mail into new
revenue
streams.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000027">&#160;</a>

I was writing the report for the coalition Government, through my
letter box one day came a document from Radio Taxis, with which I have
an account. It said, “Please would you mind being environmental
and green and stop having things posted through the letterbox to you,
and would you come to an electronic solution and do it over the
computer?” That service will be provided by Swiss Post. I was
really upset at that moment. This is a classic example. I live in
London, I have an account with Radio Taxis and the organisation that
will do the electronic erosion of the letters business is not Royal
Mail, but Swiss Post. That is in London, in the United
Kingdom.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000028">&#160;</a>

on the board of Yell Group plc—the “Yellow
Pages”—which has businesses in America, Latin America,
Spain and here. We are all facing the same issue: structural decline is
happening alongside cyclical issues. We are trying to distinguish what
is cyclical and what is structural, so that we know how much will come
back when the recession finally lifts and when small and medium-sized
businesses feel more comfortable and feel that they have money back in

the case of Royal Mail, I stated a sort of law in the report that said,
“If it is digitisable, sooner or later, it will be
digitised.” That has implications for the management of Royal
Mail and of postal operators around the world. The United States Postal
Service lost 12.2% of letter volume last year. The Royal Mail figure
was a mere 7%. There is fundamental structural decline in the letters
business.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000035">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There are
some good bits. For example, people like to read printed magazines, so
there is still a strong magazine publishing and distribution
opportunity. Also, people still like to read catalogues in print. One
should not write off the letters business, but one should acknowledge
that if it is digitisable, there is a danger that sooner or later it
will be
digitised.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also a demographic issue. I am of a generation that still puts
letters in red pillar boxes. A 30-year-old young woman who talked to us
two years ago asked, “Why would I ever need to know
somebody’s physical address, unless there was a party?”
She said, “Here is my laptop, which has all my e-mail addresses.
Here is my mobile phone, which has all my numbers and, by the way, I
don’t answer phones unless I know who it is. So why would I need
a physical address?” There is that huge demographic
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is the bad news, but let us not forget the jolly good news, which
involves the very technology that is swiftly eroding the digitisable
letters business, and doing something else: e-commerce. If I order the
water bottle that I am holding in my hand—“Beam me up,
Scotty”—it will not yet work. When it does work, we will
have a problem.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000038">&#160;</a>

during the lifetime of members of the Committee, we will be all right.
Physical non-digitisable products are a huge growth market, and one of
the reasons why I am optimistic about the Royal Mail is that there is a
huge opportunity for it to be a major player. Indeed, Parcelforce and
Royal Mail letters are a major player in books and nappies. Amazon has
just bought a nappy company.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000039">&#160;</a>

small businesses that buy and sell goods online. At what point do you

increase in the non-digitisable packets and parcels business. I was
slightly worried about that line, so I said it to a rather key person
in the world postal industry. I told him that I would just read him a

The reason why I asked that question is that Moya Greene basically said
that there had been a two-year process when modernisation had gathered
pace. You have clearly talked this afternoon about agreements between
the unions and the management moving that forward. I am driving at when
you think will be the best point at which the business should go to
market and draw in private investment. Should we be doing it as quickly
as possible? Should we be concluding particular elements of the
modernisation process? How does it fit
together?<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000047">&#160;</a>

response to your colleague. I am slightly nervous about getting into
that. It is a commercial matter. For those selling the Royal Mail, it
will be a partly confidential process. Big trading issues are involved.

so often spend our time on the private sector point, because it is
probably more politically contentious and we tend to underestimate the
regulatory matters. Part 3 of the Bill is extremely important. It has a
lot of very good material. I think it will also give Ofcom sensible
flexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
think that we in this room should try to regulate Royal Mail in a close
sense; that is much better left to an independent regulator. You may
say that I am biased because I was the founding deputy chairman of
Ofcom. I am an acknowledged fan of Ofcom and how it has approached
things, so I think it will do an extremely good
job.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000052">&#160;</a>

37 was discussed on Tuesday and it says that Ofcom “may”
impose access regulation. That is a very interesting use of the word
“may”. Moya Greene has a strong view about ex ante access
regulation, and I think it is important that Ofcom has that
flexibility. Indeed, clause 6 of the Communications Act 2003 gives
Ofcom deregulatory powers, so it gives it the ability to
deregulate.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
heart of what I was saying in the report is: decide where the general
monopoly, for want of a better word, is. Economists do not usually let
me use words such as “monopoly”, but I like to use it.
Decide where it is. Effectively, it is in the delivery bit of Royal
Mail—99% of letters are delivered by Royal Mail, and
up stream is much more competitive. Decide where the monopoly is and in
that monopoly you have the universal postal service strongly welded.
Make sure that that is very clearly and well regulated, then reduce
regulation outside the monopoly where competition is beginning to bite.
That is the philosophy in the report and I think that that philosophy
is in part 3 of the Bill,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
you look at part 3 line by line, you might make sure that Ofcom and
Postcomm are content that there are sufficient powers to prevent
cherry-picking. Cherry-picking is a big issue and one that we have
discussed at length. It basically means that somebody comes in and
starts delivering two days a week to Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester,
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Cardiff, and then expects the rest of his or her
mail to be delivered by Royal Mail to all the nasty places that cost
lots more money.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000055">&#160;</a>

basic cross-subsidisation issue, because my first-class mail from north
London to Kensington is subsidising that to the Orkneys. Do make sure
that Ofcom and Postcomm, which is giving over the role, are content
that they have the powers to stop cherry-picking, because it would be
very damaging to the universal postal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000056">&#160;</a>

half-year results of Royal Mail show you that this company’s
financial state is significantly worse than when we reported two years
ago. There will be a need for money. The advantage of private sector
capital is that it is more flexible. It is quicker. One of the problems
with capital from the public purse, which Royal Mail has dealt with in
the past, is the whole issue around state aid and Brussels. The last
time the Government put money into Royal Mail, it took two years for
Brussels to agree it. So it is not the most flexible thing.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000060">&#160;</a>

all comes down to the famous inter-business agreement, which is a
contract between Royal Mail right now, even though they are in the same
company, and Post Office Ltd. The importance of the inter-business
agreement should not be underestimated. It generates, as you know, one
third of Post Office’s revenue, which is around £350
million a year. The inter-business agreement has to be well thought
through, well negotiated and have a sensible time scale. George Thomson
talks about a 10-year time scale and others talk about a five-year time
scale. There are commercial issues there. It is extremely important
because Post Office Ltd clearly has to have certainty for its future
and, indeed, Royal Mail for its future. Moya is one of the strongest
advocates of reminding us all that the front office for Royal Mail is
extremely important. It is extremely important both for putting mail
into the system and for retrieving parcels and

five or 10 years. If you are a sub-post master with the money invested

sides will have a very strong view on it. It clearly has to be there.
It has to be for a proper amount of time. It has to address the right
issues. One of the interesting issues is the extent to which there is a
symmetric exclusivity in the contract. That is to say, post offices
cannot deal with postal competitors to Royal Mail but nor can Royal
Mail open postal outlets that are not post offices. That is quite an
important issue. There may be competition issues surrounding that
notion of exclusivity. All of those will have to be carefully

relationship between the work force and the management. I believe that
employee shares that are correctly structured—I shall come back
to the “correctly structured” point in a
moment—help employee

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not know whether the Committee has had a chance to see any of the
Royal Mail’s world-class manufacturing sites. If you have time
to go to Cardiff, to the Northern Ireland sorting centre or to Gatwick,
it is an extraordinary experience. I think you were told about it
earlier, but there you have three and now a growing number of sorting
centres where employees are expressly asked to suggest ways of
improving shop-floor practices. That is not someone from the management
saying, “I’m now going to move that glass from here to
there.” It is the guy or woman who is doing it saying,
“Actually, it’s not in the right place. What if we put it
over there?” What you see at Gatwick—I understand that
the situation is the same in Cardiff and Northern Ireland—is
that costs have gone down, productivity has gone up and, very
importantly, accidents have reduced
massively.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was at the National Maritime museum a couple of weeks ago as a guest of
Royal Mail when the world-class manufacturing awards were being
presented. That was the first time Royal Mail had ever won medals in
the world-class manufacturing awards, and those three sorting centres
all won bronze medals. The only other manufacturer that was winning
awards was Fiat of Italy, which uses very, very advanced manufacturing
processes.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000069">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">So in answer
to your question, employee shares help employee engagement. I think
they encourage it. I also think that the idea of the trust is very
important. This is, again, more of a political decision, but there is a
problem with employees just having shares. I know about this because I
was at BT in 1984 during privatisation. What happens is that employees
punt on shares, and the moment they need a holiday, they sell the
share, so some of the incentivisation is lost. The beauty of the John
Lewis Trust style is that you do not physically own the share. You
cannot sell it; you do not make capital gains at the end of your time.
Basically, you are being involved in a profit-share, dividend-share
arrangement, which means that when you leave John Lewis—or when
you leave Royal Mail if there is this trust—those shares still
stay in the body, and I think they are more engaging, but that is a
personal

Mark Higson, the managing director of Royal Mail Letters, who has
played a major role in the modernisation of the company over the past
two or three years, he has great clarity. When I have talked to people
from Gatwick, Cardiff and Northern Ireland, I have felt that there is a
great deal of clarity as to what will be required. They realise that it
is a tough world out there, and that the digital media are not the
ideal competitors—they eat your lunch. I think there is a strong
sense of that; I think there is a strong sense in the union. You only
have to look at that modernisation agreement, which is not just
tinkering around the edges. That document talks about the number of
sorting centres, which are critical-infrastructure, capital-investment

hurt my back, and I walked about 4 miles a day, which I did not need to

first MP who I ever talked to, back in 2008? I had the most wonderful
conversation with him, in which he made one key point that resonated
right through the report. He said, “Mr Hooper, do not forget
that when we talk about social and economic glue in rural areas, we are
talking about not just granny and you and I, but small and medium-sized
businesses that are critical parts of rural areas. They do not just
work in towns, so the universal postal service is critical to their
functioning.” I was extremely grateful to Mr Weir for making
that strong point, which resonates still.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I believe the
answer is part 3 of the Bill; it is about the regulatory framework.
Ofcom is a tough regulator, and there is much evidence of its
toughness. It clearly has the mandate to ensure that the universal
postal service is maintained, and there are elements in the Bill about
how it might be changed in the future. I am under no doubt that
properly regulated, a company that is 90% privately owned will not be
allowed to renege on its universal postal service
obligations.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000087">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
think there is a slight paradox about the universal postal service.
With the fact that you have access on six days a week to 28 million
households in the UK, you could argue that that is a liability, but you
could also argue that that is an incredible marketing asset,
particularly if you have this wonderful brand called the Royal Mail,
which is a great brand. You have this fantastic brand and an
infrastructure that allows you access to 28 million
businesses and homes across the UK without fear or favour. I think the
combination of those two will mean that you will not lose it in private
hands.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000088">&#160;</a>

service in rural and island areas, for example, is a considerable cost
to Royal Mail, and will be on a private operator? Other providers get
the benefit of that—the last-mile service, or whatever it is
called. I just wonder whether we will not find, in a privatisation,
huge pressure from the privatised company for a reduction in the terms
of the USO as part of its cost-cutting measures.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000089">&#160;</a>

three mechanisms that are cleverly worded to ensure the future. I want
to be absolutely clear now. I have said to both management and the
unions: “Right now Royal Mail, no excuses, you’ve got to
modernise, to accelerate modernisation. At the moment, we’re not
going to talk about compensation funds that suddenly say,
‘Perhaps someone else will pay for it.’ Going from six
days to five, which saves £250 million a year, you are not going
to get that, you are modernising. When you are fully modernised and you
are best in class”—we can measure that in <em>x</em>
years’ time—“if the universal postal service is a
major financial burden, you can then look at compensation funds, and so
on.” I think that that is a perfectly reasonably way forward.
But you, as politicians, should be tough and say, “You’ve
got to be best in class. When you are that, if it becomes a huge burden
or becomes impossible, we will look at that.” Taking something
like the regulation of payphones—who has recently thought about
the matter? The coming of the mobile phone has fundamentally changed
the way in which you think about payphones, so as we

point that I think you have intimated already, we know that currently
there are 11,900 post offices and that 4,000 are profitable. That
leaves 7,900 that are not profitable. My question is in two parts.
First, is there a minimum requirement of access points to make the
universal service obligation work, and secondly, what will happen to
the 7,900 non-profitable post offices, if there is no protection in the
legislation? I cannot find any protection in the Bill for those post
offices.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000095">&#160;</a>

                           </em> My study was very much on the Royal Mail and
not postal services. Neither Government asked me really to look at post
offices, except as the front office of Royal Mail. So, I did not study
that in
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Just
recently, the Government announced a significant increase in funding
for post offices. My view was always that post offices were not
fundamentally a commercial operation—there was a strong social
and public purpose to them—but you could look at Royal Mail
slightly the other way around. It basically has a strong commercial
business and a very important throbbing heart of the universal postal
service. So, I looked at the issue in slightly different
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000097">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Government
have announced plans for the future of post offices, have increased the
funding for that and have put forward a number of ideas about how to
improve profitability, and it is entirely possible that the
mutualisation idea could help that employee engagement. As we know, 97%
of all post offices are not Crown post offices; they are run by small
and medium-sized businesses, and so there is a strong incentive to get
it
right.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
think that the current figure of 11,500 is right, and I think that the
Government have said that they are not going to reduce that figure.
When you look at this in terms of distance—90% of the population
are within a mile or something—that is a very important figure.
So, there are big challenges in the Post Office; they are not ones that
I have studied, but they need care, attention and good management.
There is a strong argument for saying that Post Office and Royal Mail
are fundamentally different businesses. Basically, the Post Office is a
retail outlet—a big retail network—and the Royal Mail is
fundamentally a logistics business. By, in a sense, splitting them in
two, you might get an even stronger management focus on both the
logistics side and on the retail side than at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000099">&#160;</a>

I will be quite honest. I am tempted to say what President
Obama once said, which is, “It is above my pay grade.”
Clearly, the regulatory framework sets up the regulation of Royal Mail
rather than post offices, but I think the access points of pillar boxes

he did for both the previous Government and for this Government. It was
extremely helpful, and it really got a lot of consensus behind the sort
of things that we are proposing. It is no coincidence that the Bill is
not that dissimilar from the 2009 Bill that the previous Government

that Consumer Focus said this morning that it would like to see that

Richard Hooper mention five years in his evidence to us. We have also
heard it said that, when the prospectus for the sale goes through,
there will be a statement in the prospectus about the IBA. Why is there
no time scale in the Bill? Linked to that, why doesn’t the Bill
oblige the universal service provider to utilise Post Office Counters

Davey:</strong>
                           </em> The inter-business agreement is what it says
on the tin—it is an agreement; it is a contractual relationship.
It is currently between Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd, albeit that
they are in the same group, but it is a commercial agreement between
those two companies now. No previous Government have thought to put it
on any different footing. I am pretty clear that there will an
agreement in the future, but it is for the two companies, which will be
separate and not in the same group, to reach that agreement. I refer
the Committee to what the chief executive of Royal Mail, Moya Greene,
and Donald Brydon, the chairman, said. Moya Greene said it was
unthinkable that there would not be a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 122<a class="bkMark" name="Column122">&#160;</a>
                           </div>long-term relationship between Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd. Donald
Brydon said that he wanted to have the longest possible legally
permissible agreement, and that is what he intends to do. So, I start
from that basis in response to the question, but I would make this
really important point: the drive behind our reforms to the post office
network is to make it much more commercially viable.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the
Committee has already heard, a large number of the post offices are
currently not commercially viable and, therefore, require subsidy. The
analysis that I have seen is that if we do nothing, that subsidy will
grow and grow and grow. If we do not take action, invest and put
forward this proposal, the estimate is that the subsidy will grow to
£400 million a year by the end of the spending review, which I
do not think is sustainable. That is why we have a whole set of
policies to invest in and transform the post office network, and a
whole set of other polices to turn it around. By doing that and by
improving customer service—having longer opening hours in many
post offices, reducing the queues and improving the customer
experience, so that there are more services available across the post
office network—the subsidy requirement will be reduced. That is
the way to think about the future of the post office network.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have to
equip the post office network for the future. As Richard Hooper made
very clear, the volume of letters is going down and down and down. The
post office network’s revenues are therefore affected by those
same digital trends, because its mail business is going to go down. We
have to look at other ways of getting business through the post office
network, not just surviving on the past. For all those reasons, I think
that our approach is the right approach, and I just do not think that
it is possible—to return to your original question—to
enshrine an agreement into statute law. Governments have done so in the
past, but we are not going
to.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000116">&#160;</a>

that the link will not be broken between Royal Mail and Post Office
Ltd, why not put it in the Bill? You have talked about non-viable post
offices. Surely, a long-term IBA is a potential solution for those post
offices that are not viable. A long-term business arrangement would be
very important to the many small and medium-sized enterprises that run
post offices and need to invest in their businesses, at the same time
as having a contract of this nature. A long-term IBA would, therefore,
be a further encouragement for these businesses to invest in their
businesses and improve the quality of the service that they provide.

Although it is not quite the same situation as with Serco and its
suppliers, in such a position you have a major player and somebody who
is dependent on the major player. Royal Mail will have all the cards in
its hand at that point, so it is very important to understand whether

Davey:</strong>
                           </em> Well Mr Banks, I hope that I can answer all
those questions. Quite a few were wrapped up in that, but let me see
whether I can answer them all. If I miss any, please come
back.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <p class="tabbed">You started off
by asking why we are not putting that into legislation. I do not want
to repeat what I have said, because the first question was quite
similar to that, but I want to try and get this point across. If you
actually wrote that there should be a contract between two companies
that are going to be separate companies into law, I think that it would
be subject to serious legal challenge. I am not aware of any precedent,
and I think it would be a bizarre thing to do. Previous
Governments have not thought it necessary, which is why we do not think
it is necessary. It would be open to challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When we are
talking about sub-postmasters having reason to invest in a business,
you are absolutely right; we have to give them confidence and certainty
going forward. They have not had that for a long time. When you talk to
sub-postmasters, they have gone through a searing experience in recent
years, and they want to be reassured that things are going to get
better. However, I do not think that you do that by putting into law an
agreement that is subject to legal challenge and does not actually deal
with the underlying economics. My whole approach, both to Royal Mail
and to post offices, is to deal with the underlying economics. I think
sub-postmasters will be rather more convinced that they can invest if
you deal with that, if they know that new services will be coming
across their counters, if they are clear that the Government have a
clear vision for the future of the network and if they know that parts
of the network will not be closed in the way that they
were.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">You
have asked about other operators and providers. One of the great things
about the post office network is that it has nearly 12,000 outlets, and
it has a real competitive advantage because of its size. If you take
all the high street supermarkets and put them together, you have a
network of just 4,000. If you take all the banks and put them together,
you have a network of slightly less than 10,000, I think. They tend to
be in the same streets and not in rural areas, as post offices often
are. The Post Office has a very different network, which is much larger
than any rival. That is its strength. Even after the closures—I
think 7,000 post offices closed under the previous Government—it
is still a large network. We believe that we need to play on that
competitive advantage.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the
consumer experience, if you look at the market research, it is not
about the network and accessibility. It is about queues, and about post
offices not being open long enough and not having all the services that
consumers want. That is what we are going to tackle. We are going to
tackle the underlying economics, which I think is the right approach,
as opposed to thinking that you can solve economic matters by passing
regulations and laws.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000124">&#160;</a>

Davey:</strong>
                           </em> I think that the relationship between Royal
Mail and the post office network is really important. When you talk to
them—you heard Tuesday’s evidence—both parties
feel that they have a long-term future working together. They are
dependent on each other and that is right. I agree with that; it is
really important. I cannot envisage a situation where Royal Mail would
want to leave a vacuum for its competitors—other parcel
companies, courier companies and so on—to come in and use the
space of the post office network, which is such a trusted space in the
public’s mind. It would be shooting itself in the foot, and I do
not think that Royal Mail would do that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Royal
Mail is likely to want to put its relationship with the Post Office on
a contractual footing, as it has done in the past. We heard from Donald
Brydon on Tuesday, and that is what he wants to do. He wants to refresh
that relationship, prior to the separation, and he wants a deal that is
as long as possible. When you listen to Donald and Moya Greene who,
with respect, are expects in the industry and are running the
corporations, you get the impression that they want the relationship to
continue. I am rather more reassured that the people running the
businesses want that relationship to continue than I would be if we
passed a law that could be subject to legal
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000127">&#160;</a>

questions.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000128">&#160;</a>

Davey:</strong>
                           </em> On the first point, both are important. There
must be more product development. If mail flows are going to go down,
we must have other services. That is really important. In the near
term—the next five to 10 years or whatever—it
is important that mail goes through that network. However, if we rely
only on that and see the flow fall, the revenue will not be there for
the post office network. We need that product innovation in the medium
and long
terms.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000129">&#160;</a>

length of time do I think the IBA should be for? Let us be absolutely
clear as there is some confusion: the Government are not party to the
IBA. I have never seen the IBA and neither, I believe, have other
Ministers, although I cannot speak for the previous Government. Why?
Because it is a contract between Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd. I am
led to understand that the current IBA was signed for five years. I
heard what Donald Brydon said, and I would certainly agree with the
chairman of Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000130">&#160;</a>

as the shared ownership part of the Bill, we are also dealing with the
historic pension deficit. I told him that on the face of it, I thought
that the Bill represented an exceedingly good deal for the employees of
Royal Mail. He seemed to disagree. I want to get your opinion. Have you
been disappointed by the union’s response to the Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000131">&#160;</a>

                           </div>my door is open to them and that I want to continue that dialogue. That
is my job. They have raised points on behalf of their members, which is
exactly what they should do. I am not going to say that I am
disappointed with them. I note in passing that Billy Hayes was kind
enough to say that I am more emollient than Lord Mandelson, although I
would not necessarily want to draw any further conclusions from
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
Billy Hayes recognises that there are two key parts of the Bill for his
members. I think that the solution for the pensions of his members is
really good. The provisions in the 2009 Bill were good, and we have
made slight improvements to them. It is a good deal for Royal Mail
employees. When I go round delivery offices in Kingston and Surbiton
over Christmas, I will be telling people that I think that they have a
great deal, and I am delighted that we have been able to put it
forward. I hope that the CWU will appreciate that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On employee shares, I heard
what was said in answer to those questions, and I am not surprised at
that. I think that union members will be pleased that the
Government are providing them with a chance to share in the future
profitability and success of Royal Mail. I am not necessarily sure that
all union members agree with Mr Hayes. Ultimately, the trade
union—quite understandably—wants to ensure that the
terms, conditions and jobs of its members are looked after. But in the
past 13 years, 65,000 jobs were lost in Royal Mail under public
ownership. The union was very reasonable to sign up to the agreement
with Royal  Mail to modernise, which sees jobs effectively
going. The management and unions are to be congratulated on coming to
that modernisation agreement and accepting that automation
and technology will have consequences for jobs. We will act in a
compassionate and humane way, and people who lose their jobs will be
treated absolutely
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000134">&#160;</a>

heard from Richard Hooper and Moya that in the world class mail
project, which is right at the cutting edge of where Royal Mail needs
to be in its sorting and delivery sites, the health and safety record
has improved. Modernisation and our proposals are in the interests of
Royal Mail employees, not only because of pensions and employee shares
but because it is the only way to ensure that their jobs are
sustainable in the future and that their working conditions continue to
improve. As Minister, I care passionately about those

                        <p class="tabbed">In due
course, I am going to the all-party parliamentary group on employee
share ownership, which is doing a report in this area. I am keen to
hear its advice. We are listening to some of the witnesses who gave
evidence on Tuesday—the Employee Ownership Association, for
example—about how we can do it. I have my own views, which I am
happy to share with you now about how we might go ahead. In matters
such as employee share ownership and mutuality, it is important that
you consult and discuss and give yourself—in an enabling
Bill—some flexibility to make sure you get it
right.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So,
how am I minded? As was debated on Second Reading—I think it
came from Labour colleagues—longevity in the employee share
relationship is important. Therefore, there is a lot of attraction in
the employee share trust model, so that the benefits to productivity
and to individual Royal Mail employees are ongoing. There is clearly an
attraction there.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">But that is
not to say that we should completely discount individual share
ownership as well—or, more likely, a mix of the two. We should
not be tying our hands here; we should be looking at the options. We
might not have an initial public offering and not sell shares in the
open market—individual share ownership does not look quite right
there. However, if we were to go to an IPO, there is no reason why we
could not do a mix and keep the advantage of the trust for the
longevity I referred to earlier, as well as potentially offering
individual shares. We are quite open and we want to have a good debate.

views.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000141">&#160;</a>

in clause 2, we are putting a requirement on ourselves to report back

wanting to look too far ahead to that debate, I would say that if you
look at all—I could be wrong about that, but certainly
most—of the past privatisations where there has been paving
legislation, there has not been a subsequent vote, and there is a very
good reason for that. When you are doing a transaction or a deal, and
getting European state aid and the other things that you have to do,
you need certainty, to get value for the taxpayer and to ensure that
you get the interests of Royal Mail right.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000145">&#160;</a>

in the universal service order, which is the parallel to the licence
that Royal Mail has at the moment. When Ofcom makes that order, I
imagine that it will look to the licence that has gone in the past
under the previous regulatory regime and try to mimic most of it. It is
not for me to tell Ofcom—the independent
regulator—exactly what it will put in its first universal
service order.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000156">&#160;</a>

Ofcom was the regulator that the previous Government chose, and that

would have led to both companies remaining in Government ownership, but
in this case there will be a privatised Royal Mail. Why are access
points less important than pick-up-and-delivery, which will be part of
the universal service obligation?<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000160">&#160;</a>

question, Gregg, is that what we are taking forward is exactly the
regime that is in the Postal Services Act 2000. We are not trying to do
anything unusual here, and we are putting the onus on the regulator to
regulate in that area. That is what was proposed in the 2009 Bill and

                           </em> I am glad that you asked that question. You
are referring, I think—I want to give you the right
answer—to clause 29(5), which we will no doubt come to. The
reason why we put that forward is that it is more about who is
regulated, as opposed to what is regulated. There are a number of
postal operators, such as courier companies and express mail companies,
that are not regulated at the moment. There is a danger that they would
be unclear and uncertain when Ofcom starts, if Ofcom chose to regulate
them. We wanted to remove that uncertainty.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, those companies are regulated only on consumer protection
grounds—for example, on complaint handling. We wanted to make
sure that they did not, by a mistake in legislation, come under the
scope of regulation at the start of Ofcom’s jurisdiction. That
is the sole reason why clause 29(5) is in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not know
whether this lies behind the question—I am sure that you would
not want to suggest that we would want to do this—but you might
think, if you read this in the wrong way and thought that we had the
wrong intent, that the Bill wants to change what is in the Royal
Mail’s licence, which will be in the universal service
order.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000165">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I would never suggest that. Can I present a
scenario to you, which you may find a somewhat cynical view of the
provision? We have a situation in which the Minister can exclude
services from the universal service order, but cannot add them. In
theory, Ofcom will make a decision on the universal service order
independent of any interference or influence.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000166">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Do you not
agree, however, that it is human nature not to like to be
second-guessed? It may be possible that Ofcom will want to know
discreetly how the Secretary of State’s mind is moving as
regards the universal service order and the exclusion of services from
it. Once that mechanism is in place, where the Secretary of State can
remove services but not add them, you could end up with a situation
where Ofcom announces the removal of services from the universal
service obligation and the Minister comes to Parliament, or the media,
and says, “My hands are tied—there is nothing I can do
about it. I cannot add services, I can only exclude them.” Is
that not a potential problem?<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000167">&#160;</a>

which I think you are, it is very clear that that refers only to the
first universal postal service order, not to every universal postal
service order. Whether it is the Secretary of State or myself, we are
making it absolutely clear, on the record in <em>Hansard</em>,<em>

not regulated for lots of services at the moment will not be regulated

                           </em> We have introduced a number of provisions to
the Bill that differ from the 2009 proposals, which I hope will ensure
that the universal service provider is not unfairly affected. There is
an overriding duty on Ofcom to secure the universal service, which was
in the 2009 Bill. We have added the duty to ensure the financial
sustainability of the universal service provider. We have toughened up
the duties on Ofcom to look after the universal service provider. That
is a very important change. When we debate part 3 of the Bill, I hope
colleagues will realise that we have responded to the concerns of
Members of all parties that Royal Mail has been unfairly treated in the
past.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have also changed the access provisions; I forget which clause that is
in, although I can find out shortly. Ofcom will be able to mandate
access to Royal Mail’s network—primarily its sorting
centres or inward mail centres—only if it meets several
conditions simultaneously. Effectively, we have put “and”
where it said “or” in the previous Bill. That toughens up
the regime, which is welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000180">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We can expand
more when we debate that clause in detail, but in brief, if we had not
done that, I fear that competitors might have requested access to Royal
Mail’s network at almost any point they wanted—I am not
saying that they would have done that, but that they might have had the
power to do so. That might have been quite disruptive for Royal
Mail’s management and very costly. I believe that it would have
imposed unfair costs on Royal Mail. I think that that action has
improved on the 2009
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000181">&#160;</a>

Davey:</strong>
                           </em> I made the confession on Second
Reading—it is good to make confessions regularly—that
before I was elected in 1997, I was a management consultant
specialising in postal administrations. I worked for a number of post
offices and wrote a number of reports. Although one Committee member
believes that I was involved in privatising post offices around the
world, I was not. I have never privatised a post office before this
one.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
the record, we are privatising Royal Mail. If you get into postie talk
with the Universal Postal Union, which is the United Nations body that
represents all postal administrations around the world, it talks about
post offices, but they all have different names. We are privatising
Royal Mail, which is the postal administration in the United
Kingdom.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
lot of my work looked at the threat of digital media to what are
effectively a physical delivery companies. I spent a year working for
Posten, the Swedish post office, to analyse the threat of internet and
e-mail to its mail flows, products and services. As a result, my
consultancy got into looking at how postal administrations should
position themselves in the digital age. That was in 1995, so it was 15
years ago when life was rather different. We looked at a range of
value-added services from hybrid mail, which I am happy to talk about
in detail if you want me to, and postal administrations getting into
e-mail delivery services and other electronic services. You heard from
Richard Hooper how he gets information about his local car hire company
from Swiss Post. There are a number of products and services that use
electronic services provided by different postal
administrations.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a company called the International Post Corporation, which Maya
Greene was a member of when she was chief executive of Canada Post
Corporation. No doubt she is a member of it now, because Royal Mail is
a partner shareholder of IPC. One of the reasons why it was originally
set up was to look at these issues, although it has a much wider
remit.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is a
long answer to your question, which is to say that there is a lot of
scope for Royal Mail to get into that area. It has a lot of plans to do
so, but because it has been in a relatively weak
position—particularly financially—it has been worried
that if it were to develop those products and services now, it might
cannibalise its own letter volumes. Entering the market, therefore, and
how you do so, is quite important, and on balance, it was probably
right to hold back. With the capital that it

the Bill, it will be much better placed to take advantage of the types
of service that other post administrations have been involved in for
some

has said. When we talk about regulation and Postcomm moving into Ofcom,
and Richard’s evidence about Royal Mail being part of a much
wider landscape of communications, that is a signal that Royal Mail
will no longer be an island. That is a huge
opportunity.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000188">&#160;</a>

do not know enough about what Royal Mail is planning to do, but I
suspect that having private investors will open up huge opportunities
for it. It is also an extraordinarily powerful brand. I do not have any

a little further on universal service obligations, which are composed
of all sorts of things but which have two important
elements—first, collection and deliveries and, secondly, access
points. We know that the Bill protects the first, but it does not
protect the second. I wonder why that is. I wonder whether that is more
about ideology than anything else. On Second Reading, in answer to one

the hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East. Our
approach is the same as that in the 2009 Bill and in the previous
regulatory regime. Let us remember that those were gold-plated regimes
from the European directive. We are not doing anything unusual in terms
of either how postal administrations are regulated throughout Europe or
how they have been regulated in the UK in the past. Interestingly, the
European postal directive makes its regulatory framework irrespective
of ownership. As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows, there are
postal administrations in Europe that are already in private hands, and
they are governed by the same postal directive with the same regulatory
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000193">&#160;</a>

the UK National Audit Office in 2004? It

its attempts to reform its post offices network were drastic, poorly

will believe it is reasonable for me to say, because every other Postal
Affairs Minister before me will have had to say, that I cannot
guarantee that a post office in any particular village or town will not
close at any time. That is for this reason—97% of sub-post
offices are privately owned, and people may die, retire, move away or a
range of things may happen that we cannot control, which is important
to recognise. However, we have made a legal agreement with Post Office
Ltd and provided the funds so that, over the next four years, there
will be 11,500 post offices in the United Kingdom, which is a pretty
big step forward compared with what we have been used to in recent

dramatic change of approach from the past. The last Government and,
indeed, previous Governments, did not think that the number of post
offices should be written into statutory legislation. Postcomm did not
regulate the number of them and, in fact, it hardly regulated the Post
Office side of Royal Mail Group at all. It only provided for a report,
which we have made provision to repeat in the Bill for Post Office Ltd.
So, regulation has not been involved in the area that you are talking

you think about it, post offices are privately owned. To come back to

offices open, particularly given the detailed access criteria that we
have, in such a way that Post Office Ltd would be committing an offence
when the genesis of that offence was a private operator closing its
post office. It would be rather unfair to Post Office Ltd to put into
law that it would commit an offence for the actions of someone

is one of the means by which we can see not just a sustainable future

moving to a mutual would put the post office network in a worse

pension deficit and the Government’s commitment to take it on.
It is clearly a great deal for Jane Newell’s pension plan
members and for Royal Mail, because it is already holding it back. Can
you talk about how this will also be a good deal for the taxpayer? A
lot of people would like their pensions propped up by the Government,
and they are going to be paying for this. Moreover, given that you are
looking to privatise Royal Mail, do you have any idea of the time frame
you will set out to make the division between the new Government scheme
and the Royal Mail pension
plan?<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000209">&#160;</a>

Davey:</strong>
                           </em> In terms of the taxpayer, that is a very fair
point, because this is a pretty generous deal. It is the right deal.
For the Government to take on liabilities that are bigger than assets
to the tune, according to current valuations, of more than £8
billion is quite an ask. I think that is ultimately in the interests of
the taxpayer, however, because we want to see sustained capital
investment in Royal Mail. If you left the pension deficit, given the
size it is with Royal Mail, you would not get that investment. In order
to get a better future for Royal Mail and a long-term better deal for
the taxpayer, I think this is the right package. It is the package that
Richard Hooper and the previous Government proposed, and I think it is
the right way. The Treasury, which is the ultimate guardian of the
taxpayers’ interest, has certainly agreed to it.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000210">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">You
make a valid point about how we will offer the solution to this. As we
said on Second Reading, it is vital to ensure that the Royal Mail
pension plan has an appropriately sized pension plan going forward. The
liabilities of Royal Mail are currently more than 50 times
annual profits. By comparison, the liabilities of an average FTSE 100
company are close to one times profit. That gives you another measure
of how massive the pension deficit
is.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Since
Second Reading, we have been considering when the dividing line, or the
cut-off, should be between the liabilities that the Government will
take on and what will remain with the ongoing Royal Mail pension plan,
which will be with the company. We have reflected on that and come to
the conclusion that the cut-off date will be as close as is practical
to the date of the sale of the shares in the business. We will, no
doubt, tease this out a bit more when we debate those clauses, but
based on an illustrative cut-off date of 31 March 2012, which I think
is a sensible one, our estimates are that that would leave liabilities
of about £1.5 billion with the plan. That relates almost solely
to the salary-link liability, which, again, is a bit of a technicality,
and I am sure that we will talk about it during the passage of the
Bill. Given that those liabilities are based on salaries, which Royal
Mail will control, we thought that they should not come to the
Government, because we will not control them, but that they should stay
in the
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
key thing is that, at the point of transfer, the RMPP—the Royal
Mail pension plan—will be fully funded. That will reassure the
company and the RMPP’s beneficiaries, and, indeed, I think it
will help the sale. So that is the approach we are planning to
adopt.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000213">&#160;</a>

amount, and she is the chief executive. She thinks that it will be in
the range of £2 billion to £3 billion. People did not
question her about this, but, in terms of completing the modernisation,
I think she was referring to the near term. Why do I say that? I say
that because a company the size of Royal Mail, in an industry going
through the changes that it is going through, is not going to need just
a one-off capital injection. It needs to invest
continually.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000222">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
order to help these proceedings, I have asked my officials to look at
the capital investment that Deutsche Post has had since it first
floated shares in 2001. When you control for fluctuations in the
exchange rates, it has invested £11.9 billion since 2001.
Reasonable people in this room realise that, over the next nine years,
the Government are not going to have £11.9 billion available, so
that will have to come from somewhere else. I simply say that it is
clear that, within Treasury controls and with the slowness of getting
such capital, sometimes, but not always, with the need for state aid
approval, that is not a great way for a large company in competitive
markets to have to get capital. Our approach will not only give it more
capital, but mean that capital can be more easily
obtained.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000223">&#160;</a>

distinction between access to private capital and privatisation? There

Canadian postal system while remaining a public sector body. There are
also domestic examples like local authority airports, Welsh Water,
Network Rail. There is a distinction between access to private capital

have remained in the public sector have had access to private capital.
When I studied the New Zealand post office for a report I wrote for the
US Congress, it had four long-term lines of credit to private banks.
But it has to secure that debt against something, either assets or
future revenue streams. So imagine you are a bank at the moment and
Royal Mail, in the state sector, says, “Can I borrow some
money?” Well, you would look at the asset sheet and notice that
it has quite a lot of debt secured on its existing assets so there are
not many more assets to secure debt against. So then you would say,
“Right, what revenue flows have we got to secure that
debt?” You would then say, “Well, you had a negative cash
flow of £500 million last year so that is not looking terribly
clever and a loss after tax and interest payments of £320
million.” There are not many banks that are going to lend a
company money when its assets are already secured on its existing debt
and it has no guarantee of revenue to pay off that
debt.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000225">&#160;</a>

risk equity capital is putting skin in the game. They are saying,

stability of the provider of the USO and gives Ofcom the power to look
at it. Can you clarify for me where the balance is between the terms of
the USO and the financial stability? In other words, if Ofcom thinks
that the USO provider is not financially stable with the current USO,
can it reduce the terms of the USO or is this where the financial
scheme comes

                           </em> To answer Mike’s question, if Ofcom
thinks that the burden of providing the universal service is unfair,
there is provision in the Bill for how it will assess it and the
process for making recommendations to deal with that. I am sure we will
debate those clauses at length. What we have done, which is unusual in
legislation and certainly is a development from the 2009 Bill, is to
provide a menu of options for what Ofcom could look at for the solution
to that unfair
burden.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000234">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
Graeme’s point, who do I favour buying it? We have deliberately
kept our options open on that to maintain maximum flexibility. I think
Richard Hooper went through the options: there could be private equity;
it could be a trade sale; or it could be an IPO. In order to maintain
that flexibility and get the maximum benefit for the taxpayer, I think
it is right to keep our options open. I do not have an estimate of what
we hope to get, because there is an awful lot to assess here, and we
will try to do the best for the taxpayer, which is why we have left
ourselves flexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="10111160000235">&#160;</a>

Co-operatives UK. We have been talking to that sector, and we have
asked it, rather than the Government, to take it to the next stage,
