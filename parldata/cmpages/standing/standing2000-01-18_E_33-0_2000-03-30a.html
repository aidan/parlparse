</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we start, I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) has made available the statement made by Lord Macdonald in response to Railtrack's network management statement; copies are available in the Room.
<H4><center>Schedule 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE: TRANSFERS TO SRA</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move amendment No. 898, in page 193, line 10, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Secretary of State shall indemnify the authority in respect of any liability of the authority arising out of anything done by or in relation to the Secretary of State in connection with anything transferred by a transfer scheme, unless full provision for such liability has been made by the Secretary of State in grants made under the provisions of Schedule 13 or a corresponding right which provides sufficient funding to cover such liability has been transferred by that transfer scheme.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment, like the previous group of amendments moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson), deals with the transfer of liabilities. We have covered some of the issue, but the Under-Secretary should explain further why he does not take the belt-and-braces approach. Unless it is properly funded, the Strategic Rail Authority should not be left to pick up the tab for the actions of the Secretary of State. He should be obliged to provide funding for any liabilities transferred.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> Let me express my thanks to the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) for an amendment that is helpful in intention, although I am happy to say that it is one of those amendments that is wholly unnecessary. It would indemnify the Strategic Rail Authority against any liabilities that are transferred to it without full provision being made by the Secretary of State. Naturally, the public expenditure provision for freight grants will be transferred to the SRA, which will then be able to bid in the usual way for future provision in the spending round. It is not intended that the Secretary of State should drop unfunded liabilities on the SRA; that would be pointless, as the liabilities would be in the public sector, and the Treasury would have to meet them in either case. With that reassurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that he can withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 14, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 187</center></H4>
<H4><center>Securing of services by franchising</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I beg to move amendment No. 904, in page 102, line 46, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2C) The Authority shall not exercise its powers under subsections (2A) and (2B) unless necessary for the purpose of exercising its powers under section 30.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want to have the same discussion as we had this morning on the iniquities of nationalisation. There are, however, two ways of skinning a cat: the Government can either buy the shares, or regulate the industry back into nationalisation, as is happening in utilities and other areas.
<P>
I am worried that the clause gives the state authority much stronger powers to run the trains than the Railways Act 1993 did. The Bill replaces the words ``as eligible'' in section 23 of that Act with the word ``ought''. The amendment would ensure that those powers are used only as a buffer stop, or as the last resort, The language in section 30 of the 1993 Act, was again weaker than what we have in the Bill. It gave the franchising director the duty to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>secure the provision of those services until such time as they again begin to be provided under a franchise agreement.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A little further on, it stated that the franchising director may have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the power to secure the operation of any additional railway assets.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The new section 30 is considerably more aggressive in specifying that the authority
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall provide, or secure the provision of,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
services. It is another hidden form of state interference in the running of the railways. The amendment would ensure that that option is used only as a last resort.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Under section 23 of the 1993 Act, the franchising director designates services as eligible to be franchised. Clause 187(1) amends that provision, so that the SRA designates services that ought to be franchised. Subsection (2) provides for such designations to be varied or revoked, but not in relation to existing franchise agreements. The variations or revocations would take place only on expiry of those agreements.
<P>
Under amendment No. 904, the designations could be varied or revoked only to allow the SRA to exercise its powers under section 30 of the 1993 Act, when necessary, as operator of the last resort. However, the SRA does not need to vary or revoke designations when it becomes the operator of the last resort. In such cases, the franchise services remain as originally designated. The SRA effectively becomes a substitute franchisee. The amendment would allow designations to be varied or revoked when they do not need to be, and would prevent them from being varied or revoked when it might be useful to do so. That would obstruct franchise replacement when part of the replacement agreement involves changes in the pattern of designated services.
<P>
I am sure that the purpose of the amendment is to probe once again the Government's intentions on back-door renationalisation. The hon. Member for North Shropshire Mr. Paterson raised that issue when he claimed that, without the amendment, it would be easier for the SRA to renationalise services by de-designating them and then providing them itself under clause 188(1). That would require the consent of the Secretary of State.
<P>
If I understand the hon. Gentleman's thesis correctly, he believes that there will be a grand conspiracy between a future Secretary of State and the SRA to renationalise part or all of the railways. However, clause 187 makes it clear—and it is apparent in the thrust of the 1993 Act—that exceptional procedures must be followed before a franchised service need not be secured through a franchise agreement. Quite apart from the convoluted nature of the supposed conspiracy, acting in the way that the hon. Gentleman fears would be unlawful, as it would be an expedient designed to circumvent Parliament's intention.
<P>
The amendment would achieve nothing. It would remove the flexibility that is necessary for future franchises to reflect changing circumstances. The protection that it supposedly provides against renationalisation by the back door is unnecessary. I urge the hon. Gentleman, in the light of my explanations and reassurances, to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I should like to probe a little further. The Under-Secretary's reply was helpful, but suggests that I was right in thinking that the Bill confers stronger powers on the SRA as opposed to the franchise director to run trains. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It gives greater powers to the SRA to run trains. The SRA negotiates with operators to run trains. It is true that operators will normally deliver train services through franchises, which the SRA will secure. Some non-franchised rail services are in operation, such as the Heathrow-Paddington express and English Welsh ÿ Scottish Railways' freight services. We are making provision in the Bill to enable the SRA to operate services as an operator of last resort, but it is perfectly clear that a number of hoops must be leapt through to reach that point. It is certainly not the intention of the Bill to facilitate that kind of direct operation. The last resort provision is obviously there in case, for example, a franchisee went bust and it was essential that the services were operated. There is no intention that the SRA should be a primary operator.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That is a helpful explanation. We shall debate section 30 at greater length in a few minutes. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): I beg to move amendment No. 907, in page 103, line 2, leave out from beginning to end of line 10 on page 106 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`26A. If the Authority has issued an invitation to tender for the provision of any services under section 26 above but received no tenders in response to the invitation the Authority shall consult with the railway industry to identify the reasons for the lack of any response and, having regard to the results of such consultation, shall issue new invitations to tender, with such changes as are calculated to encourage tenders'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: </b>With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 905 in page 103, line 13, leave out from `above' to end of line 16 and insert</B><P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`with such changes as are calculated to encourage tenders'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 906, in page 103, leave out lines 17 to 23.
<P>
No. 908, in page 105, leave out lines 10 to 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> This is a significant clause and an important series of amendments. The Under-Secretary talked about buying dogs and barking himself, which is curious because the Secretary of State seems to have the upper hand in this part of the Bill. Everything else we have talked about transfers responsibility from the Secretary of State to the SRA, but it seems to be the reverse here. If someone fails to produce an adequate tender for a franchise service, the SRA must give notice to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State then acts by giving directions to the SRA. I am curious to know why the Secretary of State should maintain that residual responsibility in this case.
<P>
Our amendments refer to what happens if no tender is received. There are two such circumstances in the Bill: one is simply when a tender is put out and no one responds to it; the other, which is more significant, is when the tender that is received is deemed to be inadequate and the SRA believes that the service could be provided more economically. That seems a curious get-out for the SRA. The purpose of the amendment is to make it consult further if an adequate tender is not produced. We want it to consider why no one was interested in tendering for the service. We want it to have to go out again and consult the industry and the train operating companies and other organisations to find out what was wrong with the tender.
<P>
We take the view that if no one takes up the tender, presumably something is wrong with its conditions. Insufficient subsidy and many other factors could make it unattractive to train operators. We are asking the authority to go back to have another crack to see what the reasons are. Perhaps the Under-Secretary could explain the proposed new section 26B(b), regarding when the authority believes that the services could be provided more economically and efficiently under a franchise agreement. I should be fascinated to know what services could be operated in that way other than by a normal train operating company.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am happy to respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Hexham. It is important that we are as clear as possible about the Government's purposes in the clause.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is with a certain irony that I recall our proceedings on the previous Railways Bill when the Labour Opposition at that time were only too keen to facilitate the possibility of the franchise director of British Rail becoming an operator of last resort. However, times change, and we are happy to offer the reassurances that the hon. Gentleman is seeking.
<P>
The clause is concerned with what happens if the SRA's invitation to tender for a franchise produces an unsatisfactory response. I understand the difficulty that concerns the hon. Gentleman. He is worried that the SRA will issue invitations to tender that are calculated to be so demanding and unreasonable that no one responds to them. Alternatively, he fears that the approach that the SRA takes to assessing the economy and efficiency of the responses will be calculated to justify it in seeking a direction from the Secretary of State to dispense with franchising. I take it that those are the fears that he was groping towards. Let me further explore his fear, which is that that will then create an opportunity for the Secretary of State to set aside franchising, direct the SRA to provide the services instead and—hey presto!—renationalisation by the back door.
<P>
We have a difficulty here. I am sure that the Committee will accept that a failure, of whatever kind, in the franchising process must not stop the trains running. I hope that the Committee will also accept that the SRA must not be placed in a position where it has to accept a tender that is manifestly bad value for public money, just because the tendering process has failed to deliver anything better. We need to provide for cases of that kind.
<P>
That is exactly what subsections (3) and (4) are designed to do. Subsection (3) inserts new sections 26A, 26B and 26C in the 1993 Act. New section 26A deals with the case where there are no responses to an invitation to tender. New section 26B deals with the case where the only responses do not, in the SRA's view, represent good value for money. New section 26C is procedural. Subsection (4) then amends section 30 of the 1993 Act, which places duties on the franchising director—in future, the SRA—to act as operator of last resort.
<P>
New section 26A is relatively straightforward. If there is no response at all to an invitation to tender, the Secretary of State may then direct the SRA to try again; or else he may direct the SRA not to do so, in which case it must provide the services itself under new section 30.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 905 and 906 would remove that discretion from the Secretary of State. The SRA would be obliged to try again, with changes calculated to encourage tenders: I presume that that means on ever more generous terms, making ever less demanding requirements, and repeatedly, until it has succeeded in receiving at least one tender.
<P>
We have already heard from the hon. Member for Hexham about having a dog and barking. The proposal contained in the amendments really is a case of the tail wagging the dog. It makes the process of franchising more important than the outcome for which we are aiming, which is that the designated services should be economically and efficiently provided. If it was necessary to provide a bulwark against back-door renationalisation—although I have said repeatedly that that is not the Government's intention—the amendments would not achieve that. If there was a conspiracy, the SRA need only wait to receive a tender, deem it uneconomic or inefficient under new section 26B and invite the Secretary of State to give it a direction to provide the services itself. The Secretary of State can also do that under new section 26A.
<P>
I do not accept that there is a genuine risk of that happening, but the amendment would create as much of a risk as the situation that it is designed to circumvent. If the hon. Gentleman peers into his soul he will see that problem.
<P>
Amendment No. 907 would sweep away new sections 26A, 26B and 26C and replace them with a simple requirement to keep retendering until a valid tender is received and accepted. Under the amendment, the value-for-money safeguard would be abolished: that is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The Opposition's paranoia—there is no other word for it—about renationalisation by the back door means that they are prepared to set aside everything that they have ever said about the need for efficiency and economy in spending public money.
<P>
Amendment No. 908 would strike out proposed new section 26C(3) of the Railways Act 1993. New section 26C(3) provides that the Secretary of State's directions to the SRA on selecting a tenderer, inviting fresh tenders, or providing the service itself may be challenged in court only under section 26C(2), which specifically allows for legal challenge, within 42 days, from disappointed tenderers whose tender has been rejected by the SRA on economy or efficiency grounds.
<P>
We aim to strike a balance between the need to protect the interests of tenderers and the need to complete the tendering process in a well-ordered fashion. Tenderers obviously have a legitimate interest: if their tenders are not accepted, they need the opportunity to test in court the basis on which that decision has been reached. The Bill protects their interest. However, to expedite the process, tenderers alone should be able to challenge the Secretary of State's decision. We do not want protracted litigation, creating uncertainty, from those who do not have a direct commercial interest at stake.
<P>
Behind the amendments is the fear that a future Secretary of State may exploit the Bill's provisions to frustrate the purpose of the 1993 Act as amended by the Bill. However, the various discretions given to the Secretary of State do not extend to an ability to subvert Parliament's entire purpose in the 1993 Act. Indeed, as I have explained, the amendments would not achieve their purpose.
<P>
In the light of my explanations and, I hope, reassurances, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for his response. He suggested that I peer into my soul for problems. From time to time, I do indeed peer into my soul, where several problems repose. However, the SRA's tendering process is certainly not one of them.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has been so genial in the past few days that I do not believe that he is proposing that back-door renationalisation should take place. However, I am still puzzled. Why does the Secretary of State have an interest in such matters? I cannot envisage a scenario in which the SRA will need such a power to run its own services.
<P>
There is merit in the Under-Secretary's argument that the SRA will be given a strategic hand in negotiations. However, suppose the SRA decides to respond to public opinion on running a passenger service in the Vale of Glamorgan on what is now a goods line. It sends out tenders to companies that want to operate the service, and the tenders come back with ridiculously high estimates. It might try again in the hope of obtaining a better deal, but I presume that if it proved uneconomic because the rail companies could not reduce their charges or the amount of subsidy was too high, the scheme would be aborted. Why, then, should the SRA come in, hire its own rolling stock and provide a service? I do not see that as a logical way of providing a service that the normal train-operating companies have found uneconomic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked why the Secretary of State is involved. The answer is simple. The Secretary of State is paying the money, so it is perfectly reasonable for him to be involved in decisions about the operation of rail services in these extraordinary situations. The hon. Gentleman seems still to find it difficult to understand why the SRA should have a say. The reason is that no one else is capable of doing what it does on value-for-money terms—which it is the responsibility of the SRA to consider, as one would expect any public body that dispenses public funds to do. Someone has to provide the service. If the SRA is not satisfied that a tenderer can do that, the tenderer has the right to appeal. There are plenty of opportunities for further tenders, and so on. The SRA has an obligation to provide an economic, efficient rail service to the travelling public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> If the tender comes back with a demand for too high a subsidy, how will the SRA be able to run the railway more cheaply? The authority will have to go to a contractor to get carriages and locomotives. How will it be able to do that more cheaply than a professional train-operating company?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> There is a rather obvious explanation, which is that the SRA will not make a profit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> We have given that topic a fair outing. Perhaps we can explore the latest revelations. These debates are most helpful because we flush out more information each time the Under-Secretary rises. He is now saying that section 30, which allows the state to run rail services, ``shall provide services''—as he interpreted it—but it now must read ``shall provide services at a loss'', which is riveting. How will the losses be sustained, how they will be financed and what amount of loss is acceptable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman thinks it extraordinary to talk of the possibility of operating a rail service at a loss. It may come as something of a revelation to him that virtually all rail services operate at a loss. That is why the taxpayer will pay £1.3 billion this year towards the franchises. With not more than one exception that I can think of—the Gatwick express, which makes a profit, which we term a negative subsidy—all the franchises operate with a subsidy. Frankly, the idea of the SRA, acting in the capacity of an operator of last resort, running a service that does not pay, is nothing new for the rail services. However, it might come as a revelation to the hon. Gentleman that they provide a public service.

<P>

<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The issue is intriguing but, with respect to the Minister, we are still left in the air about it—
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Off the rails.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> As my hon. Friend says, we are off the rails. I simply do not understand how the SRA can provide a service of last resort to run a railway service when other private, professional companies, which own rolling stock, cannot do so economically. What will happen is that the Secretary of State will tell the SRA to run the rail service at a ridiculous loss and it will have dig into its £3 billion borrowing requirement to do so. Political manipulation of the railways lies ahead of us. It is an interesting matter to which we shall return on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 187 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 188</center></H4>
<H4><center>Limited additional powers to provide railway services</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The explanatory notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Clause 188 gives the Authority limited additional powers to run goods or undesignated passenger services where it acquires an obligation to provide that service in consequence of a former obligation of the British Railways Board or they are no longer being provided by another person. It gives the Authority the necessary associated powers (such as storing goods) to run that service.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Authority may provide services for the carriage of passengers or goods by railway if the Secretary of State consents to the provision of the services by the Authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it goes on to list several cases in which that would happen. Does that mean that the Secretary of State must consent to every case in the list? ``Limited additional powers'' means limited powers because the Secretary of State will be the person who determines what shall be done. Are all the provisions necessary? Clause 188(2)(a) states that the authority may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>provide or operate network services—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is quite a big item—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>station services or light maintenance services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Secretary of State have to give permission for the SRA to undertake light maintenance agreements if it is a matter under schedule 18, or if it is decided to take them on for operational reasons? Will the Secretary of State be concerned with the nooks and crannies of everything that the authority does, or will there be a cut-off point to ensure that minor matters are not referred to him? The Bill sets out categories in which the SRA will be able to undertake services, all of them subject to the Secretary of State.
<P>
In the good old days of the 1970s, every time British Rail wanted to invest more than £250,000, which even then would pay only for a major refurbishment of a station, the proposal had to go to the Secretary of State for Transport. That was not the most productive use of the Secretary of State's time, but it was done because the funds counted against the public sector borrowing requirement. The Bill seems to be heavy-handed about getting the Secretary of State's consent. That may be appropriate for major passenger and goods services, but when minor matters are involved, I wonder whether the Bill is correctly drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> On this occasion, the Opposition are expressing their anxieties about the SRA as a creature of the Secretary of State, rather than a wildly unaccountable quango.
<P>
I shall deal, first, with the question put by the hon. Member for Poole whether the Secretary of State has to issue a consent in every case. The answer is yes, but hon. Members must remember we are talking about operators of last resort. Consents will be very rare, because the events will be very rare.
<P>
The broad purport of clause 188 is to establish a limited power to provide non-franchised passenger and goods services. The clause gives the authority the power to run freight or non-franchised passenger services, either where it has inherited a legal obligation to run services from the British Railways Board, or where such a service has ceased. The clause also gives the authority the necessary associated powers to run those services, such as the power to store goods. It provides a necessary and limited power to carry out legal obligations or to step in to run services that have ceased. The authority will need the consent of the Secretary of State, who can decide that he does not want a specific service to be reinstated—for example, where a commercial service has failed and it is not in the public interest to reinstate it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole may feel that the powers in clauses 187 and 188 are too broadly drawn. The clauses make it clear that the Authority's powers to run a railway service are not general, but limited to a franchised service that has failed and cannot be re-let, or to a non-franchised or freight service that has ceased or is an inherited legal liability, and then only with the consent of the Secretary of State. There is no power to be a general provider of railway services in any other circumstances. We revised the provisions formerly in the Railways Bill to put it beyond doubt that the SRA is an operator of last resort only, as recommended by the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>
We consider that the powers are necessary so that there is public sector provision of railway services, should the private sector fail. We do not intend to replace private sector provision of railway services, but it would be unacceptable for the public sector not to be able to step in in extremis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> Can the Under-Secretary give the Committee an example of an inherited freight or passenger service that the British Railways Board has been required to run?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall be delighted to give an example. The British Railways Board would be liable through its obligations in the channel tunnel usage contract to secure the provision of alternative freight and passenger services through the channel tunnel if the existing service failed. The capacity to perform such obligations has to be transferred to the Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Further to that, let us assume that the service has failed and there are people on a platform in Brussels who want to come back to the United Kingdom. Presumably the SRA might decide to underwrite that service: it would have to phone the Secretary of State—in Brazil—and ask, ``Secretary of State, may we have permission to keep the service going? It is important to keep it as a regular service. It wouldn't be good if passengers who had bought tickets for this train were stranded abroad with their Belgian chocolates.'' Is that how the Under-Secretary sees the power operating?
<P>
As drafted, the clause seems heavy handed. The Secretary of State has to be in the loop of every decision, even when it has to be made quickly. Perhaps there should be a provision to enable the SRA to make a decision and obtain the Secretary of State's approval, but a few days later. Without such a provision, the authority may say, ``We can't do this. We have to get the Secretary of State's approval, but he is on a canoe up the Amazon. What can we do?''
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): Phone him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me refute the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) that the SRA should phone me—that would be tantamount to lese-majesty. I can speak from experience: my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is always available. Some assert that he is too available, although that is not my belief. However, there is no question of that sort of instantaneous response being required. We are talking about a proper process by which the response of the SRA and the consent of the Secretary of State have to be secured. That would not include people phoning up from the Gare du Nord in Brussels. I hope that that allays any anxieties on that score.
<P>
I repeat, we are talking about the last resort, not an event that will occur frequently. My right hon. Friend, the Deputy Prime Minister can rest easy in the knowledge that he will not be regularly disturbed in his public duties by irate passengers phoning from Brussels or elsewhere on the continent of Europe. With that assurance I am sure that the Committee will agree to the clause.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 803, in page 106, line 30, after second `vehicles', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`who must provide the same level of service as that which the service provider had previously offered, in part particular by the carriage of guide dogs at no extra cost,'.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and where any relevant franchisee has failed to do so'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Amendment No. 848 covers unforeseen substitutions of other modes of transport when a railway service is not running. That often happens at weekends when maintenance is programmed. The amendment would require that such substitute services make provision for people carrying luggage, including bicycles and prams. At present there are various provisions for those in wheelchairs, and we shall discuss that matter soon in relation to taxis.
<P>
Train operating companies are not obliged to provide for bicycles and prams, although for bicycles are not currently so frequently required, except on some intercity services, and there is no charge so there have been improvements.
<P>
I was reassured when my non. Friend the Under-Secretary said on Tuesday:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Integrating railway transport and other transport modes, including cycles, walking, bus travel and private motoring is at the heart of the authority's mission.—[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 28 March 2000; c. 1187]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, it is. Following on from that, substitution services should provide facilities for people with bicycles or prams using rail network, although they probably do not cycle and push prams at the same time. Otherwise when they get off the train and onto another mode of transport, they have to leave behind their luggage, or in the case of cyclists, cycle all the way. For people with a pram, it is even more difficult; they either have to leave the pram and carry the baby, or push the baby all the way home in the pram. That is completely unacceptable. I am told that Anglia Railways make very good provision for such circumstances.
<P>
As I said in an earlier debate, there are now more bicycles sold in Britain than new cars. Since about 50 per cent. of urban and 70 per cent. of rural households do not have a car, this is about social exclusion. We should enable people without cars to travel by bicycle to the train, get on the train with their bicycle if they want to and, if there is a substitution, carry their bicycle on the alternative transport provided.
<P>
Clarity on this will mean that we do not indirectly encourage car use. We do not want to encourage those who travel by bicycle to use their cars if they think that a substitute service is operating because of a maintenance programme. That is especially relevant at weekends, when many cyclists on day trips travel by train to and from the place where they want to cycle. They do not want to risk problems with substitution. Provision must be made on trains and substitute services for the other types of luggage—whether double basses, skis, cellos or the other things that we normally carry around.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): I endorse the fine words spoken by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies), who has shown great insight.
<P>
Amendment No. 803, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) and myself, deals with assistance dogs. Those who represent the visually impaired and other groups are concerned that substitute services should be of the same high standard, and be accessible, as the services that have been disrupted; in particular provision should be made for guide dogs for the blind. People are concerned because the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 does not apply to minicabs. Therefore, people with guide dogs could be refused help if their journey was disrupted and they had to continue by minicab or private hire car.
<P>
Those who operate taxis and buses are obliged to provide assistance for especially vulnerable members of our society, but no similar obligation exists for minicabs or private hire cars under the 1995 Act. That omission—or inclusion, depending which way the Under-Secretary sees it—might produce a worrying loophole. People deserve to have full confidence that, if their journey is disrupted, they can continue to their final destination. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reassure us about that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> My hon. Friends and I tabled amendment No. 912. I am slightly out of sympathy with the two hon. Members who have spoken on this group of amendments. Rail services are often stopped if a heavy goods vehicle hits a bridge. If that happened and the amendment had been passed, if a guide dog or pram was on the train, everyone would have to wait until a vehicle of sufficient size to carry it could be found. In an emergency, people might want to use taxis that might not be able to take guide dogs or prams. In any case, I did not think that people had prams these days; I thought people now had buggies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman is not deliberately missing the point. Buses may be used, but they are obliged to provide those facilities as are taxis. However, it might be decided to provide private hire vehicles which are not so obliged. I do not think that everyone on a train would fit into one private hire vehicle. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman misses the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I give way to the hon. Member for Croydon, Central.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am amazed to hear the comment that, if a train breaks down and a substitute service is provided, people should not wait for someone with a baby in a pram, as if such persons were second-rate citizens—that is outrageous. Substitute services should be provided for people with babies in prams, disabilities or whatever; those services should be provided on the spot, when those passengers need them. No one should say, ``Leave the people with prams. Take the people with business cards. Leave the babies in the hedge.'' That would be ridiculous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I am delighted by that response. I had thought that we might even provoke the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) into making an intervention. The question that I was trying to ask before we heard such howls of outrage from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee is why specify such matters in the Bill? Why not leave them to the common sense of the people trying to sort out the problem on the ground?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): I rise to offer some practical information about the example that the hon. Gentleman provided, which is commonly known in the industry as a bridge bash. In such circumstances, the train would be stopped and the bridge would be safely passed out. If it were not, the train would reverse back to the nearest station, and provision would be made to allow passengers safely to proceed with their journey. The description of taxis pulling up beside the bridge and people dismounting is preposterous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman's knowledge of the subject is unchallengeable and I bow to his expertise on how to run a railway. I was not suggesting that people with prams and guide dogs would leap off bridge parapets. I had assumed that the train would reverse from the bridge to the station.
<P>
Making the Bill too prescriptive would remove the possibility of people using their initiative to solve the problem on the spot. If a private hire vehicle turned up and could not take a guide dog, the people involved would be in the silly situation of having to wait until a vehicle such as a bus was provided that could take it. That might not be convenient for the other passengers. 
<P>
However, I shall not irritate the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) but shall instead speak to our own amendment No. 912, which would simply specify that the obligation to make such provision should lie with the franchisee. A problem with the system may not be the responsibility of the franchisee, but responsibility in the event of damage to the track or cessation of services because of maintenance work should be part and parcel of the franchise. That seems more logical than making the authority responsible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It has been an interesting, lively and well informed debate, at least in some quarters of the Committee. Clause 189 relates to substitute services. The SRA will discharge its responsibilities for substitution services by including appropriate terms in the franchise agreement, making the franchisee responsible for the provision of bus or taxi substitution services. For a service that used to be franchised but has passed back to the SRA as operator of last resort, the SRA will be able to contract with a third party to provide the substitution services.
<P>
I have a great deal of sympathy with the principle behind the amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central. I join him in commending Anglia Railways' innovative cycle storage on trains, and echo his wish for other operators to follow that splendid example. I notice that my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson), who has direct experience of such matters, agrees with that proposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): In May, my constituency will benefit from that facility being offered to cyclists when they come to enjoy the Tour de Tendring in Harwich, which is held every summer. We are pleased that Anglia Railways provides such facilities for cyclists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As my hon. Friend knows, I am looking forward to visiting his constituency on 17 April. I shall arrive by train, and I dare say that my bike will be appropriately stored on that train so that I can participate in the tour d'horizon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): Now might be a good time to ask my hon. Friend if he will join with me in congratulating the train operating companies and the shadow Strategic Rail Authority for giving approval to the new rolling stock shortly to come into operation on the Airedale and Wharfedale line through my constituency. It will allow for extra storage space for cycles, prams and so on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I happily join with my hon. Friend in commending the provision by Northern Spirit of bicycle storage space on trains to Airedale and Wharfedale. I look forward to taking my bike on those services so that in due course I can cycle on the bank of Bingley relief road whose existence, like that of the bicycles provision, owes much to the outstanding campaigning efforts of my hon. Friend.
<P>
I agree that where alternative travel arrangements have to be put in place, passengers should be able to undertake their extended journeys with minimum difficulty. Mr. Gale, I am having difficulty speaking—there are shadows of short sea shipping floating through my mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): In my usual helpful way, I thought I would ask the Minister if he would give way so that I could try to persuade him to consider the 15-„mile link between Bristol and Bath and the cycle journeys that are available to so many people on that route. By now, he should have got over his fit of giggles and be able to continue.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate the Minister is getting fitter by the minute because of all his cycling around the United Kingdom, but could we get all the press releases out of the way in one go please?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Bath and I am looking forward to cycling around Bath, Avonmouth, Bristol and all those wonderful places in the vicinity of Bath which, as we know, has the most distinguished urban landscape in the United Kingdom.
<P>
In most cases, I would expect that the road vehicles involved in substitute services should be able to carry luggage and collapsible prams and pushchairs. I accept that finding road vehicles able to accommodate bicycles is more of a problem. I look to train operators to provide good information and publicity about engineering work, so that passengers intending to travel with bicycles can take into account any restricted service.
<P>
Amendment No. 848, standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central, is not necessary to enable the SRA to secure the provision of substitution services by road vehicles able to carry passengers' luggage, including bicycles and prams. The obstacles to more easily accessible vehicles are practical rather than legal. I look to the SRA to ensure that replacement franchises provide for convenient substitution services so far as is reasonably practicable. I hope that in the light of my response, my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment. The Committee will return, as he knows, to other aspects of substitution services when we come to debate amendment No. 845 on accessible substitute services, which also stands in the name of my hon. Friend and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby.
<P>
Turning now to amendment No. 803, to which the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale spoke. That seeks to ensure that substitution services provide the same level of service as the ones they replace. Road services will never be able to match exactly the level of service available on the railway. The characteristics of road and rail transport are too different. Amendment No. 803 is, therefore, unattainable. However, I understand that the carriage of guide dogs on substitution services is free. Indeed, where a substitute service is temporary—for example, because of engineering works—there is no extra cost for any passenger. The price of the rail ticket includes the cost of the substitute service.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moore rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I see that the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene. May I complete my thought, which might deal with the issue he wishes to raise?
<P>
The reference to the carriage of guide dogs at no extra cost is superfluous for another important reason. Since 1 October 1999, treating a blind person who needs a guide dog less favourably than someone without a guide dog is likely to amount to discrimination under section 19 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The hon. Gentleman said that public hire vehicles are not caught by the legislation. It would be improper to use the present Bill to create laws for purposes that lie outside the scope of the Bill. Indeed, the amendment does not itself seek to change the law on PHVs and the obligations that lie on them.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I appreciate the Minister's lengthy reply. I do not want him to be hung up on the fact that the amendment talks about ``no extra cost''. It is concerned with the principle of ensuring that the end provider of the transport service will carry a guide dog. I accept that this may be the wrong place to discuss the previous Act, which addresses discrimination against disabled people. However, people should have confidence when they leave their original point of departure by train that if the service is disrupted or breaks down for some reason, they will not be left stranded because private hire firms refuse to take their guide dogs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. He will probably accept that when we talk about temporary substitution services, we tend to think of bus or taxi services; PHVs come up only occasionally. The point is absolutely right, but there would have to be a different locus for making that kind of change. There remains a heavy obligation on the franchisees to provide accessible substitution services and we shall be able to explore that further on amendment No. 845.
<P>
Turning to amendment No. 912, I explained at the beginning of my response to this group of amendments that the SRA's franchise agreements will provide for the franchisee to be responsible for substitution services where there is temporary interruption such as engineering works. However, it would not be appropriate to restrict the SRA's powers to cases where the franchisee has failed to secure the substitute service. For example, the SRA needs the power in clause 189 to cover cases where it may be required to make provision for a substitute bus or taxi service as a statutory condition for the closure of a passenger service. The SRA also needs the power in case it has to act as operator of last resort for passenger services. I trust that the hon. Member for Hexham will agree not to press the amendment in the light of my explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> In light of the reassurances and the commitment to cycling that I have heard from the Minister, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment. I am glad to hear that he uses a bicycle. I hope to see him in Croydon on his bicycle. I have here a picture of me on a tandem at East Croydon station with the director of public health. I hope that he will join us one day to go round the scenic brownfield and other sites of south London.
<P>
I welcome the reassurances that I have received and hope that the train operating companies will rise to the challenge, so that everyone can travel with their luggage in the knowledge that, if a substitution is required, the bicycles, prams or other luggage can be accommodated. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On a point of form, may I remind the hon. Gentleman that visual aids are not available in committee? Hansard reporters are adept at getting their pens around most names in the English—and, indeed, the Welsh— language, but they have no means of transferring photographs into the Official Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 913, in page 106, line 34, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but by as little as is practicable.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is a simple one. Clause 189(2) states that a road service
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may deviate from the route of that railway service,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is sensible as buses cannot run up rail lines, and we simply wish to add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>but by as little as is practicable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That makes it slightly more of a duty. The provision should not be taken too literally, to mean going all around the houses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's helpful intent in moving the amendment. As drafted, however, I am not sure that it would help passengers. The amendment would ensure that, if a substitute bus or taxi service is provided, it follows the route of the railway and deviates
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>by as little as is practicable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sounds like a good idea, but I doubt whether it would help passengers on the ground. Roads do not follow railways, and passengers' main concern is not to mirror the railway route, but to get by the fastest and best route to the next stopping point. By road, that might well be on a different route from the railway's.
<P>
We expect substitute services to cover stopping points on the railway line, but even when a stopping point is reached, the railway station as a fixed point might not be the most convenient point for passengers, if it is not the most central point in the location. The focus of a settlement often changes over time, but the location of a railway station does not. The current provision allows more flexibility. I hope that in the light of that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his reply and I understand his arguments. In some circumstances, passengers might wish to take legal action against the company, especially if the company did not go by the shortest possible route. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 845 in page 107, line 7, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) Before entering into any agreement with any person in pursuance of this section for the provision of a substitute service the Authority shall ensure that, so far as is practicable to do so, that any vehicle used for that service is constructed or adapted so that it is possible for a disabled person—
<P>
(a) to get into and out of, or on and off, the vehicle in safety and without unreasonable difficulty (and, in the case of a disabled person in a wheelchair, to do so while remaining in the wheelchair); and
<P>
(b) to be carried in or on the vehicle in safety and reasonable comfort (and, in the case of a disabled person in a wheelchair, while remaining in the wheelchair).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with transfer and substitution provisions for people with disabilities. These days, many more people are in wheelchairs—not only for medical reasons, but because people become less mobile as they reach old age. Such people still wish to get out and about, travel around the country and enjoy themselves in the countryside, and their main means of travel will be train services. It is important that accessible transport is available when they reach their destination. My simple amendment would ensure that taxis able to accommodate wheelchairs are available at the destination station.
<P>
As I understand it—the Under-Secretary will correct me if I am wrong—the Bill allows transfers and substitutions to be carried out by minicabs, which may not be wheelchair-accessible. That amounts to social exclusion and poses the question whether an integrated transport service can cater for all people, including those in wheelchairs. As the Disability and Discrimination Act rolls out, more services are becoming wheelchair-accessible. The amendment would ensure that disabled people arriving at a railway station have access to substitution services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I support the hon. Gentleman's amendment, but how would it help in Cambridge and Eastbourne, from whose railway stations taxis are already banned as a result of contracts with private hire companies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> To be quite honest, I cannot give a specific answer on the legal and contractual impact in Cambridge of such change. My fundamental point is that people in wheelchairs arriving at a railway station should know that they will be able to get into an accessible taxi. If that means that a range of options should be available to cater for wheelchair accessibility and non-wheelchair accessibility, that would be sufficient. However, I cannot say whether that would sort out the position in Cambridge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the amendment would disadvantage taxi drivers who have made their cabs accessible to disabled people who are charged for the use of such facilities? Is that not a discouragement to taxi companies who have gone out of their way to ensure that such facilities are available?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Yes, that is an important point. Given the Government's overall message and the legislation we have passed, people are making such investments in good faith to facilitate mobility and accessibility for people in wheelchairs. If the law allows a lower-cost operator to undercut those who have invested in facilities for disabled people and thereby put them out of business, that will be bad for the providers of accessible transport and for people in wheelchairs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> I rise to support my hon. Friend's amendment. I shall illustrate the value of the amendment with a practical problem affecting many disabled people trying to travel from York to Scarborough early last summer. As hon. Members may recall, the constituency of the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) was badly flooded, severing the railway link between York and Scarborough. Disabled people tried to make use of substitute services, but the initial provision in the contingency plan between Railtrack and the train operating company left something to be desired. I hope that the amendment would spur Railtrack—the infrastructure provider—and the train operating companies to examining their contingency plans for such circumstances.
<P>
I worked in the railway industry for many years. In my experience, the problem is not usually weekend maintenance taking place over a 48 or 72-hour period, as that is properly planned and substitution services are offered. I say that, having managed such provisions myself in the past. However, blockages or breakdowns in the railway infrastructure give rise to problems and I can recall half a dozen cases in which we tried to maintain a service for the public. In such circumstances, railway professionals become frustrated, as their role is to serve the needs of the travelling public and ensure that they complete their journey.
<P>
That relates to disabled people and blind people especially. A local railway manager trying to re-establish the transportation system might not have the tools to set up a modified, substitution service. He may not be able to arrange for a local taxi or bus company to provide an alternative service that is accessible to disabled people. The amendment takes that into account.
<P>
I commend the work of the Scarborough District Disablement Action Group on behalf of its members and of the many disabled people who visit Scarborough, which the Minister may regard as one of his top 10 beautiful places in the country. Scarborough tries to cater for disabled people, but the flooding on the line last year revealed the need for more proactive thought about contingency plans for unforeseen circumstances in which a substitute service is needed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): I support the amendment. The Salford Disabled Motorists Club is very active in Salford in my constituency. It may surprise those of us who have no need to be members of such associations that their members have an interest in public transport.
<P>
The spirit of the amendment and of the Bill is to enable disabled people to be independent. We take it for granted that someone in a wheelchair is accompanied by a helper, but most disabled people want to be completely independent and to do things for themselves. The amendment is important because it highlights the fact that an unaccompanied disabled person in a wheelchair may want to use public service vehicles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I want the Committee to know how many people are involved. About 620,000 people in Great Britain use wheelchairs, and it is estimated that there will be 660,000 by 2011, which is nearly 2 per cent. of the population. It is not a fringe issue; it requires mainstream provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention; he is correct. I want my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to confirm that the Bill will take into account the importance to disabled people of being independent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): I shall be brief My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby mentioned expertise gained in his previous career, and I shall do the same. I worked with disabled people as a training officer and I say to the Undersecretary, respectfully, that it is not simply a matter of providing services, but of ensuring that disabled people can get on and off trains in a dignified manner. Will my hon. Friend consider not only what services should be available at stations, but how people can go to and from platforms and get on and off trains?
<P>
For example, because of engineering work, people travelling from Euston to Rugby have to change at Northampton and travel by bus to their destination, which means using a stairway to cross the bridge at Northampton station. Disabled people who cannot use the stairs have to rely on station staff to push their wheelchairs across the line, and on flag men to ensure that it is safe to do so. As a consequence, we have had some interesting discussions with Railtrack, which has asked the local authority for a contribution towards the cost of a lift to enable the company to fulfil its responsibilities to tackle discrimination. I hope that such events are not being repeated throughout the country, and that the SRA will bring its influence to bear. It is not simply a case of providing a substitute service, but of stations enabling disabled passengers to travel from service to substitute service with dignity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I suggest to my hon. Friend that such problems are not unique to his area, but occur in railway stations across the land. Even some of the major railway stations such as East Croydon, which is major junction between Victoria and the south coast, do not have proper provisions for people in wheelchairs to go from one platform to another, or from the platform to another form of transport. It is a major challenge to the Government to work with the industry to enable proper accessibility for the many people in wheelchairs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend that it is a major issue, and it is one that the SRA should address. Following on from the comments made by the hon. Member for Bath, it is time that action was taken against Railtrack in respect of those stations where contracts are solely with minicab owners, because such arrangements mean that those stations are not intermodal. A disabled person cannot travel to or from Cambridge or Eastbourne station because no Hackney carriage is available to carry disabled passengers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman amplify that point? He uses my examples of Cambridge and Eastbourne where Railtrack has given the contract to minicab companies, excluding taxis with wheelchair access from the station itself. Does he agree that the problem might be that the train operating company responsible for providing the substitute service wants with all the good will in the world, to make use of taxis, but Railtrack, which owns the station, prevents a substitution service accessible to wheelchair users from being used?
<P>
That is the problem with which the SRA and the Minister must grapple.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I certainly agree with the hon. Gentleman. I would go further: sometimes it is not even a question of contractual default, but of economic default, inasmuch as hackney carriage drivers cannot afford the high rents charged to the Hackney Carriage Association to have a rank within reach. While acknowledging that not all of those considerations are covered by the amendments, I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to tell us that, when the SRA fulfils its duty of ensuring that provision is made for substitute journeys, the needs of disabled people will be taken seriously, and that they will not only be able to use those services, but be able to do so in a dignified manner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> This has been an excellent debate. Again, I congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, Central and for Scarborough and Whitby on tabling the amendment. I join my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby in commending the work of the Scarborough District Disablement Action Group in what I am happy to describe as one of most beautiful resorts in the United Kingdom; I know it well.
<P>
I also thank and commend my hon. Friends the Members for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) and for Northampton, South (Mr. Clarke). I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South that Railtrack, which owns the railway stations, is committed to ensuring that disabled people have access to the railway network. It is currently exploring a framework for achieving accessibility; a detailed programme will be developed in consultation with train operators and other interested parties.
<P>
I was very interested in the point made by the hon. Member for Bath about Railtrack's responsibility for leasing rights to take passengers from stations; in some cases, those rights are restricted to private hire vehicles. To be technically accurate, saloon vehicles—the majority of private hire vehicles—are more easily accessible to wheelchair users than traditional Hackney cabs, unless modified by low floor provision. That modification does not apply to taxis nationwide, but it was introduced in London on 1 January. Having said that, saloon cars may be more convenient for wheelchair users, but are not wholly accessible to them. We would expect Railtrack to take on board the point about stations made by the hon. Member for Bath and my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South.
<P>
Facilities for disabled people are important, so I shall say more about those. People with disabilities and their representative organisations outside the House will follow my words carefully. Train companies and Railtrack have adopted a voluntary code of practice designed to ensure that people with disabilities are offered a universal common standard when travelling on the rail network.
<P>
The code states that if a train service is altered due to engineering or other works, the operator will ensure that alternative travel arrangements are put in place so that disabled people are able to undertake their journey ``with minimum difficulty''.
<P>
However, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, known as DPTAC—the Government's statutory advisory committee for people with disabilities—and other disability organisations have been concerned for some time that when substitute services are needed, there is no requirement for the vehicles used to be accessible to disabled people.
<P>
The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998 set minimum access requirements to meet the needs of disabled people. These requirements must be met by all new and rebuilt passenger trains entering service from 1 January 1999. With the increasing availability of accessible trains, disabled people will make greater use of rail travel. Ahead of the new requirements, the majority of rail vehicles already provide some access for disabled people.
<P>
If those customers are to have the same service as that offered to others, it is important that they can travel in confidence knowing that if substitute services are used they will be able to continue their journey. At present, however, we need to recognise, as the amendment does, that in some parts of the United Kingdom accessible road transport may be limited. Sections 32 and 40 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which deal with taxis and PSVs, are not yet in force.
<P>
The absence of accessible road vehicles is likely to have the greatest impact where substitute services are required at short notice, but may be less of a problem if rail operators are able to plan ahead.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the principle of the amendment, which is directed at the SRA, but we need an enforceable mechanism for tightening the requirements on train operators because the vast majority of substitute services is secured by them, not by the SRA directly.
<P>
The Government's view is that the objective of the amendment can best be secured by revisions to the regulator's statutory code of practice on meeting the needs of disabled passengers. The regulator will shortly be consulting on a revised code of practice, which may provide an opportunity to tackle the problems to which my hon. Friends referred. Subject to this consultation, the regulator proposes to require that buses or other substitute transport arranged on a pre-planned basis must be accessible to disabled people. The regulator proposes to require that when train services are disrupted because of an emergency, operators must seek suitable alternative means of transport for disabled people. Where accessible buses cannot be provided at short notice, the regulator proposes to recommend that operators should provide accessible taxis. The regulator also proposes, again subject to consultation, that operators must ensure that this information is supplied to the national rail inquiry service, other information services and station staff on affected routes.
<P>
The Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee is a statutory consultee in terms of section 70(2) of the Railways Act 1993. The Committee will therefore be able to make a significant contribution before the regulator's proposed new code is finalised. The shadow SRA is also involved. Under the Bill, the SRA will inherit the regulator's responsibilities for disabled people including the code of practice.
<P>
I am sure that all Committee members will agree that these are positive developments. In the light of the important points that have been made by my hon. Friends and by hon. Members in this debate, I undertake to consider how we might secure an appropriate mechanism to achieve the objectives sought. With that assurance, I hope that my hon. Friends will agree to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I am pleased with those words of reassurance from my hon. Friend the Minister, as I am sure the 620,000 people who use wheelchairs will be. They will be looking carefully at our proceedings, which will no doubt be reported in their magazines. People want the assurance that they can use the rail network and that they can get on and off it. I am reassured by the regulator's code of practice, which has been mentioned. The train operating companies, the SRA, Railtrack and the regulator have a mutual responsibility to get this done.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby mentioned a train reversing back to a station. It is important that all stations have taxis or other forms of transport so that they are wheelchair accessible—the hon. Member for Bath mentioned that. We need that provision and we need it also for substitute services.
<P>
As the Under-Secretary said, in the case of pre-planned substitution for maintenance, it should always be wheelchair accessible substitution. In emergencies, there may from time to time, be practical obstructions and time delay.
<P>
However, I am reassured as I am sure the wide audience outside this Committee will be. The people from Railtrack, who are in the audience, are also listening intently to hear about their obligations. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 924, in page 207, line 13, leave out sub-paragraph (7).
<P>
Knowing your tolerance, Mr. Gale to a slightly wider debate on the first amendment of a new part of the Bill, I hope that you will allow us to discuss schedule 16 more widely than the amendment allows. It is a probing amendment, but it also promotes one or two small questions.
<P>
The interesting thing about this part of schedule 16 is how it deals with consumer protection. For some time the complaint has been that consumer protection has been muddled, presumably between the franchising director and the regulator. The schedule would move consumer protection firmly into the court of the Strategic Rail Authority. I am puzzled by that and would welcome an explanation of why that decision was taken.
<P>
The schedule specifies such things as conditions about fares, pricing, dealing with complaints, security and the police, conditions at railway stations, how the timetable information inquiries operate, ticketing, conditions of carriage and rail passengers' committees. Protecting the interests of disabled people should be the responsibility of the franchisees, as the Minister said.
<P>
Why, then, should the SRA be the policeman in this case? It would be more sensible for the regulator to have that responsibility. Why has the Minister chosen to go down the SRA route rather than with the regulator? To police companies on their ability efficiently to issue tickets and deal with public security and other consumer matters, seems to be to police them on whether they are dealing adequately with the disabled. We are not clear what subsection (8A) means and why it appears to be so draconian. We would welcome an explanation from the Minister as to its purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Before I deal with the amendment, it may be helpful if I explain the thinking behind schedule 16. The hon. Member for Hexham invited me to do so.
<P>
A criticism of the current regulatory regime has been that there is no clear division between the roles of the regulator and the franchising director in relation to the consumer. When a railway passenger wishes to comment or complain about a service that has been provided, there is no easy way of knowing who is best equipped to deal with the complaint. By the same token, no one organisation has focused responsibility on the concerns of the railway passenger.
<P>
Clause 191 and schedule 16 will make a clearer division between of the roles of the regulator and the authority as successor to the franchising director by transferring to the authority some of the consumer protection functions of the Rail Regulator. These are the regulator's functions in respect of the content, enforcement and modification of Railway Act licences as far as they relate to consumer protection conditions, sponsorship of the renamed rail passengers council and committees, the preparation of a code of practice for protecting the interests of disabled passengers and some functions relating to closures—for example, the power to certify minor closures and the powers to make rules for penalty fares. The provisions will vest in the authority a one-stop shop for the travelling public. They will simplify the regulatory framework and so increase public confidence in the railway.
<P>
I come to the important matter of consumer protection conditions of licences. As the Committee is aware, anyone who wishes to operate passenger or goods services, or a network, railway station or light maintenance depot, must be awarded a licence by the Rail Regulator. Each licence granted typically requires the operator to comply with technical and operating standards relevant to the railways. The conditions also secure a number of benefits for the public such as participation in the national timetable information service, insurance against liability for damage to property or personal injury and through ticketing. These are sometimes called network benefits. They complement consumer protection provision, which is included in franchise agreements—foremost, the provisions on fares and passenger charter compensation matters.
<P>
The conditions that protect consumers of railway services are set out in new section section 71A of the Railways Act, which will be inserted by schedule 16(3), which takes the form of a list. However, subparagraph (c) does not prevail in this case because the list is exhaustive. If a condition is not specified in it, it is not a consumer protection condition. The intention is to transfer responsibility for these conditions to the Strategic Rail Authority. The regulator will remain the person who grants the licence, but in future the following arrangements will apply. The regulator will need the authority's approval to include the licence conditions relating to consumer protection and the authority's approval for the consensual modification of a licence condition relating to consumer protection. The authority will be responsible for approvals relating to a consumer protection matter. This includes the approval of insurance or policing arrangements, The authority will be responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection conditions of a licence, including new penalty arrangements or enforcement under section 55 of the 1993 Act. The authority will also need to join the regulator in consenting to the assignment of a licence.
<P>
We also propose that the authority should have the conduct of any reference to the Competition Commission on a matter relating to consumer protection on the ground that it operates against the public interest. This could lead to a licence modification being imposed on an operator. We propose that the authority should be able to make such reference, although it will require the regulator's approval to do this.
<P>
It is also worth noting how far we have gone in this part of the Bill to ensure that licence holders cannot argue that the burden of regulation will be increased. In exercising its functions under this part, the authority's usual purposes and functions are switched off and will not be subject to instructions and guidance from the Secretary of State under clause 182. Instead, the authority will be under the same duties and responsibilities as the regulator under section 4 of the 1993 Act although, of course, we are aligning the regulator's and the authority's respective duties as closely as possible, given their differing functions. This provision is in new section 7A(7) in line 33 on page 35 of the Act. I was surprised to discover that amendment No. 927 would delete this important provision, but we shall come to that soon.
<P>
The provisions make no change in the licence holders' substantive obligations. I think that that was a worthwhile overview.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> Hear, hear!
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am pleased to receive the Committee's assent.
<P>
Before I comment on the amendment, I will deal with the draft consumer protection scheme, which I have tabled for the Committee's convenience. This is a scheme that could be made under schedule 25(2), which we shall come to later. The scheme will amend existing licences to ensure that they conform with the new arrangements. I am not saying that it is perfect yet, but it is an illustration of the use that the Secretary of State would make of his powers under schedule 25. I am opening the document to general consultation with the railway industry and copies will be available from my Department.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 924 would delete schedule 16(7). The regulator has the power to refer any matter relating to Railway Act licences to the Competition Commission if he considers that they operate against the public interest. A procedure in sections 13 to 16 of that Act can lead to modification of a licence if the commission agrees. Paragraph (7) amends that provision so that the SRA makes the referrals to the commission where the subject is consumer protection. This is consistent with the schedule's general thrust, which I have described. The amendment would leave responsibility for consumer protection with the regulator, even though he will not have other active consumer protection responsibilities—although, under our provisions, he will of course have a continuing role in appraising a proposed referral by the authority. That would undo a significant part of the one-stop shop approach and re-open the door to confusion.
<P>
I suspect that behind the amendment lies continuing concern, especially among train operating companies, about the ability of the SRA to re-open—by reference, if necessary, to the Competition Commission—matters that it failed to resolve through franchise agreements. Let me reassure the Committee. First, I repeat that it is important to understand that the SRA, in exercising its regulatory functions under the Bill, will be required to have regard to the same section 4 duties as the regulator. Secondly, any attempt by the SRA to abuse the licence modification procedure to re-open individual franchise packages would be open to challenge in the courts as an abuse of its new powers. The Competition Commission could also take that into account when it determines whether an action operates against the public benefit. Thirdly, we must not underestimate the robust and wholly independent scrutiny that the commission will impose. All these considerations should rule out any question of the SRA attempting, through licence modification, to take a second bite at the franchising cherry.
<P>
None the less, we have listened to representations from the railway industry since we amended the Railways Bill that was introduced in July 1999. The aim is that the regulator should retain the ultimate responsibility for decisions on licence modifications. Only the regulator—where the licence holder agrees—can modify a licence. Under proposed new section 13(1B) of the Railways Act in schedule 16(7) of the Bill, the authority would need the regulator's consent to a referral to the Competition Commission to modify a licence condition that is not working. That is adequate protection against the possibility of the SRA misdirecting itself. The amendment would go further, which would be unnecessary. It would also reintroduce a complication that we want to remove.
<P>
I stress the continuing role of the regulator, who will act as the gateway through which the authority must pass before it can initiate the modification reference. The regulator must bring his own independent consideration to the decision, as if he were considering the initiation itself. For example, he must consider, but not exclusively, whether the licence amendment is necessary to secure a change that applies throughout the industry and not solely to the personal package of consumer benefits that the authority may have agreed in the franchise agreement.
<P>
Train operating companies will be able to make representations to the regulator, who will be required to have regard to those. I hope that after my reassurances that the Government have taken note of the rail operators' concern that we are giving compulsory modification powers to the SRA, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for that long, gripping explanation. I slightly lost track just after he began, but I will not ask him to repeat his speech. I shall look at the record instead. The hon. Gentleman has gone a long way towards clearing up the differences between the SRA and the rail regulator. I am sure that they will consider his words carefully. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 925, in page 207, line 31, after `service' insert

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I wonder whether we can recover the spirit of consensus and co-operation that led to the acceptance of amendment No. 918. Let us see whether we can do the same with these two amendments. These are sensible additions to the lists of requirements for those who want to gain a licence. I cite two examples from my area, which is a typical country area. Many people from Shropshire want to go to London by train. There is a service from Shrewsbury, where the car park is not enormous, a good service from Stafford, which is an hour's drive away and the car park is jammed full by 7.30 am, and a service from Crewe which is a little further north but has a better car park.
<P>
At a time when modern means of communication enable people to drive around Puget Sound with little gadgets on their wrists that give details of all the traffic jams, it is ludicrous that in this country we do not know the status of car parks. Surely it would be immensely valuable to make it incumbent on service providers to give the status of car parks at stations so that people know where to divert their cars.
<P>
People who want to travel from Shropshire to Birmingham might want to take a bicycle and it would be sensible for them to have information about whether there is a safe place to store it and whether the trains have space for carrying bicycles. Similarly, if people who want to go into the middle of Birmingham could also access information about local bus services when they ask for train information, it would tie the whole service together. That brief explanation should so overwhelm the Under Secretary with the sense of the amendment that he will accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am not exactly overwhelmed, but I am not unsympathetic to the intention of these amendments. They define what provisions in a licence may be classified as consumer protection conditions. It might be helpful if I explain why the conditions are framed as they are. The amendments are legitimately provisions that could be considered consumer protection conditions, but we have taken a careful and cautious approach to that definition.
<P>
The present list defines consumer protection by reference to the current contents of the licence. We did not want to indicate whether a licence should include anything else. This was intended as a further safeguard against accusations that the SRA might abuse the process. We think it right to define consumer protection in this way. We had great difficulties in arriving at a more general definition of consumer protection. We recognise that what comprises consumer protection in licences will not be cast in stone. That is why paragraph 3(3) of schedule 16 provides that the Secretary of State may make further prescriptions of what may or may not be considered a consumer protection provision.
<P>
Licences may well contain different provisions in the future, including the types that the hon. Gentleman proposed. We need the flexibility to respond to that. The franchising director has said that, as part of the franchise replacement process, he wants provision of secure car parking, including the need for additional spaces to encourage the use of rail and provision of preferential spaces for regular travellers or spaces near the station entrance for disabled passengers. He has also asked for proposals for secure cycle storage and links to local cycle lanes, where appropriate, in the proposed new franchises. The Government and the SRA have been reluctant to impinge excessively in the setting out of conditions. We think that that is probably right for the innovative and flexible relationship that we want from those bidding for the franchises. The Secretary of State has not made an order to redistribute responsibility in respect of any of the conditions. Formal responsibility for content, modification and so on will remain with the regulator. The Secretary of State cannot abuse this power. Clearly a demarcated line beyond which he cannot pass is provided in section 7A(3). I hope that those reassurances will persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I should like to put on the record again that the lack of parking spaces and the uncertainty of finding a parking space after an hour's drive is a major disincentive to country people to drive to a mainline station to take the train. Given the sympathetic hearing that the Minister gave the amendments and his encouraging noises, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 927, in page 207, line 39, leave out from beginning to end of line 38 on page 208.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 988 to 990, 997 and 998.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> This is one of those helpful amendments. The principal reason for moving it is that we do not believe that the Secretary of State should be able to make unilateral changes to primary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall speak first to amendment No. 927. We trailed much of the ground here on amendment No. 925. The present definition of consumer protection conditions simply reflects the reality of what is in railway licences. Other matters would be consumer protection conditions if they were in a licence. Amendment No. 925 identified two such provisions. That is why subsection 7A(2) in paragraph 3 of schedule 16 provides that the Secretary of State may make further prescribed descriptions of what may or may not be considered consumer protection provisions.
<P>
Licences may well contain different provisions in the future, including those proposed by the Opposition. We need the flexibility to respond to that. The power is exercisable by statutory instrument, which offers some protections from the arbitrary interventions that the hon. Gentleman evidently fears. We make exceptions for those conditions that can never be consumer protection conditions.
<P>
If, as the result of the exercise of this power to add to the list of consumer protection conditions, any licence documents need to be amended to reflect the assumption of responsibility by the authority, subsection 7A (4) to (6) provides for a scheme to enable that to be done. It would need to be similar to the type of scheme that we have referred to this afternoon already. We imagine that the powers in these paragraphs would rarely need to be used because any new matters would not be covered in existing licences, but they are reserve powers in case it is necessary.
<P>
Subsection 7(7) is an important provision because it puts the authority under the same duties in respect of the consumer protection conditions of the licence as the regulator. That is an important safeguard and I do not imagine that the hon. Gentleman intended to delete it. I hope that after that explanation, he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
The Government amendments also cover ground that we travelled this afternoon. They are essentially housekeeping amendments to ensure that the conversion of references to the regulator in relation to consumer protection conditions can be converted to references to the authority. The mode of conversion for such conditions will be a scheme of the type illustrated in the document that we produced. The amendments would ensure that we could convert references to the regulator in all appropriate documents to references to the authority.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I recognise that the spirit behind this amendment is not unhelpful, but I shall invite the Committee to resist it if it is pressed to the vote.
<P>
The amendment would elaborate on the requirements placed on the SRA when it gives notice that it proposes to consent to suggested modifications to a licence. Such elaboration is unnecessary. The notice that the authority needs to give under section 12(1A), as inserted by paragraph 6 of schedule 16, is subject to the requirement in section 12(3) of the Railways Act 1993 that it should be published in such manner as the authority considers appropriate to bring the notice to the attention of those likely to be affected by the modifications. It must also serve the notice on the licence holder.
<P>
There is no need, and it is unhelpful, to add a requirement to publish in a newspaper or add a new six-week timetabling requirement time scale into the process. The authority has clear obligations to publish and the appropriate manner of publication is for it to decide. I suspect that hon. Members were not aware of the authority's obligations under section 12(3) of the 1993 Act and will be content to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also wants the notice to be made in a newspaper circulating in the locality, which would be less than helpful. Currently the SRA could use newspapers, were that appropriate, but it may not be. Not all licences have a geographical prescription. A depot licence might, but a train operator might run over a large area. Flexibility is what is needed and it is provided under the present arrangements. I implore the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am convinced. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
It is understandable that train operating companies are nervous of the Secretary of State, the authority or the regulator modifying the agreements. It removes the certainty and could make people less likely to invest in the railway system. The amendment would provide more certainty than is proposed by the Government.
<P>
Franchise agreements can be changed only with the approval of train operating companies, but the terms of licences can be changed unilaterally. Train operating companies are concerned that their investment plans could be seriously disrupted if changes to licence conditions place additional expenses on the operation of train services—expenses that were not factored into their original bids. Through the amendment, we seek clarification of how those changes will be made in future bids. We want such changes to be made through franchise agreements rather than licences. The Under-Secretary has discussed the matter with train operating companies and has moved a long way in the direction for which they have pressed. However, our debate will give us an opportunity to flush out a little more the Under-Secretary's intentions on the matter and, hopefully, reassure the train operating companies that their future will not be jeopardised by sudden changes in licence conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that matter and for the tone with which he moved his amendment. I know that the matter has caused train operating companies some concern, which I hope to allay.
<P>
The amendment would require that consumer protection conditions are not already contained in a franchise before the SRA seeks consent from the Rail Regulator for a reference to be made to the Competition Commission to seek their modification. I assure the Committee that we have taken seriously the railway industry's concerns—as expressed by the train operating companies—that the SRA should not be able to re-open in a licence modification conditions that it fails to achieve through the franchise.
<P>
Under the Railways Act 1993, the Rail Regulator can modify licence conditions, even if they relate to a matter already in a franchise. Whether he expects to succeed is another matter. The Competition Commission and the courts would take a dim view of any attempt to reopen a franchise settlement unless there were legitimate reasons for doing so, such as the desire to convert a consumer protection matter from a personal arrangement in a franchise agreement to a cross-industry standard—often described as a multi-lateral arrangement.
<P>
The SRA's position in the Bill as the regulator of consumer protection matters is no different from that of the Rail Regulator as regulator of other licence conditions. The SRA will be under the same section 4 duties as the Rail Regulator when carrying out its regulatory functions.
<P>
Generally, we would expect licence changes to be agreed between the parties. When that cannot be achieved, there is provision for reference to the Competition Commission, on which the amendment bites. Before the commission can examine the issue, the SRA must seek the consent of the independent Rail Regulator, which is yet another safeguard.
<P>
I have much sympathy with the amendment. However, it would unnecessarily reduce flexibility. To date, such an eventuality has not occurred and I am not aware of circumstances in which it may occur. There may be circumstances in which a franchise commitment may need to be translated into a licence condition as part of a general rationalisation of industry standards. The amendment would remove the opportunity for flexibility that is provided for a truly multi-lateral occurrence. The current position should be maintained and the authority should be able to act where the regulator can with all the safeguards that are in place. In light of my explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for his explanation, although I cannot judge whether it will satisfy the Association of Train Operating Companies. No doubt, if concerns remain, they will be raised at a later stage. However, I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's remarks and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
