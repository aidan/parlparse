                        <p class="tabbed">I am keen, as
others will be, to participate in the stand part debate on clause 75.
It marks a critical stage in our proceedings, with the introduction of
the personal independence payment, which is a substantial part of the
Government’s programme. The payment will replace disability
living allowance, and payment rates are outlined in subsection (2)
under the headings of daily living and mobility components. I therefore
thought that it was important for the Committee to have the opportunity
to discuss the handling, key principles and concerns behind part
4.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
has been much focus on this part of the Bill. Disability living
allowance reform has attracted much attention and provoked much
controversy. It has perhaps not made the political headlines on the
scale of the Health and Social Care Bill, but thousands of people will
take to the streets around Westminster for the rally tomorrow. That may
well trigger a wider debate on the reform. These changes are causing
enormous concern among disabled people and their families, as well as
among wider disability organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There have
been many debates, questions and representations, and it is incumbent
on us to address them. I am sure that we have all read reports this
week that Jobcentre Plus staff have been sent guidelines on how to deal
with claimant suicide threats. It is quite extraordinary that they have
to tackle that. We cannot underestimate the strength of feeling out
there among some of the most vulnerable people on these big changes to
the welfare system. Their feelings and concerns must shape our debate
today. I hope we keep that in mind as we go through the various
amendments in part 4, which is substantial and important. It is
important that we place that discussion in the right and proper
context.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000033">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Fundamental
concerns need to be addressed in the framework of clause 75, including
the objectives and outcomes of the personal independence
payments—I will refer to the personal independence payments as
PIP. How have the Government gone about that fundamental change? What
is the Government’s approach to including important
representations made by disabled people themselves and by their
representatives?<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
great many people will be affected by the reform, with the latest
estimate from Disability Alliance projecting the figure to be some
800,000. Perhaps the Government will, at an appropriate point in our
deliberations, address that figure so that we may understand it. Who
will be affected by the daily living component, by the mobility
component, and by a combination thereof? Who will gain, and who will
lose? What is the Government’s objective in introducing the
reform?<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is no doubt, and it has been plainly stated, that there is a case for
reform. The Opposition and I are clear about that. How we go about
making that change is important, and its underpinning principles need
to be clarified. We need to understand the drive behind the reform. If
we get that right, we could move towards more effective and
long-lasting
reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I understand it, part of the Government’s argument is that there
is a problem with the increasing uptake of DLA, but the Government have
failed to look at the reasons for that increasing uptake. Undoubtedly
the Government have an argument to make, and I will listen to it
constructively. Disability living allowance was introduced in a
different time, well before the Equality Act 2006 and the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995. There have been various health and social care
measures, education Acts, and other new legislation that have shaped
our understanding, and shaped the principles underpinning our
understanding, of
disability.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before
we embark on fundamental change, potentially to the detriment, it is
alleged, of so many disabled people, it is reasonable to argue that we
should look at the evidence, the facts, the context and the grounds on
which reform is based. What factors have led to an increase in the
uptake of DLA, which has led to the argument for change? It could be
changing demography. People are living longer with longer-term
conditions. We have a better understanding of existing conditions and a
greater appreciation of new illnesses and new disabilities. Mental
health issues are emerging much more frequently now than they did 20
years ago. Our understanding of conditions such as autism is much
improved.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Reflecting
on the legislation, the definition of disability is changing and social
care services are evolving. How do those changes interact and grapple
with benefits? How do different benefits interact? It is reasonable and
legitimate for the Government to say, “We now need to take
stock. We need to look at how all these benefits interrelate and how we
pay for social care services.” How does all that factor into a
grand narrative? That would have been a much better and more effective
basis for
reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have yet to make that argument—we certainly have not
heard it. We believe that reform of DLA is necessary. Such reform is
the next logical step in welfare reform after the reform of incapacity
benefit, in which my right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham played a
significant role.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000040">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
imperative that we learn the lessons from incapacity benefit reform and
ensure that they are built into our current deliberations on DLA
reform. Again, we are not at that stage yet. Particular lessons need to
be learned from the work capability assessment, to which I do not doubt
we will return when we discuss the details of the new assessment for
PIP.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
could the principles of reform be? How do we introduce a proper system
of entitlement and review? How do we avoid unnecessary and duplicate
assessment processes, about which disabled people tell us they are
deeply concerned? How do we gather evidence to make decisions on
awards? That is critical to how we take the reform forward. How do we
learn the lessons of the Harrington review, extrapolate them and apply
them in a different context? That could have been the basis of reform.
I would argue that, if one engages constructively with the disability
organisations, many of them also see the need for reform. They will
argue that DLA reform is necessary, but they would argue strongly that
one should look at the evidence and the facts. That should be the basis
of
reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sorry to say that the Government’s approach, as illustrated
in clause 75, has fallen far short of that method, and has alienated
wider elements of the disability movement. That has sadly undermined
the case for reform of DLA, and now many people have rolled back from
that argument, because they are so terrified of the
prospects.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 75 is
essentially the accumulation of a large consultation process entitled
disability allowance reforms. I shall say a few words about that
consultation. The period for it was cut short; it fell short of the
12-week recommendation for Government consultations, and the
consultation period included the Christmas holiday and the new year
break. Rushing such a fundamental reform is unforgivable. It was
completely unnecessary to cut off a couple of weeks. It was
particularly provocative to disabled people; anybody with engagement in
the disability field will understand that. Those people need longer to
go through standard consultation procedures, because they often need
extra assessment and aids to go through the documents. Assistance is
needed to submit recommendations and so on. I was particularly
concerned about that. I know that the Minister has had his ears pinned
back about that several times.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">More
significantly, the Government published the core of their welfare
reform legislation while the consultation process was still under way.
The process was not even closed when the Government said what they were
going to do and what their proposals were. Of course, when the
Government produced their response to the consultation, there were few
changes from the original proposal, despite the fact that the
Department acknowledged that it was one of the biggest responses to a
Government consultation in recent years. We also know that a strong
case for change was made during the consultation process, because many
of the organisations published their consultation submissions. We know
that many substantial questions were raised during that process. The
fact that the Government produced their response—largely
unchanged from their original proposals—before the consultation
closed, was again provocative to disabled people. The Minister has had
his ears pinned back about that, too.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000045">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
undermines the Government’s claim that they want to listen and
work with disabled people. The organisations will tell hon. Members
that they do not feel that they were listened to. I argue that there
are some principles in the Bill that we want to engage with and look
at. There are some big arguments, but it is not complete and there are
big gaps. There are still fundamental questions to be asked,
implications to be spelled out and the need to understand the impact on
some of the most vulnerable members of the community before we go
ahead. I am sure we will do so as we look at the amendments in
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000046">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
need to consider the underpinning issues. Some guiding principles are
beginning to emerge in the Government’s approach, which we need
to explore and extrapolate, to see how the argument goes. The
Government are now clear that PIP will be available only to those with
the greatest need. It is vital that we address the implications of that
proposal for the current case load. We need to work out who will be the
losers. Will the Minister spell out the underlying principles? For
example, who currently gets DLA but will not get PIP? What kind of
group are we looking at? The shift in prioritising PIP for those with
the greatest needs raises fundamental questions about the
Government’s overall approach to disability. It is of course an
attractive argument in a time of scarce resources, but we always live
in a time of scarce resources; that will always be the argument about
welfare spending. There is never enough money to spend on welfare, so
we are always trying to manage limited resources.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People will
always say that of course such benefits should go to those with the
greatest needs, but we will have to be clear about the implications of
that. Does that mean that the Government intend to concentrate
resources on those with the most severe disabilities? That term is used
time and again in documents and papers, and the Under-Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Maria
Miller) has used the term again and again in her contributions and
announcements, but it has caused concerns. Does it mean that there will
be a hierarchy of disability? Where should the line be drawn in that
hierarchy? How will “severest needs”, “severest
disability” or “those in the greatest need” be
defined?<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What are the
implications for people with autism, for example? Some people would say
that those with the severest disabilities are essentially those with a
physical disability, but most members of the Committee know that that
is not adequate and that we need to move beyond that. Where does one
draw the line? For example, one of the big questions that has emerged
and is causing great concern is whether people with mild learning
difficulties will essentially no longer receive financial support in
recognition of the extra cost of their disability. We need to be honest
and have that debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We need to
look at the full implications of subsection (2). For
example, how do we interpret the daily living component? How do we
interpret mobility? Significant representations have been made about
the Government’s proposals concerning aids and adaptations,
because they seem to imply that if a person has some aids and
adaptations that facilitate their daily living and mobility, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 770<a class="bkMark" name="Column770">&#160;</a>
                           </div>perhaps they no longer need PIP or financial support. If that is the
Government’s argument—it is a reasonable
argument—let us debate it and look through the implications
thoroughly. People will ask, as they have asked me, whether they will
no longer be eligible if they have a wheelchair that helps them to get
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What if
someone has a guide dog? I know that the Department has given us some
briefing on that, which we will discuss later, but there is still some
ambiguity. Like it or not, many people who have severe visual
impairments are deeply worried that they will lose their benefits
because of the Government’s proposals about aids and
adaptations. If someone has a carer, will they still get PIP? We need
some clarity about what circumstances will be included, what criteria
will be used, and who will be affected by this.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We know that
even if some aids and adaptations are assessed as necessary—when
an assessment has clearly been undertaken and it has been recognised
that a person needs and should get an aid or an adaptation—they
will not necessarily be provided. Sometimes a local authority has
agreed a person’s eligibility but does not have the resources to
allocate to the necessary aid or adaptation. We know that that is
happening more and more with cutbacks in local government. If people
are cut out of benefit and they still do not get their aid or
adaptation, they are in a particularly serious position. What happens
if they get their aid or adaptation and they are cut out of PIP, but
their aids and adaptations are affected by cutbacks in local
government? They might not get the ramps or the necessary adjustments
in their house, for example. Would PIP be reinstated in such
circumstances?<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, there are fundamental issues about the principles behind
clause 75. During our debate on the Bill, we will advance a number of
detailed amendments that reflect the broad concerns that I have
highlighted. We have concerns of substance about this reform, such as
the six-month wait and the end to automatic entitlement. In this clause
stand part debate, we have to highlight that there are fundamental
concerns about the speed and scale of this reform. There has been no
pilot and there will be no proper tiered approach to the assessment, so
many people feel that they will have to go through this process
reasonably quickly and are unsure of the outcome. Overall, the
principle of reform is one for which support could and should have been
garnered. It is an opportunity that the Government have lost.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
need to modernise benefits, and I would always support that. We need to
address the current gateway, but I strongly argue that we could have
mobilised and galvanised more support if we had taken an evidence-based
approach, paced the reform properly, and worked alongside disabled
people and disability organisations. The basis of the reforms should
have been consulted on properly, and the gaps in the existing
legislation could have been addressed. Sadly, I do not think that the
legislation in front of us today is full and
proper.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000054">&#160;</a>

                           </span> One of our concerns about
the introduction of PIP is that the background to it seems to be
legislation by assertion, rather than by evidence. A number of
assertions have been made, and I am interested to hear the
Minister’s response about what the basis of the evidence for
those assertions is and what further research would hopefully be
ongoing to back them up.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For example,
it is frequently stated that—it was said in the consultation
paper and it was repeated in the response to the
consultation—DLA is out of date, that it needs to be modernised,
and that things have changed since 1992. However, 1992 is not 1892, or
even 1952. It is not so very long ago, and it is not clear in what way
things are so different from 1992 that we need a fundamental overhaul
of the system—not just an updating of parts of it or a
modification of it. There is the idea that it all has to be thrown up
in the air already, and I did not see anything in the consultation
paper that ever really supported that. It was an assertion without
evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly,
people are concerned about the increased numbers of claimants and,
therefore, about increased expenditure, but are we probing the reasons
for those developments properly? We need to understand why those
changes are happening, because a number of things can happen. First,
people may lose benefit who need it, because there is an underlying
assumption that if the numbers have gone up, it is not justified, and
that in some way, people are getting benefit who do not need it. That
comes through several times, certainly in the wording of the
consultation. Secondly, if we have not probed why claims and
expenditure are increasing, we might find that the same thing happens
again with the new benefit, because there is actually a real need out
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A number of
things have happened, even in recent years, and they are still
happening. There has been the de-institutionalisation of many people
with disabilities. In my city, and I am sure in many other areas, for
some 20 years, a programme of closing down large institutions and
enabling people to live in the community has been ongoing. That has
many advantages for individuals, and I think that we all accept that.
In the bad old days, people, whether they had mental health problems or
physical health problems, would be sent to the equivalent of Gogarburn
in Edinburgh and would spend the rest of their lives, more or less, in
that hospital setting. That was not good for them, or for
society.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although the
term was always used in a rather negative fashion, the
“reprovisioning” of such places—moving people into
the community and enabling them to live independent lives—has
depended in part on such things as DLA. If that financial support had
not been available, it would have been far more difficult to set that
up. It is not the only thing that has helped; many people have a whole
spectrum of practical support that comes from the local authority,
although that has a cost, too. However, the financial support from such
measures as DLA has been very important in enabling people to live
independent lives and to help them pay for the costs of doing that.
That is just one aspect of why there may be more claimants now than
there were at a time when people lived very differently. That was a
cost, of course, to a different budget—the health budget. When
people were institutionalised in that way, it was an NHS provision, so
we have shifted that cost, but we need to understand why that has
happened.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I stood down
from my council in 2007, but in the years before that, we were becoming
increasingly concerned about the number of young people who were
entering adult life with disabilities. That was because of huge
advances in medicine, predominantly. Increasingly, children who would
not have lived out of infancy were living. There are conditions that
used to be seen as so life 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 772<a class="bkMark" name="Column772">&#160;</a>
                           </div>shortening that children would be unlikely to live into adulthood, but
they are now able to do so. That means that there are individuals who
need considerable support to lead independent lives. That is another,
growing, group that did not really exist before. That concerned us as a
council because it presented a cost which previously we did not face.
It was seen as a major pressure on our council budgets and we expect
that pressure to continue into the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Additionally,
people are living longer in both adulthood and into older age. Some
people with DLA will continue to receive it, even after they reach the
end of their normal working lives. People are able to live longer, but
longer life is not always healthier life and gives rise to issues about
people’s health and disability needs. Those are the challenges
we face. It would, therefore, be useful to be clear about the reasons
for increases in expenditure and factor in such increases and new and
increased real demands. That is not necessarily to allow a budget to
overrun or to let people who do not deserve it make claims. Throughout
this process, upon first reading the consultation paper, I have had
concerns, which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow East has referred
to, about the increase in concentration

Nevertheless, we are discussing clause 75 stand part. I wonder if the

                           </strong> Thank you, Mr Gray. I would conclude by saying
that, although the benefit will be called a new name and is put forward
as a substantial change in clause 75, it is clear that in some respects
there is not a great deal of difference. That poses the question of why
the whole matter needs to thrown up in the air and reviewed. Daily
living component and ability component are not very different from DLA.
It remains to be seen, as we have discussed in the remainder of the
clauses, how far they really are different and will make a substantial
difference, and whether the entire reform, in the way it has happened,
is justified.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000063">&#160;</a>

that the existing disability living allowance benefit is perfect, but
it is absolutely vital for many disabled people in terms of their
quality of life and their ability to participate fully. In seeking to
make changes, we must not underestimate its importance and the need to
protect its achievements for disabled people. Therefore, I support the
concerns my hon. Friends have raised this morning about understanding
the Government’s purpose in introducing the changes. I welcome
the clarity in clause 75 that DLA continues to be replaced by a benefit
in PIP that is to meet daily living and mobility needs, but we are
entering into unknown territory.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000064">&#160;</a>

Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for

with their disabilities and to enable them to fully participate in
society as those of us who do not to experience disabilities are able
to do. I would like absolute clarity from the Minister that it remains
the philosophy of the Government, in introducing PIP, that this is a
participation benefit and no other sort of benefit and that it is on
that basis that the changes are being
introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000065">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
say that in the context of the recent introduction of the work
capability assessment, which was introduced by the previous Labour
Government and which had many teething problems, as we all accept. It
is to the Government’s credit that they have commissioned a
review of the introduction of that test, which was required under the
Welfare Reform Act 2009, and that they have committed to making the
changes recommended by Professor Malcolm Harrington. We also welcome
the fact that he is conducting further reviews to improve that
test.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is significant confusion in disabled people’s minds, however,
between the work capability assessment, including the many difficulties
that they have experienced or heard about, and the forthcoming gateway
test for disability living allowance. It is imperative that Ministers
allay those fears and confusion and that they make it absolutely clear
to disabled people that the personal independence gateway assessment is
entirely different from the work capability assessment in purpose and,
therefore, in
design.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we discuss the personal independence payment clauses, I hope that we
will understand exactly how the Government intend to implement the
gateway assessment, because there is certainly considerable concern
about the potential for confusion in disabled people’s minds. An
example of that might be the way in which the two tests need to look at
the same person and their circumstances in different ways. A blind
person might be able to pass the work capability assessment, because,
with the aid of suitable adaptations either to the equipment that they
use or to their workplace, they can work in paid employment. We have
many encouraging examples of blind and partially sighted people who are
able and keen to be in paid work. That is different, however, from
saying that that person does not necessarily need financial support for
their wider social participation. We need to be absolutely clear that
the PIP gateway test is about that wider social participation and that
failing to pass, as it were, the work capability assessment does not
get bound up with or predispose an outcome on the PIP gateway
test.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000068">&#160;</a>

concerns about the DLA, which have existed for several years and which
the previous Government 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 774<a class="bkMark" name="Column774">&#160;</a>
                           </div>sought to address. A number of reforms and extensive consultation took
place on exactly the issues that she has raised about take-up,
particularly among people in paid employment, complexity of claiming
and so on. Although many of the organisations that participated in the
review three or four years ago were positive about the way in which the
then Government engaged with them, I must say that, in terms of
complexity of claiming, it actually led to a lengthening of the form.
That was because the nature of the information that is needed to carry
out a satisfactory, comprehensive and well-informed assessment requires
that we gather all the relevant evidence. There is a real challenge,
which I am sure that Ministers will be thinking about, about how to
ensure that, on the one hand, information is appropriately collected
from disabled people and, on the other hand, that it is not too
burdensome or bureaucratic—insofar as that is at all
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How
will the clarity that this assessment is different from and has a
different purpose from any other assessment around work capability or
otherwise be guaranteed and communicated to disabled people, to those
who work with them and to their families? How, in due course, will the
assessment process sit alongside other assessment processes, so that
disabled people do not find themselves being constantly tested and
retested for different benefits in a way that could cause them great
stress if it is not handled
well?<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000071">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
second issue that I want to raise in this stand part debate concerns
the introduction of the new benefit and the lessons that can be learned
from the early months of the work capability assessment or employment
and support allowance. I highlight the need for very clear
communication to disabled people, their families and the organisations
that work with them about when they are likely to be affected by the
new assessment. The hon. Member for West Worcestershire and I were
present in the Select Committee discussion the other day, in which we
heard that a timetable of when assessments would affect different
disabled people would be very much welcomed, particularly by those with
mental health conditions, autism, learning difficulties and so on, who
are likely to be anxious in a period of uncertainty.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
the Minister will discuss communicating the process of transition and
change. If she cannot do so in the stand part debate, I hope that she
will discuss at a later stage of our consideration the nature of the
assessment, the descriptors and characteristics that will be used to
determine whether somebody is entitled to the new personal independence
payment and the level of the payment. I hope that she will say
something about the decision-making process, because there are some
powerful and important lessons for us to learn from the experience of
the work capability
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000073">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
warmly welcome the changes that Ministers have introduced to the
process of the work capability assessment as a result of the Harrington
review. In particular, Ministers have put extra so-called touch points
into the process, where a Jobcentre Plus official will be in direct
personal contact with the claimant as their claim proceeds, and their
entitlement taken, assessed and reviewed. Will the Minister tell us
what sort of decision-making process, and design around that, has been
carried out so far? What lessons are being learned about designing an
appropriate decision-making process from the work capability
assessment, though it is different in purpose?

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman is right to pick up on
that. There is a slightly different purpose; PIP is not simply about
the additional costs of being a disabled person, but about trying to
identify how we can help disabled people to participate in society. It
is important to make that distinction, because that drives the
assessment criteria that we are putting forward, and it goes to the
heart of why PIP will provide stronger support for disabled people than
the DLA, which is because it recognises that participation is what
disabled people want support with. One of the key weaknesses of the DLA
is that it does not pick up those participation issues, particularly
around people with sensory impairments and learning difficulties.
Rather than going into the detail of that now, however, perhaps I can
draw back to some of the broader points.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000082">&#160;</a>

details of the assessment criteria, which the Committee received last
week. It is difficult to assess each individual’s needs on a
case-by-case basis. Therefore, the assessment criteria are inevitably
used as proxies for some of those barriers that people face. Rather
than being drawn into a detailed debate on assessment criteria, I will
refer to the broader principles outlined in clause

core of our philosophy, and we will focus on giving disabled people the
support they need to live more independently. Disability is one word
with many meanings. I challenge the Committee to keep that

communications. As with so much that we do in government, the way that
we communicate with those affected is most important. I assure the hon.
Lady that the task of communication is already under way. We are
working in co-production with disabled people and their organisations
on the design and architecture of the proposed benefit. For many months
now, we have had a specialist group working with us on the design of
the assessment, to make sure that we get that right from the start. We
are doing some testing now, and there will be further testing during
the summer. I am sure that we will talk more about that as we move
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000091">&#160;</a>

is right to emphasise that communication about what changes are being
made, how they will affect people and when they can expect those
changes to come into play, is most important. I hope that we can work
with her and other Labour Members and disabled people’s
organisations to make sure that those communications are strong and
clear, because it is in the best interests of disabled people to know
the facts, rather than some of the assertions that have been made in
recent
months.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Members for Glasgow East and for Edinburgh East questioned the
evidence that is being used to shape reform and, indeed, whether there
was evidence of the need for reform. There is clear evidence that the
current structure of DLA is simply not working in the way that is in
the best interests of disabled people. First and foremost, my key
concern about DLA is that it fails to recognise many of the problems
faced by people with sensory impairments and learning disabilities. It
took some 10 years of debate and changes to primary legislation make a
simple change to recognise that people who are blind have considerable
mobility problems that were simply not picked up in the current
architecture of the benefit. That shows how DLA is flawed at its heart
and lacks the flexibility to adapt to the changing way that we want
benefits to work to support disabled people.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000093">&#160;</a>

cannot believe that the hon. Ladies think that a benefit that has no
inbuilt method of reassessment is right for the 21st century. Why?
Because we leave disabled people at risk of either being over-rewarded
or under-rewarded. I certainly feel deeply uncomfortable about their
condition not being regularly reassessed.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000094">&#160;</a>

believe was dealt with by one of my predecessors, but perhaps I will
come back to her with the exact details. As the previous Government set
out, there was some misinterpretation of the idea that an award was
given for life; indeed, it was only ever the case that an individual
would receive a benefit as long as their condition continued. I
understand the point she 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>makes, though, and perhaps it comes back to her earlier communication
point: we have to be clear with people about exactly what we mean.
Perhaps some looseness of words in the past led people to believe that
they were given a benefit that would not be subject to
review.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000096">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps the
hon. Lady makes my point for me: if we have an inbuilt review, disabled
people can be confident that they will still receive that benefit if
they require it, and that if their condition has deteriorated, that
will be acknowledged. The Committee might be interested to know that
130,000 people who were awarded DLA in 1992 have not had their benefit
either reviewed or reassessed since then. It is difficult to believe
that absolutely nothing has changed for those people in the intervening

                           </strong> Yes, although the two things are described in
slightly different ways. In revising the assessment criteria, I am
trying better to reflect the reality of disabled people’s lives.
If the right hon. Gentleman looks at the current assessment of the need
for mobility assistance, for example, he will see that it is focused on
the physical needs or the physical problems that people face in terms
of being able to walk a certain distance, whereas PIP is designed to
pick up on the other mobility problems that disabled people frequently
face, particularly in being able to plan a journey between A and B.
Even if one can walk a certain distance, if one cannot plan that
journey and undertake it independently one’s mobility is as
severely undermined as that of an individual who cannot physically
walk. That is a clear example of the deep flaw in DLA as it stands. In
response to the hon. Members who challenged whether DLA needs to be
reformed, I would assert that that is one of the many challenges that
we face in reforming DLA to ensure that it is fit for the 21st century
and how we understand disability
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000109">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a helpful answer, but I want to confirm
that PIP is about meeting extra costs. The Minister is defining the
extra costs in a slightly different way—they are about
participation rather than the things that the DLA was about—but
it is about meeting extra costs that disabled people
incur.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000110">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It would be difficult to analyse every single
extra cost that a disabled person might incur. The administrative
system required would be complicated and difficult to implement if we
looked at every single extra cost. By definition, we have to look at
proxies for some of those extra costs, which are set out in the
assessment criteria.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I will make a
little progress before I am waylaid again and asked for further detail.
Entitlement to DLA depends on the extent to which somebody needs help
with personal care, needs supervision or has difficulties walking. PIP
will consider the impact of an individual’s impairment or health
condition on their daily life, as I have outlined to the right hon.
Gentleman. PIP will take account of changes in individual circumstances
and the impact of disabilities, as well as reflect wider changes to
society that have taken place since 1992—for example, our
understanding of conditions such as autism and learning difficulties
was not as well developed in 1992 as it is
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000112">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As I am sure the Minister knows, a large number
of applications for DLA are unsuccessful, albeit some appeals against
the decisions are successful. The Minister has given examples of people
who may not currently be eligible for DLA but who may be eligible for
PIP. Is she satisfied that that will not lead to an increased demand?
If it does, what effect will that have on her Department’s
financial planning? It appears to me that we are talking about people
who are not currently eligible.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000113">&#160;</a>

principled approach in the reform of any benefit, which is what we are
doing. We will be led by what is right in terms of the support that

mindful of our other budgetary requirements. Every Minister in every

PIP, I assure the Committee we will prioritise support for those
individuals who face the greatest day-to-day challenges and are
therefore likely to experience the highest costs. It will be
non-contributory and non-means-tested, and the aim is to help people to
live more independent lives in their community. PIP will not be linked
to an individual’s impairment, but will focus on an
individual’s ability to carry out a range of activities that are
necessary for day-to-day life and the extra costs that arise as a
result. It will be payable to people who are in work as well as those
who are out of work.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000115">&#160;</a>

deal with many of the issues that will arise are set out in the Bill.
For Members who are interested in the challenges that we have to deal
with, tests of residence and presence will be similar to those used for
DLA and they will be set out in regulations. We intend to introduce an
habitual residence test to bring PIP into line with other
non-contributory benefits, instead of the ordinary residence test,
which applies for DLA. Entitlement to PIP will be determined by a new
objective assessment, which will enable us more accurately and
consistently to assess individuals to determine who will benefit most
from additional support.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000116">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Stretford and Urmston asked how what we propose will differ
from the work capability assessment. The new test is a completely
different way of assessing people. The two tests assess things
differently. It is important to be clear that the personal independence
payment will focus on the ability to carry out key everyday activities,
whereas the work capability assessment looks at the capability to work,
so any direct comparison between the two assessments is not strictly
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000117">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Lady would expect, however, we are seeking to learn from our
experience of delivering the work capability assessment. As part of
that, we are looking at the findings of the first review carried out by
Professor Harrington to see whether we can ensure that the design of
the PIP claim and assessment process is as good as it needs to be. We
recognise the need to ensure that the processes are transparent and
empathetic, which is an important finding of Professor
Harrington’s work. We are considering the scope for using
mental, intellectual and cognitive champions to support the assessments
for PIP, as Professor Harrington recommended for the
WCA.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Glasgow East asked about aids and adaptations. I am
sure we will return to that later in our deliberations, but I want to
make it clear—the hon. Lady mentioned guide dogs—that we
do not intend that guide dogs be considered an aid or an appliance, nor
do we intend to take them into account in the assessment process. Guide
dogs do not help people to complete the activities considered in the
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000119">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On the hon.
Lady’s more general comments on aids and appliances, our
approach is that support should be targeted at people who are least
able to take part in everyday life. We believe that the assessment
should take account of the successful use of aids and appliances, which
can lessen the impact of health conditions. We recognise, however, that
some aids and appliances, such as electric wheelchairs, that help
individuals also attract significant costs. We have attempted to
reflect that in the detail of the descriptors, and we will also seek to
do that in the associated point scores. I assure the hon. Lady that we
will get that right before finalising the assessment criteria and full
testing will be carried out. If she has had an opportunity to look at
some of the notes we have issued in support of our approach,
she will be reassured that the aids and adaptations we are talking
about are things with which she would feel
comfortable.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000120">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady also touched on the consultation on the provisions before the
Committee today. The consultation, which is the second largest that the
Department has run, ran from 6 December to 18 February and some 5,500
responses were received. Importantly, in parallel to that we held a
number of meetings with disabled people and their representatives and
organisations before, during and after the formal consultation. We
ensured that people had the opportunity to comment not only in the
consultation, but in more detail in those discussions. I strongly
refute the allegation that we somehow rushed the consultation and
pre-empted its outcome. A response to the consultation was published in
April and provided an explanation of our approach, which takes into
account the views from the
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000121">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendments focus on communication needs, which
we have already emphasised this morning, and the whole Committee has

PIP at both the standard and enhanced rates.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000144">&#160;</a>

amendments seek to put an individual’s communication needs on an
equal footing with the barriers that disabled people face in relation

to 216, span clauses 76 to 78 and ensure that, with regard to both the
daily living and mobility components, the communication needs of the
individual are taken into consideration when assessing the barriers
that they face in living a fully independent life. The amendments would
ensure that any Government commitment to take the communication needs
of a disabled person into consideration in the application of PIP, as
has been suggested in the Government’s narrative,

have the support of the Disability Benefits Consortium in promoting
this group of amendments, and it stated the following in its
briefing:<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“For
some disabled people, it is communication barriers rather than personal
care needs that lead to additional
costs.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
Minister has indicated that, to use the vernacular, she gets that. The
briefing
continues:<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Without
adequate recognition of this, individuals can become isolated and cut
off from their local communities. Communication needs affect
individuals’ ability to carry out the activities that are
expected to be included in the assessment for both components of PIP.
For example, communication needs affect an individual’s ability
to take part in ‘planning and buying food’, where someone
faces difficulties in communicating with others and understanding what
is available. Additional costs could therefore be faced by needing
human support or an accessible home delivery
service.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000279">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some
supermarkets do not provide that, and there is need for communication
with customers to support that purchase. As the Minister has used in
examples:<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Equally
communication is essential to mobility. For example, communication will
be crucial for the activity of ‘planning and following a
journey’. Individuals will face significant communication
barriers in asking other people who do not know them for advice when
following a journey. Strangers may not be able to communicate
effectively”.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are especially important given the clear shift that the
Government have decided to make in targeting PIP on those with the
greatest needs only. Those with a physical or mental disability may
appear in great need of support, but it is imperative that, if we
introduce a new modern benefit to meet the demands of the 21st century,
our understanding of disability develops according to the times that we
live in. Disabilities are not just those that can be seen or those that
have no obvious physical dimension, and there can, of course, be an
overlap between physical and mental communication difficulties. By
putting this commitment in the Bill to ensure that individuals’
communication needs are taken into consideration during their
assessment for PIP, the Government have the opportunity to do just
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Member for Redcar said, communication needs also fluctuate,
and we need to grapple with that in the assessment, as well as how that
will be taken into account in a controlled environment such as the
assessment itself. Physical disability—for example, with a
double amputee—is not only clear from the outset of any
assessment of that individual’s needs, but is a permanent,
static impairment that will not come and go. That does not necessarily
apply to those with communication
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000150">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Does the hon. Lady recognise that communication is
a two-way process? As MPs, we often experience people who, either
through a lack of understanding of the process, or fear about where an
admission of incapability may lead in terms of being taken into care or
whatever, have been assessed as more capable. Two-way communication is,
therefore, extremely
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000151">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 785<a class="bkMark" name="Column785">&#160;</a>
                           </div>we have had powerful testimony, particularly from the parents of adults
with autism who participate in the assessment process. They
are determined to answer the questions as they are interpreted and to
reveal the entirety of the disability or its impact. I appreciate that
we are all trying to grapple with that to ensure that we bring it into
account as we develop the new assessment.
<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
drive today is to ensure that we include such communication in the
Bill, because it is such a significant development in how we carry out
the assessment. I do not want to go back to bookcases and those issues,
but we need to be emphatic about this and make it centre stage. The
best way to do that is to put it into the Bill. As I have said, it is
in the Government’s narrative, but we have to go one step
further. It would give a vital signal to all the organisations that are
on the other side of the process and ensure that it is a two-way
process. That is vital.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000153">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I have spoken
about the importance of communication needs in assessing impairment,
but in emphasising the other dimensions of communications in no way do
I underestimate the significance of the physical and mental dimensions
of disability. The key point is to put them all on an equal footing. We
are almost there in terms of an agreement to do so. I urge the
Government to go that one step further to show the significance of
doing so. I understand the argument that some things need not be
included in the Bill, but perhaps in this case it might be worth doing
so, given the step change that we are all engaged in
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000154">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am pleased to respond to this group of
amendments, and I should like to say from the outset that communication
is more than in the Government’s narrative; it is in our
proposed assessment criteria. The hon. Lady may not have seen the
assessment criteria when the amendment was tabled, so I will take her
through the thinking behind them. She seeks to ensure that
communication needs are taken into account, alongside physical and
mental impairments. I absolutely recognise the importance of
communication and taking into account impairments that affect
communication. That is a perfect example of why we need to reform DLA,
which takes only very limited account of communication needs. Indeed,
the National Autistic Society’s recent report, “Who
benefits?”, highlights that any new assessment should reflect
the needs of people with autistic spectrum disorders.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
individuals with disabilities affecting speech, language,
comprehension, sight and hearing may not have received as much priority
in the benefit as their needs deserved. That failure in DLA led to the
introduction of the measure recognising severe visual impairment. It
was a necessary workaround to ensure that blind people were fairly
treated. In PIP, we want to treat people fairly and assess their needs
properly as a matter of course, avoiding the need to bolt on special
rules for groups of people affected by particular impairments. That
lies at the heart of our philosophy. It might be helpful to say a
little about the assessment and the work that has been done to develop
it to this point, perhaps to reassure the hon. Lady that we are very
much on the same
page.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
assessment will consider the impact of a full range of impairment
types: physical, mental, intellectual, development, cognitive and
sensory. It is also designed 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 786<a class="bkMark" name="Column786">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to look beyond the care and mobility needs considered in DLA. Although
care and mobility remain essential to the new assessment, we recognise
that they alone do not fully reflect the impact of disability. In
particular, DLA takes only very limited account of communication needs.
Last week, I circulated to Committee members a copy of draft
regulations on the assessment, with a supporting technical note, to
show how the assessment is likely to work. We have since published them
on our website, and I urge any member of the general public who is
following today’s debate to look at them and send us their
comments, because that is, again, part of our ongoing consultation
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000157">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As hon.
Members will have seen, we have set out 11 key activities
that we propose to consider in the assessment. They relate to an
individual’s ability to access food and drink; to manage their
personal care and health needs; to get around; and importantly, to
communicate with others. The activities that have been selected are not
intended to cover all the activities that might be affected by health
conditions or disabilities, nor all the areas that might create extra
cost for disabled people, as I have outlined before. That would not be
possible without creating yet another extremely complicated,
time-consuming and expensive assessment. Instead, they are meant to
represent the key activities that are essential to everyday life and
cumulatively to act as a reasonable proxy for the impact of
disability.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The inclusion
of communication in the assessment is a key development, and it was one
of the things that our assessment development group felt most strongly
about. As hon. Members will know from the draft regulations, the
assessment will consider ability to communicate as a spectrum. We
propose taking into account people who can only communicate with
support, such as someone who is trained to communicate with limited
communication ability—for example, lip speakers—and where
people are unable to engage socially without causing overwhelming
stress to themselves or others. Individuals unable to communicate with
people familiar to them will receive higher priority than those who
cannot communicate with unfamiliar people. As the hon. Lady will
understand, we need to recognise varying degrees: the greatest priority
will go to those unable to understand and communicate even simple
instructions and basic needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000159">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although we
have published the initial draft criteria of the assessment to support
discussions in Committee, our work on that assessment is far from
complete. We intend to spend the summer engaging disabled people and
their organisations on the criteria, as the Committee would expect, and
to seek their views on how the criteria will work and what their likely
impact will be. In particular, we are keen for views on communication
activity—the most radical departure from DLA. We will also be
testing that in our assessment process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our aim is to
provide a further draft of the assessment criteria after the summer to
support discussions on the Bill in the other place. In particular, the
regulations do not, at this stage, include details of how much priority
will be awarded for an ability to carry out activities. We intend to
include those detailed weightings and the thresholds that will be used
for entitlement to the benefit rates in the autumn draft regulations,
once we have been able to test the initial criteria and discuss them
with disabled people and disabled people’s organisations, which
is important.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000161">&#160;</a>

explanation helps hon. Members to understand our approach. The hon.
Lady also picked up on fluctuating conditions, and I hope that she
heard my response to my hon. Friend the Member for Redcar, when he
intervened earlier. I reassure the hon. Lady that the assessment will
not be a snapshot of one day, but that it will consider an
individual’s ability to carry out activities over a
period—we are suggesting a year—and impacts that apply
for the majority of time.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
assessment will also take into account whether activities can be
carried out reliably, repeatedly, safely and in a timely manner. We
will explore that area further in discussions with disabled people and
their organisations. With individuals who have autistic spectrum
disorders, it is vital to ensure that decision makers and assessors
have appropriate training and guidance, and, as I have said, we are
very much learning from the Harrington review.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000163">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
we have been able to reassure hon. Members. I should like to point out
to the hon. Lady that her amendment would perhaps work in a way that
she did not mean. It could involve taking into account communication
needs that are unrelated to health conditions or disabilities; for
example, where an individual does not speak English or does not
understand it, so they cannot communicate on a daily basis. I am sure
that that was not her intention, but it serves to underline why I
cannot accept her amendment. I hope that I have reassured her, however,

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for that substantial answer,
and I want briefly to make a number of points in response. I have seen
the papers from the Department for Work and Pensions; they arrived on
Friday and there were quite a lot of them, so perhaps I have not quite
grasped them all, but I think that I have. I and other hon. Members
will return to this point during our debates: although I appreciate the
pressures on the Government and staff, it would help the Committee and
allow us to conduct our business more effectively if we had such
information rather earlier. That is beginning to be an issue, and it
reinforces the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford
and Urmston that we need further scrutiny by the Social Security
Advisory Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
from those papers that work has been done on the descriptors, but some
people still have concerns about them. The Disability Benefits
Consortium has said that we do not sufficiently recognise the
cross-cutting nature of the communication needs that will have an
impact across all the activities that are being considered. Those
points must be addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has indicated that she has a plan to take this work forward, and I am
sure that she will work with the relevant organisations to address
their remaining concerns about those descriptors. I think that that is
fairly reasonable. The range of work that she has said will be carried
out over the summer, before the Bill goes to the other House, indicates
that in this whole policy area so much work still remains to be done,
and I return to my earlier point that the Bill is rushed. It is
important that Members such as myself who have such an interest in the
subject should have the
opportunity—<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000167">&#160;</a>

ensuring that the Committee receives such documents in a timely

We cannot test properly whether those principles are being correctly
applied, because we do not have the supporting evidence. I am not
saying that every bit of secondary legislation or every regulation
should be in front of the Committee—I understand how legislation
works—but I think that there are significant gaps. It strikes me
that this is different from my normal experience of legislation. The
Minister should not dismiss that quite as lightly as she does, because
I am not the only one saying so; it is quite a widespread view. None
the less, although I am not sure that I agree with the Minister about
how the amendment would work and some of the unintended consequences, I
will not argue with her about that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

                        <p class="tabbed">We
come to another substantial area of discussion. I will refer to the
information that the Government have provided, and I am sure that we
will discuss some of the detail as well as the text of the amendment,
which would make a small but vital change to the Social Security
Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, to ensure that a clear link
remains between carer’s allowance and the main disability
benefit in the United Kingdom. I will address some of the further
information we have had from the Government but, as it stands, part 4
of the Bill contains no explicit reference to linking the new personal
independence payment to carer’s allowance. The amendment would
change that to ensure that the personal independence payment was a new
passported benefit to carer’s allowance.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under current
legislation, an individual who cares for a disabled person who receives
either the middle or higher rate component of disability living
allowance is entitled to claim carer’s allowance. Carer’s
allowance is respected and understood by carers throughout the country,
and it is important that the main disability benefit—the
personal independence payment that may replace DLA—continues to
be a key passport to receiving carer’s allowance. According to
Carers UK, there are 6 million carers in the United Kingdom
and, as of April 2010, 530,000 of them were in receipt of
carer’s allowance. A further 44,000-plus have an underlying
entitlement to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 789<a class="bkMark" name="Column789">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the benefit, implying that they may be entitled to other means-tested
benefits. Even those families choosing not to receive carer’s
allowance for whatever reason have an interest in the wider reform of
disability living allowance. Indeed, families who care for a disabled
person but do not receive carer’s allowance greatly rely on DLA
payments to help them meet the extra costs associated with caring for a
person living with a disability.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When we
discuss DLA reform and the impact it will have on parents, it is
important to consider not only parents who receive carer’s
allowance but those who do not receive the benefit, despite being
eligible under the current rules, and those who are not eligible but
have substantial caring responsibilities for others in receipt of
disability living allowance. All those groups are entitled to clear and
succinct information on how the eligibility criteria for carer’s
allowance and the Government’s plans to support carers more
generally may change in the light of such big changes to the welfare
system, especially with the introduction of PIP, which is a very
significant and substantial change to people living with a
disability.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have decided to keep carer’s allowance outwith
universal credit—a decision that we have welcomed, as has, I am
sure the Minister knows, Carers UK. As it has said, drawing
carer’s allowance into the new system would result in hundreds
of thousands of carers facing a means test on their household income
and savings, and the risk of losing the right to £233 a month in
carer’s allowance and a key recognition of their contribution to
society. However, we welcome the clarity of the Government’s
position regarding carers and universal credit. The position of carers
in the wider reform of DLA has not been subject to the same clarity,
and particular elements remain uncertain.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“It is

                        <p>That
is very significant and will be of great interest to carers throughout
the UK. The amendment seeks to include in the Bill a clear commitment
to ensure that PIP is part of the passport to carer’s allowance.
It also provides us with the opportunity to raise the needs of carers
and make sure that we are really grappling with the impact that the
change in PIP will have for them. If the Government are dealing with
that, let us put it in the

their plans for the fall in carer’s allowance, reform of DLA,
and the introduction of PIP. Before the publication of the note last
Friday, I had not received a response to clarify the relationship with

DLA reform on carers, and she replied

                           </strong> I strongly agree with the point that my hon.
Friend has made, which highlights the importance of the debate.
Families with disabled members feature disproportionately in poverty
statistics. We know the struggles that they face; an extra couple of
pounds can make all the difference in the world. If someone is planning
for their future and does not know what it holds—whether they
will have that resource—it is enormously important. That is why
clarity and pace are so important in the debate. I am not saying that
reform is not important, but how it is done is critical. It must be
managed and paced appropriately, with the information
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We need to
explore the relationship between carers and DLA. It would have been
preferable if that had been done properly before the introduction of
the Bill. There are serious questions and implications as to whether
sufficient parliamentary scrutiny has been allowed on the Bill. The
lack of answers from the Government to my questions on carers is
reflected in a wider lack of information from the DWP following
publication of the Bill. For example, there was no mention of carers in
the initial impact assessment of DLA reforms published alongside the
Bill, nor did one appear in the quality impact assessments published
during the Committee stage. According to Carers UK, 73% of carers in
the country are women, so it raises significant concerns that
carer’s allowance was not mentioned at all in the quality impact
assessments released by the DWP, especially given the scale of reform
that we are discussing today.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is why,
as I am sure the Minister is aware, many carers have made strong
representations that they have not been properly part of the process.
There is growing concern that the Bill therefore lacks joined-up
thinking and that there is a need for a more coherent approach. Rather
than look at each component on a one-to-one basis, there must be an
understanding that a disabled person and their carer are not completely
individual entities, and we cannot pretend that they have no impact on
each other. That is the point my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford
and Urmston was making, and that is why certain information in the
briefing note for carer’s allowance is concerning. It
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“It is

                        </p>
                        <p>That
is incomplete, I think, at this stage. Changes to carer’s
allowance should be developed alongside the reform of DLA. They should
evolve together; it should not be the case that the impact on carers is
only realised after the settlement of a new gateway has been agreed and
after we have established the principles. Our attention to carers
should be embedded in the principles of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
to highlight a case study that illustrates the point that I am trying
to make. It was provided by Carers UK and serves to highlight how
interdependent DLA and carer’s allowance are, and why we need a
more joined-up approach to this reform. Tony gave up work to care for
his wife Laura who is partially blind and has memory problems following
a car accident. They have two young children. Laura needs Tony to be
there to help her wash, dress and use the toilet and she struggles to
prepare food on her own. Tony would love to go back to work but does
not want to leave Laura on her own during the day. Tony claims
carer’s allowance and Laura receives the middle rate care
component of disability living allowance. The support that the family
receives from care and support services is being reduced, because the
local authority has just raised their eligibility criteria to critical
needs, and Laura has been assessed as having substantial needs. If,
following assessment for the new PIP, Laura receives a reduced amount
of disability benefit—equivalent to the lower rate care
component of DLA, for example—that might not allow Tony to
qualify for carer’s allowance; we do not know. The family could
lose almost £60 a week, over £230 a month, as a result of
the reduction in disability benefits, the removal of carer’s
allowance and carer premium. Tony would be forced to claim
jobseeker’s allowance, even though he knows that he cannot work
because of the care and support his family needs, and the fact that
their social care support is also being cut. That is why we need to see
these issues in their
totality.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">From
that, we take away two points. First, our amendment seeks to retain the
independent relationship between carer’s allowance and the new
PIP; secondly, we note the importance of the rates that trigger
qualification for the carer’s allowance. The Government have
said repeatedly that they do not believe that the growing case load and
expenditure on DLA are sustainable—my hon. Friend the Member for
Stretford and Urmston referred to that. Do they think that the case
load and expenditure on carer’s allowance will be sustainable,
and how does that feature in their financial planning?<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the
personal independence payment is to be a key gateway to carer’s
allowance, will the Government clarify that by supporting the
amendment? If the Minister believes that PIP will be a passport to
carer’s allowance, will she provide more information about
whether that will apply to the enhanced or standard rates—or
both—of the daily living component? Do the Government plan to
allow the mobility component of PIP to be linked to carer’s
allowance, or will it remain accessible only via the daily living
component? Will there be an updated equality impact assessment to look
at how people in receipt of carer’s allowance will be affected,
given the proposed reduction in the DLA case load? Has the
carer’s role been taken into consideration in the assessment
process outlined in clause 78?<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000190">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would carry the rules of eligibility for carer’s allowance,
which currently apply to the disability living allowance, over to the
PIP. It is not a massive change and would not require a huge step, but
it would maintain our current position and provide much needed clarity
and assurance to millions of carers throughout the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000191">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is a tendency when dealing with carers to
be supportive, but not necessarily to create the structures needed to
ensure that their role is rewarded and understood. When looking at
public expenditure as a whole, it is important to join up several
things, but because we are looking at one Bill and particular
expenditures, it is easy to concentrate only on those to the exclusion
of other matters. If we take a step back during our consideration of
various forms of public spending, it sometimes becomes clear where
there are links and why some things save money for the public purse.
Carers are one group who probably save the public purse a considerable
amount of money. In their absence, many people would require various
different forms of care. Some people, for example, would not be able to
live independent lives without their carer, who is often a family
member and saves the state a considerable amount of money by providing
that care.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important that carers have the security of knowing that an income
source is available. They have to give up much of their time, and they
may not be able to enter into or carry out paid employment because of
their caring responsibilities. If the situation is not clarified,
anxiety could be created for carers and those for whom they care. If
the intention is for PIP to be a passport to the carer’s
allowance, that should be made explicit at the outset and written into
the Bill. In that case, much of the anxiety and the concerns expressed
by those who have written to Members of Parliament and others about the
issue would be removed, and it would be easier to enter into more
detailed discussions about the reforms suggested in the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Anxiety
remains that some carers will no longer find it easy to qualify for
carer’s allowance. If the PIP is not the passport to that
allowance, it is not clear what the criteria will be for those who
receive carer’s allowance. That could lead to the establishment
of another set of tests that would be expensive to administer and
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000194">&#160;</a>

usual, when we deal with carers—it was Carers Week
recently—we want to sign up to the issues and have our picture
taken with whoever is present at the time. Warm words are frequently
spoken, but those of us who have had the good fortune not to have to
undertake such caring responsibilities have no concept of the extent of
the commitment that people make and the lives that they lead. Added to
the pressures on their lives, such people do not need uncertainty about
whether the payments will still be available, the basis on which the
payments will be available and how easy it will be to claim them. I
hope that the Minister considers that in such circumstances it is
reasonable for the Government’s views not only to be made
explicit but to be made explicit in the

is important to provide such clarity, and I thank the hon. Member for
Glasgow East for giving me the opportunity to do so. We intend the
daily living component of the personal independence payment to be part
of a gateway for receipt of carer’s allowance, as DLA is
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000196">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Member for Edinburgh East pointed out, we need to ensure that
the extent of our commitment to carers is more than benefits alone. I
reassure her that the Government are committed to that in the way in
which we treat carer’s allowance within the universal credit. We
have an ongoing commitment to supporting carers within Jobcentre Plus.
We will ensure that where carers want to stay close to the labour
market, which is often an issue for many carers, they have the support
to be able to do so. Our support for carers goes beyond simply ensuring
that carer’s allowance is in place; it goes much deeper than
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000197">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Glasgow East raised a case study of an individual who
is concerned about whether they will receive carer’s allowance
in future. Obviously, it is difficult to respond to a particular case
study such as that, because the assessment criteria for PIP are yet to
be finally determined, but if an individual has a disability that
requires intensive support such as that outlined in the case study,
clearly the individual would be eligible for PIP. With PIP being used
as a gateway to carer’s allowance, I am sure that the
appropriate level of support will be
forthcoming.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000198">&#160;</a>

understand it, is the word used in the briefing notes that were
produced last Friday. Some concerns have been expressed about that, so
I am again looking for clarity. Will the Minister explain what is meant
by “intensive”? She knows that my point is not only on
the principle of whether there is a link between carer’s
allowance and PIP, but on the level at which that allowance is paid.
That is the point of the case
study.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000200">&#160;</a>

the Government envisage that PIP will mean a decrease in the

caring responsibilities” mean? Answers to those questions would

there is a provision under clause 89 to make an amendment such as she

about removing mobility from those who are “unlikely to

the crux of this debate is the phrase “unlikely to

reassurance about this, but I would be grateful if she could give
further assurance. She will know that disabled people who have
wheelchairs, guide dogs, or a walking stick are worrying about whether
this will affect their application. I think the Minister has said that
if people have a wheelchair or a guide dog, that will not affect their
claim. However, she said earlier that it was the intention to take
account of other aids and adaptations. Will she clarify which people
are unlikely to benefit, and whether this is a reference to this
section of Bill? We need to get to the heart of what is meant by
“should take account of aids and adaptations”.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000216">&#160;</a>

PIP award or eligibility for a PIP award. I understand that the details
of the assessment process and criteria are ongoing and have yet to be
finalised. We will no doubt come back to that. I hope that in her
response the Minister can shed some light on those whom she believes
are unlikely to benefit. It looks as though she can do that, and I
would be grateful. Could she also clarify whether this will merely
affect the later debate we will have about mobility in care homes? I

clause carries into the new benefits similar rules to those that
currently apply to DLA. We are thinking along the same lines as the
hon. Lady in envisaging that this would largely apply to people who
were in a coma or a vegetative state and therefore immobile and unable
to benefit from the mobility component.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000219">&#160;</a>

placing these specific conditions in the Bill is contrary to the
approach to PIP that I have already set out, that we do not want to be
prescriptive about the conditions within the primary legislation. These
conditions would fail to take into account individuals who may not be
able to benefit from mobility assistance, who are not in a coma or
vegetative state but in some similar state. I hope that that clarity
will provide some reassurance to the hon. Lady that this is not
connected with discussions that may be had on other parts of the Bill.
This provision is linked to a provision in the existing legislation on
DLA. I hope that, with that assurance, the hon. Lady will be able to
withdraw her amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000220">&#160;</a>

that a number of disability organisations have made similar
interpretations and wanted this clarification, and I am grateful that
she has given it. It is significant that concerns are so heightened; it
is for this sort of clarity that we are having this debate. As long as

                        <p class="tabbed">It
gives me great pleasure to bring this issue to the attention of the
Committee today. Obviously, it is an issue which is specific to Wales.
However, it is important to give some context, so that Committee
Members can understand why I have raised the issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000225">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Welsh
Language Act was passed in 1993 by the Conservative Government of John
Major. The Act tries to ensure that public services in Wales are
available in the medium of Welsh and English on an equal basis. When
the services in question are being supplied by a Government Department
such as DWP, the demands of the Welsh Language Act can only be
implemented if the Department in question decides to take on board the
need for a Welsh language scheme to be adopted. I am glad to say that
the Department for Work and Pensions has adopted the Welsh language
scheme and in 2010 that scheme was revised and it has been approved by
the Welsh Language Board.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000226">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The scheme is
a very good scheme. It would ensure that the provisions of the Welsh
Language Act applied to the work of the DWP in Wales, and that people
in Wales could access services through the medium of English or Welsh,
according to their choice. That choice is something that we all
support. However, when it comes to services provided by a third-party
agency for Departments like the DWP there is an issue as to whether
they comply with the Welsh language scheme that has been adopted by the
Department.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000227">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
requirement for a third-party agency to work within the demands of the
DWP’s Welsh language scheme is clear. It says:<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Any
agreements or arrangements which we make with third parties based in or
outside Wales will be consistent with the relevant parts of this
scheme, when those agreements or arrangements relate to the provision
of services to the public in Wales. This will ensure that third parties
provide those services in accordance with this
scheme.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000288">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Indeed, I have
asked numerous questions of the Department on this issue and I have had
the same response, which I welcome. However the proof of the issue is
in the way in which the third-party organisation implements policy in
Wales. Unfortunately, since I was elected last May I have had a number
of complaints from constituents that the organisation providing
services and assessment in Wales—Atos—has failed to offer
a comprehensive service through the medium of English and
Welsh.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many members
of the Committee may not be aware that 600,000 people in Wales speak
Welsh as their first language and communicate in Welsh, and nothing
else, until the age of six when they go to school. A constituent who
suffered a stroke at an early age now finds it difficult to communicate
in English. She had to relearn English as a result of the stroke, but
can communicate quite fluently in Welsh. Her disability was assessed by
an assessor who was unable to communicate in Welsh. There is clearly a
problem when someone with a communication issue is assessed on her
ability to communicate in a language that she is relearning as a result
of a
stroke.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000230">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other issue about the assessment process for the personal independence
payment is that we are also looking at the assessment of children. In
the same way it has to be noted that there are numerous monoglot Welsh
speakers in Wales, but they all tend to be under five or over 85.
Again, when we look at the ability to deal with children, it is
important that the provision, which is pretty clear in the DWP’s
scheme, ensures that third-party organisations delivering those
services can do so through the language of choice of the individual in
question.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As a result
of the complaints to my constituency office and complaints that other
Members in Wales have received, the Welsh Language Board instigated an
investigation into DWP procedures. It is a fair summary of that
investigation to say that the scheme adopted by the Department was more
than acceptable, but failures were found.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have tabled
the amendment to get some clarity and assurances. The Department has
adopted a strong Welsh language policy, and there is a commitment to
ensure that third-party organisations work within the scheme’s
remit, but I should like an assurance that the written confirmation
provided to me is what is happening on the ground now. My understanding
is that as a result of the Welsh Language Board’s review, an
effort has been made by Atos to recruit more Welsh speakers. I am
looking for some
assurances<em>—[Interruption]</em>

Welsh speakers in Wales. He not only represents a beautiful part of our

reassure him that I share his ambitions for the Department in ensuring
that assessments are always available in Welsh. Indeed, the people who
have helped me to prepare for this debate have given me the words in
Welsh—if only my Welsh was that good. Moreover, I do not want to
test <em>Hansard</em>
                           <em>’s </em>ability by making it decipher what
I am saying. Suffice it to say that my hon. Friend and I have a shared
objective. Of course, we will meet our commitments to comply with
provisions in the Welsh Language Act 1993 as part of the
implementation of PIP. We will ensure that when required, assessments
will be carried out in accordance with the Welsh language scheme, which
is endorsed by the Welsh Language Board.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000236">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend has mentioned, the scheme is already in place with regard to the
work capability assessment, but there have been hiccups along the way,
and my hon. Friend has made it a priority to raise them with me. I
reiterate that I will happily take up any case in which the provider of
services—whether Atos or any other service provider—does
not provide a bilingual service to a Welsh speaker in
Wales.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000237">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff Central said the pivotal point was
that we should be monitoring the situation. I can reassure her that
that is exactly what we do. DWP monitors compliance with the Welsh
language scheme through a mystery-shopping programme that also monitors
customer complaints. A quarterly return is produced as evidence of
compliance, and it is forwarded to the Welsh language liaison point
within the DWP. Any evidence of non-compliance is taken extremely
seriously and immediately taken up with Atos.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Aberconwy implied, this is something that he and
I have been in correspondence about. I hope that he is reassured that
we take the matter seriously and that we are already taking action.
Atos is already taking action with regard to the work capability
assessment to ensure that it has sufficient bilingual staff to provide
just the sort of services that his constituents and other Welsh
speakers need. Whether they are old, young or of working age, they
should have access to such a service. With those reassurances, I hope
that my hon. Friend will withdraw his

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
is about who is able to provide evidence as part of the assessment for
PIP. Given that the assessment is not designed to be medical, there are
many conditions where a GP or a consultant—the people generally
approached to give evidence—are not the most appropriate ones to
highlight an individual’s day-to-day needs. GPs can explain a
claimant’s disability, but they are not best placed to explain
the effect of that disability on daily life.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000244">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I was
recently visited by a constituent whose 29-year-old son has
Down’s syndrome and severe learning disabilities. He has carers
looking after him day to day, who are in a much stronger position to
explain not only his more obvious needs—such as feeding,
changing and assistance at home—but the less obvious things,
such as how he copes with roads and traffic. Those things have a
serious impact on his ability to co-ordinate with other people, to
attend activities, to get out and about and so on. The doctor could not
provide that information as part of the assessment because he or she
would not know. The carers are much better placed to identify his
needs, particularly since PIP is concerned with how a person can be
independent and interact in daily life, rather than with the prognosis
of a condition.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000245">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would restrict those who could provide evidence to carers, social
workers and others in a formal role. It could be extended to take
evidence from people, such as informal carers, parents, partners and so
on, who see someone every day and know how their disability or
condition affects their everyday life. Will the Minister let us know
what type of assessment the Government envisage? What sort of evidence
will be taken as part of that assessment process? Would the Government
consider broadening the group of people giving evidence, to make the
assessment more personal and specific to the impact of a disability or
condition on daily life, rather than just a traditional medical
assessment?<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000246">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have heard a lot about how important it is to
regard the benefit as being not primarily about medical conditions, but
about the social model of disability developed recently. The amendment
is important in that context, as it draws out the importance of looking
beyond the obvious people to whom one looks for information.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000247">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Cardiff Central showed clearly the role of carers in the
social model, but other professionals are not always involved at this
level: occupational therapists, for example. They are often the people
called in to make recommendations if people need aids and adaptations,
and they often have a good grasp of the more practical aspects of daily
living with a disability. Occupational therapy has gone far beyond its
original image of teaching people to make baskets. It is about how to
manage daily life.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000248">&#160;</a>

                           </div>I have heard from constituents is that somewhere in the process the
original intentions were not carried out. There are issues around what
information is given and what is available for the decision maker,
beyond the relatively brief snapshot tests by independent assessors,
that can give a rounded picture and enable a good decision to be made.
Many people who have had difficulties with the work capability
assessment have brought that up in

taken. Admittedly, that experience came at the end of last
year—I hope that things have changed now—but it shows why
it is perhaps important to bring this matter out right from the start,
so that, as we go down through the process, some of the same mistakes
are not made again. When a decision maker is making a decision, they
should have in front of them the best sorts of information from the
people who are best able to provide
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000250">&#160;</a>

her experience, she will obviously have had cases where that has
happened. For many GPs, their contact with an individual may be
relatively limited. Going to a GP, even with an ongoing condition, is
about being ill. It is not necessarily about having the kind of regular
contact that shows what someone’s life is really like and what
difficulties they are actually encountering. That is not in any way a
criticism of the GP, but that is the kind of contact that they are
likely to have. They will not necessarily see someone in their own home
or see how they get to work or how they undertake employment,
volunteering or whatever it is that the individual wants to do. There
is no doubt that a GP will have had little contact with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000252">&#160;</a>

narrow test. I understand that the Minister feels that people are
getting unnecessarily concerned, but many of the fears that people have

to the hon. Ladies who have contributed to this part of the debate and
say up front that we do not want to be prescriptive about from whom
supporting information will be sought. When it comes to the PIP
assessment process, we recognise the importance of getting evidence
from the individual disabled person themselves. As I said from the
outset, disabled people are those who know the most about their own
conditions. We will also, however, be working with them to identify

professionals and those who support them on a regular basis, which may
mean a GP or another individual. It is important that we are able to
tailor that to the individual to ensure that we get the best possible
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000254">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
can reassure hon. Members that we recognise the fundamental role of
evidence gathering, and we want to gather the best and most appropriate
evidence and do it early in the claim to ensure that assessments are as
informed as possible. The evidence-gathering process will build upon
our experience of DLA, where we have found that relevant evidence and
information can be gained from a wide range of sources, including GPs,
consultants, social workers, community psychiatric nurses, occupational
therapists—the list goes
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000255">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are also seeking to learn from the experience of the work capability
assessment, including Professor Harrington’s review, which
highlights the importance of seeking advice from the claimant’s
chosen health care adviser and from an appropriate health care
professional who best knows the claimant’s impairment. We are
still considering which people are best placed to provide such
information, but we are designing an assessment that will treat people
as individuals, so we do not want to be prescriptive about from whom,
as I said up front, supporting evidence is sought. We believe that that
could hinder the flexibility of the assessment process in responding to
an individual’s circumstances. As we develop the detail of the
operational processes, we will want to work with disabled people and
their organisations to ensure that our approach to evidence gathering
is appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000256">&#160;</a>

(2).’.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would establish the right for somebody to take an advocate
into the assessment with them. Many people with disabilities rely
heavily on support, not only from parents, partners, or carers in an
informal 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 802<a class="bkMark" name="Column802">&#160;</a>
                           </div>way, but from formal advocates, such as welfare rights advisers, and so
on. That is particularly important during the assessment process, and
especially for people with communications needs or disabilities, as we
discussed earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, whether somebody can take an advocate into the assessment
depends on the adviser’s discretion, and practice varies hugely
across the UK. In some places, advocates are allowed to participate in
the assessment itself. In certain areas, advocates are allowed to come
into the room to sit and support in silence, but they are not allowed
to say anything, while in others, nobody is allowed into the room at
all. We clearly do not want to assess the advocate rather than the
claimant. However, if we are trying to get the most accurate picture of
somebody’s needs, and want to make a very clear assessment,
putting that person at ease and having someone to interpret as
necessary will mean that a better decision is made at the end of the
process. Given the existing differentials across the country, leaving
it to the discretion of the assessor does not work, so the amendment
would clarify that everybody is entitled to have an advocate with them,
if they so wish.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A number of
cases have been raised about the lack of awareness by Atos doctors
about some conditions, and advocates being present in assessments could
help in those instances. For example, people with some forms of autism
can often be very eager to please, so they say what they think the
doctor wants to hear, rather than the bare truth about their condition.
If a doctor or assessor is not aware of that, has not had the
appropriate training, or does not know how to interpret what they are
being told, the outcome of that assessment could be very unfair. Others
with mental health conditions, and particularly those with anxiety
disorders, might need support to be able to cope with the assessment
itself. Some people with learning disabilities may need somebody to be
able to explain the questions—in effect, the questions are
translated into a way that the individual can understand, so that they
can respond and give the information that is being asked for. That is
particularly necessary, again, if the doctor does not have the
appropriate training to deal with somebody who has that
condition.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would make it clear that everybody can have an advocate in the
assessment, and that the advocate can participate if it is appropriate,
or if the claimant wants them to be able to do so. That would hopefully
lead to better decisions, and it might reduce the number of appeals,
thereby saving resources, too. The proposal would, all in all, make the
process run more smoothly, and it would help people with a wide range
of different disabilities feel that their assessment was fair, and that
they had the best opportunity to put their case
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000264">&#160;</a>

making such significant points. She has a clear grasp of the assessment
process. Highlighting the role of the advocate is important in
principle, and it means much to those who make use of it. Inconsistency
of practice throughout the country should be addressed centrally, and
the amendment is strong on that aspect. It goes some way to addressing
concerns that I have tried to articulate about the process as it is
currently experienced. One of the most striking aspects, as I have
mentioned before, is to do with families that have experience of
autism, either directly or through caring for someone else with autism;
it is their experience of officialdom that people have an enormous
struggle with, and the amendment would have a significant effect in

circumstances but, most important, it will allow the individual to put
across his or her views of the impact of their health condition. That

                           </div>will ensure that the advice provided by the trained independent assessor
to the Department reflects a full understanding of the
individual’s circumstances. If an individual wishes a suitable
person to attend the face-to-face assessment—a relation, a
friend or possibly a professional who supports them—we will of
course allow it. Such people may help them not only to articulate the
impact of their health condition or impairment but to remove any
personal anxiety that they may feel by taking part in the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000269">&#160;</a>

Ladies who spoke to the amendment set out very well some of the
concerns that we all have about an individual’s ability to put
across an accurate reflection of their circumstances. Certainly there
will be many instances when additional support from someone who knows
the individual well and who knows the impact of their condition will be
important. The person offering that support will have an important role
in ensuring that the assessment process is both accurate and
fair.<a class="bkMark" name="11051069000270">&#160;</a>

circumstances vary, however, so we shall resist the urge to be too
prescriptive in identifying who might attend the face-to-face
consultation alongside the individual. We want to be flexible enough to
respond to the varied lives of our customers and disabled people, and
allow individuals to be able to choose who they believe would be more
appropriate to accompany them to a face-to-face consultation. However,
although we are absolutely supportive of the idea of another person
attending an assessment, the hon. Member for Cardiff Central and I will
have to agree to disagree about whether someone can attend in place of
