<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No.  40, page 19, line 43, at end insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and have regard to the views of'.  <P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  the following amendments: No. 262, in page 20, line 13,  after `considers', insert `, after consulting the Assembly,'.  
<P>
No. 263, in page 20, line 15, after `out', insert `any  further'.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I welcome you particularly warmly to the  chair, Mr. Benton. I also welcome the clause. We believe  that putting the duty to consult into the Bill is a  progressive move following on from the consultation  paper "In touch with the people"	. It is a welcome  development in the Government's thinking.  
<P>
Amendment No. 40 tries to specify a little more about  the nature of the consultation by imposing a duty on the  mayor when he or she consults to have regard to the views  of the people consulted. There are many forms of  consultation. There is consultation which amounts to little  more than informing people and consultation at the other  extreme which involves far more in-depth discussion,  submissions and hearings. If there is to be a duty to  consult, it must be seen as a real duty. The consultation  process must not be brought into discredit by being  cursory and a mere formality, with mayors and local  governments simply going through the motions.  
<P>
When she was Prime Minister, Baroness Thatcher used  to complain that she was referred to as the great little  dictator. She said that that was ridiculous as she always  consulted. I am sure hon. Members will remember the  type of consultation that she engaged in and the notice  she took of it. If we do not strengthen the clause, a future  mayor could take that approach. Baroness Thatcher used  to say, "I don't mind how much my Ministers talk as long  as they do what I say."	 Such an approach would be  possible if we left the duty to consult as it stands. The  amendment will strengthen the duty and thereby  strengthen the authority of the mayor and the assembly.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be extremely brief and will not try  your patience, Mr. Benton. I rise in defence of my noble  Friend, Lady Thatcher, in whose Government I served. It  is a habit of Liberal Democrats to suggest that she treated  the House of Commons as a rubber stamp. In sharp  contrast to some recent Prime Ministers, there was  nothing she enjoyed more than coming to the House of  Commons and having a row.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I do not necessarily disagree with the right  hon. Gentleman. The problem was that she never listened  to the Opposition.     
<P>
Amendments Nos. 262 and 263 seek to ensure that the  mayor has to consult the assembly if he or she makes  a change to the strategy. The current wording is rather  subjective and leads to far too much mayoral discretion.  Let us imagine what the contents of a particular strategy  would involve. They would involve priorities for a  particular policy, a time scale and funding. The mayor  may want to suggest that changing a priority or a time  scale will not materially alter the strategy for example,  introducing a project in the month before a by-election  but members of the assembly may have a different  viewpoint. They may think that it was a material change,  even though it was merely a matter of one month. If there  are to be changes, the assembly should be consulted.  
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept our  constructive amendments.  
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman gave yet  another revealing insight into the basis of the Liberal  Democrats' political philosophy. For him, apparently,  consulting can be as slight as informing. The courts accept  that implicit in any requirement to consult people is the  requirement to provide them with adequate information  about what is being proposed and to have regard to the  views of those consulted.  
<P>
The amendments are another attempt by the Liberal  Democrats to undermine the will of the people. The  people of London will elect a mayor, the mayor will be  the executive authority and the assembly will scrutinise.  As virtually every other amendment tabled by the Liberal  Democrats would do, this amendment would transfer  power from the mayor from the people of London to  the assembly.  
<P>
The hon. Gentleman neglected to read what is in the  Bill. Subsection (4) states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In any case where the Mayor proposes to revise any of the  strategies mentioned in section 33(1)"	   
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
he will have to consult all those people listed in clause  34(1) in preparing a strategy. The amendments are  unnecessary and I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw  them.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister's reply suggests that the  assembly lacks a democratic mandate. She suggests that  because Liberal Democrats want to give it some power in  these processes, we want to make it some sort of quango.  That is not so; in many ways the assembly will be more  representative of Londoners than the mayor.  
<P>
The Minister said that as the law currently understands  it, the process of consultation should have regard to the  people being consulted, and that is the case. That is why  we want the amendment to be included in the Bill. We  hope that the Government will think about our proposal,  but we will not now press the amendment to a Division.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The requirement for the mayor to consult  is in the Bill. I repeat: the hon. Gentleman and his hon.  Friends are attempting to remove power from the people  of London, 5 million of whom will have voiced their  opinion on the individual who will be returned to the  mayoralty, and to give that power to the assembly. The  amendments would allow the assembly to intervene in the  slightest of changes to any strategies. The Bill already  provides that, in respect of large revisions that would have  wide effects, the mayor has a duty not only to consult the  assembly but to consult all the bodies listed in the Bill. I  urge the hon. Gentleman to reconsider his position and to  withdraw these unnecessary amendments.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the  amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand  part of the Bill.  
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I have a short inquiry and a  suggestion. Will the Minister explain what are "the  functional bodies"	 referred to in clause 34(1)(b)? If they  are, as I believe, bodies such as the LDA or the London  biodiversity action group, I have a suggestion for her  which might prevent some confusion. While I agree that  specific bodies with whom the mayor will be required to  consult the assembly and London boroughs, for  example should be in the Bill, I question whether every  functional body should be consulted on any strategy on  which the mayor is consulting.  
<P>
To prevent confusion if I have not misunderstood the  point I suggest as a probing verbal amendment that after  the words "the functional bodies"	 should be added the  words  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"relevant to the particular strategy"	.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I was diverted from the Committee on  Tuesday to the Bill on the Floor of the House and thus  failed to table a probing amendment on a particular aspect  of clause 34, but I am content to raise the issue with the  Minister in this clause stand part debate. My hon. Friend  just referred to subsection (1) (b), but I want to refer to  subsection (1) (e). Did the Government ever contemplate  specifying business organisations under paragraph (e)? I  recognise that business organisations are embraced there.  However, a lengthy debate took place between the  business community and the Government in the run-up to  the Green and White Papers about how the views of  business would be represented, and it is unfortunate that  business has not been singled out specifically as one of  the bodies that should be consulted.  
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I respond first to the query put  by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet. The functional  bodies to which he referred include Transport for London,  the LDA, the Metropolitan police authority and the  London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. I can tell  the right hon. Member for Cities of London and  Westminster that we have already given a commitment to  return to the issue of which people should be specified in  the Bill as authorities to be consulted. The argument for  the business community to be included has been put  forward, but so has a case for voluntary organisations and  others. As I said, we have made a clear commitment to  return to the issue.  
<P>
Clause 34 places a duty on the mayor to carry out  consultations in preparing or revising strategies. The  mayor must consult the assembly and the functional  bodies, and subsequently each London borough council  and the common council, plus any other organisation or  individual whom the mayor considers it appropriate to  consult. Where the mayor proposes to revise any strategy,  and considers that the proposed revisions will not  materially alter the strategy in question, the mayor will  not be required to consult.     
<P>
The clause makes appropriate provision for full  consultation on the mayor's strategies. It quite rightly  requires the mayor to consult those bodies, such as the  boroughs and the functional bodies, who will be most  closely affected by the strategies. But there is scope for  more extensive consultation if the mayor considers that to  be appropriate. I urge the Committee to accept that the  clause as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`The Authority shall promptly make all public documents and  Minutes of the Authority freely available to anyone visiting a public  Internet site to be maintained by the Authority.'.     <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The amendment seeks to encourage the  authority to make documents more freely available to the  London boroughs. Its object is to encourage information  flows between the mayor and the boroughs. It is little  more than a common courtesy for them to do so. More  seriously, the obligation would guarantee extra  information and powers to the boroughs, and ensure that  the mayor could not keep them deliberately in the dark  throughout the implementation of his strategies.  
<P>
Amendments Nos. 171, 175 and 182 are amendments  of our time, because they would encourage the mayor to  use the internet more. They are intended as probing  amendments. The Government have already made it clear  that their target is for 25 per cent. of Government services  to be electronically successful by 2002. I imagine that  they would like local authorities to make similar progress.  They are probably aware that a number of local authorities  are already making progress in using the internet. No  doubt the Minister will take the opportunity to praise  Wandsworth council, which is a pioneer in that respect.  
<P>
The amendments would also encourage authorities to  make information available to the public on the internet.  Such extra dissemination of information would be to the  benefit and advantage of local government efficiency.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The Liberal Democrats support  the hon. Gentleman's amendments. We should also like  the Committee to consider and agree to amendment No.  41. Some people are not yet connected to the internet  there is 10 per cent. connectivity. Even though many  libraries are connected, many citizens are IT-phobic and  do not like receiving information via computers. To  require the mayor to send 32 copies to the principal library  in each London borough seems to be a fairly mild measure  but, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South argued, all  of the amendments would help the dissemination of  information across the capital's population.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendments set out detailed  obligations relating to arrangements for publicising the  GLA's work, in particular its strategies and the annual  report. Curiously, support for the amendments comes  from hon. Members who criticised the Government this  afternoon for being unduly prescriptive. I recall references  made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and  Bermondsey, who, alas, is no longer in his place. He was  voluble earlier this afternoon, but during other sittings his  presence in the later part of proceedings was less obvious,  which appears to be the pattern today. I recall him  accusing us of being a nanny state, by telling the mayor  how to do his or her job. I hope that the hon. Gentleman  will not mind my putting those words on record in this  context. The proposals supported by the Liberal  Democrats for dealing with publicity for the GLA's work  fall exactly into the category that he described.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Does the Minister agree that dissemination  of information is less about being prescriptive to the  mayor than about ensuring that the people of London can  hold the mayor to account? The amendments seek to  ensure that the GLA is owned by the capital's fabric and  is part of it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Had the hon. Gentleman bothered to  read the Bill more carefully, he would have seen that the  clause requires the mayor to take such steps as he  considers necessary to     
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"give adequate publicity to each strategy"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That will allow the mayor a sensible degree of flexibility.  He or she could place a copy of the strategy in each of  London's libraries or on an internet site if he or she  wished to do so. It would, however, be unduly  prescriptive to legislate on those points.  
<P>
I turn now to amendment No. 175. I agree that it is  vital for the mayor's monthly report to the assembly to be  publicly available. The Bill already provides for that.  Clause 48 makes the assembly subject to the access to  information rules that apply to local authorities  generally part VA of the Local Government Act 1972.  Section 100B of the 1972 Act requires copies of the  agenda and reports for meetings to be open for inspection  by the public at least three clear days before the meeting  or from the time when the item is added to the agenda.  Copies of the agenda and reports are also to be made  available to representatives of newspapers who request  that they be sent them by post. The mayor will send his  report to the assembly no later than three days before the  monthly meeting. The provisions in clause 48 mean that  the report will immediately be made available for public  inspection.  
<P>
I do not agree that the GLA should be under additional  statutory duties to send copies of the mayor's monthly  report to the boroughs or to post it on an internet site,  which the authority would be obliged to maintain. the  important point is that the Bill guarantees that the mayor's  monthly report will be publicly available. The Mayor or  the assembly may choose to send copies of it to the  boroughs and to post it on an internet site. Local  authorities generally are not subject to such prescriptive  duties, and there is no case for applying them to the GLA.  
<P>
I appreciate the sentiments behind new clause 12,  which would require the authority to maintain a public  internet site free of charge and to post its most important  literature on it. The matter is, however, surely best left to  the authority to decide; it is not a point on which we  should legislate in the Bill. I ask the hon. Gentleman to  withdraw his amendment.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I would not say that the Minister has  given a wholly satisfactory answer. Nevertheless, it is not  worth pushing the matter to a Division. I beg to ask leave  to withdraw the amendment.  
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.     
<P>
Amendment made: No. 220, in page 20, line 19, leave  out `such strategy' and insert

<P>
Clause 35, as amended, ordered to stand part of the  Bill.  
<H4><center>Clause 36 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Directions by the Secretary of State </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the  Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The clause should not stand part of  the Bill without us at least making one observation. Yet  again, the Government are granting the Secretary of State  powers of direction. They seem reasonable on the face of  it. No one least of all the Government, who are keen to  ensure that the mayor and his policies accord with their  objectives and policies would want him to fall behind in  promulgating the strategies that are listed in clause 33.  Nevertheless, it is surely primarily for the assembly to  bring the mayor to book and to ensure that he is kept up  to the mark and that there is no dereliction of duty on his  or the authority's part in implementing the strategies that  are listed in clause 33(1).  
<P>
There is a problem with the wide and sweeping power  in clause 36: who will inform the Government if the  mayor is not taking the necessary steps? Who will be the  whistleblower within the authority who advises the  Secretary of State about the progress of the authority's  business as it relates to the strategies? Will the Secretary  of State's nark or his mole be in the authority? Will the  Government office for London have a supervisory role in  such matters?  
<P>
It is perfectly reasonable for the authority, under the  mayor's leadership, to give the priority that it thinks is  appropriate to the strategies that have been listed. That  judgment may conflict with that of the Secretary of State.  He might be keen for biodiversity to be priority number  one. However, in accordance with the wishes of the  electors of London, as transmitted to the mayoralty  through the assembly, the authority might want to give  priority to putting right the London underground. There  are many such potential conflicts of priority. We see now  that the Government will decide the appropriate priority  and at what speed the authority should promulgate its  strategies. That is not satisfactory. As with other  provisions throughout the Bill, it indicates that the  Government do not trust the elected assembly to do its  proper job. The clause is fundamentally undemocratic and  the people of London might as well know that. They must  understand from the outset what kind of authority the  Labour Government want to foist upon them.     
<P>
The Government could have chosen a more democratic  mechanism vested in the power of the assembly to ensure  that it laid down a proper timetable for the promulgation  of the strategies. Instead, they chose the route of diktat  and the exercise of their ministerial power. The fact that  they did that shows that they do not trust elected  representatives. They like to get their own way.  
<P>
Clause 36 is regrettable and unnecessary, which is why  it must be highlighted and emphasised. That is why I  sought this short stand part debate.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I associate my party with the  remarks of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. He  put his finger on it. The clause shows that the only person  who will truly be able to hold the mayor to account is the  Secretary of State.  
<P>
The clause also reveals that the Government are  concerned about whether the mayor will actually do his  or her job. Previously, Committee members were told  how keen anyone who became mayor of London would  be to turn up at meetings to defend his or her policies.  Indeed, when we tabled an amendment that would require  the mayor to attend every third meeting we were told that  it was ridiculous and that we were living in cloud cuckoo  land: of course the mayor would attend.  
<P>
Now the Government tell us that the mayor might not  even build his own strategies. Although the mayor will  apparently want to show the people of London what a  tremendous politician he or she is, we are told that he or  she might not want to have a transport strategy or a spatial  development strategy, and that the Secretary of State will  need a reserve power to fill the gap. There is a clear  inconsistency in the Government's thinking. I therefore  hope that the Committee will reject the clause.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Clearly, the clause has been included  because of the Government's fear that the hon. Member  for Brent, East may be the first mayor of London. It is an  intrusive and utterly dominating provision which gives  little flexibility to the mayor to conduct policy and prepare  strategy as he wishes. The Secretary of State could even  be wrong; the clause prescribes that he may issue a  direction merely if he  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"considers that the Mayor is not taking such steps"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
We could not possibly support such a clause and we will  therefore vote against it.  
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I am sure that it will come as  something of a surprise to hon. Members who have  spoken when I say that I not only understand what they  said; I agree with it. I must, however, add a caveat:  although I understand and agree with the arguments, they  are not relevant to the clause.     
<P>
Of course it would be intolerable if the Secretary of  State were able to instruct the mayor to review or revise  his or her strategies at the drop of a hat. I shall therefore  attempt to reassure hon. Members that their opposition to  the clause is based on a misunderstanding of both its  intent and its effect.  
<P>
The hon. Members who spoke appear to believe that  the clause gives the Secretary of State the power to order  the mayor to review and publish new strategies whenever  he or she wishes. At this point I should bring to the  Committee's attention clause 64. It applies section 230 of  the Local Government Act 1972 to the GLA, under which  the Secretary of State may request information relating to  the exercise of its functions. Opposition Members fear  that the clause gives power to the Secretary of State to  order the mayor to review and publish new strategies. In  fact, the clause is intended only as a transitional provision  to enable the Secretary of State to issue a direction to the  mayor to prepare and publish the first of each of the  strategies within a given period. The provision applies  only if it appears that steps that are necessary to prepare  the strategy in question are not being taken.  
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The hon. Lady is ever courteous.  However, she appeared to imply that we are criticising the  clause because it gives the Secretary of State the power  to direct if the mayor were failing to introduce new  strategies. Our reservations have nothing to do with new  strategies. We discerned, and explained clearly, that our  objection lies in the Government's issuing of a direction  if the mayor did not issue a strategy  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"within such period as the direction shall specify."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
The force of the direction is such that the mayor would  have to comply with it. It is an edict which gives the  mayor no flexibility in priorities or timing.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am truly astonished by the hon.  Gentleman's sense of outrage. Earlier in the debate he  argued that it was possible that the necessity to review  would mean that nothing would ever be achieved: the  mayor would be able to spend all his or her time merely  reviewing rather than getting on with the business of  delivering strategies to the people of London.  
<P>
I repeat: the powers, which apply to all local  authorities, already exist in section 230 of the Local  Government Act 1972. Clause 64 is relevant in that the  Secretary of State will have the power to ensure that local  authorities fulfil their functions. Surely the hon.  Gentleman is not arguing that the people of London must  wait for a considerable time before the mayor actually  engages not in completed strategies but in the steps that  are necessary to create those strategies.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> This is a worthwhile debate and I  welcome hon. Members' contributions. However, surely  it is the job of the assembly to ensure that policies are  brought forward on the appropriate time scale and  according to the priorities of London's electors. The point  is not what the Secretary of State desires, but what the  electors of London judge to be in their best interests.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am, again, somewhat amazed by the hon.  Gentleman's contribution. He seems to have adopted the  Liberal Democrats' view that power should lie primarily  with the assembly. Perhaps Conservative Members are to  join the Liberal Democrats in that essentially insulting  approach, which ignores the direct will of the people of  London. Londoners have accepted the structure of the  authority and are clear that executive power rests with the  office of mayor rather than with the assembly.  
<P>
I understand that confusion may perhaps have arisen  because of the way in which the Bill refer to the drafting  of strategies. Only the first of the strategies is to be  prepared and published. All subsequent strategies,  including those that are produced under future mayors, are  classed as revisions of the first strategy to which clause  36 does not apply. The clause will therefore cease to have  any effect in respect of a strategy after the first strategy  has been published.     
<P>
We do not believe that the mayor will delay in starting  work on drafting his or her strategies, as many mayoral  powers require relevant strategies to be in place.  Nevertheless, because their existence is so vital to the new  system of government that we are creating, it would be  wrong not to include a safeguard enabling a nudge not a  diktat to the first mayor if it seems that progress is not  being made on one or more of the strategies. The clause is  eminently sensible. As a transitional provision, it will  expire within a few years of the first mayor taking office.  Therefore, I urge Opposition Members to reconsider their  opposition to the clause and agree that it stand part of the  Bill.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 241.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The amendments tabled by Liberal  Democrat Members seek to improve the contents of the  monthly report to ensure that there is a defence for the  assembly, and that it is able to exercise full  accountability effectively.  
<P>
Amendment No. 264 would ensure that the mayor  cannot suddenly redefine what is meant by significant  decisions by using a discretion. The mayor might want to  omit from the report decisions that he or she did not want  known. It is important for the assembly to be able to  provide more effective scrutiny. After all, we are talking  not about small administrative decisions, but about quite  large ones, and the assembly should be informed about  them.  
<P>
Amendment No. 265 refers to decisions that the mayor  expects to make over the forthcoming months on issues  under consideration. It is sensible that the assembly is told  about those, so that there are no surprises when the final  decisions are made known. The assembly could be  involved in those decisions beforehand, and could give  the mayor guidance.  
<P>
Under amendment No. 266, the mayor would have an  obligation to tell the assembly what meetings he or she  was attending, as is the usual process in Parliament. The  mayor's very public high-profile role means that it is  important that the assembly is told about such meetings.     
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 267 deals with the reaction of  the mayor to the petitions that he or she receives. It is  clearly important that those petitions are not merely  forgotten about, but receive the publicity that they  deserve, given that citizens of the capital will have made  the effort to collect them and hand them to the mayor.  This group of amendments will strengthen the  accountability provided for in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I remind the hon. Member for  Kingston and Surbiton of the remarks that I made in  response to the previous group of amendments, when I  referred to the Liberal Democrats' tendency to be unduly  prescriptive about the activities of the mayor, having  earlier denounced the Government for precisely the same  thing. I am delighted that the hon. Member for Southwark,  North and Bermondsey is now back in his seat, so that he  can hear my comments.  
<P>
Amendments Nos. 264 to 267, tabled by the Liberal  Democrats, deal with what the mayor is required to  include in his monthly report to the assembly.  Amendment No. 264 would require him to include details  of all decisions, however trivial not just those that  mayor considered to be significant. Amendment No. 265  would require the inclusion of details of decisions that the  mayor expected to take in the next month. Amendment  No. 266 would require the mayor to include a list of  significant meetings that he had held, and those that he  proposed to hold in the next month. Amendment No. 267  would require the inclusion of details of actions that the  mayor had taken in response to petitions that he had  received.  
<P>
My problem with the first of those amendments is that  requiring the mayor to include in his report to the  assembly details of all decisions that he had taken during  a month would simply not be practicable for the mayor,  nor for the assembly. Despite his important executive  responsibilities, some of the mayor's decisions will have  little bearing on his performance or his statutory  functions, and will be of little interest to the assembly.  The assembly will want to focus on the important issues,  not on a mass of minor, insignificant decisions.  
<P>
Is it seriously being suggested that if the mayor chooses  to change the brand of tea served to visitors to his offices,  he should have to report that to the assembly? That is the  kind of trivial nonsense that we expect from the Liberal  Democrats. Requiring the mayor to include all decisions  would simply dilute the value of his report. I can see little  value in requiring the mayor to include in his monthly  report details of the decisions that he expects to take in  the next month. If members of the assembly want to know  what issues are likely to arise, they can simply ask the  mayor, and he will be required to answer.  
<P>
Amendment No. 265 would make the Bill more  prescriptive and would not extend the assembly's right to  know in any way. Similarly, requiring the mayor to  include in his report a list of meetings that he had held and  planned to hold and details of actions taken in response to  petitions would not add anything of substance to the Bill's  provisions. The assembly will in any case be able to  obtain that information by questioning the mayor. If the  mayor considers that he has taken a significant decision  by arranging or agreeing to a meeting, or by responding  to a petition, his report will cover it in any case.     
<P>
Amendment No. 264 is impractical, and amendments  Nos. 265, 266 and 267 are unnecessary.  
<P>
Government amendment No. 241 is needed to bring the  wording of clause 37 into line with that of clause 50,  which enables the assembly to submit proposals to the  mayor. Taken together, clauses 37 and 50 mean that the  mayor would have to respond in the monthly report to the  assembly's proposal. I ask the hon. Gentleman to  withdraw his amendment, and I commend Government  amendment No. 241 to the Committee.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke rose   </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Karen Buck  (Regent's Park and Kensington,  North):</B> Oh, no.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I do not know who said "Oh no"	, but I  have a simple question to ask the Minister. I think that the  remark came from a member on the Government benches.  
<P>
Government amendment No. 241, which the Minister  has just explained, refers to actions of the mayor under  the clause. I understand why he proposes to adjust the  language to suit clause 50. However, I want to probe  subsection (4), which in lines 9 to 11 on page 21, the  wording of which is repeated in clause 51, absolves the  mayor from disclosing advice given to him by certain  persons appointed under a subsequent clause I think that  it is clause 56. That seems an unusual provision given  the normal conduct of local government where advice is  available to all members of an authority. Although we  shall debate that matter when we deal with clause 51, I  should be interested to hear the Minister's explanation  given the fact that the provision seems to be a  constitutional novelty.  
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is acute in  his observation. He is right: the provision is unusual  compared with traditional local government models; it  involves the creation of a distinct executive a mayor  acting as the executive with the assembly acting as the  scrutinising body. Therefore, the Whitehall model,  whereby advisers provide Ministers with advice in the  knowledge that it is confidential and background papers  are made available, is more apposite to the authority's  structure.  
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman will have noticed that  clause 56 contains a provision for the mayor to appoint  up to two political advisers and a further 10 people as  advisers specifically within the mayor's office. That  structure, which is more closely aligned to the Whitehall  model than the traditional local government model, makes  it necessary to exempt those individuals from the rules on  the disclosure of information that would otherwise apply.  I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will understand the  reason for that.     
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor (Solihull):</B> While we are pursuing  analogies, would not the Minister agree that the  appointment of two special advisers and 10 others to an  inner office is much more like the European model? Is it  not the mayor's cabinet?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> There are parallels with Europe  because the traditions of executive mayors are widely  followed in European countries, as they are in America.  The hon. Gentleman has a wide interest in such matters,  so I am sure that he has visited European or American  mayoral offices that have similar arrangements but  probably rather more people than in the private office  the mayor's cabinet that we are providing for in this  streamlined authority for London. The principle is similar  to that which prevails in Europe and America. I hope that  that answers the hon. Gentleman's questions and that it  deals with the difficulty about Government amendment  No. 241.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be extremely brief. I am grateful  to you, Mr. Benton, for allowing me to ask the Minister  the question that I asked, which might have been on the  borderline of being appropriate to Government  amendment No. 241. I am also grateful to the Minister for  his reply, which I understood. I had suspected that he  would give that answer.  
<P>
Given the fact that the proposal is a constitutional  novelty, I hope that he will regard this as a paving  discussion for the matters that we shall debate both on  clause 51, where the provisions are repeated, and, as he  says, on clause 56. If we are to make great constitutional  innovations, we should not do so on the nod.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I agree.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The Minister accuses us of being  over-prescriptive in this group of amendments and  suggests that we are being inconsistent with what we have  said in earlier debates. Nothing could be further from the  truth. There is a clear difference between issues of  accountability and issues of policy. Clearly we do not  want to prescribe which policies the mayor and the  assembly should have for the capital; we do not want to  prevent them from dealing with matters that we cannot  foresee.  
<P>
The Government and we, as legislators, should not tell  the assembly and the mayor which strategies they should  develop. However, it is important that we are prescriptive  in matters of accountability because, at the moment, the  assembly is a weak institution. It must have the powers to  hold the mayor to account to defend the assembly from  those mayors who will take too much power to  themselves. That is the difference, and it is why the  amendments are prescriptive.  
<P>
The Minister's remark about amendment No. 264 was  unusual for him; it was to use the words of the hon.  Member for Harrow, East almost fatuous. We are not  saying that every decision such as an order for  paper-clips should be reported to the assembly; we are  saying that "significant"	 is very subjective.  
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> No. The hon. Gentleman should sit down.  
<P>
However, a decision of the mayor to refurbish his  office, perhaps to line it with expensive wallpaper, should  be reported. My instinct is that a mayor would say that  such a decision was not significant and would not give it  air time in the assembly. The amendment therefore deals  with an important matter and I am surprised that the  Minister treated it in such a cavalier manner.  
<P>
Although we are not convinced by the Minister's reply,  we shall not press the amendment to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Under the Bill, the mayor will attend  and issue a monthly report to assembly meetings;  however, assembly members may wish to raise issues  with the mayor between meetings. The amendment  provides a further channel to ensure the mayor's  accountability by which urgent matters can be raised in  short order, by following the parliamentary practice of  written and oral questions. As in the parliamentary  tradition, questions and answers would be a matter for  public record. We believe that that would be a welcome  development for the authorities.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I support my hon. Friend. It is right  and proper that oral questions should be put at a monthly  meeting; indeed, it is one of the most important aspects  of accountability for the assembly. However, the regular  opportunity to put written questions for information is a  normal function of any effective democratic body the  House of Commons, for example, is very familiar with  it and it is not good enough merely to put the answers  on the internet; there should be a proper official report  that can be disseminated throughout the London boroughs  to ensure the fullest possible interchange of information  between counsellors in boroughs, members of the  assembly and those who take an interest in the authority.  I therefore wholeheartedly welcome the sensible  amendments tabled by my hon. Friends on the Opposition  Front Bench and what is, in this instance, a reasonable  amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats and hope  that the Government will accept them.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Amendment No. 327 is, as the  hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said, in the spirit of  the Conservative amendments and is important because,  as has become apparent from our debate on previous  clauses, the mayor may not attend meetings for a long  period. It is therefore vital that he or she is forced to  answer written questions in the way that we have laid  down, following on from those set down in the  amendment of the hon. Member for Croydon, South.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Amendment No. 176 is intended to  place a duty on the mayor to answer any written question  from any assembly member about his or her statutory  responsibilities. It would also require the text of such  questions and the mayor's responses to be made available  on an internet site, which the authority would be obliged  to maintain. The new subsections containing these duties  are presumably supposed to be added at the end of line 8,  not line 9, as the amendment states but I shall not be  pedantic about that.  
<P>
Amendment No. 177 would allow the mayor not to  disclose advice from GLA staff in answering written  questions from assembly members as well as questions  put to him at the monthly assembly meeting. Amendment  No. 327 is intended to clarify that the assembly has a  statutory right to put written questions to the mayor for  him or her to answer.  
<P>
We intend that the mayor should be required to answer  written as well as oral questions put to him by assembly  members but believe that that should be done through the  mechanism of the monthly meeting. Similarly, if the  mayor cannot answer all the questions that assembly  members put to him at the monthly meeting, because of  insufficient time, we intend that he should send written  answers to assembly members whose questions were not  reached. We also intend that written answers to questions  put at the monthly meeting should be publicly available.  We shall consider the provisions of clause 37 extremely  carefully, and, if necessary, we may propose an  amendment to the Bill to clarify those intentions.  
<P>
I do not agree with two aspects of the provision that  the amendments would make. First, the amendments  propose an express duty on the mayor to answer written  questions put to him by assembly members other than at  the monthly meeting. I fully expect that the mayor will  write back if an assembly member writes to him asking  him a question. That is the normal courtesy of  correspondence. However, a statutory duty to answer  questions should rightly be reserved for the monthly  assembly meeting, which is the key forum in which the  assembly will hold the mayor to account.     
<P>
The arrangements for the assembly to question the  mayor are not identical to those for Members of  Parliament to question the Government. Unlike the  Government, the mayor is required to submit a report to  the assembly each month and can also be summoned by  the assembly. A duty to answer questions put at any time  would allow assembly members to swamp the mayor with  questions, preventing him or her from getting on with the  job, and would require the setting up of a mechanism  similar to the Table Office to ensure that questions were  orderly, which would involve substantial additional  expenditure.  
<P>
Secondly, I have already made clear why we do not  intend to prescribe in primary legislation particular ways  in which the mayor or the assembly should make  documents publicly available. I am sure that the GLA will  have a website on which it will post all its public  documents. However, it would be too prescriptive to  impose such a requirement by statute.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I follow the Minister's argument, but it  is not clear to me how a reply that is not on the record  can be given between the monthly meetings. He  mentioned the courtesy of correspondence, but in the  event of an urgent matter such as a tube strike, surely  some mechanism for prompt, public comment is  desirable?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We accept that, and that is when  correspondence would come into question, if a written  response were required. When dealing with a matter of  extreme urgency, the mayor is likely to make a public  statement and will be subject to all the usual questioning  of the press and such publicity.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Ah.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> However, if a member of the  assembly did not feel that sufficiently clear answers had  been given at the time, he or she would, rightly, be able  to write to the mayor requesting a written response in  reply to correspondence. That is different from a  procedure for formal written questions analogous to that  of the House of Commons. I hope that when the hon.  Gentleman reflects on the matter, he will realise that the  processes necessary to set up a procedure for formal  written questions would impose substantial additional  costs on the authority, which is not compatible with our  wish for a streamlined and value-for-money authority.  
<P>
I have already assured the Committee that we shall  further consider clause 37 and, if necessary, clarify the  provisions. This is an important part of the Bill, and we  want to ensure that the provisions for question time and  for written answers to questions that are not reached  during the monthly question session are clear. With that  assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Croyson,  South will withdraw the amendment.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I started with what I thought was  effectively a probing amendment, only to find a huge  lacuna of information. In the event of an urgent, important  matter, such as a tube strike, or an aeroplane crash  somewhere in the mayor's jurisdiction, I appreciate that  assembly members may write to the mayor, and that he  may write back, but the Minister gave the game away by  saying that the mayor could answer questions from the  press. However, that is not the point. Members of the  assembly want to ask the questions and to be given the  answers.     
<P>
The Minister said that that would create a  disproportionate cost, wherein lies the rub, I suspect. I  acknowledge that setting up a table office in a small,  streamlined, strategic authority would cost money, but to  go back to an argument that we have had before, that is  the price of democracy. Democracy is not the most  efficient form of government nor, is it the cheapest. It  must be paid for and, as such the Minister should  reconsider his view. If he cannot give me some more  encouragement, we shall have to press the amendment to  a Division.  
<P>
<H5>6.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We are introducing procedures that  will ensure that the mayor is regularly held to account by  the assembly. There is a requirement that he must report  monthly to be questioned, which is a very good  framework for accountability. Of course, there will be  moments of crisis between the monthly meetings. I  suggested that in the situation described by the hon.  Member for Croydon, South the mayor would probably  want to make a statement publicly, and he would the be  questioned by the press. If the assembly felt strongly  about the matter, it would have powers to summon the  mayor. Therefore, there is provision for the assembly to  seek information when the situation is serious. That is  different from the position of regularly requiring written  questions to be answered throughout the year, rather than  only when the assembly is sitting, as applies in the House  of Commons. There is no provision for long or even short  recesses and the GLA will meet monthly.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister is reconsidering.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am certainly not reconsidering.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone rose   </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall give way to my hon. Friend.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Is my hon. Friend seriously  suggesting that there should be a meeting in August?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The obligations are very clear. The  mayor must present a monthly report, which should be  presented each month of the year. The meeting may not  be a long one and not all members of the assembly may  choose to attend it, but we are providing for monthly  meetings, so there is a framework for regular  accountability.  
<P>
I believe that that is the assurance that the hon. Member  for Croydon, South seeks. There is an emergency  provision for summoning the mayor in extreme  circumstances between ordinary meetings, and there is  also the safeguard of the requirement for not only  correspondence but for casual meetings between the  mayor and members of the assembly. In a small,  streamlined authority, there will be many opportunities for  them to meet.

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> As a matter of illumination, if in August  someone such as the hon. Member for Brent, East, as  mayor, was in his holiday home in, say, Vancouver,  would he be able to send his report by internet and speak  to the world through a video link? Technically, will that  be allowed under the Bill?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The obligations are for the mayor to  present his report to the assembly, and he is expected to  attend the monthly meeting. However, as we know from  previous discussions, there is provision for the mayor to  be absent on occasion. The mayor may be in Vancouver  on business or pleasure, when that provision will be  invoked. We have in place appropriate provision for  ensuring accountability, and I hope that the hon. Member  for Croydon, South will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
Question accordingly negatived.  
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand  part of the Bill.  
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Government are to be thanked,  inasmuch as the Minister for London and Construction  said that he would look again at some of the provisions  in the clause. I think that everyone appreciates that. It  should be reiterated, however, that certain aspects of the  clause merit reconsideration.  
<P>
The first is the question of the banning or disclosure of  advice from advisers. Many of those advisers will, by the  very nature of their duties, have an executive function on  the authority. It is all very well to assume that the mayor  will be omniscient. We know that he will be omnipotent  within the strict parameters set by the Secretary of State,  but it seems that he is supposed also to be omniscient. On  many occasions, assembly members will much prefer to  be answered by the specialist with executive charge of  environmental, biodiversity or some other policy rather  than by the mayor himself. To preclude the possibility of  an adviser's advice being revealed could be potentially  confusing.  
<P>
Secondly, would it not be better for the authority to be  involved in and devise its own procedures, instead of  using such a highly prescriptive mechanism, particularly  with regard to questions? The Minister said that an  emergency meeting could be called in a crisis, and that  the mayor would be summoned to the assembly. No one  wishes the mayoralty to be burdened with a host of  unnecessary questions. Everyone comprehends that. But  the Minister acknowledges the possibility of there being  many questions that cannot be answered in the allotted  time, each of which will receive the Minister said will,  not might or should a written answer. Assembly  members may lean that, under the Bill, they can put  pressure on the mayor by asking hosts of oral questions  that can never be answered questions for which the  mayor must provide a written answer.  
<P>
If clause 37 is to be re-examined, I seek a mechanism  whereby the authority as a whole, both mayor and  assembly, can, as it is established, evolve procedures that  are mutually acceptable, that work, and which are  satisfactory to the electors of London.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I believe that the concerns expressed  by the hon Member for Ruislip-Northwood are misplaced.  Clause 37 makes effective provision for accountability by  the mayor. It requires a monthly written report and  attendance at monthly meetings. It makes provision for  members of the assembly to question the mayor, and for  the mayor to provide answers to their questions at the  monthly meetings and written replies to all questions that  are not answered orally because of lack of time.  
<P>
As I made clear, provision is made for the assembly to  summon the mayor between monthly meetings if there is  a state of emergency. Obviously, usual social contact will  be made between members of the Assembly and the  mayor in the Greater London authority building that we  are seeking to commission. There will be many  opportunities for accountability. That is essential to the  Bill, the framework of which is based on a division of  powers in which the mayor is the executive and the  assembly members are there to scrutinise, as well as to  play their other important roles, such as serving on the  police authority and other bodies.       
<P>
During their scrutiny role, the members of the assembly  will rightly be questioning not only the mayor, but  employees of the authority. We have distinguished the  position of a small group of employees, up to two political  advisers and up to 10 others who will be employed  specifically by the mayor within his cabinet or office.  They will be advisers to the mayor and it would not be  appropriate for that advice to be made public for reasons  that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood will fully  understand, given that the framework is based on the  Whitehall model. The mayor is accountable, but the  advisers should be able to advise him privately.  
<P>
The fact that advice given to the mayor should not be  available for wider circulation is appropriate. We shall be  distinguishing between background information that  should always be made available and specific advice to  the mayor that should be treated like advice to Ministers.  That would cover officials of the authority, other than just  the limited number who will work within the mayor's  private office. The principle of openness and  accountability will prevail, subject to those provisos that  I am sure the hon. Gentleman will understand, as they  are modelled closely on the procedures that apply to the  Government. I hope that I have assured him that the  clause is appropriate and that the motives behind it are  entirely benign. I hope also that he agrees that it should  stand part of the Bill.  
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Annual report by the Mayor </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 179, in  page 21, leave out lines 23 to 25 and at end insert   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) such information within the Authority's powers as the  assembly or any of the London Boroughs and Common Council,  prior to the end of the financial year to which the annual report  relates, have notified to the Mayor that they wish to be included in  the annual report.'.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  the following: Government amendments Nos. 242 and  243.  
<P>
Amendment No. 181, in page 21, line 27, after  `Assembly', insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and to each of the London Boroughs and Common Council'.     <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Clause 38 requires the mayor to include  in his annual report whatever information is requested of  him by the assembly. The amendment would limit the  information that can be requested to prevent the assembly  from asking for ridiculous and unrelated information and,  secondly and more importantly, it would ensure that  information can be requested by any member of the  assembly, not just the assembly as a whole. If the majority  of members of the assembly were of the same party as  the mayor, it would be a useful way of ensuring that the  opposition still obtained information from him.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman :</B> Order. I appeal to members of the  Committee to keep their voices down. It is difficult for  me to hear what is being said, so it must be even more  difficult for others in the Room. Please talk only if it is  necessary.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I draw the Committee's attention  to the profoundly philosophical intention of the  Government. Government amendment No. 243 is  wonderful; it states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"leave out `end' and insert `beginning'"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
Although I have studied the clause and I understand the  purpose behind the amendment, methinks that we should  be told whether such a provision will be at the bottom of  everything that the Government are seeking to do.  
<P>
<B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the  Home Department (Kate Hoey):</B> Amendment No. 179  is intended to allow not only the assembly but London  borough councils and the common council to require the  mayor to include information in his annual report.

On resuming   
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> Amendment No. 179, which was moved  by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, is intended to  allow not only the assembly but any of the London  borough councils or the common council to require the  mayor to include information in his or her annual report.  
<P>
The Government have tabled two amendments to  clarify the provisions relating to the assembly's powers.  We shall come to those later. Here I shall focus on why  it would not be appropriate to give London borough  councils and the common council the power which  amendment No. 179 is intended to confer on them.  
<P>
Firstly, unlike the assembly, the boroughs councils are  not part of the same authority as the mayor. Most of the  GLA's statutory responsibilities will be vested in the  mayor, and it is right that he or she should be responsible  for reporting on performance in an annual report. But the  assembly will have a key role in the budget process, will  carry out scrutinies into London issues and will make  proposals to the mayor. In those ways, among others, the  assembly will influence the mayor's activities.  
<P>
Secondly, unlike the assembly, it is not the job of the  borough councils to scrutinise the mayor's activities and  hold him or her to account on London's behalf.  
<P>
The Bill gives the assembly a substantive role in  deciding what the mayor's annual report should cover  because of the Assembly's unique relationship with the  mayor and role as his scrutineer. London borough  councils and the City Corporation are separate  independent authorities and there is no case for extending  this role to them.  
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 242 and 243 are needed  to correct two small but important points in the provisions  relating to the assembly's power to require the mayor to  include information in the mayor's annual report.  
<P>
Amendment No. 242 makes it clear that the assembly's  power relates to information of the sort specified by the  assembly. As currently drafted, as the hon. Member for  Southwark, North and Bermondsey noticed, the clause  suggests that the assembly would actually have to provide  the information itself. That is not the intention. If the  assembly wishes to publish a report of its own activities,  it already has the power to do so under the Bill.  
<P>
Amendment No. 243, as the hon. Gentleman  particularly asked, provides that the assembly should be  able to require that this information is included in the  annual report only if it notifies the mayor before the  beginning of the year that the report is to cover. As  drafted, the Bill empowers the assembly to require the  Mayor to include in the annual report information of  which it has notified him or her before the end of the  financial year to which the annual report relates.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister's argument is  entirely reasonable, which is why we are so happy to  accept it.  
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> Those are our two amendments. We are  coming to those of the hon. Member for Croydon, South.  
<P>
As I have made clear, the intention is that the assembly  should have a substantive role in deciding what the annual  report should cover. That ability lends weight to the  assembly's scrutiny role and is one of the many means by  which the assembly will hold the mayor to account for  its performance.  
<P>
It would be completely impractical for the assembly to  be able to demand on 30 March that the annual report  should include specific information covering the entire  year. Amendment No. 181 is intended to ensure that the  mayor sends a copy of his annual report to each London  borough council and the common council. I do not agree  that the mayor should be under that additional statutory  duty to send his annual report to the borough councils.  
<P>
The Bill guarantees that the report will be published. It  will be in the public domain. That is the important point.  The mayor may well choose to send it to those councils  but there is no case for requiring him to do so in primary  legislation any more than there would be to require  councils to send their reports many of them produce  annual reports to the mayor. I am sure that on reflection,  the hon. Gentleman will agree that the amendment is not  necessary and I ask him to withdraw it.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am persuaded to do so. I beg to ask  leave to withdraw the amendment.  
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.  
<P>
Amendments made: No. 242 page 21, line 23, leave out  `such information' and insert  
<P>
  
<P>
`information of such descriptions'.  
<P>
No. 243, page 21, line 23, leave out `end' and insert  `beginning'. [Ms Hoey.]  
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand  part of the Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We support the idea of an annual  report by the mayor, which should be published as soon  as practicable after the end of each financial year. We also  support the idea that it should be followed by a debate,  which we shall discuss in the following clause.  
<P>
Clause 38(2)(b) states, properly, that the annual report  shall include a summary of information which relates to  the authority's performance during the year. Will that be  produced partially by the mayor or will the information  be provided independently? That is a serious question  about the credibility of that information.  
<P>
Last year, to their credit, the Government produced an  annual report for the first time. Its only fundamental  weakness is that it was a propaganda document, not an  independently prepared report. I welcome the fact that  there will be an annual report on what Governments do.  If the mayor is to have an annual report, it should be a  credible document; it will be good use of Londoners'  money if the achievements stated in the report have been  independently tested. It will not be such a good use of  Londoners' money or such a credible document it will  be open to propagandising if it is not verified; if, for  example, the major produces the report in house and  simply includes or omits, within the discretion allowed by  the Bill, what she or he chooses.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Apart from the scurrilous remarks of  the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey  about the Government's annual report, he makes a fair  point about the need for the information in the report to  be both objective and informative.  
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman knows, clause 38 provides for  the mayor to prepare the report, so it is the mayor's  responsibility. But the mayor will depend on the  professional staff of the authority, who will be appointed  on merit. They may be civil servants or local government  officers who will have a strong focus on probity and the  provision of accurate information. The London research  centre, which will become part of the new authority under  the arrangements introduced by the Government, will be  a highly professional body able to provide information of  a high standard. Of course, the report will be subject to  outside scrutiny and analysis, and any failings would  reflect badly both on the mayor and on the authority. I am  confident that the report will be a fair, impartial and  accurate statement of the authority's performance. It is in  everyone's interest that it should be. With that assurance,  I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the clause  should stand part of the Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We do not intend to vote against the  clause because, as I said, we agree that there should be a  report. I hear what the Minister said, but the Government  should reflect on our view that any statistical service to  Government should be independent. It is important that  annual reports on local and London Government should  be independently audited. What the Minister says is  helpful but not conclusive. There could still be high  degree of personal propaganda in the material produced  and I hope that in time, possibly in a range of measures  dealing with local and other government, the Government  will decide that, at some stage, independently audited  reports will be needed. Companies do not carry out their  own audits and we, too, should ensure that the public are  given truly independent information. I hope that the  Government will return to the issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No.  270, in page 21, line 34, after `date', insert `and at a  place'.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following  amendments:  
<P>
Government amendment No. 298.  
<P>
No. 45 in page 21, line 42, after `date', insert `and  place'.  
<P>
Government amendment No. 299.  
<P>
No. 46, in clause 40, page 22, line 8, after `date', insert  `and place'.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Briefly, I stand to celebrate the  amendments. On 2 February, the Government tabled  amendments that were similar to ours. Clearly, they  accepted our arguments before we had even presented  them. That is a first in this Committee, and it deserves a  short celebratory speech.  
<P>
The location of the state of London debate could be  exciting if it changes every year. There are many venues  in the capital, from the National theatre and Wembley  stadium to Kingsmeadow stadium in my constituency.  The latter is a fabulous venue, which a future mayor might  choose to use. I am sure that every member of the  Committee could suggest an ideal location.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> On a point of order, Mr Benton.  I wonder whether my hon. Friend has already issued the  press release about holding the people's question time in  his constituency.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am sure that you, Mr Benton, would not  expect me even to conceive of issuing a press release  before making a speech in the House of Commons.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Without wishing to spoil the hon.  Gentleman's moment of glory or detract from his great  influence on the Government, I must say that, when we  heard about the rapprochement earlier, we felt that, in the  words of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, the  appropriate adage was "timeo Danaos et dona ferentis."	  It is a shame that we did not observe it on this occasion.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Although I studied Latin to O-level  standard, I did not understand that. My hon. Friend the  Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey tells me  that it means that one should beware of people bringing  gifts. However, I shall not detain the Committee longer. I  hope that the Government continue in this new vein.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Amendment No. 270 would place an  explicit duty on the mayor to decide on a venue for the  state of London debate. I am happy to accept that the  mayor should have that duty, but amendment No. 270 is  technically defective. Government amendment No. 298  has the same effect, and has been tabled to replace  amendment No. 270. Government amendment No. 299  would place an explicit duty on the mayor to decide on a  venue for people's question time.  
<P>
Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 would explicitly require  the mayor to publicise the place where the state of London  debate and people's question time were to be held. I think  it extremely unlikely that the mayor would fail to do that  under the provisions of the Bill. Similarly, I think it  extremely unlikely that the mayor would fail to decide on  and specify a time for those events, although he is not  specifically required to do so. The state of London debate  and people's question time will be high-profile events and  key occasions in the future London calendar.  
<P>
I am nevertheless content to accept amendments Nos.  45 and 46, to make the duty to publicise these important  events more specific. Government amendments Nos. 298  and 299 are needed to make amendments Nos. 45 and 46  work as intended.  
<P>
I am delighted to provide the opportunity for the hon.  Member for Kingston and Surbiton to issue a press release  to announce that he has effected the first change to a  measure in his parliamentary career.  
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I shall be as brief as possible  so as not to delay proceedings unnecessarily. How can the  mayor be expected to choose the venue when he does not  know how many people will attend? Will he be required  to circulate all Londoners to get feedback, in the way that  privatised industries with millions of shareholders do?  
<P>
That would be extremely costly. Moreover this is a  serious point how will he ensure that only Londoners,  and not non-Londoners, attend?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises two points.  The first is an absolutely appropriate question about how  the mayor will know how many people are likely to  attend. I say openly that in the first two or three years it  will be difficult to judge; after that, with the experience  of those two or three years, it will probably be  [Interruption.] I am sorry that the hon. Member for  Solihull has such a pessimistic view of Londoners'  interest in the new authority. My own view is that after  the first year or two it will be possible to forecast the  likely attendance with reasonable certainty. At the start,  it will be necessary to provide for the expected level of  attendance that the mayor estimates. To some extent, this  will be hit and miss. I hope that many will attend and that  the mayor will make suitable arrangements. He may also,  if it is thought appropriate, make arrangements for  communication between the hall where the meeting takes  place and other venues possibly by television link, if  appropriate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> What would happen if an unscrupulous  mayor who did not want to be questioned picked a broom  cupboard for the meeting?       
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Given the provision in clause 39(1),  which requires the mayor to  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"hold and attend a meeting which is open to all members of the  public"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
the mayor could find himself in a difficult position if he  deliberately chose a venue that was far too small to  accommodate the number of people likely to attend. If the  mayor, made a genuine error, hired a hall for 300 people,  and 2,000 came, that would, I think, be a fair mistake.  Hiring a broom cupboard would clearly be contempt, and  it would, I imagine, be open to anyone to challenge the  mayor's bona fides through the usual legal channels.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Committee is intensely interested  in this aspect, as London's public will be. What advice  has the Minister had, and will he share it with the  Committee? For example, has he consulted the hon.  Member for Harrow, East, who has great experience of  mayoralties in the United States? Do other mayoralties  have such a public procedure? If so, are the auguries good,  or will it end up a pretty good scrum and degenerate into  something less than edifying?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Member for  Ruislip-Northwood also has a pessimistic view of the  outcome of this event. I do not share it. I am sure that  these will be useful and valuable occasions and that it will  be appropriate for the mayor to find a suitable venue. That  will be very much at his or her discretion.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Is it the first of its kind in the world?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> No. There are provisions in other  cities for meetings of this nature at which the mayor is  publicly accountable. it will certainly be the first in this  country; therefore there is inevitably an element of  experimentation about it. We cannot forecast accurately  the number who will attend and it would be foolish to try.  I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we are  doing this in good faith to ensure both accountability and  the availability of the mayor to his or her electorate.  
<P>
On the second question raised by the hon. Member for  Chipping Barnet, there are no means that I can think of  to prevent someone living outside the Greater London  area from coming to the meeting if he or she chooses to  do so. Holding an inquisition at the door to find out  whether people are resident in London would probably  not set the right tone for a meeting designed to make the  mayor accountable and there will be people who live  outside London but who work here and have an interest  in the city's future who wish to attend the debates. It  would be quite wrong to exclude them artificially. For  those reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept  that no provision for their exclusion can be made. I hope  that hon. Members will accept that the amendments  should be agreed, with the exception of amendment  No. 270, which I invite the hon. Member for Kingston  and Surbiton to withdraw.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> As I was concluding my brief  opening remarks, the right hon. Member for Bromley and  Chislehurst asked from a sedentary position whether that  was it, suggesting that my speech was too brief. I intend  to make a brief speech now, because that showed how  effective a brief speech can be. After a brief speech I  managed to extract form the Government two  concessions, which are my first experience of changing  British law.  
<P>
I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment. I can  imagine that, after that generous concession, my office  will issue a press release. I look forward to the Minister  making future concessions and I beg to ask leave to  withdraw the amendment.

Brought up, and read the First time.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read  a Second time.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to  consider, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the  Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We tabled new clause 11 long before  the Minister and the Liberal party tabled their  amendments, and I have to confess that the amendments  that have just been agreed make me feel better about the  whole process. The new clause provides that, in the clear  absence of any direction about the way in which the  debate should be conducted, it would be better to have a  proper debate in the assembly and then with the London  boroughs.  
<P>
I still believe that some form of consultation with the  London boroughs over the mayor's report is appropriate,  but, in the circumstances, even though the new clause  does not apply until the end of the part II, I beg to ask  leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
I do not feel the same about the people's question time.  If ever we needed an example of the Government at their  worst, we have it in the introduction of a people's  question time. Of course the public must be able to  question the mayor's activities, but do we need to go to  such absurd lengths? The clause does not say where the  meeting is to take place, who can go, how it is to be  conducted or what the arrangements are, but what  concerns me most is that there is no limit on who can  attend: it will not just be every member of the electorate  in London, every member of the electorate in the United  Kingdom or indeed every member of the electorate in the  entire European Union

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Why stop there indeed? It is a farcical  gimmick.  
<P>
I have been reassured by the Minister about the venue  for the debate and the question time, but I have a vision  of the hon. Member for Brent, East sitting on a podium  in the middle of Wembley stadium conducting      
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I can see him sitting there; a chap with  a white beard will come up and say, "I'm the Secretary  of State for Health, what are you doing about the state of  health in London?"	; and he will reply, "Well, you put only  two lines in the whole Bill about health, so you go and  sort it out yourself."	 Then the doors will open, a convoy  of Jaguars will enter and the Deputy Prime Minister will  emerge saying, "What are you doing about my integrated  transport policy?"	 Ken will then say, "I run London, not  you."	 Finally, this guy, all teeth and smiles, will pop up  waving his arms and saying, "I am the Prime Minister.  What are you going to do about influencing my policies  in London?"	 and the answer will be, "I have the mandate  in London, not you, mate."	  
<P>
That demonstrates the farcical and vacuous nature of  people's question time. We all seem to think that there  must be some form of public meeting, that the way in  which it should be conducted should be set out in the Bill,  and that there should be a defined category of those who  can attend and ask questions. Amendments Nos. 185 and  187 in the next group, as well as amendment No. 184, are  relevant, but I hope that I have made my point.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> In the past two or three years, many local  councils in London, including my own, have allowed  ordinary members of the public to attend council or other  committee meetings and to put questions on particular  subjects to elected members. In Redbridge, the  Conservatives were not in favour of it but the minority  Labour administration brought it in and it has proved  successful in allowing resident groups and individuals  from the general public to come along and speak at  council meetings. These proposals are consistent with  that.  
<P>
I know for sure about my own local authority but I  suspect that there are different models in different  boroughs. We should be able to learn from the experience.  In our London-wide deliberations, it will be an important  innovation. It will be open to ordinary members of the  public, but I am not too bothered personally whether we  call it the public's question time or a people's question  time. We must signify that one does not have to be a  representative

<B>Mr. Forth rose   </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway rose   </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> In a moment. It is not necessary to be a  representative of an organisation or to be an elected  person of any kind to have a say and ask questions. An  ordinary member of the public can do so, and ordinary  people can have a voice in this system rather than having  to go through the filter of some other body.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Could I attend that meeting and ask a  question?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> If the hon. Gentleman lives in London, I  assume he can.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottway:</B> I do live in London. Is that the  requirement?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I am not advocating a particular model; I  am saying that in my own local authority, which covers  the London borough of Redbridge, people living in the  area can go along to the town hall and attend meetings to  put forward their views. If a meeting were organised on a  London-wide basis, I assume that many Londoners would  attend it.     
<P>
I am not a Liberal Democrat, however, so I am not  proposing separatism: I do not want to set up passport  controls and border posts on the Greater London boundary  or the M25 to stop people coming into our city. Millions  of people who work in London and travel into London  will be affected by the policies of the mayor and the  assembly. Surely it is sensible for people who have  economic and business interests in our city to be able to  ask questions of the mayor and the authority, even if their  residence is not within the Greater London boundaries.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> The hon. Gentleman several times used the  expression "the ordinary members of the public"	. Will he  explain what other sorts of members of the public there  are?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> Conservative Members of Parliament or  Conservative councillors, for example.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I want to make a few short  observations about the question time. I do not mind what  it is called because that does not matter. It will be an  interesting experiment in direct democracy and we all  hope that it works, although I suspect that many of us  have doubts and anxieties about that. I am pleased that  my hon. Friends have suggested that it could be a petition  time as well as a question time. We need a genuine filter,  and the question time should be limited to voters in  London. Those who have a right to elect the mayor and  the assembly should, on production of a polling card at  the door, be able to demonstrate that they are entitled to  question the mayor or to present a petition. Otherwise, the  procedure could become a farce with people being bussed  in from all over the kingdom, or even through the  channel tunnel.  
<P>
<H5>8 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Europeans? No!  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Although there is a strong temptation  to be frivolous, we must try to be serious. [Interruption.]  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Could we have more quiet in  the Committee? This is the third time today that I have  appealed for that; may it be the last.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> There is a genuine risk that the whole  procedure may degenerate into a bear garden. We hope  that it does not, but in order to provide every chance that  good order and sensible procedures will be adhered to  from the outset, we should stipulate clearly that only  electors eligible to vote in Greater London elections  should participate in question time. Beyond that, I do not  want to make a fuss about it. It will be interesting to see  how it evolves and whether it lasts.  
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I am pleased that the hon. Member for  Croydon, South has accepted the principle of having twice  yearly meetings. He did not oppose the idea of a once  yearly event, so I do not suppose he will oppose it as a  twice yearly event.  
<P>
The hon. Gentleman wants to change the name and I  am sorry that we must spend time on that. The principle  of setting up the body shows that we are trying to  introduce an authority that works differently and is a new  model for genuine accountability and democracy. As my  hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South said, that is  happening already in different ways around the country.  We have no idea how the question time will work. Ten  people may turn up, or 3,000 or 3 million.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Very unlikely.  
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> Yes, that is very unlikely, but the name is  an issue on which everyone could have different views.  The serious point is that the Government are strongly  committed to encouraging people to feel that they can  have a say in what is going on and that they will be  genuinely informed.  
<P>
One important aspect will be to gain people's interest.  If question time is a boring old meeting, people may not  even consider going, but if it is called a people's question  time or London people's question time, I think that it will  be a little more exciting and appeal to all members of the  public. Frankly, if people want to come from Birmingham  or Manchester or even Belfast to see people's question  time in London with the mayor and assembly, whoever  they may be, why not? The hon. Member for Southwark,  North and Bermondsey may agree with me that we have  a people's palace on the south bank perhaps the people's  question time could be held in the people's palace. The  hon. Member for Croydon, South has made his point.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I hope that I have made my point. I  think that the name is stupid, but I beg to ask leave to  withdraw the amendment.  
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,

Amendment made: No. 299 in page 22, line 7, after  `Mayor' insert

<P>
Amendment made: No. 46, in page 22, line 8, after  `date', insert `and place'. [Mr. Edward Davey.]  
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand  part of the Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I have one observation and one  question. Interestingly, clause 40(2) provides one of the  GLA's few functions that have to be conjointly agreed by  the mayor and the assembly, which we enthusiastically  welcome. We wish that more provisions had to be  conjointly agreed by the mayor and the assembly. My  question to which there may be a perfectly reasonable  answer is about the people's question time. Subsection  (2) states that one of the two question times has to be either  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"not less than ... one month before"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
or "one month after"	 the debate. Some uncertainty  probably crept into the Bill during its final stage of  drafting. I could live with that arrangement, but there  would be more logic in having the question time precede  the debate, because the mayor and the assembly would  appreciate the issues that matter to Londoners. That is not  a major point, but subsection (2) seems to allow some  flexibility that is probably unnecessary.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Member  for Southwark, North and Bermondsey welcomes the  clause's principles. We believe that the mayor should be  responsible for the state of London debate because he or  she will be the executive, but the people's question time  is an opportunity for the people of London to question the  mayor and the assembly, which is why we made them  jointly responsible for that event.     
<P>
On timing, the objective in subsection (2) is to avoid  too close a proximity to the state of London debate  because that would cause confusion between the two  events. Clearly, the mayor will have to suggest, and the  assembly will have to agree, a timetable that will enable  the two events to take place in the course of the year at  suitable times, when the public will be well informed  about the issues and have an opportunity to raise  appropriate questions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will  accept that the clause should stand part of the Bill.  
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.  
<P>
Clause 40, as amended, ordered to stand part of the  Bill.  
<H4><center>Clause 41 </center></H4>
<H4><center>The Deputy Mayor </center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the  Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I want to make a short but  important point about the clause, on which we shall divide  the Committee. We accept that there should be a deputy  mayor: that proposal is logical and sensible, because the  deputy mayor will step into the mayor's shoes if the  mayor is indisposed or resigns or dies, and the Bill should  make provision for such cases. However, we have  consistently argued in the debates on the Government's  Green Paper and on the White Paper that the deputy  mayor should not be chosen from the assembly. The  clause requires the mayor to choose the deputy mayor, but  that involves a ridiculously excessive patronage. I  understand the logic behind the Government's proposal,  but it means that after the mayor is elected he or she will  have the power to choose someone in his or her image or  from his or her party if that is what he or she wants  irrespective of the assembly's make-up.  
<P>
The Government have a great opportunity to change  their mind. They have made concessions, for which we  are grateful. The original proposal, in the Green Paper,  was that there would be no deputy mayor, but we argued  that there should be one, and the Government's White  Paper included a proposal for a deputy mayor. We argued  from the beginning that the deputy mayor should be  elected, but the Government's proposal is that he or she  should be appointed.  
<P>
If the representatives of the Government of London are  to be seen to be representative on what will almost  certainly be a multi-party authority, it could be harmful if  a mayor always chose a deputy mayor from his or her  party. If the mayor were from one of the three main  parties, or from the Green party or if he or she were an  independent there would be every advantage in the  deputy mayor belonging to another party. If the mayor  were a woman, there would be every advantage in the  deputy mayor being a man [Hon. Members: "Why?"	]  Simply because we would have more representative  leadership. If the mayor were white, there would be every  advantage in a deputy mayor who was black. The  leadership of London should be seen to be representative.  There would be every disadvantage in the mayor and  deputy mayor being in the same image.     
<P>
The most important point, however, is that our proposal  would give the assembly the chance to choose from those  elected by the people of London the person in whom they  have the greatest confidence. The deputy mayor does not  have the chance to be elected by universal suffrage, so he  will not have the mandate of the people. He might  exercise the mayoral function for six months, so it is vital  that he has the maximum authority. But, as the clause  stands, the mayor may choose someone who commands  little authority among the rest of the assembly or among  Londoners in general. The Government have been willing  to create a deputy mayor, so I hope that there will be  further movement and that they will see the wisdom of  assembly members electing the deputy mayor, if not the  mayor.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I believe that the hon. Gentleman is well  meaning but wrong for the same reason that the  Government are wrong. The arguments were well  rehearsed in the Committee of the whole House. The  assembly's role is to scrutinise the activities of the mayor.  The minister has played down that role.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford indicated dissent.  </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am comforted that the Minister shakes  his head because it confirms that the assembly's role is to  scrutinise the mayor's activity.  
<P>
If the deputy mayor is chosen from the assembly by  the assembly through whatever means appointed by the  mayor or chosen by the assembly there will be a conflict  of interest. He cannot be a mouthpiece and perform  executive functions on behalf of the mayor while  performing a scrutiny role. The Government, rightly or  wrongly, have for the first time in this country separated  the executive from the legislature. A person cannot move  from the legislature to the executive and perform the  functions of the executive, then turn around and scrutinise  his own activity. For that reason, we will vote against  the clause.  
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I am always anxious to make a  long Bill shorter. There is no need for subsection (9)  because of subsection (8). The deputy mayor is appointed  by the mayor. According to subsection (8), if the deputy  mayor ceases to be an assembly member, he cannot be  appointed deputy mayor; if he gives notice of his  resignation as the deputy mayor, he is not likely to want  to succeed himself; and if the mayor gives him notice  terminating his appointment as deputy mayor, that person  will not be appointed deputy mayor. Therefore, there is  no need for subsection (9).  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> This is a very important debate. I am  sorry that it is during dinner because people's  concentration might not be as acute as it should be. My  hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South and the hon.  Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey argued  two fascinating and divergent points of view.  
<P>
We have done well not to table amendments because  the clause merits careful re-examination by the  Government before Report. Would not it have been  preferable for the Government to permit at the outset the  possibility of electing the deputy mayor with the mayor,  so that we could have had dream tickets the Minister for  Transport in London with the hon. Member for Brent,  East, for example, or the Secretary of State for Health, the  right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras  (Mr. Dobson) and the Minister for London? Intriguing  possibilities come to mind, such as the noble Lord Archer  and Mr. Norris.     
<P>
The division of powers argument that my hon. Friend  the Member for Croydon, South advances is absolutely  fundamental. How can the deputy mayor, in all  conscience and effectively, fulfil the double mandate that  will be required of him under the provisions of the clause  as drafted? Either he will be a good assembly man, and  be critical of his boss, the mayor, or he will slavishly  follow his boss's line and be in dereliction of his duty as  an elected assembly man, be it on a constituency or a  Londonwide basis.  
<P>
The Bill contains an inherent contradiction. The  Government set their face against the concept of a  chairman of the authority as we have always known it  a Chairman of a Committee or a leader of a borough  council, or even a Prime Minister in our parliamentary  system in favour of the American model of a division  of powers with an executive mayoralty.  
<P>
<H5>8.15 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The job of mayor will be exceedingly onerous, so the  position of deputy mayor will be most important. Perhaps  the municipal potentate, the supreme being of the London  scene, will want to hog the limelight and cover the big  occasions. However, the deputy mayor will do much of  the donkey work, the hard routine stuff, the controversial  nitty-gritty work. If he is an assembly man, a fatal conflict  of interest might result.  
<P>
I am extremely appreciative of the debate that we have  had. It may have been tedious and seemed rather long  winded, but it is important, and I hope that the  Government will recognise that the matter merits  re-examination. Re-examination should be fundamental  and should allow for the possibility of the deputy mayor  being elected along with the mayor, so that two candidates  could be presented to the electors of London who combine  the qualities about which my hon. Friend the Member for  Chipping Barnet spoke. We could have, perhaps, a women  with a man, or a European with an Indian, in a  combination of capabilities and talents for the betterment  of London.  
<P>
Merely allowing the mayor to pick a deputy from the  assembly is full of risk. It could unbalance the assembly,  because the assembly might be finely balanced between  the political parties. It will be a crucial decision, as the  colleague will have to have exceptional qualities in order  to get along. No function is more difficult to fulfil than  that of a deputy. It is more difficult than that of the boss.  It would be better if from the outset they recognised that  they have to work together, and ran a campaign together  and were elected together. That would be preferable to the  elected mayor's coming to the assembly on election day  as though from the Mount of Olives and divinely selecting  a man for that particular job. I ask the Government to  reconsider the clause, because it is fraught with potential  problems that the Government still have time to put right.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Several points have been raised in this  short debate that go over the same ground as we covered  in the Committee of the whole House when discussing the  issue. I do not intend to rehearse the arguments again.  Suffice it to say that we have a different conception from  that of the Opposition parties of the new authority and  how it will work, of the role of the mayor and deputy and  of the relationship between the mayor and the assembly.  The Liberal Democrats would constrain the mayor as  much as possible, and would have the deputy elected by  the assembly rather than appointed by the mayor. The  Conservatives would have the deputy elected together  with the mayor. It was not clear whether that would be  on the same ticket or separately, but he or she would not  be taken from the assembly.  
<P>
The deputy has a crucial role to play in linking the  mayor and the assembly. The assembly's role is scrutiny,  but the deputy and the mayor must have constructive  working relationships with each other. We do not want  the assembly to perform a remorselessly negative role.  The deputy has an important role to play. It is vital that  the deputy can work closely with the mayor. That is why  it is right that the mayor should appoint the deputy. The  deputy also has some important responsibilities as a  member of the Metropolitan police authority and as the  person who takes over from the mayor in the event of the  mayor being incapacitated.  
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> In the past few weeks, I have  had the pleasure of reading the federalist papers, which  contain the strong exchange of views that took place  during the writing of the American constitution. Madison  and others strongly recommended that the Vice-President  of the United States of America should not be a senator  plucked out of the Senate by the President because that  would weaken the state that that senator had previously  represented. This is an exact parallel 200 years later, and  the Government should reflect on those ancient saws and  maxims.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I must tell the hon. Gentleman that  the analogy of the American presidential system and our  proposals for the mayor of London was made by my hon.  Friend the Member for Brent, East during the proceedings  of the Committee of the whole House. I said that we are  creating not a presidential system but a mayoral system.  There is no precedent for the model proposed by the hon.  Member for Solihull.  
<P>
I was describing a process that will ensure a good,  constructive working relationship between the mayor and  the assembly, with the deputy mayor playing a pivotal  role. We believe that that is right, which is why we are  constructing the authority in that way. I must tell the hon.  Member for Ruislip-Northwood that the assembly will  have a chair and, indeed, a deputy chair. We have made  provision for those posts in clause 43.  
<P>
As I said, we do not believe that the deputy mayor  should be elected from the assembly or elected separately.  We have set out the reasons why the mayor should  appoint the deputy. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet asked why  subsection (9) is required. The answer is simply to  safeguard against a possible legal challenge. If a deputy  ceases to be a deputy either by losing his or her seat on  the assembly, or by being dropped by a mayor there  should be no challenge to that person's eligibility to be  reappointed as deputy, possible in a subsequent term.  Because of the possibility of legal challenge, we wanted  to make it absolutely clear that there is no impediment to  such a reappointment. 
<P>
I am sorry if the subsection causes offence by  increasing the Bill's length. However, as it is only two  lines long, its removal would make no material difference  to the Bill's length and we believe that there is a  justification for keeping it. I hope that the hon. Member  for Chipping Barnet will accept that all nine subsections  of the clause are required and that the clause will stand  part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> As a feminist, it is with some trepidation  that I rise to support the replacement of "chair"	 with  "chairman"	. I said earlier that Britain has some of the best  race relations laws; we also have some of the best sex  equality laws, and I am a keen supporter of them. I believe  in women's equality and that there should be no  discrimination between the sexes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> I understand that many people find  the word "chair"	 awkward; would it accommodate the  hon. Gentleman if we retained the concept and made  Opposition spokespeople "stools"	? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I was trying to keep the debate serious. 
<P>
I think that it is political correctness a step too far for  the piece of wood and leather on which our Chairman is  sitting to have its own office in the new assembly  building. In tabling the amendment, I wondered how far  one should go with political correctness and so I looked  up the phrase in "Brewer's Politics"	. The entry will take  about 30 seconds to read but it is worth it. Political  correctness is defined as follows:

The Important question in deciding whether to call  someone chairman rather than chair is whether it causes  offence to people. I do not believe that it should. Most  people that I talk to are quite happy with "Madam  Chairman"	, for example, as the title for a female holding  the chair. We can all look up the "Oxford English  Dictionary"	 and see that the word "chairman"	 means a  person presiding over a meeting. While one has to be  sensitive to such issues, to describe the office as "chair"	  is a step too far on the line of political correctness. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend may be meeting  resistance from the Labour Benches, but I happily invite  him to highlight his argument by telling me the politically  correct version of "foreman"	 as in "foreman of the  jury"	. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I suggest that my hon. Friend makes his  own inquiries. I do not have a clue about that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> In American juries, the term is  "foreperson"	.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> At least it is not "forestool"	. 
<P>
We have been here since 2.30 pm. I suspect that this is  the last substantial debate of the day at least, I hope that  it is. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I cannot let the occasion pass without  giving my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South a  modicum of moral support. It really is time that a  counterblast started against the fascism of political  correctness. If the Government feel obliged to write such  nonsense into legislation, they are going too far. A recent  example that has been in the newspapers of late,  emanating again from the United States, is of someone  who used the term "niggardly"	 and got into serious  trouble with the usual suspects for doing so. When we  reach that degree of cultural or linguistic fascism a sort  of super-sensitivity whereby people must go around  twisting and bending our wonderful language matters  have certainly gone too far.

The most recent example of such action is the  misfortunes of Glen Hoddle, a gentleman whom I do not  know, but for whom I now feel some sympathy. He is  alleged to have said something out of place that greatly  upset a group of people, as a result of which he has lost  his job. When we have reached that sort of state as a  society, we have lost all sense of priority. Surely, there  are other more important things to which we can turn our  minds. It is very sad that the Government feel obliged to  twist the language in such a way to please I know not  whom. 
<P>
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon,  South in trying to restore to the Bill the language that we  were all brought up with and with which most reasonable  and everyday people feel comfortable. We must not  succumb, as seems to have been increasingly the  tendency, to the shrill voices who want to dictate to us  what we must and must not say. 
<P>
Please, cannot we all be a little relaxed and enjoy our  language that has come down to us through the ages, put  up with its occasional rough edges and even with things  that we may find offensive. Offensiveness is in the eye of  the hero or the beholder and we must not take it on  ourselves to make judgments about what we think  everybody and every group in society may find offensive.  I strongly support the amendments.    
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I raised this point earlier, so I  can be brief. With a surname like mine, my hon. Friend  the Member for Croydon, South can expect me to give  him my full support. I am nearing the desperate situation  of realising that it will be under a politically correct,  radical, reforming Labour Government that I will have to  change my name to "Person-Person"	. I would be wary of  doing that, however, because the last three letters of the  word "person"	 leave much to be desired if we take things  to such ridiculous lengths by referring to a chairman as  a "chair"	. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I cannot comprehend the desire to  emasculate the English language in such a way. We all  know that "chairman"	 is a generic term. It has no sexist  or divisive implications. There is no intent to cause  offence. It does not of itself diminish any person's  femininity or the qualities that we admire in womankind.  There is total equality under the Bill, such as opportunities  for elective office even to the post of chairman or deputy  chairman. Many accept the counter argument that  emasculating the office by talking as if it were a piece of  furniture would upset another category of people. Surely it  is possible to draft the measure so as not to cause offence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Does my hon. Friend share my  view that if we take matters to their full extent and  examine the etymology of the word "mayor"	, we could  realise that it is masculine? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Of course, but I should be ruled out of  order if I pursued that argument too far. If people cannot  stomach the word "chairman"	, why do we not call  occupants of such an office "president"	 or "vice- president"	? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Go on Glenda, gnaw their balls off! 
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I have a feeling that they would  have to be there before exercising my dentures. 
<P>
I was prepared to believe that there was a serious  purpose to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for  Croydon, South. However, having listened to him, the  hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, the hon. Member  for Chipping Barnet, the right hon. Member for Bromley  and Chislehurst  
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> And the hon. Member for Solihull. 
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Indeed. I was prepared to be charitable  and believe that the hon. Member for Solihull and his  right hand hon. Friends knew that we would be sitting late  and that a ludicrously bizarre amendment would cause the  Committee no small mirth. The work that they have  devoted to meticulously examining every single clause in  the Bill to find the word "chair"	 and replace it with  "chairman"	 shows dedication     
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> It demonstrates consistency. 
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but  I am capable of choosing my own words. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South has tabled an  absurd amendment to serious parts of the Bill. I cannot  understand his alleged defence of the English language,  nor his suggestion that no insult is implied to half of the  world's population. Given the absolute, abject dedication  of Opposition Members to the belief that the only people  fit to hold high office are men, why did the amendment  not distinguish between "chairman"	, "chairwoman"	 and  "chairperson"	? The holders of such an office could choose  their own title. 
<P>
The amendment is another example of the official  Opposition's inability to leave behind the detritus that has  benighted them for so long. As my hon. Friend the  Minister for London and Construction said, the hon.  Member for Croydon, South has no difficulty working in  this House and is not astonished to find a person with the  title of Black Rod walking down the corridor. However,  he and his hon. Friends are obsessed with referring a new  city-wide form of government back to old definitions of  government.

<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> The Minister has not dealt with my point  about the word "mayor"	. There is no doubting her  sincerity, to which her animation testifies, but I have  already told her that "mayor"	 is a masculine word: it  pertains to a man. Why have the Government not dealt  with that? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jackson:</B> I appreciate the regional nature of the  hon. Gentleman's voice, slight though it may be. There  are people who, having listened to his speech, would  believe that he was referring to a female horse. He will  perceive the sort of difficulties we could get into on the  type of tack to which he referred. 
<P>
I have already paid tribute to the meticulous but truly  dedicated unending hours that have gone into drafting the  amendment. But, again, in a sense it adds insult to injury.  I agree with the right hon. Member for Bromley and  Chislehurst, although I paraphrase, that injury is in the  eye of the beholder. It is not for us to define what  constitutes injury. People continue to express their  concern at this type of definition of exclusive use of the  male gender in titles. I have little doubt that the person  who spent many hours pouring over the Bill with great  dedication, eschewing the pangs of boredom so that the  amendment could be tabled, would be female and  probably very young, and that she probably received no  payment of any kind because she is dedicated to the  Conservative party. The amendment is absurd and I ask  the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw it. It is  another indication of the Conservative party's failure to  come to grips with the changes that have taken place in  this country, something to which not only the amendment  but the scarcity of women on the Conservative Benches  testifies. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We are all familiar with the story of  the boy who cried wolf. The Minister's wind-up was no  different from thousands of her replies that I have been  obliged to listen to over many months, if not years.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> No, I will not. 
<P>
I find myself utterly unmoved by the hon. Lady's  platitudes. She means well, but we never intended to  divide on the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw  the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> What are the Committee's wishes  regarding the remainder of this evening's proceedings? If  we go on much longer it is only fair that hon. Members  break for something to eat.

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> My understanding, having spoken  to the Government Whip earlier, was that if members of  the Committee thought that we would reach clause 50, we  were likely to do so within 17 minutes.

<P>
<H5>8.45 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> May I ask for a little clarification? I  am surprised that subsection (2)(d) refers to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any other matters which the Assembly considers to be of  importance to Greater London."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Are such wide powers for debate by the assembly  welcome to Her Majesty's Government? One presumes so  from the legislation. But surely the assembly should  always debate matters that are germane to the  competencies of the mayor and the authority as a whole,  rather than stray into areas that may be relevant to other  Departments of State and national Government. Could the  Minister clarify that point?    
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an  important point. We have always made it clear that the  remit of the assembly would be not just to scrutinise the  role of the major but to investigate matters of concern to  Londoners and to propose actions to remedy problems. As  part of that wider remit it is obviously appropriate that the  powers of the assembly should not be restricted solely to  those areas which are formally allocated as  responsibilities for the GLA. It is in pursuance of that  policy that subsection (2)(d) has been included. This is  part of the wider remits that we debated at an earlier  sitting. I believe that it is appropriate, and that it would  unduly restrict the role of the assembly were the  subsection to be omitted. 
<P>
Question put  and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 49 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 50 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Proposals by the Assembly to the Mayor </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 54,  page 25, line 43, at end insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) The Mayor shall take such steps that are necessary to  implement any proposal submitted by the Assembly under  subsection (1) above.'. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a brief exploratory amendment to discover why  the clause, which is welcome in that it allows the  assembly by a majority of those present to submit a  proposal to the mayor, does not, as far as I am aware, go  on to deal with what the mayor has to do with the  proposals. We welcome the fact that the assembly can  take initiatives. We have accepted, whatever our  disagreements about the balance of power, that the mayor  and the assembly both have a part to play. Our  amendment argues that if the assembly puts forward a  proposal the mayor must do something to implement it. 
<P>
The Government may say no, that that goes across the  line and that they do not think that the assembly should  have power to make the mayor do something. I understand  there may be disagreement about that, but it would be  helpful if the Minister could at least indicate that if the  assembly proposes something, the mayor must not only  consider it but should not be able to reject it without good  cause. Otherwise, to be honest, the assembly will not bother to take these initiatives that the Bill will permit it,  if it does not have some comfort that there will be some  purpose to it. 
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I wonder what the reaction of  Londoners would be if the assembly proposed to the  mayor that he or she should resign the day after taking  office. This is yet another of those amendments which are  broadly drafted and are based, again, on the premise,  which has been increasingly clear during our exchanges,  that the Liberal Democrats wish to see the power, in  essence, residing in the assembly. They refuse to accept  the model which the Government have clearly stated and  which Londoners have clearly endorsed: executive power  rests with the mayor and scrutiny rests with the assembly.    
<P>
The assembly could submit alternative strategies to the  mayor which the mayor would have to implement whether  or not they were contrary to his or her strategies. The hon.  Gentleman made it perfectly clear this afternoon that he  would like to see a Greater London authority which totally  ignored the national policies of the United Kingdom and  adhered to the national policies of Germany, Spain and  Canada. Presumably he would argue that this kind of  proposal should also come from the assembly and that the  mayor would automatically have to accept it. 
<P>
Clause 37 provides that the mayor must respond in the  monthly report. On those grounds it is our perception that  the balance of power between the mayor and the assembly  is the way that good government will be introduced into  London [Interruption.] Did the hon. Member for  Ruislip-Northwood wish to intervene? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> No. I am satisfied by what the  Minister has said. 
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> If the amendment was imposed upon the  GLA it would be a recipe for total and unadulterated  chaos. I call upon the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the  amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> It would not be a recipe for chaos,  because the assembly would, I am sure, act as responsibly  as would the mayor. One should not assume that the  mayor will always act responsibly but the assembly will  not. 
<P>
The Minister presented our case as one which argues  that the authority should always contradict national policy  and overly support the policies of foreign countries. I am  sad about that. That has never been our argument. The  assembly may or may not wish to agree with national  policy that is the assembly's choice. 
<P>
We have consistently argued that the assembly should  have more power. The Minister has answered the point,  and said that all the mayor need do is to respond in the  monthly report. That is better than nothing, but it does not  go as far as we would wish. We realise that there is a  difference of view, and we must accept that the  Government are not to be moved on the matter this  evening. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw  the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Clause 50 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
