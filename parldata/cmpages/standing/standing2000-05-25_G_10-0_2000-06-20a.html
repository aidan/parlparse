<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
 No. 15, in page 14, line 2, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In preparing the standards the appropriate minister shall have regard to the needs and views of people with multiple physical or sensory impairments.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 201, in page 14, line 9, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`including any person who has been consulted or who has made representations to the Minister in respect of any previous statement made under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I had intended to be extremely brief in speaking to the amendments during our previous sitting and see no reason not to be so now. The amendments are an invitation to the Minister to say yes. I cannot imagine anyone not taking into consideration the views of service users and providers and of people with special needs. It would be good to have that in the Bill and I should be happy to accept an assurance from the Minister.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton)</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for moving his amendment so briefly. However, I am unable to accept amendments Nos. 35, 15 and 201 for a number of reasons, but mainly because it is not appropriate to identify some categories of people with whom we might wish to consult and exclude others. The hon. Gentleman's amendment refers to service users, but not to purchasers, carers, providers or other professional bodies.<P>

<P>
The same difficulty arises with amendment No. 15. We are more than happy to give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. We made it clear in another place that we wished to consult as broadly and deeply as possible with all relevant interests. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with that and feel able to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mrs Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): The debate has been a record for speed. We have received many representations about consultation. I should like to put on record the comments of the owner of a care home in Herefordshire, who wrote to me and emphasised that changes in standards might place some care home owners in peril when running their businesses. Mr. Edmunds said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I believe that carers should have some safeguards to ensure the powers to impose standards are exercised fairly.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He hoped that, as care home owners are directly affected, they would be involved in a consultation process. At an earlier stage of the Bill, hon. Members spent a great deal of time in discussing the way in which care home owners would be affected and it is right to place that example on record, which is one of many representations that we have received on the point.

<P>
When we went to the exhibition that was thoughtfully laid on by the Minister for all members of the Committee, we saw cut-put pieces of plastic on the floor of Richmond house. They were a graphic illustration of current room sizes and of the proposed standard room size under the draft consultation document ``Fit for the Future?'' A stage on from that-what representative and interested bodies would like to see in future-it immediately struck me that changes in standards, even from those described in ``Fit for the Future?'' to the next grade would present care home owners with a considerable challenge, and I stress the need to consult them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I can assure the hon. Lady that we shall do so.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> In view of what we have heard, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 14, line 2, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1B) In preparing statements of standards the appropriate Minister shall include specific guidance on behaviour management in the relevant care setting.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:

<P>
No. 156, in page 14, line 2, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Statements under subsection (1) shall include specific guidance on the assessment of the care needs of individuals to ensure consistent national minimum standards of needs assessment.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 33, in clause 45, page 22, line 32, leave out ``and (2)'' and insert ``, (2) and (3)''.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> An earlier amendment related to drug regimes and the distribution of medication, as well as to expert advice being made available both to the Commission and to individual providers. Amendment No. 32 recognises that the care does not restrict itself to pharmaceutical regimes, but that advice and a framework for managing potentially difficult clinical conditions should be made available as part of a care management plan as set out in amendment No. 156.

<P>
Too often we hear of residents being almost drugged into submission when there is no active management plan that allows them to maximise their opportunities. It is the difference between promoting and actively promoting health. We seek an assurance from the Minister that that important aspect of care will not be forgotten.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Once again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I urge the Committee not to accept amendments Nos. 32 and 156. In doing so, I will give the assurances that the hon. Gentleman seeks.

<P>
On amendment No. 32, the powers in clause 21 enable inappropriate methods of controlling behaviour to be prescribed. We shall seek to do that. The national minimum standards will also address the issue. The amendment is unnecessary because we shall introduce what it proposes.

<P>
On amendment No. 156, I certainly agree that national minimum standards should include specific guidance on the assessment of individuals' care needs by the service provider, and I intend that they shall. I have some good news for the hon. Gentleman, however; having accepted two or three amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), I am happy to recommend amendment No. 33 to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> On the question of the amendment relating to behaviour management, I wanted to wait to hear what the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) had to say. It was not immediately clear to me what behaviour management meant, but I think that I now understand. However, I want to raise with the Minister a practical point concerning behaviour management.

<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred to controlling people's behaviour medically. We discussed that previously and I do not want to repeat the debate. I want to raise a concern about the application of standards of care in care homes, which can result in managing residents' behaviour in a way that at times they find deeply offensive. The introduction of standards that are designed for residents' safety and welfare has to be weighed against their wishes and desires.

<P>
Let me illustrate that in relation to elderly persons' bathing in a residential care home. When they move from independent living to a residential setting, they lose a degree of privacy. A care home may take on a changing clientele that becomes progressively a more demented group, but some residents may still have sufficient faculties to continue to perform a personal service such as bathing. If a standard is introduced that lays down that, for safety reasons, a resident in a care home may not bathe in privacy, it can cause great offence. From my experience of visiting elderly relatives in care homes, it is an affront to an elderly gentleman when he is told for the first time that he has to be bathed by two nurses, whether he likes it or not, for his own safety. That can cause distress. However, one of my concerns is about blanket standards over which there is very little discretion-

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The hon. Lady is describing risk management, which clearly is important, and hard choices will have to be made. Amendment No. 32 is more about behaviour management, which has big implications for the training of staff in residential and nursing homes. Indeed, it may put an extra obligation on the national health service by making some of the more expert psychiatric nurses with a special interest in care of the elderly available for advice and treatment of individual patients. Amendment No. 32 should be read with amendment No. 156 in that those plans cannot be blanket. ``Blanket'' is probably the wrong term when talking about blanket baths. They should not be for everyone but specifically targeted for individual patients.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to rule me out of order, which is really your job, Mr. Benton. I was about to say that the explanation given to the elderly resident was that the behaviour that emerged was that of ``demented resident'', which constituted a vast majority of cases but not his. There was no flexibility and nobody had explained to him that they had to give him the bath because he was classified, along with everyone else, as having demented behaviour, which he did not have, but which meant that for his own safety he should be subjected to something that he did not want to do. There is a danger of legislating too crudely and of not taking sufficient care of the individual's needs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): In view of her comments, the hon. Lady undoubtedly will want to endorse the second chapter of ``Fit for the Future?'', which makes that very point.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> That is still a consultative document, as the Minister is always at pains to point out to us when we do not like aspects of it. I should like the reassurance that we are not legislating so as to bring in across-the-board standards that can give offence to individuals who should be treated in a more tailored way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady has made similar observations in the past. Of course we do not intend to do that. We are trying to do something new with the relationship beween the regulations and the standards. That relationship gives us the opportunity to approach such issues with the flexibility that the hon. Lady seeks. We shall do that. The personal dignity and privacy of residents of care homes are issues of the utmost sensitivity, and we certainly intend that such issues will be dealt with appropriately when fixing the final standards and, ultimately, the regulations.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Lady is able to put her concerns to one side on that matter. We do not intend to abuse residents of care homes in any way in the process of setting national minimum standards. Quite the opposite; national minimum standards will serve the public interest and the interest of the residents of care homes, whether nursing homes or residential care homes, in a way that has not been done effectively in the past, and we will certainly avoid the obvious difficulties and shortcomings of a rigid straitjacket to which she has rightly drawn attention.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> In the light of what has been said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Benton. Perhaps my inexperience is showing, but by leaving amendment No. 33 out of my withdrawal of amendment No. 32-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. To put the hon. Gentleman's mind at ease, I should tell him that the question on amendment No. 33 will be put later.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I beg to move amendment No. 200, in page 14, line 2, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In preparing and publishing such statements the Minister shall ensure that the costs of complying with any statement of minimum standards bears an appropriate relation to the benefit of compliance with such statement of minimum standards.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we will take amendment No. 202, in line 9, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) No statement shall be published by the Minister under this section until a minimum of 28 days after the publication of a regulatory impact assessment setting out-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the estimated total cost of implementing the standards contained in the statement;<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the estimated total cost to the public authorities of implementing the standards contained in the statement.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Amendment No. 200 would impose on the Minister in preparing and publishing statements under clause 24 a duty of proportionality, ensuring that the benefits arising from any standard introduced are proportional to the costs of compliance with such statements.

<P>
In talking about the costs and benefits of proposed minimum standards, the Under-Secretary, Lord Hunt, said that ``benefits will outweigh costs''. That is an interesting statement, which raises the question of who receives the benefits and who bears the costs. If the incidence of benefits and costs were the same, any rational person would embark on a course of action in which benefits outweighed costs. It is still not clear to the Committee whether the Government have accepted that the public purse will ultimately bear the costs of delivering additional benefits through the imposition of minimum standards. We have sought to clarify that and shall seek to do so again.

<P>
Even though the Minister may not want to accept amendment No. 200, I hope that he will have no difficulty in giving the Committee an assurance that a future Minister proposing standards under clause 22 will be mindful of the costs that will be imposed and will seek to ensure proportionality-a proper balance between the benefits that it is planned will arise and the direct and indirect costs that will be imposed. I look forward to receiving that reassurance from the Minister.

<P>
Amendment No. 202 has a slightly different purpose. It would require the Minister to publish a regulatory impact assessment of any proposed standard 28 days before he publishes the statement incorporating or revising the standard. The amendment makes sense in the context of the arrangements for publishing statements of national minimum standards. There will not be an opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny. Although a statement may refer to a period after which there must be compliance, effectively it will have force the moment the Minister publishes it.

<P>
In a previous debate, we were assured by the Minister that, when a statement is published, a regulatory impact assessment will be published with it. We suggest that we in Parliament will need to see that regulatory impact assessment in advance of the publication of the statement. As there is no formal scrutiny process, we will need the opportunity of a short delay-28 days has been suggested-in which, if there is concern as a result of the regulatory impact assessment, we can, to put it bluntly, kick up a fuss about a proposed standard that the Minister is about to publish as a statement.

<P>
Under the amendment, the Government would have to give Parliament some notice of their intentions. I acknowledge provisions in subsection (3) for consultation by the Minister of appropriate persons, but that is rather different from notice to Parliament. Will the Minister reassure us that parliamentarians will have an opportunity to consider the regulatory impact assessment before the formal publication of a statement of national minimum standards?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> In debating amendment No. 200, there is a danger that we might go over the same ground that we covered during most of Thursday afternoon's sitting when discussing the cost burdens of the national minimum standards. I want to avoid that. We have repeatedly made it clear that the minimum required standards will be realistic and affordable and that they will be accompanied by the appropriate regulatory impact assessment. We stand by that; we intend to do that. There is therefore nothing to be gained from amendment No. 200. I understand the point that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised on amendment No. 202, but it would not be a meaningful exercise to publish a regulatory impact assessment 28 days ahead of the publication of the standards. As the reader would not have the benefit of being able to look at the national minimum standards, with what could it be compared?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister makes a fair point; the amendments were probing ones. Will he assure the Committee that a draft of the statement of national minimum standards, together with a regulatory impact assessment, will be placed in the Library not less than 28 days before it is formally published?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Let me go away and think about that. I do not want to commit myself because I do not see that publishing a draft statement 28 days before the final standards are published would be beneficial. A draft statement could change. We do not want any confusion or misunderstanding about our intentions. In essence, the amendment probably would not make sense. I am not aware of the publication of any other regulatory impact assessment ahead of either regulations or the main substance of proposals. Such publication would not be sensible, and nor would it provide clarity and certainty or aid the process of scrutiny about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned.

<P>
It makes most sense to publish the standards alongside the regulatory impact assessment so that the reader can see how the documents relate to each other. I confirm that we intend to allow all interest groups the maximum period of consultation on development of the new standards. We have made that clear and demonstrated it by providing extensive opportunities for people to express their views about ``Fit for the Future?'' and the exercise on minimum standards for residential care homes. That is how we intend to develop minimum required standards across a range of other settings. I therefore cannot accept amendment No. 202.

<P>
On amendment No. 200, we have always made it clear that the standards will be realistic and affordable and that there will be a full regulatory impact assessment produced at the time that they are made available to the public.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I cannot say that I am entirely surprised by the Minister's response. He has reiterated the words ``realistic'' and ``affordable'', which as he knows have nothing to do with proportionality. Something could be realistic and affordable but disproportionate. I have sought to capture the concept that the costs must be appropriately related to the benefit that is to be delivered. What the Minister has not told us is to whom the standards will be affordable. It would be more reassuring if he was able to tell the Committee that, when he talks about realistic and affordable, he means proposing the introduction of standards only where the Treasury, the Department of Health and other relevant authorities are prepared to meet their cost through higher fees for people placed in care. To say that required minimum standards will be realistic and affordable does not tell us much. Affordable could be interpreted to mean designed not to bankrupt the people who have to pay for them. That does not tell us anything about the appropriateness of spending the money in order to deliver what might be a marginal benefit. I am therefore disappointed by what the Minister said.

<P>
I am slightly more reassured by the Minister's saying that he would go away and think about whether it would be appropriate to place draft statements in the Library before they are formally published. Unless I have misunderstood, there will be no procedure for going backwards once the statement is formally published, unlike, for example, for regulations introduced by a statutory instrument, which would be laid and then subject to annulment under the standard procedures of this place. I am not sure even that the Minister has the power to withdraw the statement, although he might issue a statement amending it, which may have the same effect. The statement will be circulated to appropriate people outside the House. It therefore seems not unreasonable for Members of Parliament who are being asked to agree the provision to seek access to such a document.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We might be talking at cross purposes; I am sorry if I have confused the hon. Gentleman. He will be aware that we are committed to publishing for consultation a draft set of standards which will be accompanied by a draft regulatory impact assessment. There will therefore be an opportunity for consultees to reflect on the cost burdens and implications for them as providers. That information will be placed in the Library.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> In essence, the Minister has reassured me. My concern was that Members of Parliament should have access to documents that are circulated outside the House. Lest he should think that spurious, let me cite an example relating to his own Department. I have asked the Secretary of State for Health whether he would place in the Library a copy of the draft findings of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence on beta interferon, which are-or will shortly be-circulating among interested parties outside the House. The Secretary of State has answered that he will not do so. Therefore, Members of Parliament will not be aware of a draft proposal for a standard of great importance to their constituents, which will be circulated openly among relevant groups outside Parliament, under conditions of confidentiality that do not allow them to disclose it to parliamentarians. That is a rather questionable procedure.

<P>
However, I am very much reassured by what the Minister has told the Committee. Although I am less comfortable about what he has said on amendment No. 200, I shall rely on his good intentions as he goes away to think about what has been said during the debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 203, in page 14, line 9, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`() Any statement published under this section shall come into effect on a date to be specified at the time of publication being not less than twelve months after the date of publication.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would insert a requirement which I imagine the Minister probably has in mind anyway-or at least something very much like it. It would require a period of not less than 12 months before any newly introduced standard came into effect as a minimum standard to be considered under the provisions of subsection (4) and captured by any regulations made under clause 21 referring to minimum standards. The reason why is fairly obvious. Some standards, particularly those requiring any changes to the physical environment-even those requiring changes to staffing practices and management procedures-inevitably take time to implement.

<P>
The aim of this probing amendment is to seek clarification from the Minister about how he sees the issue of time scales. We already know something of the Government's thinking with regard to the first raft of national minimum standards, at least insofar as they apply to care homes, because of what is in ``Fit for the Future?'' We have not heard anything yet from the Government about the time for compliance with those draft standards. It is clear that the time required for compliance will be very different for each standard. Some will be able to be complied with within perhaps a year or even months, while others will require several years if serious damage is not to be caused.

<P>
Could the Minister give the Committee some indication of the range of time scales that he has in mind for the different areas to which standards will apply and how he proposes to establish an appropriate time period for implementation? What will be the criteria in reaching that decision? Should it become apparent from the Minister's remarks that the Government are addressing the issue of time delay for implementation of a minimum standard, I would be willing to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am glad that the amendment is probing and not serious because I would be very alarmed if we were tying the Minister's hands for 12 months and preventing him from doing something about a standard identified as not working. We have seen enough evidence in the past couple of years in the various reports on children's homes to convince us that there sometimes can be a need to move with speed. However, I am also concerned about a 12-month waiting time regarding some of the bricks-and-mortar issues and the famous sweep of the floor by the door. I hope that we will see more flexibility on those issues where care is otherwise excellent so that we do not deny residents choice.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made it clear that this was a probing amendment so I will not need to go into any argument as to why it should not be accepted. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight made it clear that if we were minded to accept the amendment it could make it very difficult for effective action to be taken in the event of a change of circumstances or other development where there was a need for quick action. We would not want to be tied to a 12-month obligation as proposed by the amendment. I will not develop that argument, as it is clear the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge tabled the amendment simply as a way to open up a wider discussion about the criteria that the Government intend to use for fixing the time scales for introducing the new national minimum standards, particularly those that might have an impact on the physical environment of, for example, care homes.

<P>
Again, all I can do in relation to the concerns of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is to repeat that we recognise that care home owners might require several years to make any necessary adjustments to their premises to comply with minimum standards that impact on the physical environment. I am not able to be more specific today, as we have not yet fixed the minimum required room size. Clearly, that will have an implication for the potential time scale for its implementation and-hopefully soon-I will be able to provide the hon. Gentleman with more information.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am slightly curious about the argument that the room size adopted will be a key factor in determining the appropriate period for the transition. Surely that would relate more to things like typical lengths of loans that people have taken on in the industry and to commercial matters relating to the ability of owners to raise the capital necessary for further alterations to premises.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Yes, that is certainly an issue that we must take into account, but we would not want to be implementing some of the standards in about 25 years from now. However, the arguments about time scale and room size are connected. It might be that the final room size standard is one with which we are confident the majority of care owners already comply, or are close to compliance on. There may not be a need for an extensive period of time to make physical adjustments.

<P>
I cannot be as specific as the hon. Gentleman would like because we have not yet fixed the physical standard. He asked what criteria we would take into account in fixing time scales. One of the most important will be our consultation with the industry itself. We will have to produce standards that are realistic and affordable and do not compromise the ability of local authorities to place elderly people in appropriate residential care settings. Those are important principles that we will take fully into account. It is our intention to proceed with both the establishment of minimum standards and fixing a reasonable time scale for compliance in a way that will command the broad support of the majority of care home owners.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister has said what I hoped he would say and I know that people outside will be reassured by his confirmation that consultation with the providers will largely inform decisions about the appropriate time scale for transition periods. I am also somewhat reassured that minimum standards adopted for room sizes might be at a level with which the great majority are already compliant. That will lift a huge load from the shoulders of the industry and allow business as normal to return to a sector that has faced considerable disruption. However, I would caution the Minister that being ``close to compliance'' could be a problem with regard to physical standards. Being very close to compliance has all the same problems as being quite a long way away from compliance.

<P>
If it is necessary to knock down a wall, it does not really matter whether it is to move it 2 in or 2 ft. The costs involved will be considerable. I am sure that the Minister did not mean the Committee to read anything significant into his use of the term ``close to compliance'' but it is precisely because of the absolute nature of things like room sizes that there has been such concern. Being very close to compliance will not help people. If the standards set are such that the great majority are already compliant, that will be a significant relief to many people and to many institutions involved in this sector.

<P>
Having had the benefit of listening to the Minister's reassurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 204, in page 14, line 10, leave out subsection (4) and add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) Any person who carries on or manages an establishment or agency to which a statement of minimum standards under this section applies shall be guilty of an offence if that establishment or agency does not comply with the statement of minimum standards.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment moves us into territory already discussed. The Minister, in arguing against the point that I was making, suggested that we returned to the issue when we came to debate clause 22. It is appropriate that we do so. This probing amendment would clarify how the Bill works and in particular the inter-relationships between clauses 12(2), 22(4) and 21. The amendment proposes to leave out subsection (4) and would create an offence of not complying with the minimum standards. I envisage-he will correct me if I am wrong-that the Minister intends to use the powers under clause 21 to create by regulation an offence of failing to comply with an appropriate national minimum standard. The amendment would incorporate that provision into clause 22, rather than relying on secondary legislation in the form of a statutory instrument introducing regulation under clause 21.

<P>
At issue is whether it is more appropriate to bring in standards through statements or through regulations. The Minister has made the argument that bringing them in through statements would allow greater flexibility, perhaps using ranges of measurements rather than rigid fixed numbers, or allowing trade-offs between one area of concern and another, so that we may achieve something closer to an accurate final measure by acknowledging that, even though on one measure a certain establishment performs rather less well than we would like, that is more than counter-balanced by the fact that, on another measure, it performs better than we would require. Therefore, I accept that there is a coherent argument to be made in favour of flexible statements. However, I do not understand how regulations that draw on the statements can be implemented, because it seems to me that, if regulations that create offences are to have force, they must refer to absolute and definable things and not leave significant discretion to inspectors on the ground. I shall have something to say later about inspectors' discretion and the dangers that that introduces.

<P>
Having laid out the arguments for statements as opposed to regulations, and have established that, as I understand it, the Minister intends to lay regulations that will give force and effect to the standards, I return to our previous debate about the interaction of subsection (4)(a) with the provisions of clause 12(2), which states that, in considering an application for registration,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the registration authority is satisfied that-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the requirements of regulations under section 21  are being and will continue to be complied with  it shall grant the application; otherwise it shall refuse it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That appears to be absolute: if a person complies with the regulations under clause 21, together with the requirements of any other enactments that appear to the registration authority to be relevant, that person will be registered-no questions, no ifs, no buts and, as I understand it, no discretion.

<P>
However, clause 22(4) states that the standards laid down under clause 22
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall be taken into account-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that seems to be a very different thing-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) in the making of any decision by the registration authority under this Part;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The registration authority must both consider whether the regulations, including regulations that incorporate the minimum standards-regulations are absolute things-are being complied with, and take into account the minimum standards laid down under clause 22.

<P>
Either subsection 4(a) is redundant, in that the registration authority should not take account of national minimum standards where it is already required to register only whether it is satisfied that the regulation incorporating those national minimum standards is being complied with; or it conflicts with clause 12(2) whereby the registration authority appears to have two inconsistent requirements placed upon it in making its decision. The subject is technical and complex, but the Minister is a lawyer and I am sure that he will be able to clarify it for the benefit of the Committee. If I have misunderstood the intention, I hope he will explain exactly what subsection 4(a) means and how it interacts with clause 12(2).

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that I am a lawyer-I have a horrible sense of dÚjÓ vu. The best I can say is that I was a lawyer, but I do not regard myself as a lawyer any more for these purposes, so I have others who help me out when I get into difficulties.

<P>
To some extent we have been over this ground. I tried to explain to the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends the relationship between the regulations and the standards during our debates last week. In essence, the difficulty that he is having with clause 12 and clause 22(4)(a) might be due in part to a slight misunderstanding on his part about the regulations themselves and the way in which they will be drafted and constructed. The regulations will probably not directly refer to standards as such, although I cannot state that definitely. If that were the case, the hon. Gentleman's point might be valid. For example, in relation to room sizes, the regulations may talk about rooms ``of a sufficient size'', and the information about what constitutes sufficiency would be contained in the minimum standards themselves.

<P>
There would clearly be no point in duplication. The hon. Gentleman is concerned that we are duplicating provision. If the standards were simply incorporated lock, stock and barrel into the regulations, subsection 4(a) might look slightly otiose, because the breach of the regulations themselves would trigger the sanction to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. The reason we need to construct the edifice in the way that I have described is that we want to maintain not only as much flexibility as we can, but as much clarity as possible. There is no question but that the clarity will be there, because the minimum standards will set out clearly what the requirements will be-for example, in relation to room sizes, corridor widths, door widths or whatever-but the regulations might not refer directly to the measured room size to which the standards refer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> What will clause 12(2) add by requiring the registration authority to satisfy itself that a regulation is being complied with, if the registration authority is in any case required to take into account the standard? If the regulation is not going to be specific, but is merely going to use terms such as ``sufficient'' which have to be interpreted in accordance with the statement of minimum standards, it seems to me that subsection 4(a) alone does the job and clause 12(2) is redundant.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not agree. The hon. Gentleman should be aware of the commission's powers and duties. The commission will be able to take action in the event of a breach of the regulations; that is proper. The appropriate time for the commission to intervene and take action is when regulations approved by Parliament have been contravened by a care home owner. The standards will inform the commission's decision on whether a breach of the regulations has occurred. The hon. Gentleman may have some illustrations, but I do not want to be drawn into that.

<P>
In one or two respects, we might want to have the regulations constructed in the way that I have suggested, but with more information in the standards-partly because that allows that flexibility to which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred earlier in the debate-the need for changes and amendments to be made so that we can keep the regulatory arrangements as effective as possible and not unduly burden businesses. Care homes are businesses, as he asked me to confirm in another debate, and I am happy to do. We do not want the regulatory burden on business to be disproportionate and inappropriate. That is why, in essence, I believe that the Bill as constructed strikes the right balance between the commission's ability to take action in relation to a breach of the regulations and the responsibility of the Secretary of State to set the national minimum required standards through effective consultation with all concerned.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman might be trying to construct an argument on the basis of something that no one has yet seen. I understand that his is a probing amendment, but the origins of his confusion may lie in his having misinterpreted my earlier remarks as implying that the regulations will refer simply, in every nook and cranny, to what is in the minimum standards. That is not our intention; there is a sensible reason for separating the two, as I have said. It will not add to confusion about the obligations being placed on care home owners, because those obligations will be clearly spelled out in the regulations and standards. People will know that the standards are taken into account when deciding whether there has been a breach of the regulations, so everyone can be clear about exactly the course of action that they are required to take.

<P>
I do not want to repeat the argument endlessly because progress must be made today. We are trying to do something new and different in the procedure outlined in the Bill-for the first time, to introduce a set of national minimum required standards and a set of regulations that, as the hon. Gentleman said, will give the minimum standards the intended effect. Offences will be committed only when a breach of the regulations has occurred. That is the right way to proceed, because the regulations will have come from Parliament, so a breach of them, not a direct breach of the standards that emanate from the Secretary of State, should attract the criminal sanction.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands more clearly the relationship between the standards and the regulations. It is not true to say that we have created unnecessary legislation or duplication in the relationship between clauses 12 and 22. There is logic in the way in which this part of the Bill has been put together. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see that and be persuaded by it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister has genuinely clarified the issue, but, in allaying one concern, he has raised another. Let us use the example of room size, as that seems to be the most controversial hot topic. The Minister has told the Committee that, although no one knows what regulations will state, he envisages their referring to room sizes being ``sufficient''. I believe that the Committee understands from the debate so far that the regulations will use terms such as ``sufficient'', ``adequate'' and ``appropriate'', rather than, either directly in the regulation or by reference, incorporating a specific requirement in terms of size?

<P>
In my remarks a few minutes ago, I made the case for flexibility. There might, for example, be circumstances in which a specific standard was not met, but a related standard was exceeded. In reality, it might be appropriate to consider the whole situation rather than each category in isolation. My problem with the scenario that the Minister has spread out before me is the amount of discretion left in individuals' hands. We shall need to probe further who will have that discretion.

<P>
A registration authority must register someone if they comply with the regulation, and the regulation states room sizes shall be ``sufficient'', therefore, someone will have to interpret the meaning of ``sufficient''. Perhaps the Minister envisages that the Secretary of State will use his powers to give directions to the registration authority or to the commission-that will apply only in England-telling them how to interpret words such as ``sufficient''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I tried to make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that, if we adopt such an approach when devising the regulations, the content of ``sufficiency'', ``adequacy'' or whatever term is finally used will be informed by reference to the contents of the national minimum required standards. There will be no unidentified, discretionary area within which inspectors in the registration authority can operate. I envisage that the physical standards will be set out clearly and specifically in the national minimum required standards. Whether a care home owner is complying with a requirement for ``sufficiency'', for example, will be determined by reference to the national minimum required standards, thus the uncertainty and confusion that the hon. Gentleman has identified will be avoided.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> We appear to have gone round in a complete circle. The Minister says that the regulation may refer not to ``compliant with national minimum standard No. 10'', but to ``sufficient'', where ``sufficient'' is defined as ``complying with national minimum standard No. 10''. We appear to have gone round a purely semantic loop. I genuinely thought that the Minister had mapped out a different world in which there was intended to be discretion in interpretation that would give rise to questions about how the discretion was exercised. He has now told us that that is not what he had in mind although the standards may contain terms such as ``sufficient'' which sound imprecise, the regulations will be couched in such a way that the terms become precise by reference to something else; for example, the national minimum required standards.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon Gentleman is right to say that we are having a semantic argument, with which he wants to proceed. I tried to give illustrations, but they were purely illustrations; I was not trying to do anything other than that. As for the exercise of discretion generally, I hope that the national minimum required standards will resolve some of the issues. Other areas of discretion may need to be covered by the national minimum required standards. We shall deal with them when they are developed.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's concern that there would be an unspecified discretionary element in neither the national minimum required standards nor the regulations, leading to confusion in the care home sector, is misplaced. There is a way to balance the two, maintain the flexibility and at the same time make it quite clear to people who need the clarity precisely what they are required to do, the bands within which discretion might be exercised and how it could be exercised in relation to a wide variety of factors, some of which we have not discussed today.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman has not read too much into what I have said. There is a way to develop the argument broadly along the lines that he advocates, without falling into some of the pitfalls that his amendment would create.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful for that further clarification. I freely acknowledge that the amendment that I tabled is not the best vehicle to resolve the dilemma, but the discussion is not purely semantic. In essence, it is a discussion about whether there are to be areas of discretion in the national minimum required standards. I may be mistaken, but it seems that if a regulation is subject to the force of law and an offence is committed, it must be clear that people must not put themselves in jeopardy unwittingly. The reason for our concerns about what appears to be an opening up of areas of discretion for the commission in interpreting standards or regulations is the level playing field argument. The Minister has been at pains to emphasise that the Government intend to create a level playing field.

<P>
There are concerns about who will do the inspecting and whether they will be the same people who have done it up until now, wearing different hats. In some parts of the United Kingdom there are concerns, of which the Minister will be aware, about relationships between those inspectors and the private sector. There will be a wariness of discretion, or at least a requirement to understand how discretion is operated and the confines within which it operates. The Secretary of State has powers to give directions.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with great interest. I understand that the regulations will have statutory force, but their interpretation is part of the appeal mechanism or involves the courts. Does he think that the Minister is trying to differentiate between regulations and minimum standards pronounced by ministerial statement? Is the ministerial statement subject to challenge? Should there be an appeal as to what is reasonable or unreasonable for room sizes?

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It might be better if the Minister answers that question when he responds again in a moment. Looking at this from a pragmatic point of view, I suspect that he would rather have flexible standards that achieve the objective in the most practical and effective way. However, he will also be concerned to ensure that the exercise does not become a toothless tiger and for that reason he will want regulations that create specific offences. The tension between those objectives is causing problems.

<P>
I am not convinced that the Minister has answered my concerns. He has tried to deal with the issues, but we are all struggling because we are talking in a vacuum. We do not know what the regulations or the minimum standards will be and it might be better to deal with this matter when they are published. I may return to the issue on Report; it is important that we are clear about the relative role of regulations and standards, the degree of flexibility involved and, where there is discretion, who will be exercising it and subject to what direction. As we have come to the end of the debate on clause 22, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standard Orders Nos. 68 and 89, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Failure to comply with conditions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I should like to pause for a minute. A series of clauses go together, but, since it comes first, we may as well have the stand part debate on clause 23, which deals with offences under this part of the Bill.

<P>
I shall question the Minister on the way in which these clauses have been constructed and on the choice of some of the wording in clause 23. Comparing this clause with clause 24, there are two types of offence, the first being the failure to comply with the conditions of registration, for which a fine not exceeding level 5 would apply. That is a standard scale that amounts, I understand from the footnote to the explanatory notes, to a fine of ú5,000. Why then, in the next section, which deals with the more serious matter of contravention of the regulations, is the fine dropped to level 4, which, according to the explanatory notes is ú2,500? Will the Minister tell us why failing to comply with the conditions of registration-which could include, say not submitting forms in triplicate-should attract a more severe fine? What is the reasoning behind the different levels of fine?

<P>
This crops up elsewhere in the Bill. We hover between levels 4 and 5 throughout the Bill and unless one is a lawyer or has taken part as a juror in fining for such offences, it is difficult to understand the reasoning behind the standard scale.
 
<P>
Will the Minister also explain for illustrative purposes what would constitute ``a reasonable excuse''? Clause 23 states that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an establishment or agency  without reasonable excuse<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
could be fined. Given the state of the industry at the moment, particularly the residential care sector, does he feel that fines in the order of ú5,000 compared with one half of that are reasonable for these offences? These questions are intended to probe the thinking behind the penalties in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady might have misunderstood what clause 23 is about. She referred at one point to imposing a fine of ú5,000 on someone who had not submitted a form in triplicate. The clause is designed to protect the integrity of the conditions that the commission has imposed for the registration of an establishment or agency. These are not minor, but fundamental provisions. For example, a care home might have a condition imposed upon it that it can accommodate no more than 10 or 15 people. If it has 20, most people would accept that such an establishment would be running in serious breach of its conditions of registration. Minor or technical issues, such as the number of duplicate forms submitted, are not conditions of registration. A condition of registration relates to the fundamentals of the establishment or agency itself and it is entirely appropriate that there should be a sanction of that order.

<P>
I am happy to discuss with the hon. Lady the issues that she has raised in relation to clause 24 when we get to that debate, but I am left in some doubt as to whether she thinks that the penalty under clause 23 should be lower and that under clause 24 should be higher than those proposed. Perhaps when we get to clause 24 she will fill us in on that. This clause covers an important matter; it is not a technical or minor issue and the penalty suggested is appropriate and proportionate.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 23 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 24</center></H4>

<H4><center>Contravention of regulations</center></H4>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As the Minister has invited Opposition Members to come back to the matter, he makes a fair point. He has explained the type of offences that will be captured by clause 23. However, clause 24 would, for example, capture a person who breached a regulation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as to the promotion and protection of the health of such persons who are mentioned<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as to the control and restraint of adults accommodated in  an establishment<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
While the Minister is right to say that offences under clause 23 could be serious, it is surely also right that offences under clause 24, breaching regulations about the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>control and restraint of adults<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the control, restraint and discipline of children<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
could also be very serious.

<P>
No doubt, we all have in mind examples of bad practice that have been exposed in the past few years that could fall within this category. It is probably not helpful for the Minister to challenge my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman) by asking whether she wants the level of fines under clause 23 to go down or those under clause 24 to go up. We are questioning whether the Bill is sending the right signal. Is the worst conceivable offence under the clause really only worthy of half the punishment accorded to the worst conceivable offence under clause 23? We are genuinely surprised that there is no symmetry in the level of fines that can be imposed in this part of the Bill. The Minister may have looked at this long and hard and be quite satisfied that it is right, but many people will see it as somewhat strange.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I should be surprised if people found it strange because in clause 24 we have simply maintained at level 4 the fines that attach to existing breaches of regulations under the Registered Homes Act 1984, the Adoption Act 1976 and the Children Act 1989. The hon. Gentleman thought it was unhelpful of me to ask him and his hon. Friend the Member for Meriden whether they wanted a heavier fine. From his remarks, it strikes me that he probably believes that the fine should be heavier. That will be an interesting conversation for him to have with representatives of the care home sector, who I am sure would like to communicate with the hon. Gentleman about that proposal.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I must insist that I make my own statements and do not let the Minister make them on my behalf or I shall be in all sorts of trouble with all sorts of people. We have not said anything about what the appropriate level is; we are merely probing whether there are really such great disparities in the seriousness of offences under the clauses that make the different levels of fine appropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I genuinely was not trying to put words in the hon. Gentleman's mouth. From his comments, I understood that he felt that the offences under clause 24 that would exact a fine at level 4 did not attract a sufficiently high penalty.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister cannot be serious.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Quite; that is how it sounded to me. The hon. Gentleman has tried to resolve that issue his way. I believe that the balance that has been struck between clauses 23 and 24 is the right one. My own strong sense is that breaches of the conditions of registration should attract the most serious penalty. That is why we have fixed it at level 5. That is entirely the right signal to send out to the public and to the industry. However, we are talking about a different situation in relation to a breach of regulations where a fine at level 4 is entirely appropriate. It is the level at which fines have been set for many years and we do not see any justification for either increasing or reducing it.

<P>
It is worth pointing out to the hon. Gentleman that it might be possible in some circumstances to prosecute a care home owner for more than one breach of one regulation, so the fine in total could be much higher than the ú2,500 at level 4 that would be incurred for one breach. There is plenty of provision in clause 24 to ensure the sort of protection for the public that the hon. Gentleman proposes. If he is suggesting that we should increase the fine in the clause to level 5, we look forward to seeing his amendment at some point in the future, but we believe that the level is right for the reasons that I have described. I hope that hon. Members will feel that clause 24 should form part of the Bill.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 24 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 25</center></H4>
<H4><center>Holding out premises as an establishment or agency</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 14, line 36, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) No person shall, with intent to deceive any person, in any way describe or hold out an establishment or agency as able to provide any service or do any thing the provision or doing of which would contravene a condition for the time being in force by virtue of this Part in respect of the establishment or agency.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(4) A person who contravenes subsection (3) shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is simple. Clause 25 makes it an offence for a person to misrepresent the nature of an establishment or agency to deceive someone into thinking that it is a different type of establishment or agency. The amendment simply extends the offence to cover conditions of registration as well, so that it would be an offence to describe or present an establishment or agency as able to do something that would contravene its conditions of registration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> We have no problem with the amendment, which seems a sensible extension to the provisions of clause 25. Once again, it proposes a fine not exceeding level 5. At the risk of continuing the debate, the Minister appears to be trying to nail on me the tag of someone who wants to increase penalties. That is certainly not the case, but I do like to see consistency. I would need to be convinced that the different levels proposed in different clauses of the Bill genuinely reflect the different levels of seriousness of the offence. It may simply be that the gap between levels 4 and 5 is larger than comfort would dictate: we might all feel more comfortable if there were a level 4.5.

<P>
I am certainly not-nor would I want to be-soft on people who consciously and wilfully commit offences. The Minister will see that I have tabled amendments that tighten up the responsibilities of directors for offences by corporate bodies. I am not afraid of standing up and saying that proper penalties should be in place where people have offended and done so wilfully or negligently, but I hope that the Minister would agree that it is important for the general principle of confidence in the law that penalties are seen to be appropriate and proportional to the offences committed and consistent in their application.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
There is a six-month time limit for the prosecution of summary offences, but the registration authority may not be able to bring a prosecution within that time scale because it may only find evidence of the offence more than six months after it has been committed. The amendment would allow prosecutions to be brought within six months of the evidence coming to light. Section 56A(4) of the Adoption Act 1976 contains a similar provision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 15, line 19, after ``officer'' insert ``or member''.

<P>
The amendment will allow members as well as officers of a local authority to be prosecuted for offences under this part. The offence must be proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of the person, or to be attributable to neglect on his or her part. Members of a local authority are ultimately responsible for the actions of the officers, so it is only right that they should be equally liable for prosecution.

<P>
The amendment would also bring the provisions for local authorities into line with the provision for corporate bodies. I hope that the Committee will accept it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> We are making splendid progress now, which is in the nature of the Bill. Some areas are very straightforward and others are more controversial and need more time spent on them. We happen to be in a relatively uncontroversial area at the moment, and I am delighted to say that we are more than supportive of the Government amendment. This is the right way to go in reasserting the responsibilities that elected local councillors have for the actions of their authority.

<P>
When I said earlier that I was not afraid to propose measures that are tough on people who commit offences, I was thinking of clause 28 in particular. It is clearly right that councillors should bear the same responsibility in relation to the actions of their officers as directors of a company bear. If I may take the opportunity to probe the Minister, I am interested in the requirements for a director, manager or secretary of a body corporate to be caught by the provisions of subsection (2). For that to happen, the director, manager or secretary must have connived in the act. Could the Minister confirm to the Committee whether the clause is sufficiently widely constructed to capture a director, or indeed a councillor, who has been negligent in exercising the degree of control that he should have done? Does it require active connivance or complicity in the offence in the Bill, or is it sufficient that the person who might be vulnerable to prosecution has simply failed in the duty to control those people at the sharp end carrying out these acts and doing these things?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It might help the hon. Gentleman if I remind him of the wording of clause 28(2). He will see a reference there to the neglect of the person who is being faced with prosecution. If he was asking me to confirm that the breadth of the provision was sufficient to encompass neglect on his or her part, then the answer is very clearly yes.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 217, in page 15, line 33, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`for the purpose of verifying compliance with regulations made under this part and statements made under section 22'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

No. 220, in page 16, line 8, at end insert

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in accordance with regulations made under this part and statements made under section 22'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Having made some sparkling progress, we now come to another one of the little firebreaks in this Bill that affect the possibility of moving rapidly forward. As the Bill is drafted, clause 29 allows the registration authority to require a person to provide it with information that it considers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>necessary or expedient to have for the purposes of its functions under this Part.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 212 would narrow that down. That is a wide definition as it covers any information that the commission would consider necessary or expedient to have for all of its functions under this part. The proper purpose of this provision is that, in seeking to establish whether an establishment or agency is properly complying with the regulations and any conditions that have been imposed upon it, the inspectors might require disclosure of information. The amendment seeks, therefore, to narrow down what can be demanded by the registration authority to that which is strictly necessary for the carrying out of its functions.

<P>
As the Bill is worded, the registration authority might be able to demand information that a registered person was preparing, for example, for the purposes of mounting an appeal under clause 20. It would be expedient to the registration authority for carrying out its functions under this part to have sight of the appellant's argument in advance of the appeal hearing. It would not, however, be right that they should be able to use their powers under the Bill to get hold of that information. That is the purpose of amendment No. 212.

<P>
Amendment No. 217 would limit the intrusive power being given to the registration authority. We acknowledge that in some cases it will be necessary for them to have an intrusive power. It is important, however, that there should be a limit on that power and that it should be properly defined so that it cannot be abused in any way. The amendment would modify subsection 29(3)(a), which allows the registration authority to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make any examination into the state and management of the premises and treatment of patients or persons accommodated or cared for there which he thinks appropriate;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment again seeks to limit that. There is an issue here about access to patient records and information about the management and treatment of patients. It is appropriate to define relatively narrowly the access that inspectors are given in view of the sensitivity of the area under discussion.

<P>
Amendment No. 220 would tackle the same sort of issue. ``Proper care'' is a wide and general term. The power mentioned should be related to the verification of compliance with regulations and standards. I take it as read that regulations and statements of minimum standards will lay down standards of proper care and regulations requiring the delivery of proper care under this part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I would be grateful for some clarification of the effect of amendment No. 217. Will it mean that, before an inspection takes place, a case has to be made on which part of the regulations may be in breach?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I do not think that it would work that way. It would merely constrain the behaviour of inspectors, who would be accountable for their actions if it turned out after the event that they had acted ultra vires. We are seeking to give the inspector guidance: to constrain their ability to exercise those powers. It will be a familiar theme to the Minister and I do not want to overdo it. However, he is already aware from the consultations that his Department has carried out across the sector, that there are some old hostilities out there. There are some suspicions, born of relationships that have been established under the old system over quite long periods of time. The powers that are to be exercised must be clearly defined and constrained to those that are really needed to achieve the purposes of the Bill. They must also be laid out objectively so that there are no more opportunities than strictly necessary for flashpoints and for conflict between inspectors going into an establishment and the people managing it. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some assurance about the tightness of the definitions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Amendments Nos. 212, 217 and 220 would provide that some of the registration authority's powers under clause 29 could be exercised only to verify compliance with the regulations and national minimum standards. The amendment would make it impossible for the National Care Standards Commission to use those powers to ensure compliance with any conditions that attached to the registration of an establishment or agency. Clearly, that would be unhelpful to the commission and would weaken the extent of the public protection that it was able to discharge in exercising its powers. It would be a regrettable state of affairs if the powers could be used only in the two situations that the hon. Gentleman identified. We need to ensure that the commission can exercise the powers to ensure proper compliance with the conditions, as opposed to the registration, of an establishment or agency.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
In any case, the Bill is not drafted to give carte blanche powers to inspect and examine anything. The functions of the registration authority are clearly set out in the Bill and its inspectors can act only within those parameters. In other words, inspectors cannot do anything that the commission is unable to do. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see that as a restricting parameter.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the possibility that subsection (1) could be used by the National Care Standards Commission to secure advance disclosure of material relating to an appeal that an establishment or agency had lodged with the tribunal. That is not the case. The procedure on appeals, including the disclosure of information for the purposes of the appeal, will be governed by the rules relating to the tribunal. The disclosure in advance of information by parties who are conducting litigation is already provided for. There is no suggestion that there would be any need-or possibility-to use clause 29(1) along the lines that the hon. Gentleman suggested. In that regard, his amendments would be unhelpful and unnecessary and I hope that I have been able to reassure him, if not entirely, at least to some extent, about his concerns.

<P>
Amendment No. 220 raises a separate issue. We have used the term ``proper care'' without further qualification in clause 29(5)(b), because we want a registered medical practitioner or nurse to be able to check that it is provided. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight may have a view on this, but it would seem inappropriate to set out what is meant by ``proper care'' in regulations and standards: we could not aim to specify every kind of care or clinical intervention and the circumstances in which they should be used. Such matters should be left to the judgment of medical practitioners or nurses, taking into account the specific needs and condition of the person concerned.

<P>
I should reassure the hon. Gentleman that ``proper care'' has not been plucked out of thin air. The term is used in section 35 of the Registered Homes Act 1984 and is similarly undefined, for precisely the reasons that I have tried to explain to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I appreciate what the Minister has said: it explains the thinking behind the subsection. Will he take us on through the process? Is it intended to be part of a quasi-judicial process in which, when someone is not receiving proper care, a suitably qualified inspector can examine them? I think that this is part of a process that may lead to someone being found guilty of something and that there will have to be a reference to ``proper care''-perhaps in a regulation-if that is to be the case. Is the Minister satisfied that the definition is sufficiently objective and will stand up to incorporation into regulations if necessary?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am trying to explain to the hon. Gentleman that we do not want to incorporate the concept of proper care in regulations for the reasons that I have outlined. If we were to try to do so, we should make the system almost unmanageable. To establish whether proper care has been delivered should be a matter for the professional judgment of a medical practitioner or nurse. Such issues are always justiciable, in that an establishment or agency could lodge an appeal to the tribunal; the issue of ``proper care'' would then have to be addressed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Perhaps I did not make my question clear. What happens if the medical practitioner determines that someone is not receiving proper care and then examines them? If the Minister does not want to incorporate the concept of proper care into regulations, what remedy will the commission have?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It is possible that we could use ``proper care'' in regulations. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was asking me to define ``proper care'' in regulations. I was not trying to suggest that there would be no reference to the concept of ``proper care'' in regulations, because that would clearly trigger precipitant action. However, there are genuine reasons why we would not want to define ``proper care'' in regulations.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I should be concerned if ``proper care'' was too closely defined. Different standards might apply to different people, allowing care home residents choice in how they live. I am mindful of one of my patients who is a lady tramp. From time to time we manage to persuade her to enter a residential home. She is cared for very well by the home, but at a standard that she is prepared to accept. It would not be ``proper care'' for the other residents.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not think that we should go there today, but I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point to the Committee.

<P>
I hope that I have been able to reassure the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, and I apologise if I gave him the wrong impression of how we intend to develop this part of the Bill through regulations. There may well be a need to improve the concept of ``proper care'' in the regulations, avoiding the pitfall into which his amendment would plunge us, developing regulations that would define ``proper care'' in the context of the Bill. That approach was not taken in the Registered Homes Act 1984. For perfectly sensible reasons, we do not intend to follow it either.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for addressing the issues that I raised, especially in relation to amendment No. 220. He has conveyed information to me in his answer that plants new ideas in my mind, and I shall go away and think about them. I am pleased that I have elicited clarification from him, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 213, in page 15, line 26, after ``time'', insert ``during normal working hours''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 214, in page 15, line 28, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) For the purposes of this section ``normal working hours'' means the hours during which premises are routinely used for business purposes and in the case of an establishment providing accommodation, means any time at which any person is accommodated at the premises.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 215, in page 15, line 28, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A person authorised under subsection (2) may enter and inspect premises without notice during daylight hours and on the giving of notice not less than one hour before entering (such notice to be given in writing or verbally to the person for the time being in charge of the establishment) at all other times.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 216, in page 15, line 28, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A person authorised under subsection (2) shall report his presence at the premises upon arrival to the manager or other person in charge at the time.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The purpose of our amendments is to try to help the Government to strike a reasonable balance in the inspection procedure. We learnt a great deal about inspection procedures from debating with the Government the Food Standards Bill. There are parallels with the inspection procedure proposed in this Bill.

<P>
Our immediate concern is that without modification it would be possible for an inspector to arrive unannounced in the middle of the night and to enter and inspect premises, causing not a little alarm. When we were debating the Food Standards Bill, the problem that arose with an unannounced inspection of a butcher's shop, for example, was that the rumour would go round the village in about five minutes that the Food Standards Agency's inspectors had been there. In commercial terms, I am afraid that the same would be true with care homes. The arrival of an inspector at a care home would be bound to set tongues wagging; it is human nature.

<P>
A number of modifications to the way in which inspections are carried out would introduce a little more reasonableness. Although we recognise the need for a spot check, a spot check would be the reason for such modification. Amendment No. 213 would stipulate that the inspection be during normal working hours. In a residential agency-any residential care home-normal working hours are around the clock. The Bill regulates a huge range of establishments and agencies, some of which are clinics that are open only during the day. It is important to carry out inspections when the clinics are in operation. The people who run and manage those clinics would, justifiably, have an adverse reaction to their premises being inspected when they were not there.

<P>
The request to provide not less than one hour's notice, verbally or in writing, would not prevent spot checks, but would give a residential care home a chance. It might be in the middle of a procedure and find an inspection difficult; it might also find it difficult to make available the facilities required later in the Bill. One hour's notice would not give a residential care home the chance substantially to alter the physical standards of what they had on offer, as little would change in that time. However, there is no question that when premises are inspected, a frisson of alarm goes through the place; one has only to talk to teachers about Ofsted inspections to know that everyone wants to be on their best mettle for an inspection. One hour's notice does not give an unreasonable advantage to the establishment in that respect.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that although one hour may not be the right period, it is not reasonable to require people to answer their doors in darkness without notice? Some form of notice must be given to deal with that inappropriate knock on the door in the middle of the night.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> Absolutely. These are probing amendments to discover what could be done to ensure that, in their zeal, the inspectors do not make matters more difficult than they need to be.

<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I understand the hon. Lady's point. As I listened to her, I was reminded of a recent incident in my constituency, when the management of a health trust decided to carry out a visit primarily to check the night service staff in a hospital for people with learning difficulties. When the health trust management arrived in the middle of the night, wearing badges that clearly identified who they were, several of the staff who were supposed to be responsible for the care of the patients were asleep. Had they been given one hour-or any other period-of notice, staff could have avoided being so discovered. In such circumstances we must be careful about the period of notice given.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The normal working hours of a residential home are 24 hours a day, so the amendment is directed not at such homes but at establishments such as cosmetic surgery clinics. Anyone sleeping over the shop would be less than chuffed to hear a knock on the door in the middle of the night and find that it was an inspector. The amendment is designed to avoid an unnecessary flashpoint. Staff who may be asleep would be woken by a knock at the door anyway; inspectors would have to enter by stealth to catch people sleeping when they should be on duty.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) made an interesting point but we must also consider the matter of harassment. My noble Friend Earl Howe cited the example of a care home that had 11 unannounced visits in a month, some of them at night. There must be safeguards and provisions in the Bill to prevent harassment. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is one of the purposes of the amendment?

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I agree. I hope that the Minister will tell us that there will be a reason to carry out the spot checks that are designed to catch out anyone who would not expect such a visit. I hope that in the case of the establishment that was inspected 11 times in one month, there was good reason to carry out that frequency of inspection. If not, it would clearly constitute unreasonable harassment.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The final amendment in the group seeks to find out a little more about how the procedure will be carried out. The Bill places quite a lot of responsibility on the managers of establishments to be answerable for what happens there. It is only reasonable to try to introduce into the inspection procedure the undertaking that the inspector should report his presence to the manager immediately upon his arrival. It would ask too much of a manager to expect him to be unaware that an inspeciton is taking place. He could justifiably argue that he should have been informed immediately upon the inspector's arrival.

<P>
If my job depended on such an inspection, I should want to be informed as soon as the clock started ticking and the inspectors were scrutinising the way that my staff and I carried out the implementation of the national minimum standards. I would not want to hear about it afterwards, or halfway through, and to find that my rather startled members of staff had been unsure about what procedures they should carry out upon the inspector's arrival. The amendments try to strike the balance between what is reasonable and what is unreasonable in relation to the inspection of the wide range of establishments that the Bill covers, even though many of them house quite vulnerable and elderly residents, whose anxiety levels are likely to be raised if they are aware of such an inspection.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I am disturbed by the amendments and by the arguments that have been made in support of them. I should have thought that Members on both sides of the Committee would want to encourage a culture in which the concept of inspection is embraced as a positive experience for both users of care and care workers. It should not be seen as the alien, threatening and intrusive force that the hon. Lady described. There is no circumstance in which we should deny the possibility of properly inspecting establishments that carry out extremely important functions with vulnerable people. Inspection at the drop of a hat should be included in the process.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is thinking of a residential establishment, but the clause will cover establishments that are locked up and unoccupied at night. How is the inspector to gain access? [
Interruption.] The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that it would cover agencies and establishments that operate in the day time only. Are the inspectors to have power of forcible entry? What does the hon. Gentleman understand by the broader application of the clause?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am concerned about the broad remarks from the Opposition. It did not appear to me from what was said that amendment No. 215, on the hour's notice, did not necessarily relate to residential establishments and it is unlikely that it will. If we are talking about day care establishments-which, again, operate extremely important services for vulnerable people during daylight hours-I do not see anything wrong with somebody being required to be accountable and responsive to the inspection services.

<P>
The way that the Opposition are challenging this part of the legislation concerns me. I would expect Members from all parties to acknowledge that inspection is extremely important. It can help to preserve standards, not only for those who live-in or receive services from inspected establishments, but for those who work in them. Far from there being a feeling of panic or a frisson of anxiety about inspectors arriving, they should be welcomed in and the results of inspection should be used to assist people to develop and improve care standards.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman describes an ideal world, but does he recognise that, in many areas, there are deep-rooted suspicions and hostilities between the inspectors and the inspected?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am grateful for those remarks, but I am not describing an ideal world. There need to be avenues for people to raise issues about whether an inspection was, for example, carried out professionally, disturbed some of those in the establishment or left unattended some of the basic issues with which staff deal. That sort of instructive dialogue is part of a proper professional inspection process. My objection to what has been said by the Opposition is that they seem to feel that there inevitably will be a barrier between inspectors and inspected. I hope that the Bill takes everyone involved in these services, especially the users, much further along the road of development and improvement, using inspection in the best way.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> At first I was sympathetic to this group of amendments, but then the hon. Member for Meriden began to talk about amendment No. 215-which is not to be moved. One would hope that the relationship between responsible providers and inspection units would always be positive. There will be points of tension, as there should be when we are talking about raising standards. There are also occasions when one knows that something is wrong in a home, but cannot find the evidence. Under those circumstances it would be ridiculous to have to give an hour's notice before inspecting it. Within that time, beds can be changed, people can be untied from their lavatories and so on.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that there are powers for inspectors to interview residents and staff in homes? He is developing an elaborate conspiracy theory, whereby all sorts of things that are being done wrong are covered up and then everybody in the place is silenced and refuses to talk. Does that not strike him as slightly unlikely?

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am afraid that the evidence of many inquiries into not only children's homes but old people's homes-especially those for old people who are mentally frail-is that there is such a conspiracy of silence. I have told my local inspection registration unit that I am unhappy with what is happening at a certain place; I cannot put my finger on it but I believe that the unit should go in there. It is essential that the inspectorate have the power to do that. One hopes that that power will not have to be used for the responsible providers in the sector, and the large majority are now responsible. There were a great many cowboys in the past, but I am glad to say that they have been largely weeded out.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I respect the hon. Gentleman's personal knowledge that he is conveying to the Committee. Perhaps I can phrase the question slightly differently. Will he accept that these rather draconian powers might be appropriate only in the case of some specific types of establishment in their most draconian form?

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> That is a question inviting the answer yes, but I do not think so. Day centres can be very tight little communities where instead of having a positive atmosphere, some very negative things can be going on. I imagine that in agencies, cosmetic surgery clinics and so on there are imperfect people in an imperfect world. I am glad to say not many, but the powers must be there to weed out irresponsible and abusive practice. It is a balance that has to be struck. It is clearly right that whoever inspects gets in touch with the person in charge, but it is also right that whoever inspects has the ability to talk to residents and to staff without that person in charge being present. We all know the powers that some people in charge have over hiring and firing and whether people are fed the next day.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Given the scenario that the hon. Gentleman has outlined, would he then support the idea of extending that type of inspection, for example, to NHS institutions-unannounced, middle-of-the-night, external inspections to make sure people are not asleep who are not meant to be asleep and to make sure nothing is happening that should not be happening?

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> As the hon. Gentleman well knows, I have been in favour of a common regulatory and inspection regime for the private and NHS sectors. Indeed, when the Health Committee did its inquiry into NHS staffing, it was quite alarming to go round the country, asking members of staff whether they had ever met a non-executive director. Very few of them had, and none that I spoke to had met a non-executive director at night. They were people who were responsible for what happened in their unit, and it is an area where unannounced visits should be welcomed. People often feel isolated working at night and they are proud to show off excellent practice.

<P>
We do not need to be defensive about the need to inspect properly. Only if it is done properly does inspection become a positive measure. I very much support what was said earlier. I would find it difficult to accept the mood behind the amendments. Inspection is not about the providers; it is about the residents, the clients and the patients. For that reason, I would certainly not support any of the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Again, I shall assume, despite what the hon. Member for Meriden said, that she tabled the amendments as probing amendments. For the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) and by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, she cannot be serious about them as actual proposals to include in the Bill. I assume that she is trying to extract some indication from the Government of how the powers would be used.

<P>
I shall certainly try to reassure the hon. Lady about the amendments. The amendments have four fundamental problems. They are mistaken, because they would weaken the National Care Standards Commission's powers to secure proper public protection. They are technically deficient, for reasons that I will set out shortly. They would create additional loopholes for unscrupulous people to exploit, and we are determined that the Bill should not create a further set of loopholes. Despite what the hon. Member for Meriden said, the amendments would clearly prevent many unannounced inspections from taking place, particularly at night, and we need to ensure that such a power is available.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge intervened on the hon. Member for Meriden to try to get the arguments back on track, and said that the powers were draconian. That is complete nonsense. We are not creating the infrastructure of a new police state. The hon. Gentleman can trace the ancestry of the powers to sections 17 and 35 of the Registered Homes Act 1984. I am not sure what has suddenly compelled the Opposition to draw the conclusion that we are establishing unnecessary powers of inspection that are not available under the existing legislation.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> For the Committee's benefit, will the Minister clarify what the inspector's powers of entry are when premises are locked? Do inspectors have the powers to forcibly enter premises or to enter unattended premises?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> No, inspectors will not have the powers to force entry. It is an offence under clause 29(9) to obstruct an inspector's entry, but that is not a new offence. Only the police have the powers forcibly to enter private premises when necessary. The National Care Standards Commission's inspectors will not have such powers, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured by that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister show me where that is made clear in the Bill? Clause 29(2) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person authorised  may at any time enter and inspect premises which are used, or which he has reasonable cause to believe to be used, as an establishment or for the purposes of an agency.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems to embrace entry at night to premises used during the day for one of those purposes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Yes, but it is clear that the inspector does not have the power to force entry. The clause refers to access to premises, but I do not interpret it as giving powers to effect forced entry. That would be unnecessary, and it is not our intention for the Bill, so the concerns that the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Meriden raised are misplaced.

<P>
While we consider whether to accept the amendments, we must be clear about several issues that they raise. Amendment No. 214 defines normal working hours as meaning at any time at which any person is accommodated at the premises, for the purposes of the the amendments. That definition might be broad in practice to include care homes, which I think were the principal concern of the hon. Member for Meriden, but I doubt whether it would be sufficient to cover private hospitals, which might be registered to provide emergency or acute care, but which do not accommodate people.

<P>
That definition would effectively prevent unannounced inspections from taking place, because it would allow the registration authority to inspect a home or agency only if someone were present. Before it carried out an inspection, the authority would have to check with a home whether that condition was being fulfilled. That would fundamentally compromise the commission's ability to perform any unannounced inspections. The amendment would create a loophole by which a care home owner could claim that a home had no residents to remove the inspectors' right of entry, but it would not give the inspectors any powers of entry to establish whether that claim was true.

<P>
If a provider does not supply a 24-hour service, the registration authority will normally carry out inspections only during a normal working day. It would be a waste of the commission's resources and time routinely to send inspectors to inspect agencies that were closed, for example, because inspectors would not have the power to break into those premises. There is thus no need for the amendment.

<P>
Amendment No. 215 would require the authorised inspetors to give at least an hour's notice of an inspection taking place out of daylight hours. The power to inspect at any time is an important feature of the Bill. It gives strong powers to ensure the protection of service users and replicates the power contained in the Registered Homes Act 1984. The amendment would severely limit the powers of the commission to carry out an inspection as and when necessary. It would effectively preclude inspectors from carrying out unannounced inspections during most of the winter hours. There should be no difference between summer and winter in deciding whether there should be unannounced inspections.

<P>
Amendment No. 216 provides that an inspector would have to report to the manager or other person in charge of the establishment on arrival to carry out an inspection. There is an obvious logic behind the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Meriden, and I understand her point, but it would be unwise to include the amendment in the Bill because it would compromise the effectiveness of an unannounced inspection. We must ensure that the powers can be used effectively and properly for the intended purpose; to protect residents and the people who use the services provided by the establishments or agencies.

<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden's amendment triggered an unnecessary debate. I understand that people are worried about how the powers could be used but they must be used in respect of the commission's functions, and the commission must act reasonably. The hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge have rather over-egged their anxieties. We must ensure that the commission has effective powers at its disposal and it must use those powers reasonably. But it must have sufficient powers properly to protect the public interest. The amendments would make it harder for the National Care Standards Commission to do that because it would create further loopholes in the Bill that we should try to prevent. The amendments are fundamentally misplaced because they assume that the National Care Standards Commission will be a new, Stasi-style organisation that will terrorise care home owners and those who run private hospitals. That is untrue and unfounded; these are not draconian powers in the sense that the hon. Gentleman described them. They were powers first established and created by his party when it was in Government and we should not lose sight of that. The issue is how the powers are exercised, and they will be exercised reasonably. There is no justification for withdrawing or restricting them as the Opposition propose.

<P>
I said that I assumed that these were probing amendments; it would be helpful if the hon. Lady would confirm that that is so and that she does not want the powers to be restricted as the amendments propose.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. If there were no examples of inspectors abusing the powers that he is trying to transfer to the Bill I would be more comfortable with what he says. There are cases similar to that cited in the other place of a care home being inspected 11 times in one month. A climate of fear is to unusual in an establishment when the inspectors turn up.

<P>
In another case cited in the other place, inspectors took advantage of minor breaches in standards, such as the failure to display a certificate, to intimidate the owners into doing what they said. The standards are still at the consultation stage, but there are several minimum standards that willl have practical consequences for the establishments. Many care home owners are fearful that an inspector will arrive unannounced, find that the double lock is missing from a resident's room and haul them over the coals for it. That is one of the consequences of the Bill but also the consultative indication of the direction in which some of these national standards will go. We were just trying to put a shot across the Government's bows. Sometimes inspections are carried out not in the nice, friendly manner described by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. He made an important point and highlighed the fact that there is no procedure to appeal against the way in which an inspection has been carried out.

<P>
There are inspectors who have a clipboard mentality-and who go around an establishment looking for where it fails-rather than a helpful mentality. The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre suggested his experience was of the latter where inspectors worked in tandem together to try to improve standards. There is a big difference in attitude in the way in which an inspection is carried out and the way in which an establishment being inspected views the experience. Our amendment was intended to flag up that inspections can put people's backs up. We have now heard that these inspections will be carried out in a reasonable manner. While we believe that that is the Minister's intention, it does have to be translated right down to the grassroots. There, people with real power carry out this inspection procedure with a clipboard that may eventually cause an establishment to cease operation or be fined and so on.

<P>
Our amendments were trying to strike that balance and we would urge the Minister to find a way of translating his view of what is reasonable right down to the level of the inspectors; effective, but also reasonable.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am happy to give the hon. Lady an assurance that we will do that. I just draw two things to her attention. She has expressed a concern that there will be no way of challenging what she described as unreasonable behaviour by inspectors employed by the National Care Standards Commission. That is not true. There will be, for example, the opportunity to make a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner. We will make sure that there is a proper complaints procedure in place for dealing with complaints about how inspectors go about their business. If necessary, we will use our powers of direction to ensure this although I do not think that will be necessary. I hope that will, at least in part, reassure the hon. Lady.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> It is helpful to know that the complaints procedure will exist at the direction of the Secretary of State and it might be helpful if that were to be made perfectly clear in the Bill before all this is cut and dried. It was obviously not clear to us that such a procedure would be brought into being and perhaps we still have a chance to address this.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I emphasise that this is a professional process. I am confident that inspectors-whether employed by local health authorities, as now, or by the National Care Standards Commission in the future-will be making reports available to proprietors of care homes and there will be the opportunity for feedback and professional discussion of the issues raised. We are talking about a proper professional process carried out by people of ability and understanding. Although evocative, the image of someone coming round with a clipboard and making little ticks is wrong. We are talking about a much more profound process.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> We shall come later to the question of appropriate qualifications for inspectors and others.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I want to correct one thing; the hon. Lady implied that people were unaware that we had suggested there would be a proper complaints procedure by which care home owners could complain about the behaviour of particular inspectors. We did in fact make that very clear in the passage of this Bill in another place. There is no truth in the suggestion that we had not already made that clear.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> This is where Hansard becomes a complementary handbook to the interpretation of the Bill. Thank goodness we have Hansard for that purpose. However, it would be helpful for all those who read the Act in due course if the procedure were made perfectly clear. Perhaps we shall seek to ensure that later.

<P>
I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said, and it is possible to strip away comments about establishments. It would be absurd if a care home were empty, and its owner said that it should not be inspected for that reason. If a care home did not have any residents, it would not exist, because it is only with residents that a care home runs as an economic entity. We have heard a few examples that, in an effort to quash the purpose of our amendments, have gone beyond what is practical. However, we accept the Minister's point about seeking to ensure that the powers are exercised reasonably. Enjoining him to ensure that that is true on the ground, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 70, in page 15, line 34, after ``any'' insert ``documents or''.-[Mr. Hutton.]

<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>( ) interview in private by arrangement with the manager or person carrying on the establishment or agency during normal working hours any person employed there who is not present at the premises during the inspection;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is designed to tidy up the clause, and I hope that the Minister will welcome it in principle, even if he does not accept the drafting. Clause 29(3)(c) envisages the inspector going on to the premises and interviewing an employee whom he finds there, which is a perfectly reasonable procedure. During the passage of the Bill in the other place, the words ``in private'' were inserted to ensure that the inspector could interview an employee in private, if he felt that it was appropriate to do so.

<P>
The amendment would make explicit what I imagine is understood by the clause. The employee is an employee who is present on the premises at the time of the inspection. However, the nature of such establishments is that many employees work shifts and are not prsent on a predictable basis. It is perfectly reasonable that an inspector might want to arrange to interview an employee who is not present on the premises. Rather than a hit-and-miss process-perhaps this is what lies behind the example quoted by my noble Friend, Earl Howe, in the other place-in which the inspectors must return to the establishment umpteen times over a few days in the hope of getting lucky and finding the person whom they want to interview, they would arrange with the manager of the establishment to interview during normal working hours an employee who was not present at the time of the inspection.

<P>
The amendment represents a simple clarification and tidying-up exercise. It would make the inspection process operate more smoothly for everyone and remove another potential flashpoint in the relationship between the management of the establishment and the inspectors, if they felt that they had to resort to other methods to speak to a particular employee.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am listening with great interest. I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could explain why the arrangements must be made with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the manager or person carrying on the establishment or agency.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Obviously, it is sensible to arrange to interview someone, but to make such arrangements through the very person who may be causing anxiety in the first place seems hard on potential whistleblowers.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It is self-evident that there is no other person through whom the interview could be arranged. The employee is not on the premises, so the person in charge must be the conduit.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I do not understand the self-evidence of that. There are unions, work colleagues, patients, clients and residents-all of whom may have some input. It does not necessarily have to go through the manager or person in charge.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I simply put it to the hon. Gentleman that no other person present would have the authority to require an employee of the manager or person running the establishment to be present by arrangement at a certain time in order to be interviewed. Only the employer has such authority.

<P>
Dr. Brand indicated dissent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but it is not clear whether seeking out the union representative to make an arrangement would necessarily be productive. The employer will know the rostering of staff and will be able to direct his staff to an arranged interview at the specified time. It had not occurred to me that this aspect of the amendment would prove controversial. The amendment would provide a helpful mechanism to allow inspectors to do their work without having to come back on a hit-and-miss basis and give them an opportunity to interview an employee who is not present through the normal course of shift-work rotas when the inspection is made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge for trying to help us with the drafting of the Bill. He has made a reasonable argument, but I profoundly disagree with him about the effect of his amendment. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight made the point better than I could. I do not want to labour the point, but the practical effect would be that an interview could take place only through the auspices of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the manager or person carrying on the establishment or agency,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it is difficult to conceive how that could ensure the necessary public protection and effective inspection arrangements that we all seek. As the hon. Member for Isle of Wight said, it would make matters difficult for the potential whistleblower if he felt that the owner or manager knew that the inspectors were interviewing him.

<P>
Mr. Hammond indicated dissent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but he spoke about the real world and we should be honest about the real world. It is crucial for the inspector to have the ability to talk directly to other employees, including those who may not have been on the premises at the time-especially when abuse may be involved. Abuse is unusual, because the vast majority of care home owners work hard to secure the welfare and interests of their residents, but it can happen.

<P>
The amendment would make it harder, not easier, to get to the bottom of things-and unnecessarily so. I do not understand why the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge wants the inspectors' only conduit to staff members-as he said in response to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight-to be through employers. By definition, that is unsound and unwise. He argued that that was the only possible way to proceed, but that is not true either. The inspectors will have access to staff records in the care home and could arrange to meet other members of staff in other establishments. The hon. Gentleman's argument is unsound.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister used the term ``whistleblower'' and his arguments are made in the light of that concept. Someone who has something to say and wants to blow a whistle will be able to contact the commissioners and will be aware of the local office as a point of contact. Some may be willing to meet the inspectors outside normal working hours or away from the premises. I do not believe that we have a problem with whistleblowers. The problem that I see is that subsection (3)(d) allows the inspectors to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>interview in private any person employed there-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
whether he is there or not. Can they go to his home? Can they knock on his door? Is he obliged to let them in? Does he have to give them the opportunity to interview him, in private, outside his normal working hours? I do not think that that is what the Minister intended. I have been suggesting that the inspectors should have an arranged opportunity to interview him, at the employer's expense, in normal working hours, during the employee's time of employment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Again, the hon. Gentleman is confusing several different issues. Of course we cannot coerce people into giving interviews; there is no power to compel someone to give an interview to the National Care Standards Commission inspectorate. However, nor would we want, as the hon. Gentleman's amendment clearly would require-unless he would like to explain to the Committee how it works differently-to confine the opportunity to interview other staff employed by an establishment to those arranged through the employer. I do not see any purpose or value in constricting the opportunities for the National Care Standards Commission inspectorate to interview staff in that way. However he likes to put it, inevitably it is bound to lead to some inhibition-if, for example, the member of staff has something to say with which the care home owner might find difficult to deal.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is right in another sense. There is nothing to stop any member of staff employed by an establishment going directly to the care standards commission with information; we would encourage them to do that. However, we are talking by definition about the legal arrangements by which the interviews will be conducted and arranged. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would permit only interviews that, effectively, had been approved by the employer. If the employer chooses not to arrange the interview, the interview cannot take place-by definition under the hon. Gentleman's amendment. It is clear that the amendment would have the effect of putting the care home owner in complete control of the process of interviewing staff employed by the care home. That cannot be in the public interest.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I certainly assure the Minister that that was not the intention of the amendment. The intention was that the manager or the person in charge would have the duty to arrange such an interview where the inspectors required it. Will the Minister answer a specific question? Are the inspectors empowered, having looked at the staff records, to go to the private home of an individual whom they wish to interview? If not, how in practice will they be able to interview him without finding out from the manager when he will be at work and arranging to come back at that time?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has asked two questions. He is quite wrong about the amendment, as I understand it. It is clear that there is not an obligation imposed on the care home owner under the terms of his amendment to require the interview to take place. It simply says that the staff member could be interviewed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in private by arrangement with the manager or person carrying on the establishment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not say anything about the manager being required to arrange such an interview. Therefore, if he chooses not to arrange the interview, the interview clearly cannot take place.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman is also barking up the wrong tree about the inspectors' powers to interview staff. Having had access to records about the employment of people in the care home, the care standards inspectorate could of course visit that staff member's home address-just as any other member of the public could do. The hon. Gentleman should not have any particular concerns about that. The inspectorate cannot force entry to the staff member's premises because it has no forcible powers of entry.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> There is a right of the inspectors to interview in private any person employed in an establishment. An offence is created under subsection (9) of obstructing the exercise of any power, including that power to interview. Would an employee who refused to be interviewed be guilty of that offence?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That may of course be the case if that constitutes an obstruction. My point is that there is no power to compel someone to give an interview. That was the context of my remarks.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> They can be fined.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Of course, but does the hon. Gentleman not believe that there should be effective powers to prevent people obstructing the operation of the care standards commission's work? I do not want to over-egg the pudding; the hon. Gentleman has done that already. Two chefs are more than enough on this occasion; one chef was probably doing quite well enough. He and the hon. Member for Meriden must make up their minds about whether they want the National Care Standards Commission to have effective powers. We are not creating the infrastructure of a police state, but if we are to set up this new body, we must give it the power to do its job properly. I believe strongly that the amendment would make it harder for the commission to do its job-
