<H4><center>Clause 40</center></H4>
<H4><center>Variation etc on the Authority's own initiative</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment moved [this day]: No. 225, in page 18, line 30, after `firm', insert `or a Treaty firm'.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 226, in page 18, line 32, at end insert `or Schedule 4, as the case may be'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): Before lunch, we were tripping around the subject matter of amendments Nos. 225 and 226—the way in which the authority can vary or cancel commissions. Clause 40 contains further inconsistencies between European Economic Area firms and firms committed under the treaty. Amendment No. 225 would insert after `firm' the words `or a Treaty firm'.
<P>
As I understand the clause, the Financial Services Authority cannot exercise its case D powers in respect of an EEA firm—a non-united Kingdom firm established in the EEA that is authorised under a single market directive when the permission is granted automatically under schedule 3, which deals with EEA passporting rights that we have discussed at length. Such action is required by the directions. Surely the same exemption should apply to schedule 4, which covers firms that are committed under the treaty rights. We have also broadly considered that issue; it is what implements in United Kingdom law the passport granted to EEA firms under the treaty of Rome. We are concerned about consistency.
<P>
I should like to hear from the Minister, but the Treasury may not want to be limited on the basis that it will be allowed in the interests of the FSA and of the public good to stop incoming firms using their treaty of Rome rights to establish a branch or provide services on a cross-border basis, except where a directive provides otherwise. The amendment would subject the treaty firms to the same terms.
<P>
Amendment No. 226 would add the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or Schedule 4, as the case may be''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
at the end of subsection (3) after reference is made to ``Schedule 3''. We may have missed something, but we had discourse earlier about how there seemed to be two ways of dealing with different firms that are permitted under the various schedules. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary could explain the position and to know whether the clause may need amending by the Government's draftsmen.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> The amendments start from the assumption that case D grounds for intervention—on behalf of the Director General of Fair Trading—should apply equally to a treaty firm as they do to an EEA firm. Case D grounds arise when the Director General of Fair Trading has informed the authority that an authorised person has done any of the things that are listed under section 25(2) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
<P>
I should refer to whether the factors in the case of a person who holds a licence under that Act are relevant to the director general's judgment of whether a person is fit and proper to carry on a consumer credit business. For ease of reference, I shall set out briefly what such factors cover. They deal with contraventions of any provision of the 1974 Act; offences involving fraud, dishonesty or violence, practising racial or other forms of discrimination and engaging in deceitful, oppressive, unfair or improper business practices. The purpose of case D is to ensure that the authority can exercise its powers in respect of a consumer credit business if the authorised person was also a licence holder under the 1974 Act. Enabling the authority to act in these circumstances is an important part of our attempt to ensure that the authorisation under the Bill for United Kingdom firms can legitimately be said to cover consumer credit for the purposes of ensuring that UK firms can exercise their passport rights in other European economic area states to the fullest extent.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman noted, the grounds for intervention cannot be used to restrict a part IV permission granted to an EEA firm if the action would affect, other than incidentally, the exercise of an EEA firm's passport rights. Part XII of the Bill deals with intervention affecting passport rights.
<P>
The aim of the amendments is to ensure that carve-out from case D applies to a treaty firm in the same way as to an EEA firm. I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's reasoning and am grateful to him for bringing the issue to our attention. However, with treaty firms, the extent of what is permissible under Community law is determined by the principle of the general good, which I understand was the subject of some discussion on Tuesday. The general good principle allows a host state to take action or impose requirements directed at a public policy objective only where the actions or requirement are properly directed at the objective, are proportionate and do not duplicate the effects of actions taken by, or requirements imposed by, the home state.
<P>
We think it possible that the authority could take an action under case D as drafted that would confirm the general good principle but would affect the carrying on of the treaty right activity in a manner that was more than incidental. We do not wish to rule out taking such action in those circumstances; we think that would be the amendment's effect.
<P>
I thank the hon. Gentleman for drawing this interesting and subtle facet of the clause to our attention but should be grateful if, in the light of my explanations, he would withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for highlighting that subtle facet, if that is what it was, and for illuminating a little further the Treasury's thinking on it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I beg to move amendment No. 228, in page 19, line 1, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`likely'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 229, in page 19, line 2, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`uncertain' and insert `likely to prejudice the continued satisfaction of the qualifying conditions by the authorised person'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments attempt to clarify, and so limit, the powers of the FSA where it is unclear what the relevant financial situation has to be before the authority can vary an authorised person's permission under subsection (2). The first amendment would remove the word ``likely''; the second would delete the word ``uncertain'' and substitute the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``likely to prejudice the continued satisfaction of the qualifying conditions by the authorised person''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I understand the thinking that led the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) to question the ground on which the power in clause 41 may be exercised. This power has its origins in the Insurance Companies Act 1982, and is generally relevant to prudential supervision but is especially relevant where an insurance company is taken over. The difficulty, or risk, that the clause addresses is that the takeover of a company creates uncertainty of a magnitude similar to when a company is first set up.
<P>
I can perhaps best illustrate the point with the following example. Let us imagine that a well-established insurance company has been taken over, perhaps by a firm with no track record in insurance, in the relevant type of insurance or, more generally, in doing business in the UK, whereas the company taken over has a good track record and a substantial business. Over the years, it will have managed to build substantial reserves to back the risks that it has written.
<P>
The regulator's concern would be that the new owners will inevitably bring a new business style. This may involve changing the way in which they assess and price risks. Even slight changes may materially affect the overall financial standing of the company, and it is quite possible that the new owners would not be aware of the potential impact of their policies. In such circumstances, the regulator may want to take steps—for example, by limiting the amount of business that the company may take on, until a track record has been established.
<P>
Another concern is that an insurance company may be an attractive target because of its substantial reserves. Although rules require the maintenance of a certain margin of solvency over and above the level of the estimated liabilities of the firm, it is common practice for insurance companies—for commercial reasons—substantially to over-reserve for their liabilities. It is because insurance companies maintain such high levels of assets that failures are often avoided during periods of a downturn in business. But there may be a temptation for an acquiring firm to want to put those assets to other uses—for example, to support a massive expansion of the company's business.
<P>
Those things are not bad in themselves, and there is nothing to stop companies from adopting new business strategies without a change of ownership. However, there is a potentially serious concern when a new owner with no established track record seeks to do those things.
<P>
In some case that would put into question compliance with the qualifying conditions for authorisation: but that will often not be the case, because the regulator simply does not have the knowledge about the new owners to take that view. None the less, there is a risk to the interests of existing and potential policy holders, and the interests of third parties who may need to claim against the insurance cover of those policy holders.
<P>
In order to reduce the risk, therefore, the insurance regulator will seek to take steps that will ensure that the business does not make any sudden changes to its business plan, or that if it is to make such changes the impact will not work to the material detriment of existing customers.
<P>
So what are the constraints on the exercise of the power? Clearly, as I have described them, the powers conferred on the Financial Services Authority by clause 41 are wide ranging.
<P>
In reality, the exercise of the powers is severely constrained. The authority will be able to exercise the power only in a way that is reasonable and proportionate. If it seeks to impose restrictions and conditions that are excessive and unjustified, the company concerned will have a right to refer the case to the financial services and markets tribunal. The authority will therefore need to have good reason to be concerned about the risks to consumers following the change of control, and it will need to have good reason for adopting any course of action. However, as I have explained, those reasons may need to address concerns that go somewhat wider than simply the likely compliance with the qualifying conditions.
<P>
This power, as drafted in the Bill, is widely used and highly valued by those currently regulating insurance companies. There is a real concern that restricting its use could place policy holders at risk.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members will find that explanation helpful, accept the validity of the power on the terms presented in the Bill and withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for her explanation. We are happy to withdraw the amendment. It remains unclear, however, whether the Government are happy about using the format from the insurance industry in a much wider context and applying it to areas other than insurance.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It is presented as a power to do something, but we are not prescribing the conditions under which it might operate. I was providing merely an illustration to convey the circumstances that we envisage as relevant. It is difficult to envisage all the situations that might arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page 19, leave out lines 20 and 21.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8) In this Act, references to the Authority's own initiative power are references to its powers under sections 40, 41 and this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The first amendment is a probing measure that seeks to establish when the FSA can use its power to vary or cancel a part IV permission in order to help an overseas regulator. The clause reproduces existing powers under the Financial Services Act 1986. Subsection (3) relates to help that that FSA could try to provide under a community obligation. If it applies, it would be necessary to provide help even for a case not prescribed by the Treasury. That is why provisions limiting the right to help to prescribed cases should be deleted.
<P>
Amendment No. 233 is also a probing amendment. We want to know whether paragraph (c) is a restricted example of a subsection (1) case or, as we think, an additional case not limited by the prescribed test in subsection (1).
<P>
On amendment No. 234, the FSA should not be told only to consider whether it is necessary to exercise the power to comply with a community obligation: it should be necessary for it to do so. It must exercise that power, which is the purpose of the amendment.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 235, 230, 231 and 245 would clarify the fact that subsection (4) is additional to earlier provisions. Initially, we thought that restrictions in subsection (3) ought to be included in subsection (4). However, on reflection, that may limit too much the circumstances in which help may be given. The wider the circumstances in which the United Kingdom may give help to an overseas regulator, the more likely is the United Kingdom to receive reciprocal help.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Subsection (7) makes it clear that help may be given under subsection (4) only if the overseas regulator is of a prescribed kind. The Treasury does not want to restrict that further to the overseas regulator acting under specified circumstances. We go along with that.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The intention behind clause 42 is to give the FSA the power, when appropriate, to act in support of overseas regulators. To that end, it makes a distinction between two types of request: those in which the FSA is obliged by our commitments under the European Economic Area agreement to render assistance and those in which there is no such obligation.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 230 to 235 would interfere with that policy. Subsection (1) creates a basic power for the FSA to pass information <P>
to overseas regulators of a kind prescribed by the Treasury. Subsections (3) and (4) set out the conditions under which that will work in cases in which the FSA is responding to a mandatory EEA request or a non-mandatory request. However, amendment No. 230 refers to a category of cases that fall outside subsection (1), which, by definition, includes all the requests that the FSA receives from overseas regulators.
<P>
Amendment No. 231 is based on a similar misunderstanding. There is no need to prescribe that requests under subsection (4) will be made by regulators outside the UK or will be of a prescribed kind because that has already been done under subsection (1).
<P>
Furthermore, it is not desirable to give the Treasury a power to specify the occasions on which the FSA may respond, as it is impossible to know in advance every type of case in which the FSA may wish to respond to a request from an overseas regulator. The four principles in subsection (4) are sufficient to provide the FSA with guidance on dealing with such matters on a case-by-case basis.
<P>
Amendment No. 232 reveals a misunderstanding of the twin-track approach taken by the provisions in relation to clause 42(1). The amendment would alter clause 42(3), which refers to mandatory EEA requests. The words that the amendment would remove are necessary, as they enable the Treasury to give guidance to the FSA about which categories of request it should regard as mandatory.
<P>
Subsection (3) gives the Treasury power to provide guidance on what constitutes a mandatory request. However, in practice it will clearly be necessary for the FSA to decide whether any request that it receives falls into the mandatory or non-mandatory category. Amendments Nos. 233 and 234 are unhelpful, as they remove the words that make that clear.
<P>
Amendment No. 235 is unnecessary, as it removes the words that make it clear that subsection (4) deals with non-mandatory requests, in contrast to the mandatory EEA requests that are dealt with under subsection (3).
<P>
Amendment No. 245 refers to the FSA's ``own initiative powers'', and makes it clear that those would be given and could be used only in circumstances specified in clauses 40 to 42. However, that is already clear in the present text of the Bill, so there is no need for the amendment. I therefore urge my hon. Friends to resist the amendment, should the hon. Gentleman press it to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are in the delicate territory of EU and passport-related matters again. Our interpretation of the amendments is somewhat different from the Government's. That is not a huge political issue and we shall let it rest, but it would be helpful if the Treasury's and our advisers could get together to resolve the different interpretations of these matters. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The explanatory notes on clause 42 refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the London Stock Exchange as competent authority for listing''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand that the FSA will take on the role of listing from the London stock exchange, although Howard Davies denied earlier in the year that that was ever the FSA's intention. Will the Minister confirm whether that is likely to happen, and when? What implications will there be for the FSA if it takes on its own listing responsibility, and yet has responsibility for regulating listing roles? Will there be a dual conflict of interest?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Obviously, the hon. Gentleman is well aware of the fact that there have been changes in the arrangements, which we shall discuss when we reach part VI.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 42 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 43</center></H4>
<H4><center>Prohibitions and restrictions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 246, in page 20, line 8, after `by', insert `A'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 253, in page 21, line 5, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9A) ``Investors'' means persons who are consumers as defined in section 5(1) in relation to services provided or to be provided by A.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 254, in page 21, line 7, after `person', insert `other than A'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 246 is a minor drafting change to make it clear that assets that are held by A are subject to a transfer requirement. The term used in the clause is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by or to A's order'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is somewhat vague.
<P>
There is no definition of ``investors'' in the clause. The jargon word seems to be consumers, but amendment No. 253 would clarify the fact that investors means consumers.
<P>
Amendment No. 254 is intended to preserve the rights of the beneficiaries of the trust that is created by the FSA's requirement to transfer assets to a trustee—in other words, the investor—and it would be helpful to make it clear that subsections (5) and (7), which are intended to protect clients of A, should not necessarily apply to A himself.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Amendment No. 246 is a drafting change intended to clarify the meaning of subsection (1)(b). I do not think that it adds anything to the existing text. It is already clear that this subsection covers any assets held by A or to A's order.
<P>
On amendment No. 253, the word ``investor'' is intended to cover any person of any description who owns assets held by A. I accept that that could be better expressed, so I should like to consider the matter further. Similarly, the point made in amendment No. 254 is one to which I should like to return after considering it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for her comments. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 20, line 15, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in connection with the imposition' and insert `for the purposes'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would provide that the protections in clause 38(2) that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Authority must have as its main purpose ensuring that the qualifying conditions continue to be satisfied''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
should be excluded only when a subsidiary requirement is imposed in order to help with the main requirement. The phrase ``in connection with'' in the amendment can be read more widely to mean ``at the same time as''. Draftsmen should be aware of that point because the same issue arises in the Companies Act prohibition under the provision of financial assistance by a company to buy its own shares. That originally applied to transactions ``in connection with'' the purchase or sale of shares and has been changed to ``for the purposes`` of the purchase or sale, in order to restrict the prohibition.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Subsection (2) provides that clause 38(2), which makes it clear that the main purpose of any requirement imposed by the FSA must be to ensure that the qualifying conditions continue to be satisfied, does not apply to prohibitions or restrictions imposed under clause 43, or to requirements imposed in connection with the imposition of those prohibitions or restrictions. Under the amendment, that would be altered to refer to requirements imposed for the purposes of those restrictions or prohibitions.
<P>
The purpose of subsection (2)(b) is to ensure that any prohibition or restriction imposed by the FSA will be effective so it will cover anything connected with the prohibition or restriction.
<P>
In so far as the amendment would alter the meaning of the text, it would limit its scope and, therefore, possibly limit its practical effectiveness. On those grounds, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am pleased and interested to note that the intent is different from that which we had understood. This is not a major matter. I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 248, in page 20, line 24, after `A', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or any other duty which it may owe'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of clause 43(4) is important: it is to protect an institution from being sued by A merely because it complies with an FSA requirement. Accordingly, we should make it clear that that protection applies also to breach of fiduciary duties, which are typically owed by banks or stockbrokers, or, indeed, to any other duty. If the amendment is not accepted, institutions will lay themselves open to being sued for breach of those fiduciary duties that are not also contractual terms. That might make banks and others more reluctant to comply with FSA requirements.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining the purpose of the amendment. We sympathise with the thinking behind it. Indeed, we have included this provision in the Bill because it has been drawn to our attention that banks are concerned that complying with a notice restricting the disposal of one of their customer's assets puts them at risk of being sued for breach of contract.
<P>
We certainly want to ensure that institutions are not prevented from assisting the FSA if it decides to place restrictions on an authorised person's assets. However, we find it difficult to envisage circumstances in which an institution such as a bank would owe other, non-„contractual, duties to its account holders.
<P>
I am happy to assure hon. Members that we shall consider whether the provision should be extended in the manner suggested. I should be grateful if hon. Members could give us some examples of the duties that they have in mind and the circumstances in which they might arise. In the light of that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary. We shall supply some examples. In the light of her comments, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 249, in page 20, line 40, after `liquidator' insert `or administrator'.
<P>
The amendment would include administration as well as liquidation in the provision. Often a firm may go into administration rather than straight into liquidation or into administration only. As the clause will render void charges created by A—so protecting creditors, including clients—the people against whom the charge ought to be void should be as many as sensibly possible and, therefore, the administrator should be included as well as the liquidator.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for moving the amendment. Again, we sympathise with its intentions. We are feeling very sympathetic at the moment.
<P>
The purpose of subsection (6) is to ensure that if an authorised person creates a charge over those of his assets that have been transferred to a trustee on the instructions of the FSA under subsection (1)(b) and the authorised person becomes insolvent, the charge is void against the authorised person, liquidator or any of the creditors. That provision is intended to protect property placed on trust under subsection (1)(b) over which the authorised person subsequently creates a charge from any claim whatsoever. In the circumstances, I am happy to consider whether the current drafting will achieve the intended protection and to table amendments if necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Minister. On the basis of that promise, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 257, in page 20, line 43, after `A', insert `or the Authority'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 25l, in page 20, line 46, after `A', insert `or the Authority'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The purpose of the amendments to clause 43(7)(a) and (b) is perhaps a little sophisticated. Clause 43(1) provides that the FSA can require A to transfer assets belonging to him or to investors, to be held by a trustee approved by the authority. Subsection (7), to which the amendment applies, states that the assets will be treated as being held by the trustee for that purpose only where A has given the trustee written notice that they are subject to the FSA requirement.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In our view, that provision is not wide enough. Subsection (5) provides that assets held by the trustee cannot be released, except with the consent of the authority, while that requirement is in force. If A transfers the assets to the trustee but does not give written notice that they are to be held in accordance with the requirement, the subsection (5) prohibition on release will not apply, because the assets will technically not be held in trust. Expanding the definition of assets held by a trustee to include those for which the authority has given the relevant written notice will allow the FSA to give that notice to the prohibition, and the release contained in subsection (5) will therefore apply.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It must be the degree of sophistication, but it is confusing. My sympathy has slightly evaporated on that point. We are not likely to agree on the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 250 would provide that the necessary notification to the trustee under subsection (7) could be made by the FSA as well as by the authorised person. That has the potential to create confusion. A situation might arise in which the FSA and the authorised person expected the other to make the notification and, as a result, neither did so. The present formula has the virtue of certainty.
<P>
Amendment No. 251, however, would seem to give both the FSA and the authorised person the power to instruct the trustee to convert the assets from one form to another. It is not clear why the FSA would need such a power, and it might be regarded as being unfair to the authorised persons if the authority did so. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am saddened that the Minister does not want to make the Bill yet more sophisticated. There is a point to be made, but it is not such a material point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 252, in page 21, line 5, at end insert

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or any other security interest'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There does not seem to be a definition of the word ``investor''. Instead, the jargon word is ``consumers''. The amendment is intended to make it clear that investors means consumers—[Interruption.] Hang on a minute, I think that I have spoken to the wrong amendment. I apologise, Mr. Gale.
<P>
Amendment No. 252 would amend subsection (9), which deals with mortgages. A mortgage is only one example of a charge. It is different from others, however, because it creates a legal interest, and a charge does not. We want to ensure that a ``charge'' is defined as widely as possible, because it is a charge that, alone, is void under subsection (6). It would help if it was made clear that all security interests are included. We would prefer there to be an express reference to other security interests, even if the parliamentary draftsman thinks that that is already implied.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is again highlighting a potential deficiency in the drafting of the clause. I am grateful that he changed his claim, because we have some sympathy with the amendment, but I might not feel quite so sympathetic to the other amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 252 is intended to ensure that the reference to ``charge'' in clause 43 would cover every variety of security interest. I agree that that is appropriate and I shall consider further whether we need to amend the clause to achieve that. Again, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In the light of that answer, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 44(1) allows the authority to have regard to persons connected with the applicant when considering whether to grant authorisation or vary a permission. That power is too wide. Its use should be restricted to circumstances in which such people might affect the ability of the applicant or the person holding permission to continue to comply with qualifying conditions.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> This is the first opportunity that I have had to say how pleased I am to find that you are presiding over our deliberations this afternoon, Mr. Gale—rather to my surprise, and possibly to yours, too. I believe that I shall be able to continue the spirit of concord that has broken out in the Committee in the past 35 minutes or so as a result of the responses of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary.
<P>
The amendment covers similar ground to that covered by an amendment that we discussed when we debated schedule 6 and amendment No. 220. I am happy to accept its substance and the comments of the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs about the importance of continued satisfaction of the qualifying conditions. It is, and always has been, our intention that the requirement that an authorised person meet the qualifying conditions in respect of the entire permission that he holds be continuous. That is made clear by, for example, the fact that failure to meet the conditions would constitute grounds for the FSA to exercise its initiative power under clause 40. We shall introduce amendments to make that clear in the Bill. We are not sure at the moment whether it would be better to do that through a new subsection to clause 37, rather than in clause 44. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to have made the point, and we shall introduce proposals to deal with it. I hope that on that basis he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are honoured that a further amendment has been accepted in spirit, and, on the basis that the point will be covered in due course, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 256, in page 21, line 23, after `subsidiary', insert `or parent'.
<P>
We now return to the issue of the EEA and passporting territory. The amendment would extend the FSA's obligation to consult the home state regulator of the EEA firm with which the applicant or person holding permission is connected. The philosophy is to liaise properly with other EEA regulators, and it seems appropriate for consultation to be required when the EEA firm is a subsidiary undertaking, too. Indeed, it is even more important, because the status of the subsidiary undertaking would also be called into question. Although subsidiary undertakings are essentially subsidiary, a wider issue is involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The requirements detailed in subsections (2) and (3), for the FSA to consult other EEA authorities are explicitly specified in the directives. That is why they are included in the clause. We have not included a specific requirement for all the other circumstances in which we would expect the FSA to consult, on the grounds that to do so would make the Bill too cumbersome. We have strictly limited explicit references in the Bill to the requirements that the directives specify.
<P>
I do not disagree with the point that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs made about the importance of consultation when the application involves a parent undertaking of a firm authorised elsewhere in the EEA. However, that is one of many circumstances in which we would expect inquiries to be made but for which we have not included an explicit requirement. Including parents would mean including parents of parents, too, so a long chain may be involved. That is not an argument against doing so, but many organisations would need to be referred to.
<P>
I would hesitate before accepting the proposal, on the grounds that picking out one additional group that lies outside the scope of the directives for reference in the clause might imply that other inquiries that we think should be made should not be made. That is why I am hesitant about extending the references, as the hon. Gentleman has suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> There is an element of probing in the amendment. I believe I heard the Minister say that this is broadly how the FSA is expected to behave. I accept that there is not a special case for this being in the primary legislation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 257, in page 21, line 30, leave out `own-initiative power' and insert `powers'.
<P>
The authority must take into account other EEA matters when considering the exercise of its own-initiative powers to grant, vary or cancel a part IV permission. Surely it ought to be required to do that even where it is asked to exercise that power by an applicant or an authorised person as well as where it decides to exercise the power on its own initiative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I understand the case that the hon. Gentleman has made. I cannot see any difficulty in principle in requiring the FSA to take account of those factors when considering exercising any of those powers under this part in relation to an additional part IV permission, as opposed to just the own-initiative power. It is not immediately apparent that the FSA should be obliged to consider these matters if the firm seeking a variation to its permission does not suggest any cause to do so. But we can consider that point further. There may be something more here that we should take on board. If the hon. Gentleman is prepared to withdraw the amendment now I will consider it further and, if appropriate, table an amendment on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister. That is a further issue to add to our lengthy list of legal points. On the basis that it will be considered further, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 258, in page 21, line 32, after `authorisation', insert `(if any)'.
<P>
The amendment is designed to make it clear that the authority's obligation to take EEC matters into account will apply even if the authorised person does not have a home state authorisation. That will be relevant only in the case of an Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities qualifier. The discussion on the amendment should at least pull out and make it clear whether a person can be a UCITS qualifier. The amendment is also needed because there is no EEA restriction on the definition of an open-ended investment company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. I cannot see that anything is added to the meaning of this by adding ``if any''. Each of the three categories of authorised firm referred to, including the UCITS qualifier case, must have a home state authorisation. The ``if any'' point does not therefore arise and so I resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> There could be a UCITS without a relevant home state. We are into the territory of yet another complex UCITS-passporting issue. We would be happy to withdraw the amendment if the matter will be examined in slightly more detail by the Government's legal adviser.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am happy to reconsider the matter, despite my clear understanding of it, which I explained earlier.
<P>
<B> Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I beg to move amendment No. 260, in page 22, line 12, at end insert `relevant to the application'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 261, in page 22, line 16, leave out `verify it' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`provide such reasonable verification of such information'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 262, in page 22, line 17, after `may', insert `reasonably'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Clause 46 gives the FSA virtually unlimited discretion to require further information about almost anything in connection with an application for a variation of a part IV permission. The amendments are designed to limit that discretion and to restrict information to matters that are directly relevant to the application. That is the meaning of amendment No. 260, which adds the words ``relevant to the application''.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 261 and 262 add a test of reasonableness. The authority can require verification of information that is provided. It can do so in a way that might impose an unreasonable burden on the applicant. The process might, for example, involve a previous group company, which had since been sold. It seems sensible, therefore, to put a test of reasonableness in the clause, and the logical place to do so is subsection (6). That is the aim of amendments Nos. 261 and 262.
<P>
It is logical that we limit the obstructiveness that could result from demands for more information, which could go on indefinitely. The Treasury's explanatory notes make it clear that a minimum amount of information should be made available for an application. I suggest that there should also be a test of reasonableness to establish the maximum amount that the FSA can demand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is quite right to express the need for an assurance that the FSA will exercise its powers under the clause reasonably. However, it is a matter of established administrative law that a body such as the FSA—a creature of statute, which exercises statutory powers and performs a statutory function—is bound to act reasonably. The same applies to the question of whether the additional information that the FSA may request under subsection (4) is relevant. As a matter of normal construction, it is clear that any such request must be relevant to the determination of the application.
<P>
The amendments are unnecessary. Inserting unnecessary references to being reasonable or exercising powers in a manner relevant to their purpose could cast doubt on the working of other provisions where similar exertions have not been made.
<P>
Subsection (4) does not give the FSA the power to require information that is not relevant to assessing an application. Equally, its powers must always be exercised reasonably.
<P>
The amendments are not necessary; indeed, they might be slightly unhelpful. I hope that, on that basis, the hon. Gentleman will not press them. The fact that I have said that subsection (4) does not give the FSA the power to require information that is not relevant to assessing an application might be helpful for the record. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendments, but if he does I will ask my hon. Friends to resist them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> In the spirit of friendliness that has broken out in the Committee, I ask only that the Treasury be reasonable. The Minister said something useful on the amendment; he made it clear—his clarification will be heard about outside the Room—that the Bill as drafted does not give powers to demand information that is not relevant to an application and that his remarks would be of interest were that ever to become justiciable.
<P>
That leaves amendments Nos. 261 and 262, which add a test of reasonableness to subsection (6). In the spirit of reasonableness, I wonder whether the Treasury Minister would be prepared at least to look at it before dismissing it entirely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have looked at the amendment. While I do not, as I said, wish to be unhelpful, and will certainly have another look at it, my conclusion is likely to remain the same.

<H4><center>Determination of applications</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 137, in page 22, line 19, leave out `six months' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`35 days (or in the case of an application by a person who is not an authorised person, or by an authorised person for deposit-taking or to write insurance contracts, six months)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment makes a refreshing change in dealing with a straightforward, not legally complex, issue. It provides that the authority must make up its mind about whether to grant an application within 35 days rather than six months. The 35-day period will apply only to an application to change the existing permission, not to an application for an original authorisation, other than authorisations under schedules 3, 4 and 5. The 35-day period would not apply to applications to become a bank or an insurance company. Our argument is that 35 days should be a sufficient period and that six months would act as an anti-competitive restraint that is longer than reasonably necessary. We strongly support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Of course decisions should be made as quickly as possible. I want to emphasise that the six-month period is not seen as a minimum or even an average time for the FSA to turn around applications and we, and the FSA, would expect that most applications would be processed much more quickly. However, different cases will require different periods. A new application from an unauthorised person would generally take longer than an application for extra permission in a related area from an already authorised person who has been dealing with the regulator for some time. To that extent, I agree with the amendment. However, precisely how long each determination should take is difficult to say.
<P>
We want to avoid convoluted and complicated legislation that sets out different criteria for different types of business because that would be a return to the existing arrangements for a single authorisation regime from which we want to move away. We are reluctant to have one arrangement for a certain type of business and a different arrangement for another type. The amendment could lead to important decisions being rushed, which could lead in turn to good applications being unjustly turned down or to poor applications being unjustly accepted. For almost anybody moving to a substantially different form of market activity, even if they are already authorised, 35 days is likely to prove unrealistic. For example, anyone who is currently authorised to give investment advice who wanted to move to trade, would find it difficult to make that decision properly within 35 days.
<P>
Let me give some reassurance about the length of time that the FSA expects to take on such matters by citing the FSA, which has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The FSA expects that most applications will be processed well within the time limit set out in the Bill. In due course, the FSA will publish service standards setting out how long we expect the application process to take.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will also publish its performance against those standards.
<P>
The FSA recognises the importance of being speedy—a point that the hon. Gentleman rightly made. However, his amendment would be unduly restrictive, so I ask him to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Perhaps I am repeating my declaration of interest, but I have sufficient experience of maximum periods for authorisations to know that too often the maximum turns out to be the average. Given that the period is restricted to applications to change existing permissions under schedules 3, 4 and 5 applications and excludes the more difficult tests of banks or insurance companies, the six-month maximum is far too long. In the example that the Minister cited of investment managers changing role to become traders, it is nonsense to say that someone should take six months to consider the suitability of that. Anyone who knows the industry and can obtain references and so forth should be able to reach a speedy decision.
<P>
We are not saying that there is anything magic about the 35-day period, but six months is too long and will invite prevarication. We therefore wish to press the amendment to a Division. [Interruption.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 263, in page 22, line 32, after ``gives'', insert ``or varies''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may consider amendment No. 264, in page 23, line 4, at end insert ``until such time as the Authority varies or cancels the permission''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It appears to us that, in contrast with present procedures, permission will be cumulative, which is why a permission can be varied by adding a new regulated activity to it. Accordingly, there should be a replacement certificate of authorisation setting out permissions that are in force at its time of issue. It is the up-to-date position that people want to know about when they ask the FSA what permission a firm has. Presumably, the certificate of authorisation should cover not only part IV permissions but permissions granted automatically under the provisions of schedules 3, 4 and 5—is that indeed the case?
<P>
Clause 48(5) provides without any limit that the certificate of authorisation is sufficient evidence of part IV permission, but the permission may subsequently have been updated. We believe that it would be appropriate to provide that the certificate of authorisation is sufficient evidence only until the authority varies or cancels the permission.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Government accept the policy suggested by the amendment, they may prefer the cut-off date to be when the new certificate is issued, or that the authorised person must give back his certificate of authorisation if the part IV authorisation is cancelled. Those changes would clearly be reasonable. We also feel that there should be an additional subsection, to provide that part IV permission can continue whether or not the authority gets round to issuing a certificate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises some telling points. For some of the reasons that he outlined, and for others, we propose to introduce changes that would render the amendments redundant. It is important that the FSA must issue certificates not only when it gives new permissions but when it makes alterations to or cancels permissions. It is also important for the FSA to ensure that all such changes are recorded in the register that it is required to keep.
<P>
Using certificates as a primary source of evidence of part IV permissions would indeed create several logistical problems, including the keeping up to date of certificates and in cases of loss or forgery. For those reasons, we want to rework clause 48 to ensure that proper arrangements are in place to keep permissions up to date and authenticated. For instance, we are considering whether it would be appropriate to make the FSA's registry rather than certificates the primary source of evidence. If we were to do that, there would be no need for amendment No. 264.
<P>
Amendment No. 263 deals with what happens when a permission is altered or cancelled rather than a new one being given. It is right and proper that all such changes should be amended in the FSA's records, and that all authorisation should be kept up to date. However, the possibility of removing ``certificate'' from subsection (5) and the fact that we are considering reworking the clause means that it would not be appropriate to accept the amendment.
<P>
Clause 48 is likely to be changed significantly. Indeed, the concept of certificates may disappear altogether. We shall table amendments to implement those changes in due course. I assure the Committee that we shall take account of the points made by the hon. Gentleman when taking the alternative approach to which I alluded. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On the basis of the undertakings given by the Financial Secretary, we are clearly in for a long Report stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 265, in page 23, line 5, after `Part', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or to impose a requirement under section 38'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 266, in page 23, line 7, after `application', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or imposes a requirement under section 38'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 281, in Clause 52, page 24, line 16, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The Authority shall give notice of its decision to refuse an application to the applicant and the provisions of sections 339 and 340 shall apply as if the notice was a decision notice.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The clause brings into play the protective provisions for a warning notice and a decision notice, including the right to refer to the tribunal if the authority proposes to refuse an application. However, it does not seem wholly clear that the imposition by the authority of a requirement constitutes a refusal of <P>
a permission. It could be argued that the permission that is granted is less than the permission applied for, but it would certainly be clearer if that were to be expressly provided.
<P>
Clause 38, to which the amendment refers, allows the FSA to impose conditions on the permissions that it grants. Typical conditions are that a firm should act only for non-private customers or in relation to private equity transactions. The amendment would also change decision notice procedures.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 266. In normal circumstances, the FSA must issue a warning notice if it proposes to refuse an application. However, it would not be required to issue a warning notice in cases covered by subsection (3), in which the applicant has automatic permission as a result of a single market directive.
<P>
The reasons for that exception are not clear. A policy decision may have been made that an EEA firm given automatic permission under schedule 3 as a result of its single market directive passport should not be allowed to apply for permission covering the same activity under part IV. If so, the FSA would be allowed to bypass the warning notice procedures, as passports are provided for under schedule 3. Therefore, nothing would be lost by refusal. It would be far better not to have an exception to the requirement to issue a warning notice, and provide instead a power preventing an application for permission, if permission is already granted automatically under schedule 3. That would be considerably clearer. As with the previous amendment, that would apply to schedule 4 treaty rights and schedule 3.
<P>
Amendment No. 281 relates to clause 52. The addition of proposed subsection (1A) is not necessary, provided the Government accept that notice of a decision to refuse an application should be a decision notice. The amendment would bring in the due procedure protection of clauses 339 and 340, which treat the notice as a decision notice. However, assuming that our amendment is accepted, such notice will, in fact, be a decision notice.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Again, the hon. Gentleman is on to something. I accept entirely that applicants who are subject to a requirement under clause 38 should have the same rights as applicants who, against their will, have their permission varied by the FSA. When we table Government amendments, we shall ensure that we cater fully for cases in which applicants have a clause 38 requirement imposed on them, whether at the initial authorisation stage or on the exercise of the own initiative powers. On the basis of that assurance, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will not press amendments Nos. 265 and 266.
<P>
Like those amendments, amendment No. 281 refers to clause 38. However, it refers additionally to the procedural provisions of part XXIV. We are giving further consideration to procedural provisions that should apply in cases in which the FSA grants a permission that falls short of that originally applied for.
<P>
It has been pointed out that a rigid application of part XXIV procedure may disadvantage a firm that is content with the variation proposed by the FSA. Should such a firm wish to commence business as soon as possible, discussion of its business plan might take place as part of the normal application process, The FSA might commonly make the permission slightly narrower than that originally proposed. Equally, the FSA might wish to make an element of the business plan a formal requirement.
<P>
In such cases, there should be a facility for notice procedures to be shortened by common consent so that applicants may begin their permitted activities as soon as possible. That variation is entirely helpful and it may involve some recasting of the provisions. However, in drafting Government amendments, we shall take full account of the apposite matters raised by the hon. Gentleman. On that basis, I trust that he will not press amendment No. 281.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It is about time that the Committee gave my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) a bit of a break, so I will take up the cudgels for clause 50. We now come to the procedure for the exercise of the Financial Services Authority's own initiative power. The difference between clause 50 and clause 51 is that the former applies to non-urgent cases whereas the latter deals with urgent emergency cases.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 267 to 270 would make the procedures that the FSA would go through when exercising its own initiative power the same as those where it proposes to refuse an application; in other words, we want both warning and decision notices, and all the protections given in clauses 3, 38, 39 and 40. Several of these protections are already included in clause 50, but not all are. Clause 50(1) makes it clear that this is not an emergency situation; therefore, there would seem to be no timing reason for the proper procedures not to be gone through. Any removal of some of the normal protections could substantially prejudice the authorised person.
<P>
The deletion of the word ``written'' is proposed only because the procedures for a warning notice require that it be in writing. It may be that, as a matter of drafting, the relevant expression ought to be ``a warning notice about'' a particular concern instead of ``a warning notice of''. Perhaps the Minister will respond on that point.
<P>
Amendment No. 268 would delete subsection (3) because all the matters to which it refers must be notified in relation to every warning notice, as clause 338, which deals with warning notices, makes clear. In this case, the main change—having a warning notice rather than a mere non-warning notice—is that the representation period must be at least 28 days. When we come to clause 338, I hope that we shall agree to change the measure to cover the use of a warning notice in these circumstances. What needs to be spelt out is the effect of a proposed action on the person to whom a warning notice is to be given. The authority will also have to allow the person receiving the warning notice to see the evidence against him.
<P>
Amendment No. 270 would require the notice of the authority's decision to be a decision notice, which again carries with it all the usual protections, including notification of the recipient's rights to refer the matter to the oft-quoted tribunal. Again, a decision notice must be in writing, so there is no need to refer to it as a written notice.
<P>
Amendment No. 244 would stipulate that there must be a time limitation specifying the date on which the authority's proposed action will take effect. We feel that it is reasonable to expect that, when the authority exercises its own initiative power in relation to an authorised person, and submits a notice of its intention to do so, the notice should take effect only after the authorised person has had an opportunity to take the notice and its importance into account, and make arrangements accordingly. The Law Society of Scotland takes the view that a 14-day period is a reasonable time for the procedure to come into effect.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made the case for aligning the FSA's procedure for exercising its own initiative power with the procedure for disciplinary actions, as set out in part II. There is a striking similarity in terms of the potential impact on the authorised person in those two circumstances. A requirement to cease a particular regulated activity could have a big impact on the relevant person. My inclination is therefore to agree that there is scope for a closer alignment, at least for the non-urgent procedure under the clause.
<P>
In order to find some disagreement with the hon. Gentleman, I would point to the conflict between amendments Nos. 270 and 244. If I understand it correctly, amendment No. 270 would delete the line that is amended by amendment No. 244. My response will be to table Government amendments, which will substantially meet the entirely proper concerns that the hon. Gentleman has brought before the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful. We are arriving at a situation in which the Minister has to flail around desperately to find something in the Opposition Amendments with which to disagree—indeed, a great moment. In the spirit of enormous concord, as the darkness of a Thursday evening approaches, we are happy not to press the amendments. Members of the Committee will have further work to do on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Exercise of own-initiative power with immediate effect</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 271, in page 23, line 33, after `is', insert `or will be'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 272, in page 23, line 35, after `activity', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`arising from a contravention or likely contravention of a relevant requirement (as defined in section 334(5)).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Here we are into emergency territory. These simple amendments announce a warning about what may become a threat rather than deal with circumstances that are obvious at a particular time. The authority should be allowed to take action without having to wait for the contemplated threat to come into force. Accordingly, amendment No. 271 would allow action to be taken if there were a threat to consumers.
<P>
On amendment No. 272, it seems appropriate to restrict the entitlement of the authority to exercise its own initiative power to vary or, in extreme cases, to cancel the authorised person's permission, thus, cancellation of authorisation should be limited to where the threat of an actual or likely contravention of a relevant requirement arises. That is defined much later in the Bill in clause 334(5) as a requirement imposed under this Act—meaning the Bill—or under any other Act in which the authority has power to prosecute.
<P>
It is relevant to insider dealing and money laundering—the basis for the additional precautions that we would like to see undertaken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall respond more robustly on this occasion. Amendment No. 271 would make no difference. If it appears to the FSA that there ``will be'' a threat, then effectively there is a threat. I see no difference in meaning.
<P>
Amendment No. 272 is more substantial. It would narrow the class of threat to which the FSA could respond urgently to those
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``arising from contravention or likely contravention of a relevant requirement''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, that proposal conflicts with the concern expressed earlier by Opposition Members and others about the ability of the FSA to act quickly and decisively in circumstances where there may be a serious systemic risk. We do not want the FSA to be hamstrung in the face of a serious threat because it is not clear that the threat arises from a particular contravention.
<P>
Amendment No. 272 would amount to a serious narrowing of the circumstances in which the FSA could act and a diminution of its ability to protect the interests that we all want protected. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore feel it appropriate to withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I will urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We could have a more lengthy argument about a threat that is apparent or is likely to arise, but I do not want to get into the semantics of legal jargon. However, there is certainly cause for some of our legal eagles to insert the proposed terms. I will not force amendment No. 271, but I do ask for a little more deliberation on the matter. I also take the Minister's point about robustness as regards amendment No. 272.
<P>
I am happy not to press the amendments and beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 271.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 273, in page 23, line 38, leave out `proceeds' and insert `proposes to proceed'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 274, in page 23, line 38, leave out `written notice'.
<P>
No. 275, in page 23, line 39, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a warning notice (except that for this purpose the period specified in section 338(3) in which the authorised person may make representations to the Authority shall be the period specified in the warning notice).'.<P>

<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`warning notice'.<P>

No. 278, in page 24, line 8, after `to', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`reinstate the permission varied or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 279, in page 24, line 10, leave out `written notice of the decision which it' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a decision notice'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 280, in page 24, leave out lines 11 to 13.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Again, we hope that the normal notice procedures will apply, except in the case mentioned in amendment No. 275 in line 39. Accordingly, the FSA should give a warning notice as soon as it decides that it will exercise its own-initiative power. It should not wait until it exercises its power—perhaps in an hour or the next day. That is the basis of amendment No. 273.
<P>
Under amendment No. 274, there would be no need to require the notice to be written, as a warning notice self-evidently must be. We are talking about an emergency situation, so it would be wrong to require the FSA to give 28 days for representations to be made. Accordingly, the authority can give whatever notice it likes. That would normally be much less than 28 days. Under clause 51(2)(a) and (b), it is already accepted that notice must be given.
<P>
Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) would be deleted because they are dealt with by the warning notice requirements, that is consequential on the earlier amendments.
<P>
Subsection (3) prohibits the authority from taking action before the representations period has come to an end. I hope that the notice that provides for that period will be the warning notice if the amendments are accepted. It is as well to refer to the warning notice, rather than to the general notice, which is at present referred to as a ``notice under subsection (2)(a)''.
<P>
Amendment No. 278 refers to subsection (4)(a), which states that the authority must take account of representations before taking any further action. The amendment provides that the authority should, in the light of representations, reinstate the permission varied. That will not be necessary if the Government accept that the warning notice procedure should come into play before the authority takes action. If that does not happen, however, the amendment will be needed because the authority will already have varied the permission, although its action will not take effect until later—that is referred to in subsection (2)(a). We think, as of course we would, that the way we suggest of doing things makes the whole procedure clearer and does not prejudice the FSA—unlike the procedures set out in subsection (2).
<P>
In amendments Nos. 279 and 280, we would amend subsection (4)(b) so that it referred merely to a decision notice, which would bring in all the decision notice protections.
<P>
On amendment No. 280, the notice that would be given would be a decision notice; there would be no need to include line 11 because it would be clear that the decision notice related to the exercise of the own-initiative power. There would, therefore, be no need for subsection (5), as the obligation to give notice of the rights to refer to the tribunal would already apply because the notice would be a decision notice.
<P>
There is a lot of technical jargon there, but it is consequential on the earlier amendments that we are trying to push through.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Amendment No. 278 is unnecessary. Under the clause, the authority must consider whether to take any further action. Given that reinstating the original permission is one of the actions that it could take, the amendment would not add anything.
<P>
The other amendments could be damaging, however, because they would undermine the point of distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent exercise of the FSA's own-initiative powers. There is a good reason for having an urgent procedure. The FSA must be able to act quickly and effectively when faced with a serious threat to the interests of people using regulated services. That is at the heart of the arrangements under the memorandum of understanding between the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA. It would be wrong effectively to remove the FSA's ability to take urgent action.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said that that was not the intention of the amendments but, under clause 51 as drafted, the action could take effect immediately the notice was issued. Indeed, we want to make that more clear, and we shall be tabling amendments to make it absolutely clear that the action could take effect immediately. The amendments could be seen to be inserting a 28-day waiting period, which might be disastrous—as we could all envisage. The hon. Gentleman said that that was not their intention, but there is a strong case for saying that that would be their effect. On that basis, I hope that he does not intend to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Obviously, some thought has gone into the matter. Although I do not entirely accept the Minister's final point about the effect of a 28-day waiting period, I shall let this one go. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 51 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 52</center></H4>
<H4><center>Right to refer matters to the Tribunal</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 282, in page 24, line 17, leave out from `person' to end of line 18 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`who is or may be affected may refer to the Tribunal any decision of the Authority to use its own initiative power.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have now reached the end of part IV of the Bill. The amendment deals with the right of an authorised person to refer the matter to the tribunal, which we shall be hearing more about as we progress through the Bill. We find it difficult to understand what is meant by the reference to a person being ``aggrieved'' by the exercise of the own-initiative power. Presumably, everybody against whom the authority exercises the power to vary or cancel a permission would be aggrieved by it. The important point is that it could be argued that the person would not be aggrieved until the own-initiative power has been exercised. That is a legal point, but it is certainly worth consideration by the Minister.
<P>
The authorised person should, as usual, be allowed to refer the matter to the tribunal before it takes effect. Accordingly, the amendment would make it clear that there is no need for the own-initiative power actually to have been exercised before the right to refer to the tribunal arises. It is a matter of timing. The right to refer the matter to the tribunal must be spelt out in that way, because the decision notice procedures do not give a right to refer the matter to the tribunal, but only require notification of any right that the recipient of the decision notice has to refer the matter, and it is clause 52 that confers that right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not think that the amendment would help. I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument about the importance of people being able to go to the tribunal, but the amendment would not further that goal—laudable though such a goal is. I wish to reassure the Committee that, after the re-organisation of some of the clauses to which I referred this afternoon, it is our intention that there will be a clear path for anyone aggrieved under any of the provisions in part IV of the Bill to go to the tribunal and to seek redress there. That is our aim and it is what will be achieved by the clause when the changes to which I have referred are put before the House on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> On the basis that the Government's intentions have been described as honourable, we can end the debate in a spirit of concord. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
