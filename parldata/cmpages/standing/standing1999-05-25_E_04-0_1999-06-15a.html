<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 61 in page 6, line 9, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A)(a) The youth offending team shall not appoint to the youth offender panel&#151;
<P>
(i) any police officer involved in the prosecution of the young offender.
<P>
(ii) any person who appears to the youth offending team to be a victim of, or otherwise affected by, the offence, or other offences, in respect of which the offender was referred to the panel, or
<P>
(iii) any magistrate who made the order referring the young offender to the youth offender panel.
<P>
 (b) No magistrate who is a member of a youth offender panel shall preside in any youth or other magistrates court to whom a young offender is referred by that panel.'.&#151;[Mr. Greenway.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> Mr. Stevenson, we have had in your absence an interesting and&#151;you will be glad to hear&#151;well-ordered debate. We have examined how the make-up of youth offender panels might best be guaranteed to ensure that all the requisite skills are in place in a way that does not create the sort of conflict of interest that might arise when a participant is seen to be parti pris.
<P>
In order to reassure the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenaway), let me make it clear that we take the composition of youth offender panels very seriously. That is central to the successful operation of the panel process and therefore to the success of referral orders. However, we are not minded to deal with the issue by way of statute, in that we do not think it necessary to include the hon. Gentleman's amendment in the Bill. It would preclude the appointment of police officers, victims and magistrates if they are otherwise involved in the case and it would preclude magistrates from hearing cases referred back to the court by the youth offending team if they are involved in the panel.
<P>
We do not accept the need to put that provision in the Bill, because guidance would be a better way of approaching the question of the composition of a panel. That guidance will need to be specific on the point that the hon. Member for Ryedale makes. It would be inappropriate for those involved to sit on the panel if the young person concerned is a party in a case on which a police officer is engaged or on which a magistrate is sitting. Similarly, the point is well made in relation to the victims of crime. That is not to say that there will not be occasions&#151;restorative justice recognises this&#151;when victims are very much involved in the process. However, it would not be appropriate for them to sit as full members of the panel.&#151;[Interruption.] I notice from his agitation that the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway (Ryedale):</B> I was going to intervene, but the Minister has made my point for me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am happy to oblige in any way&#151;although it would not do me any good to make the hon. Gentleman's point for him too often. That would not do either of our careers any good. No doubt, he will have his career very much in mind at this moment, and we do not want to tread on the Conservative party's sensitivities at what I know can be a difficult and troubling time.
<P>
It is important to recognise that we will look to the panels to provide an input into the deliberations that reflects a breadth of professional knowledge. Therefore, the person from the youth offending team who sits on the panel may be a police officer. It is part of the youth offending teams' strength that they will involve police officers.
<P>
Similarly, a member of the youth offending team could serve as a magistrate in a private capacity. Therefore, it is conceivable that a magistrate could be the team member who sits on the panel. However, the guidance will stipulate clearly that a magistrate or police officer who is involved in the case in question will not sit on the panel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell (Colchester):</B> Will the Minister explain the difference between the proposal in the amendment and the contents of the guidance? I do not understand the difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That is because there is no difference. We accept the point that the hon. Member for Ryedale made. However, we believe that the aim would be better achieved by issuing guidance than by inclusion in the Bill.
<P>
Police officers and magistrates could be members of the panel when nominated from the youth offending team. The panel will include other lay members, one of whom could also be a magistrate in a private capacity. We do not rule that out, but it is less likely to happen because the panels will be deliberately constructed to involve the lay community and to concentrate on and specialise in youth offending.
<P>
As a matter of policy, and after consultation and consideration, we have moved away from the original conception in ``No More Excuses''&#151;a youth offender panel that comprised police officers and magistrates. The panel will be an excellent way of involving a broad cross-section of the community that has an interest in supporting young people and preventing offending. We are determined to ensure that personal interest and commitment, supported by appropriate training, will best qualify an individual for service on a youth offender panel. That is more important than professional expertise.
<P>
In conclusion, we accept the spirit of the amendment but we would not include what it proposes in the Bill. The composition of the youth offender panel is crucial. We shall consider seriously recruitment and training strategies that will ensure that we maximise the local community's contribution to panel membership, and equip members for their challenging but rewarding task.
<P>
We appreciate that the hon. Member for Ryedale has tabled the amendment in a constructive spirit, for which we are grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson. As you will see, we have made significant progress this morning, and I suspect that we shall continue to do so this afternoon. We have made such progress that, not for the first time, the spirit of what we have proposed to the Committee has been accepted by the Minister or the Under-Secretary. Apropos of what the Minister said about what is going on in my party at the moment, I fear that this success may have come too late to be of great assistance, but I am still here. I see that my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), who doubtless will share exchanges across the Dispatch Box with the Minister and the Under-Secretary in due course, is about to embark on her swan-song on health matters in the Chamber.
<P>
That aside, I am grateful for the way in which the Minister has responded. It is an important point. I emphasise again that we are not saying police officers, magistrates and victims of crime should not be members of panels. On the contrary, they would have a great deal to contribute. In trying to speak out the 10 minutes before lunch, I omitted to mention the importance of victims. I may come back to them in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
Before I ask leave to withdraw the amendment, will the Minister tell us how he expects guidance to be drawn up and over what time scale, as he knows that the matter has caused concern? Subsection (4) gives the Secretary of State power, by regulations, to make provision in respect of the membership of panels, and I suspect that the phrase ``satisfy such other criteria'' is the relevant one. If the Minister cannot answer today, I am prepared to wait until another day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We shall bring forward guidance in a form that assists us in the piloting process and use that process to ensure that the guidance can be updated to take into account any eventualities that have been inadvertently overlooked.
<P>
There is a role for the Lord Chancellor's department, which will issue specific guidance to magistrates in respect of involvement with youth offender panels to supplement the provision already made as part of the magistrates' oath, which prevents them, for instance, from presiding over any case where they have prior knowledge. the Lord Chancellor's Department may need to issue specific guidance to magistrates where they serve as members of panels or youth offending teams.
<P>
However, we recognise the importance of guidance and do not intend to allow the grass to grow under our feet as regards producing it, not least because we want the message to go out quickly to the wider community that we want people to start thinking of themselves as potential panel members. I hope that we will encourage people who would not necessarily think of themselves as magistrates to come forward as panel members. We shall be seeking not only qualities of sound judgment and a balance but an involvement with and commitment to children and young people, as that will help to ensure that the panels deliver our high expectation of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister has trespassed into what might be said in a brief stand part debate and we might be able to dispense with such a debate if I asked the Minister to say a little more about whom he believes will be appointed to the panels. Could members of victim support groups be appointed? Retired police officers, people with experience in education, youth workers and others might also be suitable. There is a void in the Bill in this respect: we appreciate the principles, but we need more detailed guidance about the sort of people who will do this work. The success of the whole project will depend ultimately on the quality of the people appointed to the panels.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that people in the categories to which he referred are indeed the sort of people whom we would like to be appointed to youth offender panels. The teams will have the responsibility of constituting the panels and we will issue them with qualification criteria to be set out in regulations to be issued by the Secretary of State under the negative resolution procedure. That will be framed and backed up by advice and assistance relating to local recruitment, which will enable a broad cross-section of people to be appointed.
<P>
I would also look to appointing some younger people. On a recent visit to a pilot area, I, the local stipendiary magistrate and the lay bench were all impressed by the contribution made to magistrates' training by a group of young people. We want to ensure that that section of the community is involved in the staffing of panels. It is also important to ensure a broad gender and ethnic mix.
<P>
Above all, we want a demonstrable commitment to the aims and objectives of the work&#151;to prevent young people from offending. The personal characteristics and qualities most associated with success in that endeavour&#151;a capacity to listen and emphathise, but also a capacity to exercise the sort of balanced judgment that recognises the importance of discipline, order and respect&#151;will be most important. Those are the qualities that we expect to be imparted through the work of the panel.
<P>
We are not talking about a touchy-feely, ``pat the little dears on the head'' approach. These young people need order, structure and discipline to their lives and they require a capacity to respect other people and their property. I expect all those recruited to the panels to be capable of imparting that in no uncertain terms.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and largely agree with what he said.
<P>
I would like to tell the Committee about an experience in my constituency&#151;predominantly a rural area&#151;where a detached youth work project was set up a few years ago. I have been astounded at the quality of some of the young people who worked&#151;often full-time for part-time pay&#151;on that project. They not only earned modest wages, but had no job security because their funding had to be renegotiated year on year with the various funding agencies.
<P>
I was struck by their dedication and commitment and by their special way with young people, which others lack. They can grasp what is troubling those youngsters and address the concerns of those who may have left home, who may be addicted to drugs or other substances, or who may be involved in petty crime. Mentors of that calibre may be prepared to join youth offending teams.
<P>
The Bill specifies that the panel should have a minimum of three members at each meeting. However, that is not a limit; the quorum is three.
<P>
I apologise for straying beyond the strict limitations of amendment No. 61. However, I am satisfied that the Minister takes seriously the important issue that we have discussed and that regulations will be introduced in the House at an appropriate time. Having obtained ministerial reassurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I sensed a mood in the Committee that a stand part debate might not be appropriate.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Attendance at panel meetings</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 7, line 6, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``with the agreement of the panel''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 63, in page 7, line 9, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) A young offender shall be entitled to be accompanied by his legal representative at any meeting of the panel called for the purposes of reaching agreement on or varying the programme of behaviour referred to in Section 8.
<P>
 (3B) Each person who is a parent or guardian of the offender shall be entitled to attend any meeting of the panel'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> At this juncture, I fear that the degree of consensus that we have enjoyed for the past 22 minutes may be about to be temporarily shattered. None the less, I am sure that the Minister accepts that we have a duty to address the issue raised by clause 7.
<P>
The clause sets out the broad terms of reference for panel meetings, especially who may attend. An offender may choose someone over 18 to accompany him to panel meetings. However, the panel must agree that bringing that person along is appropriate.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 62 is to tease out from the Minister the justification for including in subsection (3) the phrase 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``with the agreement of the panel''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I have said before, in the constructive spirit of attempting to see the other point of view, I accept the need to prevent a young offender asking someone who may be a bad influence to accompany him. However, the phrase that I have just quoted gives the panel absolute power or&#151;as the hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell) said&#151;a veto to prevent someone attending who has been requested to do so by the young offender.
<P>
That is a pretty unusual state of affairs in the criminal justice system.&#151;[Interruption.] The Minister is raising his eyebrows. I know what is going through his mind: he is thinking, and would say, that we are trying to get rid of the garbage and the previous trouble because we want a fresh approach. I appreciate that. However, there is a principle here. With the single phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``with the agreement of the panel''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the panel will have the power to prevent the attendance of a legal representative. That is where the power to prevent a lawyer from attending effectively comes from.
<P>
That means that if the panel can be persuaded that it is a good idea to bring a lawyer along, that can be done. So whatever the Minister may say about there being no lawyers, in practice, there may be. Who is to say how the provision will work? I may have it wrong. I see the Minister looking for guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am doing no such thing. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> While the guidance is being thought through, I gladly give way to the hon. Member for Colchester.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> Is the hon. Member for Ryedale suggesting that lawyers should be specifically excluded from accompanying a person? If so, that is a good idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> No, I am not. I am saying the opposite. Given the party that the hon. Gentleman represents, I am most surprised that he takes that view. One understands that the selection of members of the Liberal Democrat party to sit on Standing Committees is random in terms of the comments that we are likely to get from them about what their noble Friends in the other place think. I have no wish to incur your wrath, Mr. Stevenson. I am saying the opposite of what the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> I am supporting you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> No, you are not. I am saying that young offenders should have the right to be legally represented at panel meetings, which is why I have tabled two amendments that deal with that head-on. Amendment No. 62 would do that by deleting the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``with the agreement of the panel''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I appreciate that the difficulty with that is that a panel could not prevent the attendance of someone whom its members considered to be a bad influence. It is stretching the bounds of reality for the Minister to suggest that a lawyer is automatically a bad influence. I understand that he may feel that somehow we would be reverting to the old argy-bargy that goes on in courts about bargaining this, that and the other.
<P>
If amendment No. 62 is not a full solution, what about amendment No. 63, which addresses another concern, but differently? Not only do we suggest, in the first part, that a young offender should be entitled to be accompanied by his legal representative at panel meetings, but we suggest in the second part that parents and guardians be entitled to attend. In an amicable and consensual discussion this morning, we said that it was right that parents and guardians be allowed to attend panel meetings except in exceptional circumstances in which there is some unreasonableness. But there is nothing in the Bill that allows parents to insist on attending a panel meeting. I accept that, especially where older teenagers are involved, it may be argued that if parents are useless, or are involved in crime, we may not want them there. But we are talking of panels for youngsters much younger than the 16 and 17-year-olds. Although I am not suggesting that, in the application of these provisions generally, panels will go out of their way to say that parents cannot attend, we know from constituency experience that parents are not always given the rights that they think they deserve. A lady who attended my constituency surgery on Saturday morning told me that, last September, the head teacher at her child's school had banned my constituent and her husband from the school premises and refused to let them speak to anyone from the school on the telephone, because her husband had had a slanging match with a teacher. The couple's 14-year-old daughter has to choose her options, yet her parents are refused access to those responsible for her education. We all know how important it is for the families of children of that age to have good contacts with the school.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was astounded that a head teacher should act in that way. The mother has done nothing wrong; she is an extremely good influence on the child. In considering the proposal, one might start with the presumption that such a thing would never happen, but we would be failing in our duty unless the Committee considered whether to give parents a legal entitlement. I hope that the Minister will treat the matter seriously.
<P>
Why do I think that the attendance of a lawyer is an issue? I have no difficulty with what the Government want to achieve by taking a different approach and introducing a new initiative which will wipe the slate clean of all that has gone wrong with the way in which the youth justice system deals with young offenders when they first appear in court. However, we have yet to see how bringing together a young person and a youth offender panel and creating a contract for a programme of rehabilitation will work in practice. No one could argue with the general thrust of the provision that they are negotiating the sentence and discussing what the young person will do to address his offending behaviour, to make reparation to his victims and to repay society for the fact that he has committed an offence.
<P>
We are debating first convictions and a guilty plea in the youth court, but in earlier discussions we anticipated widening the proposal's application to other offenders. We acknowledged that such offenders may have been cautioned, reprimanded and given final warnings and thus have already had some contact with the youth justice system.
<P>
I am not sure from my reading of clause 8 how the contracts will eventually be formulated; is the intention that there will be some negotiation, or is it simply that the panel will sit the young offender down and, in an almost coercive way, say, ``Okay, sunshine, this is what you have done. We have got you for six months and this is what we insist that you do''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I am disturbed at the line that the hon. Gentleman is taking. Surely he recognises that the people who will be involved in the panel have a professional integrity and a commitment to children's rights and to basic standards of good practice in a social work setting rather than in a quasi-legalistic one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> With due respect to the hon. Gentleman, so have magistrates and judges. There can be no argument about that and those who, like me, favour this system and believe that it has a great future in dealing with young offenders, have to face up to the fact that the contract is, in effect, a sentence. The young offender is being asked to agree to that contract.
<P>
We discussed earlier whether some of what is said may go over the young offender's head. We asked if he would really understand it. I can see that we do not want the Perry Mason approach that says, ``I got you a good deal; they were going to give you this, and all you got was that.'' I appreciate that, but it raises the fundamental question of principle whether it is right to specify in legislation that a young offender must never be represented when he is being sentenced. I am not sure that it would be right to do so.
<P>
A couple of sittings ago, last Tuesday afternoon, we discussed whether the Bill might conflict with the European convention on human rights. I know that one of the possible conflicts is in that sphere, because I have read the record of the debates that were held in the other place, so I know of the disagreements between people better qualified to argue the case than I am. Baroness Carnegy of Lour questioned whether the absence of lawyers in the panels would breach the convention. Lord Williams of Mostyn, whom we all regard highly, responded that he could confidently restate the view that it would not, because the panel would constitute a court. The panel will, however, in effect decide on the reparation and how the sentence will effectively be carried out.
<P>
To respond to the Minister's anxiety about the involvement of lawyers, the first part of amendment No. 63 would limit entitlement to legal representation to meetings of the panel called purely for the purposes of reaching agreement on the contract or varying the programme of behaviour in the contract. We are not suggesting that the person involved should be able to bring his lawyer every time that the panel meets. In practice, most of the provision is hypothetical, because I can envisage no circumstances in which legal aid would be granted for lawyers to accompany young offenders to panel meetings. Consequently, we are not likely to witness a rash of legal representatives appearing at panel meetings when the pilots are first established. That is a fair assumption to make.
<P>
Equally, however, a lawyer in an inner-city area may be prepared to take an interest in a young man and attend the panel meeting for nothing in order to help him. Are we suggesting that the panel should say that such a lawyer cannot attend?
<P>
Those questions are fundamental. I wish that I could be as categorical as I would like to be, but I understand both sides of the argument.
<P>
Throughout the process and the structure of the Bill, a great deal of guidance and prescription is provided through regulations rather than in the Bill, as is the case with all legislation these days. Perhaps another option exists in addition to the one that I propose&#151;to give guidance to panels about the use of their powers to prevent attendance, especially of lawyers and parents. It would be welcome if the Minister could say something encouraging about that. It is important that we face head-on the comments and criticisms made in some quarters. The Minister will be aware of them; he was sent the briefing material that we have all read. As I said this morning, I have discarded a lot of it because I do not agree with it.
<P>
There is a case for us to hear the Government's reasoning about the phrasing on the issue, and a case for us to press the point. I commend the spirit of the amendments to the Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Clause 7 sets out those who may attend a youth panel meeting, among whom will be an adult of the young offender's choosing. Amendment No. 62 would remove from the Bill the panel's power to refuse such attendance. Amendment No. 63 would have two effects: to entitle a young offender to be accompanied by his or her legal representative when the contents of the contract are to be discussed, and to entitle parents and guardians to attend any panel meeting.
<P>
We are unable to accept either amendment. The advantage of the youth offender panel arrangement is that it enables the bringing together, around a table, of all those who could support a young offender to help him or her to avoid any further offending behaviour.
<P>
An offender will almost invariably be accompanied by one or both of his parents, and may also have with him other family members and significant adults, such as a teacher or a social worker. We also consider it important that a young person should be able to nominate a supporter of his or her choice. However, we are wholly opposed to legal representation at any stage of the panel meetings, and I will explain why in due course and in detail.
<P>
A young offender should be able to nominate his or her own supporter&#151;someone whom he will be comfortable to have by his side at what is for him an important time. That is at the heart of the new dispensation, as far as the criminal justice process for young people is concerned. We need to be realistic about the situations that may arise. Young offenders may not make the best of choices. They may bring with them a friend of their choice who, it seems to the youth offender panel, is unlikely to be a constructive presence at the panel meetings.
<P>
Any of us who has any experience of the world and of children and young people, never mind the criminal justice system, knows their capacity to be negative and destructive when they set their minds to it. A young offender may be intent on disruption or confrontation, and the young person whom he or she has brought along may be of a like mind and prepared to go along with it, or may be a party to the original offence. It must therefore be correct for the panel to have a right of veto. Nothing would be gained from proceeding in such situations, which would rob a young offender of the opportunity that the panel should provide.
<P>
I do not envisage that the right of veto will be exercised easily or often. Wherever possible, a young offender's choice should be respected, as will be made clear in the guidance to panels.
<P>
The experience of some of the areas where the approach outlined in the Bill has been piloted is relevant. The diversion unit in Northamptonshire, for example, has a scheme similar to the one that we are discussing; where the panel finds that a young person does not, in the absence of a parent or member of a wider family, have access to a trusted adult, it can nominate a social worker to act in that capacity. We may need to examine all the circumstances to work out how that power should be exercised where a young person does not feel that he or she has anyone to turn to for support and advice.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Some of the mentoring schemes that are developing around the country, even peer group mentoring schemes, would provide a suitable source of people to act in the capacity of trusted adults. I know that that matter has been of concern to some hon. Members, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), who has communicated with me on the subject. There will be plenty of scope for flexibility in the guidance and in the Bill, without need of the amendment.
<P>
We do not feel obliged to reject amendment No. 63 because we are opposed to the involvement of parents and guardians&#151;far from it; no Government have done more to promote the involvement of parents in resolving young people's offending or anti-social behaviour. However, we recognise that some parents and guardians are not the solution to the problem, but very much part of the problem. It would be wrong for such a person to have the right to attend the panel if it viewed his or her presence as destructive.
<P>
Save in the most exceptional circumstances, therefore, I expect a parent or guardian to be present at panel meetings; indeed. we actively encourage them to do so. Courts have the power to require parents to attend the meeting, particularly the parents of 16 and 17-year-olds where it is clear that they will be a constructive presence. I expect the courts to use those powers to the full. Where a young person is under 18, parents and guardians will be expected to attend, save in those limited circumstances where it would be unreasonable to require them to do so. The court must always have the power to refuse such a presence where it believes that that will not be productive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not sure that the Minister is right about that because although I entirely agree that the court will require attendance, the panel will have the power to deny parents the right to attend. I intimated earlier that in some circumstances they would be a bad influence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Yes, but the panel must have that discretion. If it finds that the parents' presence would be destructive, it will exercise its judgment. However, the court may order a parent to attend and, where it does, the panel will not get in the way of such an order, because the court would not have made it in the first place had it not looked into the parents' suitability to attend. The panel must have the discretion to determine whether a parent's presence would be counter-productive.
<P>
We have a fundamental objection to the other arm of amendment No. 63. As I have said, we do not believe that legal representation is a desirable objective in the context of youth offender panels, which are designed specifically to remove barriers between the young person and consideration of their offending. Legal representatives constitute a barrier that we wish to avoid. We want to create a forum where young people can be encouraged to come to their own conclusions about their offending behaviour and its effect on others. As we have discussed, a range of supportive adults will be there to help them to do that, as well as the trained panel members.
<P>
No member of the Committee can pretend that that is somehow the role of legal representatives. It is not what they are trained to do. Indeed, their whole culture&#151;our culture as lawyers&#151;is adversarial and in some ways in direct counterpoint to the approach and attitude that would cause the young person to become engaged with the process. Lawyers see themselves as a shield, not as a means of encouraging or engineering the involvement of a young person in a process that requires them to confront their offending and address the means of preventing them offending in future.
<P>
Therefore, we see the removal of legal representation from the panels as a positive step. We do not believe that it will have a negative impact on the young person. There is nothing coercive about the process. The whole point is that there should be a negotiation&#151;that young people should be involved in the process and should, of their own volition, see its benefit for them. If they cannot see its benefit, it will do them no good anyway. Where it has not been possible to reach an agreement or enter into a contract, the matter will be remitted back to the youth court, where the young person will have the full benefit of representation. The panel's job is to bring together a range of interventions&#151;the constituent parts of the sentence&#151;which is designed to make the young person confront and address the issue of offending and reoffending.
<P>
When a young person feels, at the time or with hindsight, that he has been persuaded to sign up to more than is reasonable, he will have the opportunity to reopen discussions with the panel and, where necessary, to return to court for the matter to be decided by magistrates. In court, a legally qualified person will be present to protect the young person's interests. Therefore, we do not envisage that there would be anything to be gained by the involvement of lawyers at the panel stage. We strongly resist such a proposal.
<P>
Let me make a couple of points about the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Ryedale that we are seeking to exclude lawyers as a group. Of course, we want to exclude lawyers as lawyers, but if a lawyer is a family member&#151;we have families and seek to be responsible parents&#151;he or she should attend as a parent or a family member. The guidance will need to be clear, and I would view with much concern a situation in which lawyers sought to enter the process by the back door as a sort of Mackenzie friend.
<P>
There have been cases&#151;heaven forfend&#151;of lawyers agreeing to act for nothing on the basis that they will gain more custom later. They provide a sort of loss-leader. [Laughter.] Opposition Members laugh, but that happens in some areas. Lawyers act for nothing on the basis that their clients are bound to return when they have legal aid. For example, lawyers act on a case of obstructing the highway on the basis that the next case might involve actual bodily harm. They may have acted for Dad, who five years ago was charged with grievous bodily harm. Therefore, when little Johnny needs free representation, they provide it.
<P>
As the Minister responsible for criminal justice policy, I have to bear in mind the nature of the profession and its capacity to adapt to the most unlikely and inhospitable of circumstances. The guidance will make it very clear that it is necessary for the panel to be alert to any attempt to introduce lawyers into the process through the back door. Lawyers do not belong in it, for the reasons that I have given. Therefore, we shall strongly resist any attempt by the Conservatives&#151;the lawyers' party&#151;to introduce their proposal. They have their chance to demonstrate that they are approaching the matter objectively and reasonably by withdrawing their amendment. If they do not, we shall know what conclusions to draw.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Goodness gracious! The Minister tempts me to be less gracious that I thought that I might be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day (Cheadle):</B> I thought that the Minister was a little bit over the top.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Yes.
<P>
The Minister has made an even better case for allowing lawyers to attend panels than I did. He has reminded the Committee of the consequences of failure to agree a contract or of failure to stick with a contract that has been agreed.
<P>
When a case returns to court, on the Minister's own admission, the young offender can be represented and the court will take a view on the failure to agree a contract. We have yet to reach the discussion about what should happen in such circumstances, but in essence it demonstrates that the contract is a sentencing issue. This is where we fundamentally disagree. Time will tell. I believe that we will be proved right and the Minister wrong.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is our purpose in Committee to point out where we think that the elephant traps lie in the proposed structure. That is what we have done. I said earlier that I did not expect my remarks on these amendments to fall on the fertile ground on which earlier amendments appear to have fallen and on which I expect later amendments to fall.
<P>
I am somewhat taken aback by the Minister's assertion that the Conservative party is the lawyers' party. That is news to me. I am not sure that the Lord Chancellor would take kindly to the remark that the Conservative party is the lawyers' party. However, we want to ensure that these matters work and that there is equity. I do not believe that a blanket exclusion of lawyers from the panel meetings at which the contracts are negotiated would be right. ``Negotiated'' was the Minister's word. If it is a young offender, how is he or she to negotiate?&#151;[Interruption.] Yes, it may well be, but I do not believe that 15 or 16-year-old hoodlums who have played truant and do not have much academic ability are in such a position.
<P>
However, I shall not flog the point any more. We cannot maintain that there are people visibly watching our proceedings, although a party of schoolchildren came in this morning, which was interesting in view of what we are talking about. However, outside this place people are watching our deliberations to see how the issues that we are raising are being responded to, and I think that there will be trouble in future with this power.
<P>
Having discussed this issue in the depth that it deserves, I am to some extent reassured that guidance will be issued to the panels on the way in which they should conduct themselves. I take that as a positive response from the Minister. As to the rest, I am not sure that I agree with him, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 7, line 15, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) Where the panel allow any such person as is mentioned in subsection (4)(a) (``the victim'') to attend a meeting of the panel, the panel may allow the victim to be accompanied to the meeting by one person chosen by the victim with the agreement of the panel'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment makes it clear that a victim attending a panel meeting may be accompanied by a supporter. I believe that Members on both sides of the Committee agree that one of the great strengths of the new panel system is the way in which it can be a vehicle for restorative justice, which, for the first time, will enable the victims' views to be heard in that setting. That will assist the young offender who is facing the consequences of his actions and the victim coming to terms with the offence, for whom it will be a great healer.
<P>
I stress that the victims' involvement will always be optional. The notion that a victim would be under any pressure to participate in these proceedings would be abhorrent. They should be given the option of being involved and, if they become involved, should feel that they can attend with a person who can support them. If the involvement of victims is to be successful, they must feel that their concerns and needs are recognised. Coming face to face with a persons who offended against them can be traumatic, and if victims agree to participate it is vital to provide them with the necessary support. The amendment would make it clear beyond doubt that victims can bring a supporter with them to panel meetings. I hope that for those reasons it will be supported on all sides of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This Government amendment provides something of a respite in our proceedings, giving a couple of seconds' breathing space. We agree with the amendment. In the good-natured spirit with which we are debating these matters, I was pleased to see in the amendment that the victim may attend only with the agreement of the panel. We debated that before, and it may have been an oversight not to build the provision into the Bill from the outset. Much can be said for the confrontation&#151;if that is not too strong a word&#151;of young offenders with victims, if victims are prepared to be involved. Panels will provide a good forum for that.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 7, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>First meeting: agreement of contract with offender</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 64, in page 7, line 44, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
The clause, which deals with what can be included in the youth offender contracts, has formed the basis of much of our discussion today. I do not intend to discuss the positive side&#151;what can be included&#151;at this juncture. The amendment effectively invites the Minister and the Committee to address what the Bill leaves out of the contract. Under subsection (3), any
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``electronic monitoring of the offender's whereabouts''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or imposition of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any physical restriction on his movements''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is prohibited within the contract.
<P>
On balance, I am less concerned about electronic monitoring in dealing with pilots for first-time offenders who pead guilty. I am thinking ahead, and in due course electronic monitoring could become the normal disposal for the whole range of young offenders. We discussed this morning whether offenders might have had previous referral orders and we concluded that, in the long run, they might have had several previous convictions.
<P>
The interests of flexibility demand that the use of electronic monitoring should be an option, albeit a last resort, for a young offender who, in all other respects, complies with his rehabilitation programme, but is badly influenced because he can come and go as he pleases, and ultimately reoffends. The contract is broken and the process collapses.
<P>
I first saw the operation of electronic tagging in the United States of America 10 or 11 years ago when I was a new Member of Parliament and served on the Home Affairs Select Committee. Tagging helped young people to stop reoffending, to go straight and to fulfil the promises that they had made to their social workers and the courts.
<P>
It is reasonable to conclude that we should rule out the use of electronic monitoring or restriction of liberty, especially through custody, at the first stage of introducing referral orders. We are right to rule it out for the first pilot referrals, but I am not convinced that that would be sensible in the long run. Monitoring and restriction of liberty could contribute to the success of referral orders and the work of youth offender panels in future.
<P>
Earlier, I mentioned the experiments in Boston. I was impressed by the extent to which youth justice teams could restrict liberty and remove such restrictions according to how well or badly young offenders responded to the agreed contracts.
<P>
The imposition of a curfew as part of a contract may also be beneficial. Subsection (2)(d) provides for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the offender to be at home at times specified in or determined under the programme''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not entirely sure about the difference between that and subsection (3)(b), which states that the programme may not provide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the offender to have imposed on him any physical restriction on his movements.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Without such a restriction, the offender cannot be guaranteed to be at home and the curfew cannot be guaranteed to work.
<P>
It is a mistake to include subsection (3) in the Bill because I suspect that, as the disposal for which the measure provides is more widely applied, the Government will want to use means that the provision precludes. Panels could be told in the guidance that tagging and physical restriction on the movements of first-time offenders should be prohibited at the early stage of introducing referral orders. However, we are discussing primary legislation&#151;a legal structure on which more will be built in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am about to resume my place. I have almost laboured the point that we may want to extend the Bill's provisions to many more young offenders. This morning, the Under-Secretary said that in time they will become the normal disposal for all young offenders.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Yes, first-time young offenders. However, we also discussed the prospect of other offenders benefiting from the panels. If the panels not being able to use a referral order is the one thing that might make them a success, is that senisible?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I honestly find that extraordinary. The hon. Gentleman's proposal is highly inappropriate for the panels and blows a hole in guidance about the use of restraint in the Children Act 1989, which was worked out carefully over a number of years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not know whether the Government Front Bench would agree with the hon. Gentleman's assertion, which reveals what is likely to happen. In effect, if the panels take a kid-glove approach&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Oh no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am glad that the Minister has reacted, because young offenders must be aware that the panels will impose a relatively tough regime. They will be in difficulty if they do not succeed in doing that.
<P>
If the Bill is to work, young people must be aware that they will incur the wrath of the court, the youth offending team and the panel should they fail to make the most of the chance that they may be given after offending. Therefore, it is wrong to rule out the use of facilities that could, in some cases, help the youth offender panels to succeed in their work with young tearaways. We must be flexible if we are serious about making the Bill work. If we are flexible, such options must be included, rather than specifying in the Bill that they should be excluded for ever.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I wish briefly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale.
<P>
In most cases, it would be extraordinary if such measures were necessary, as the panel aims at achieving consensus and support in order to set youngsters on the right road. However, as a Member of Parliament, I have been surprised at the number of parents who do not know where their children are at a given time. On one occasion, I went out with the Dorset police looking for youngsters who had obtained alcohol. The police picked up youngsters who had bottles and took them back to their parents, with the bottles still in their hands. One the whole, the parents were unaware of where their kids were and of the fact that the alcohol had probably come from their drinks cabinet.
<P>
I understand the Government's sentiments. However, the provision proposed in the amendment should be included in the Bill, as it would add something to the armoury that may, in future, be necessary for certain cases.
<P>
As we know, various groups of youngsters congregate in car parks, multi-storey buildings and other parts of town. It is easy for youngsters to get pulled into a group of people that may lead them astray. Tagging or some other form of registration may be employed as part of the armoury used to stop such youngsters falling into bad ways. I do not believe that such restrictions would be widely used, but specifically excluding them is undesirable. Therefore, I support the amendment; it would be sensible to accept it as a possible option.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Member for Ryedale acknowledged, clause 8 sets out the nature of the contract with the young offender. His amendment would remove the prohibition under the Bill on electronic monitoring or any other physical restriction of his movements. I was about to say that the Committee is well aware of how the youth offender panel will operate but, having listened to the hon. Member for Ryedale, I am not sure that it is.
<P>
A youth offender panel is not a court, but a forum in which young offenders can interact with their families and, on occasions, their peers, in taking responsibility for developing solutions to problems that first led the offenders into crime. As we debated earlier, there is deliberately no provision for legal representation at panel meetings. It would not be appopriate for the panel to have the option of agreeing a custodial penalty or any other court disposal that places a physical restriction on liberty. That is the crucial difference between my stance and that of the hon. Member for Ryedale and, to my surprise, the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms), with whom I usually agree.
<P>
The monitoring of a young offender's whereabouts, electronically or otherwise, amounts to a serious restriction on his liberty. There are circumstances when that is justified, but the Bill precludes the inclusion of such measures in the programme of behaviour drawn up to form the contract between the young offender and the panel. The hon. Member for Ryedale cited subsection (3)(b), which refers to physical restrictions such as being locked up in a house. Deprivation of liberty should be imposed only by the courts. Custody is appropriate in some cases, but at the court's disposal, not through the referral process.
<P>
If a young person's offending is serious enough to warrant such a restriction, it is entirely appropriate that that should happen. However, it should happen only at the behest of a court before which the young person is legally represented&#151;a matter about which the hon. Member for Ryedale expressed concern a few minutes ago&#151;not at the behest of a panel of the sort envisaged in the Bill. If there were a decision following the pilots in favour of the long-term use of tagging for 10 to 15-year-olds, that could solve part of the problem outlined by the hon. Member for Poole. It could be available for repeat and persistent offenders&#151;those whom the trial indicates seem to be the most suitable for tagging.
<P>
I do not think that the hon. Member for Ryedale was trying to be mischievous, but he misunderstood the fundamental difference between the role that we envisage for the panel and the role of the court. If panels are to succeed, they should not adopt court paraphernalia and procedures. As the hon. Gentleman said, we should nip in the bud the problems that first-time young offenders develop as part of a potential criminal career. The process will take them away from that part of the criminal justice system that may snowball the effect. It will give them the opportunity in another environment with a different process to resolve such problems at an early stage.
<P>
If the offences are serious, it is right and proper that the court deals with them with proper legal representation. The hon. Member for Ryedale did not cite any examples, but the cases that he has in mind are probably those in which the process alone would not be the entire solution. An appearance in court and a suitable sentence of the sort that the hon. Gentleman described should be seen in that context. There is not that much difference in our thinking on that, but there is a gulf of misunderstanding between us on the process and what it is intended for. I hope that, with those words of encouragement, the hon. Gentleman will now acknowledge that he is barking up the wrong tree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not sure that that is the case. While we are exchanging polite pleasantries, I think that the Minister has gone about this process in a misguided way. I am firmly of the view that it is wrong to remove from the panels a power that could make the referral order work. We will shortly discuss what happens if, during a referral to a youth offender panel, the young offender reoffends; he may be sent back to the panel to continue with the referral, but what would happen if the panel says, ``Well, he has reoffended: every Friday and Saturday, when his mum and dad are never in, he goes down the town with his mates where they start nicking stuff. If you could only restrain his liberty, we could make a go of this.'' As that cannot happen, the panel will say, ``In that case, there is no point in referring him back to the panel; he will have to go to a custodial institution.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman is meandering down irrelevant paths. The circumstances that he describes, where someone on a referral order carries on offending, would constitute a failure of that order; it would therefore be appropriate to have the offender back in court for the order to be reviewed and for any appropriate sentence, according to the nature of the reoffending to be imposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I just said that. The offender would go back to court for a review of the referral order where, as the Bill makes clear, another referral order could be issued. The continuation of the referral order could work if only his liberty could be restrained, but the Bill lays down that that cannot occur. A flexible option therefore exists but is being rejected.
<P>
It is clear that we shall not persuade Ministers that they are wrong. Again, we shall see whether time proves them right. Having had the opportunity of debating the issue, I am not sure who has won the argument. We shall not press the matter and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 8, line 17, leave out `or sent to'.
<P>
The amendment deals with a small point of detail.  I am concerned that under subsection (5), once the programme has been agreed, a record of it is created which the young offender then signs. The subsection states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the panel shall cause a copy of the record to be given or sent to the offender''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I cannot see the logic of sending a copy of the record to the offender when he has recently signed it. I prefer the certainty of deleting ``or sent to'' and insisting that the contract or programme should be physically given to an offender so that there can be no doubt that he has it, knows exactly what he has signed and can take it home with him. I see several Labour Members apparently nodding in agreement.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The clause sets out the nature of the contract with the young offender and how it is to be devised. As the hon. Member for Ryedale rightly said, the youth offender panel is obliged to draw up a written record of the programme of activity and to provide the offender with a copy. By raising this issue in the amendment, the hon. Gentleman has asserted the importance of the document, and we do not disagree about that.
<P>
The amendment would remove the possibility of a copy of the contract being provided by post. That does not seem unreasonable, given that the hon. Gentleman framed the amendment without taking account of wider considerations, to which I will come later. It is important that a young person who is the subject of a referral order be given a clear record of any agreement entered into with a youth panel. We accept that entirely; otherwise, what manner of agreement would there be if it were only ever made verbally? The Bill requires panels to ensure that a copy record of the contract&#151;or any variation of the contract that may be necessary&#151;be given, or sent, to the young person. It is the use of the word ``sent'' which I believe exercises the hon. Gentleman's mind.
<P>
The amendment is well intentioned, but it raises potential practical difficulties. A panel will undoubtedly consider it important to have a record of the contract typed so that it is clear and legible. Any contract made in my handwriting would exercise the minds of lawyers for many years as they tried to comprehend it. I think that we accept the principle that, to be clear and legible, a contract should be typed or printed. But even with the wonders of modern technology, that takes time: it cannot be provided instantly. Asking a young offender to hang around while a contract is prepared, or to call back later to collect it, would cause more problems than it would solve. It is important to ensure that delivery of the contract, in person or by post, is not unduly delayed. We shall ensure that this is covered in guidance. The hon. Gentleman's raising of this matter has been useful because it has given us an opportunity to place on the record the importance of the document and to state how crucial it is to the process. However, the amendment would not serve any useful purpose; indeed, it could cause practical difficulties. So, given this useful and constructive exchange of ideas, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not feel the need to press the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> In this Committee, I seldom feel the need to continue to press issues. However, I still find it bizarre that we shall send someone a paper that he has just signed. I had not interpreted the phrase in line 7 on page 8 of the Bill,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall cause a written record of the programme'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as referring to a handwritten record. I assumed that the written record might be typed initially, and that, if the offender signed it, a copy would be given to him. Be that as it may, we have at least explored the importance of having a proper record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. Our assumption is that usually a document would be typed and signed, and copied there and then. However, a computer failure or something similar could occur and in such circumstances it would not be unreasonable to ask someone initially to sign a manuscript contract and later for the document, printed in proper format, to be delivered, or collected by him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Earlier this morning, the Minister accepted the principle underlying a similar amendment by means of which the Bill would include a requirement for a written record to be given to the young offender when he was referred to the panel. In the spirit in which the Minister accepted that principle, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 66 in page 8, line 17, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(7), If it should appear at any time that the terms of the programme agreed under subsection (2) of this Section conflict with the provisions of any ancillary or other orders imposed by the court when sentencing the young offender the provisions of such ancillary or other orders shall take precedence.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment raises an important issue of detail which should be clarified. I shall explain the background to the matter, which relates to an earlier discussion. Clause 8(2) sets out everything that can be included in a contract, such as making financial or other reparation to any person, attending mediation sessions with victims, attending school or other educational establishments, attending rehabilitation courses on drug and alcohol abuse, presenting himself
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to specified persons at certain times and places specified in or determined under the programme'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
staying away from specified places or persons and so on. They are all important features of the contract.
<P>
We earlier discussed at some length the provisions in clause 4, which prohibit the court, when making a referral order, from imposing other sentences. However, they do not prevent the court imposing what might be called other ancillary orders. For example, a youngster may have been involved in a fight outside a football ground&#151;sadly, that still happens from time to time. It is his first appearance in court; he has pleaded guilty to assault or a disturbance offence such as a beach of the peace. As we discussed on Second Reading, and subsequently with the Under-Secretary of State in relation to the Football (Offences and Disorder) Bill&#151;I am glad to say that it completed all its stages in the House on Friday&#151;in such circumstances, in addition to its power to make a referral order, the court also has the power to make an attendance order stating where the young person has to go on a Saturday afternoon while a footbal match is being played. That is a very important provision and I welcome it.
<P>
In addition to the panel being able to make arrangements for reparation in drawing up the contract, similar powers are available to the court to make orders of that nature. If young Johnny has chucked a brick through someone's plate glass window and caused a couple of hundred quid's-worth of damage, he can pay for that and go before the panel; it is obvious that that is what should happen. However, it raises the possibility that there may be conflict between what is in the contract and what is in the other orders.
<P>
We are trying to encourage the young offender to believe that people in authority in the criminal justice system and in the wider world are his friends, and are not there to trip him up; he may therefore want to know how he is supposed to be in two places at once or which one he should go to and why. The amendment draws the Committee's attention to that problem. One solution may be to accept the amendment, but perhaps the answer is that in the event of a conflict the programme or contract agreed between the young offender and the panel should take precedence.
<P>
The problem with that solution is that if the court has made a reparation order for damages, people will not be paid. Equally, if we have said that the person involved cannot go to a football match, for example, on a Saturday afternoon, he will be going to an attendance centre and that is where he should be. That would probably be the best approach. The principle of the amendment is that if other ancillary orders contradict or conflict with what is agreed in the programme with the young offender panel, we need to be clear about which takes precedence. I hope that the Minister will explain the Government's thinking.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The clause specifies the nature of the contract with the young offender, and how it is to be devised. As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, it includes, under subsection (2), a list of activities that might be included in the agreed programme.
<P>
The amendment would specify in the Bill that commitments relating to ancillary orders or to other existing court orders should take precedence over the requirements of a referral order contract. As we have said, the referral order is intended to be the primary disposal for first-time young offenders. However, that should not prevent ancillary orders being made when appropriate, which may include circumstances such as those in the example that the hon. Member for Ryedale cited of a football restriction order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I should have said that the Bill that my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) has introduced&#151;with some help from others&#151;places a requirement on magistrates to make such football orders and to state in open court why they are not doing so if they do not do so, as it is a real possibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale is right. It is a real possibility. As I understand that Bill, how he describes it is how it will work in practice.
<P>
In moving the amendment, the hon. Member for Ryedale expressed sentiments for which I suspect the Committee has a great deal of sympathy. The youth offender panel should not interfere with court orders by including in the contract an activity or commitment that would interfere with an ancillary court order. That is an important point that the hon. Gentleman makes, and it is correct.
<P>
It will be important for the court to ensure that details of any such orders are made known to the youth offender panel when it is notified of the referral order. Such orders can be taken into account when considering the programme of activity with the young offender. Indeed, as the hon. Member for Ryedale made clear in moving the amendment, in some cases, it would be entirely inappropriate if those requirements were not made clear, because they might conflict.
<P>
Although I do not consider it appropriate or necessary to require young offender panels to work with existing court orders, I assure the Committee that we shall ensure that a clear reminder is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am pleased. That is an excellent response to what could be a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am pleased. That is an excellent response to what could be a problem. Let us hope that no young offender finds that the panel has asked him to be somewhere when he should be somewhere else. If that happens, we will know that it is the panel's fault and not the young offender's. That is important, and I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I see that the hon. Member for Colchester appreciates my point. I am happy with the answer that I have been given, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not entirely sure of the point that I shall make. There is something written on my copy of the Bill, but I did not think it sufficiently serious to merit tabling an amendment.
<P>
The clause deals with what happens if agreement is not reached at the panel's first meeting. My point relates to the discussion that I had with the Minister of State earlier about legal representation. If, God forbid, some panels take a coercive and draconian approach, youngsters will not agree. The Minister used the word ``negotiation''. That implies to me that when the panel says to young Johnny, ``We think that you should do this,'' he has the opportunity to say, ``I'm not sure whether I want to do that. Can we do this instead? Can we do it in this way? Can I do a bit less of that and a bit more of this?'' That is the point of the two-sided discussion in agreeing a contract.
<P>
The phrase that raised my eyebrows was in subsection (3)(b). If the young offender and the panel fail to reach an agreement, or if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) agreement is reached with the offender but he does not sign the record produced . . . and
<P>
(b) his failure to do so appears to the panel to be unreasonable'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>the panel will end the meeting and send him back to the court. How will panels be instructed as to how to consider what is reasonable in terms of a young offender's part of the discussion? Perhaps I have not put that especially well, but that is the essence of my concern, and the Minister will deal with it by way of guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman previously gave as an example a visit that he made to Boston to consider how young offenders are dealt with there. I witnessed the process that he described four years ago when I went to observe the American drug court system. I remember attending a drug court in Oakland in California, where a young man had effectively reached a probation order under which young offenders have to demonstrate to the court that they are subjecting themselves to regular testing and are remaining drug free. The young man had been caught in possession of cannabis&#151;bear in mind that I am talking about California. He had a dirty test and when the judge asked him about it, he said, ``Well, if it'd suit the court I'd rather do my time, get out and carry on smoking dope.'' That was his approach.
<P>
That is the sort of situation, although not necessarily the same set of circumstances, that the hon. Gentleman described. We must be realistic: although it is not our intention, young people will occasionally fail to reach an agreement with a panel on the nature of a contract. Some people would rather do their time in young offenders' establishments. For that reason, clause 10 provides that where there is no prospect of an agreement, or where an agreement appears to have been reached but the young offender has refused to sign the contract, the panel must refer the young offender back to the court for resentencing. That is wholly appropriate. In those circumstances, it would be inappropriate to soldier on with unwilling young offenders in a process that is designed to take them out of a cycle of behaviour rather than to perpetuate the cat-and-mouse games that might otherwise be played in the criminal justice system.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is suitably reassured. I do, because this debate has given my hon. Friend the Minister of State time to return to the Room to take part in the debate on clause 11.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> In the circumstances that the Under-Secretary described, I have no doubt that the panel would act perfectly reasonably in referring someone back to the court. However, we needed to make our points, and more important elements will be discussed in our debates on clause11.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 9, line 30, leave out from beginning to `or' in line 32.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 68, in page 10, leave out lines 30 to 34 and insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `If the panel, having discussed with the offender such a request as is mentioned in subsections (3)(a)(ii) or 4(d) fails to agree a variation in the contract with the offender the panel shall refer the offender back to the appropriate court.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 69. in schedule 1, page 50, line 32, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4)(a) If, in a case where the offender is referred back to the court at the request of the offender under sections 11(3)(a) or sections 11(4)(d) the court may revoke the order if it considers that a significant change in the offenders circumstances (such as his being taken to live abroad) make compliance with the youth offender contract impractical.
<P>
(b) In all other respects the court shall seek to determine such a referral back to the court at the request of the offender by agreeing with the offender and the panel such variations in the contract as the court thinks fit.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to test whether the arrangements in the clause have struck a balance between the rights of the panel and the rights of the young offender.
<P>
As I read it, the clause does not give the offender much of a chance to ask to be referred back to a court. Therefore, he may be tempted to think that the only way he can be referred is by seriously breaching the contract. If I am wrong, perhaps the Minister will explain the position.
<P>
The amendments would improve the structure of referrals back to the court and would allow for circumstances in which a young offender wishes to vary the terms of the contract because he finds it too onerous. If both sides are not satisfied, it would be possible to refer back to a court.
<P>
Amendment No. 67 woud delete lines 30 to 32 in subsection (3)(a), so that the matter is dealt with not when the request is made but when the panel reviews whether the contract should continue. Amendment No. 68 would leave out the lines that state that a court must be satisfied that there is soon to be a change in circumstances, such as a young person moving abroad. That is a limited provision, and does not deal with my point about a young offender wanting to review the position. The amendment states that if the panel discusses an offender's problems and fails to agree a variation in the contract,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the panel shall refer the offender back to the appropriate court.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 69 puts the final piece of the jigsaw in place. If, as allowed by amendment No. 67, a case is referred back to the court to the request of the offender, the court may revoke the order if it considers that there has been
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a significant change in his circumstances'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(b) In all other respects, the court shall seek to determine such a referral back to the court at the request of the offender by agreeing with the offender and the panel such variations in the contract as the court thinks fit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are two aspects to the amendment. First, the young offender needs to be given a chance to say, ``Hang on a minute. I am not getting on with this as well as I thought I might. Can we have a meeting to discuss the terms of the contract?'' He needs to be able to make that request. Having had the meeting, and if it is not possible to reach agreement, the offender ought to be able to say, ``I think we should go back to court.'' At present, I do not think that he has that option.
<P>
Having returned to court, and if the offender's circumstances change, such as his family taking him to live abroad, clearly that is a reason for terminating the referral order. In such circumstances, one assumes that the court would then impose a conditional discharge by way of a new sentence, which it could not do originally for the reasons that we have already discussed.
<P>
There is an important element, which comes back to the point about ending up with coercion in the process. Let us say that the young offender, having returned to court, says, ``I have come back because I am being asked to do all these things, which I cannot live with. I don't want to upset anybody, but I am being asked to do too much. Can we come to some agreement?'' In those circumstances, the court would seek to reach an agreement, so that the referral order can continue, progress and be successful. If agreement cannot be reached, the referral order will be terminated.
<P>
I hope that I have explained my argument well enough. In essence, I do not think that the arrangements, as currently structured, give the young offender much of a chance to say that he is not happy with something. I suspect that he may get that chance in practice, but as we are putting in place the framework, it is important for it to be one in which the young offender has&#151;I am reluctant to use the phrase ``has some rights''&#151;the opportunity to challenge what is being done. If it fails, the offender will end up back in court, so rather than being back before the court because he has breached the order when he may be resentenced, we should have a mechanism, whereby the young offender can say, ``Can't we go back to the court and get an independent assessment of what I am being asked to do, so that we can achieve a satisfactory outcome?'' That is a constructive approach that is not intended to wreck the referral orders in any way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The young offender has rights, but he also has responsibilities, which is where the emphasis should lie. Our emphasis is very much on the young offender's responsibility to comply with a contract that he has entered into, and which is designed to create a programme of activity that will be challenging. There is no doubt about that. It will be challenging and rigorous, as it is designed to prevent that young offender from reoffending. It also needs to be achievable, which is where the issue of rights comes in. The young person has a right to say when the programme of activity is not working, or when he feels unable to deliver the responsibilities and undertakings that he has entered into. He should have the right to ensure that the panel is made aware of what is happening, and to consider the consequences flowing from that awareness.
<P>
That is why we specifically give the young offender that right in subsection (3)(a)(i) and (ii). Where the offender has notified the panel that he wishes to seek its agreement to a variation of the contract terms or wishes the panel to refer him back to the appropriate court with a view to the referral order being revoked because of a significant change in his circumstances that makes compliance with the youth offender contract impractical, he has the right to notify the panel, which will then make a request under the provisions of the subsection, convene and determine the proper course to take. I hope that, in view of what I have said, the hon. Gentleman will feel that his concerns are dealt with adequately in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not believe that it is likely to happen, but if a court subsequently finds that a panel has behaved unreasonably, because a referral back to the court has occurred, it would be entitled under schedule 1 to find that any breach alleged by the panel was not the offender's fault and send him back to the panel. Does the hon. Member for Ryedale follow me?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That is a specific right that we are enshrining in the Bill, because it is important that all those involved believe that the process is fair. That is how we engage the young offender in what is happening.
<P>
We all know that when children and young people nurse a sense of grievance that overpowers all else, we cannot do anything with them. Central to our approach to youth justice is our determination to do something with these young people, whom the system has all too often given up on in the past or who have given up on the system. Neither option will be readily available under the dispensation that we have put in place.
<P>
In view of the youth offending teams' statutory duty to monitor the compliance of young offenders with the agreed programme of activity and the panel's right, enshrined in the clause, to use the power of hindsight when reviewing the terms of a contract, if they think it right, I hope that the hon. Gentlemen will feel, on reflection, that we are justified in resisting his amendments and that he will seek to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister's comments show that there is not a huge gap between us. As I said, I do not think that the Government's scheme of things allows the court to decide what should be in the contract. The Minister may have thought that that was inappropriate, and I can understand why, but it seems to me to be an all-or-nothing situation. Either the panel says, ``This is what is in the contract and the young offender does not agree'', in which case the referral order could in the end be terminated, or there is another means of review. I wanted to know whether there was a case for the court to endeavour to arbitrate between the young offender and the panel about the contract in such circumstances. That point is not insignificant, but we do not wish to pursue it at this juncture. Given that I am content with the Under-Secretary explanation's that the young offender will have at least a chance to have the matter reviewed, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 51, line 40, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`from the date of extensions or variations.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment makes an important point. As the Under-Secretary said earlier, schedule 1 deals with further court proceedings after youngsters have been referred to youth offender panels. Part II of schedule 1 on page 51 sets out what powers are available to the court to extend the referral orders if, during the process of being under a referral order, the young offender reoffends. The amendment provides an opportunity for the referral order to be extended. Under the Bill, the referral order can be extended, but the total length of any referral order shall not be more than 12 months from the date on which it was first made.
<P>
I first thought that that was a little silly and that we should table an amendment referring not to 12 months, but to 24 months. I understand the point about 12 months being long enough, but let us suppose that a young offender who is eight or nine months through a referral order gets into bad company, reoffends and ends up back before the court. It is not much of a punishment to tell the offender to carry on with the referral order, that there were only three months left of it and not to reoffend again. Moreover, it would be a tragic failure of the system if, in all other respects, he was responding well to the referral order but, because he had reoffended and there was just a 12-month limit from the start of the original referral order, he could not continue to be pushed through the process.
<P>
Will the Minister consider the scheme outlined in the amendment? If a young offender reoffends during a 12-month referral order, it should be open to the court to say to the offender, ``We will continue with the referral order and with your work with the youth offender panel. You will have another 12 months from now, not 12 months from the time that the original referral order was made.''
<P>
I hope that the Minister understands what is in my mind and that&#151;even though he may explain that the amendment is unworkable&#151;he agrees with the importance of avoiding two extremes: the extreme of a reoffending young offender being punished in a way that is not in his best interest and the opposite extreme of not punishing him at all for a fairly serious offence committed while on a referral order from the youth offender panel.
<P>
Extending the 12-month principle may not be the way out. However, a fresh referral order that could apply and run for another 12 months may be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I must stress to the hon. Member for Ryedale the importance of recognising that the Bill makes provision for a totally new approach to youth offending. Listening to him, I was reminded of the mitigation that I hear repeatedly from defence lawyers; I imagine that he heard something similar during his career as a police officer. My hon. Friends have certainly heard such lawyers say: ``He fell into bad company and the offence is a one-off. Give him another chance. Let the conditional discharge continue to run and the probation order be extended. It will be all right next time.''
<P>
We are not proceeding like that. The referral will not have worked if a second offence is so serious that a futher 12 months is necessary. Our job is to protect the public; a young person committing such an offence must face the full rigour of the law. That offender will be dealt with by the court, to which all options will be open. He can therefore expect a condign punishment. 
<P>
To put it bluntly: no more excuses. That is how the Bill originated and that is why we are not prepared to accept the amendment.
<P>
Part II of schedule 1 sets out the arrangements for extending referral orders when other offences have been committed before or after the making of the original order. Paragraph 13 specifies that the overall maximum period shall not exceed 12 months. The amendment, however, would allow a referral order to be extended beyond that, provided that the period from the date of the extension or variation does not exceed 12 months.
<P>
We do not accept that. The Government's view is that a minimum and maximum period should be set out in the Bill so as to achieve consistency and proportionality. We have arrived at a minimum of three months and a maximum of 12 months. That will allow the courts to respond to a spectrum of offences, ranging from the minor to the more serious.
<P>
The courts will determine what action to take when circumstances, such as those outlined by the hon. Member for Ryedale, arise. Should the youth offending team report that a young person is responding well to a programme of activity and that such a programme is, in its opinion, likely to be successful as a means of preventing further reoffending, that will take place within the 12-month period.
<P>
However, should the team be unable to give such an opinion, the sooner the case is disposed of through condign punishment, the better. Under such circumstances, saying that little Johnny fell into bad company will be no excuse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> No, we did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That was the hon. Gentleman's excuse for specifying circumstances in which it would be appropriate to consider extending the referral. The Government do not buy that, nor do the public. I hesitate about being party political, especially on a day such as this, but I shall be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> The Minister cannot resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No, I cannot. 
<P>
In 1997, the public chose to invest their trust in Labour, and when we go to the country in a general election, they will do so again, and reject the Conservative party unequivocally.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am glad that the Minister gave way because, essentially, his argument just does not stack up. If he is saying that a breach of a referral order is such a heinous thing that there should be condign punishment, why has he put in the Bill a provision to continue with referral orders? Even if an offence were a most minor matter&#151;we were told earlier that it could never be so minor that a fine or conditional discharge would be better than a referral order&#151;the provision would mean that if, after 12 months, someone wanted to continue with the order, the offender would not be punished at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> On the contrary. The reason that we set a period of 12 months and said that it will not be extended is that it concentrates everyone's mind on the process and the importance of complying with it. Under the hon. Gentleman's proposal, there would be a situation&#151;I can see it stretching out before me as sure as night follows day&#151;in which, time and again, 12 months would not be a maximum; it would be extended to 24 months, and we are determined to avoid that. It is important to remember that this would be for a second offence, committed during the last chance. When a person is given a last chance, it is just that, unless there are wholly exceptional circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> There are too many last chances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Too many last chances have been given to too many young people. They must understand that, save in wholly exceptional circumstances which could be justified by allowing referral to continue for 12 months, but no more, they can expect to be dealt with in a way that reflects the circumstances with which the court would be bound to regard such a breach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> What would be the position if, at the second offence, a young person had pleaded not guilty? The idea of referral is that someone admits that he has committed a crime. What would happen if at the second offence he denied it but was found guilty by the court?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The court may wish to take account of the denial and subsequent finding of guilt in determining a young person's attitude to his offending. I have to say that. In may view, and that of those responsible under the existing system when issues are examined if release on licence is being considered, a refusal to accept responsibility would rightly count against a young person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> What the Minister said appears to demolish the justification for the provisions in part II. Circumstances where a person offends while subject to a referral order apparently might be so exceptional and minor that perhaps the Minister should tell us what they are. My conclusion is that the best course of action would be take away part II and redraft it, to limit the scope in which a person subject to a referral order who re-offended could be kept on the order rather than be punished in the way that the Minister described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Gentleman now attempts to row back from the position in which he placed himself. I shall not allow him to do that.
<P>
I shall give an example of exceptional circumstances. A young person has been given a maximum referral order of 12 months. In month 11, he goes to a disco with a group of friends. There, they are attacked by another group of young people. The young person admits that he used disproportionate force when responding to the attack and thus went beyond self defence. In those circumstances, I can envisage a court letting the order run for the remaining four weeks if it had received reports of excellent, unblemished conduct for the 11th month, heard the full facts and was satisfied that the first group was subject to an unprovoked attack.
<P>
If a young person fell into bad company, as the hon. Member for Ryedale put it, went out and was part of the attacking group, the court would be duty bound to invoke the full range of penalties at its disposal. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman. I could not give clearer examples in response to the challenge that he set. As the hon. Gentleman will realise, those examples are rooted in the experience of practising law. As a police officer, the hon. Gentleman must have been called to such incidents at pubs and clubs. He probably appreciates the reality better than most members of the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister has made my point for me. He gave an example of a young person who is involved in a violent crime in the 11th month of a 12-month referral order. The Minister wants the young person to continue with the referral but he does not want to provide for an extension to deal with the offending behaviour. We believe that it makes sense to give the court the flexibility of extending the referral. The Minister believes that it is better to leave the Bill as it is. It is his Bill, and we shall leave the matter. However, the Minister is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I can only say that the hon. Gentleman expresses neither what I think nor what I said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> Try concensus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Try as I might, I cannot think of anything conscensual to say. The hon. Member for Ryedale has his view, we have ours; we are in the majority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I have not yet sought leave to withdraw the amendment. However, we shall return to the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 1 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Functions of youth offending teams</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 11, line 36, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and of all discussions with the young offender about the terms of the contract.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with a small point of detail. Under paragraph (2)(b), the panel is obliged to keep records of the offender's compliance with the terms of the contract but nothing in the Bill requires the panel to keep records of the discussions that went into agreeing the contract with the young offender. That is an important point because if the matter ends up being referred back to the court, what was discussed between the young offender and the panel about the contract could play an important role in the court's determination of what is to be done with the young offender.
<P>
I see that the Minister is, like me, having to jump from one issue to another and find the right piece of paper on what he is supposed to say, but I cannot think of much more to say about what is a simple point. I do not want to catch the Minister unprepared.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The clause sets out supplementary information regarding the functions of youth offending teams that we expect to be fulfilled. One of those functions is to keep records of compliance and non-compliance with the programme of activity. The amendment would extend those functions to include a requirement to maintain records of all discussions with the young offender about the terms of the contract. I ask the hon. Member for Ryedale to reflect on what that would mean in practice. He knows the burdensome nature of record keeping, which has sometimes, in the view of Labour Members who are concerned about the effectiveness of policing, diminished the effectiveness of the police service. The burden on the police of maintaining and keeping records of all that occurs between them and others in a case is a heavy one and it would be wrong to impose such a burden on those responsible for the work of the youth offender teams and of the panel.
<P>
Nonetheless, it is essential that careful records are kept in respect of compliance and non-compliance since they may form the basis of breach proceedings or may enable the panel to sign off the contract. It is also good practice for the panel to keep a record of dealings with the young offender, particularly where they relate to the terms of the contract. I expect record keeping to be covered in some detail in guidance to the youth offending teams, but we require the keeping only of records relating to compliance and non-compliance and possible court proceedings, on which it is necessary to place a statutory duty on the youth offending team.
<P>
We want to be guided by pragmatism and proportionality&#151;valuable principles in life generally. I hope to persuade the hon. Member for Ryedale that were his party to adopt those principles on a range of measures, it might once again&#151;at some stage in the distant future&#151;be fit to resume the reins of governance. That time is not yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I was working out a brief response, in the hope that we might conclude part I today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I look forward to the hon. Gentleman's response, which I hope will enable him to withdraw the amendments. Well meant though they are, their effect would be less than satisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Pragmatism and proportionality were at the heart of the Conservative European election campaign, which is why it was so successful.
<P>
I think that the Minister said that guidance would be used to tackle the issue and, as in the case of other amendments tabled in order to discuss the issue, I am happy with that assurance. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
