If I suspect that somebody is coming in with an offensive weapon or
something that they should not have, I have always taken it upon myself
or charged one of my senior deputies to investigate that. If it means
opening a bag, that is something that I would do. I would usually
contact the parent first, though, to seek their sanction. In terms of
members of staff who are accused of something by a student, I am in
full support of that provision in the Bill. Those members of staff
should remain anonymous until it is proved and the police charge that
person with an offence.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000040">&#160;</a>

                           </em> On the last point, I certainly agree
completely with teacher anonymity. Anything that can stop mischievous
accusations is really important. That is almost a no-brainer. I
completely support it. In terms of the extension of searching, the
power of it is more in the symbolism than in the actuality. As for
extending the power to search in itself, I do not think that schools
are jumping up and down with joy about it as something that is going to
make a huge difference to them. Symbolically, the idea that there is
legitimate authority in the school is a very important message, and it
is an important message to get across to parents. I do not think,
however, that schools will be using those powers to substantially
increase the number of searches that they
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000042">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I totally concur with what the other two
panellists have said. Like Michael, I have always searched students if
I have believed that they had an offensive weapon or anything that is a
danger in a school community. I would do it with another adult present,
so it is quite clearly done sensitively. Obviously, where possible, I
would phone the parents. I also totally concur with teacher anonymity,
because it is very easy to make accusations just because you have had
an argument or you have a grudge against somebody. The teacher’s
career could then be ruined by something that is completely
false.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000043">&#160;</a>

up on something that the others have not said, as always, the issue is
“What does it look like?” and “What happens
next?” For search powers to actually work, you need clear
behaviour policies and guidelines in schools, so that, for instance,
you are not leaving your most inexperienced person in the situation of
trying to implement a search power. Instead, you have well-organised
systems where properly experienced people can come and carry out
whatever duty needs to be carried out. It is always a

going to do it?”, but I have no problem with that. In 2005, when
the practitioners considered this, it was limited in the way it was
because the legal advice at the time was that it needed to be. If the
legal advice is changed, and if Ministers are happy and relaxed with
that, I am perfectly happy with

                           </em> I would think that a teacher would be
most unwise to do any form of intimate search of a pupil of the
opposite sex under almost any circumstances. I imagine that if we sat
here and thought, we could come up with some, but I would have thought
it most unwise. If, for instance, they were with a child off the school
premises, there were no other people to call upon and they thought that
the child had a dangerous implement, I would urge them to call the
police, rather than actually embark on a search. I would be interested
in what my colleagues would say on that. It is something that troubles

back to “What does it look like?” and “How would

me is the distinction between searches for things that are stipulated

understand.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000051">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This search power only applies in circumstances
where somebody is deemed to be causing an immediate danger to
themselves or to others, where powers of restraint are obviously
already available. On that point about school rules, all of us who have
been involved over the years, as practitioners or Ministers, in trying
to bring in law around behaviour are seeking to give the maximum
appropriate powers possible to teachers and head teachers in order to
have good behaviour and discipline in schools. Do you have any feeling
that any of the provisions in the Bill are actually to send some kind
of signal, whether it is to teachers or to tabloid headline writers, or
are they real, practical powers that can be used? For example, in
relation to the deletion of information from mobile devices that are
held by pupils, is it properly a matter for school staff to examine and
erase data from pupils’ mobile devices? Is it sensible for
teachers to have more powers than police officers would have under
those circumstances, for example?<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000052">&#160;</a>

important. It gives support to head teachers and senior staff who want

common sense of head teachers and senior staff to do things properly.
Searching a pupil is always going to be a difficult thing, and a good
and sensible head teacher with a fair degree of common sense would do
it properly, contacting the parents or appointing someone who had a
good relationship with that child to do it for

is not mainly to do with the pupils in this situation, but with the
teachers and staff, is it possible that the specific provisions in the

directing this at Sir Alan, because you have done reviews on behaviour,
discipline and so on. Might it potentially put teachers in a more
difficult situation, if they are deleting material from people’s
mobile devices without any recourse to the police,

things was actually very low. The standard of training and support for
people was often very low.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000062">&#160;</a>

concerned at one point when there was a move to remove the need to
record instances of restraint. I thought that was very damaging for
teachers and, if I had been a young teacher, I would have probably
refused to carry out restraint unless a proper record was made, because
what would have been my defence against a parent complaining six weeks
later that I had done something improper? So you need to unpick these

would not necessarily relate to discipline. You could argue that search
is taking place when discipline has broken down. There are many other
measures under which children are made aware that a teacher of either
sex has full disciplinary powers, which I thoroughly support. One of
the pluses of this discipline debate is, I hope, the continued
increased awareness among teachers that they do have disciplining
powers—and responsibilities, on which we need to focus just as
much. But no, I do not think that the issue is of the search of
opposite sex, as I said.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000066">&#160;</a>

children. They have not changed much in the 42 years that I
have dealt with them. The children in Bermondsey in 1968 were very much
the same as the children I teach now in Hackney. The thing that
improves behaviour is the culture of the school, which is determined by
the school’s leadership. If you have the right leader and the
right senior team, it changes the culture of the school and behaviour
improves as a consequence. If the Bill gives more power, more freedom
and more authority for good heads to do what is necessary to improve
behaviour, it is a good thing, especially in challenging areas, where
often we are surrogate parents for a lot of our children. Where
parenting is not good, and where children come from unstructured homes
with very little care and support, heads have to intervene on a daily
basis with large numbers of

I’ll deal with you tomorrow morning.” The parents will
say that the member of staff cannot do that because the youngster was
on the street; he was not in school. He was outside the school gates,
so the member of staff has no authority to do that. I have always
challenged such arguments, and I have usually won the case. If the Bill

it is a very loaded word. Some aspects of the Bill trouble me, because
I think it is an inconclusive Bill. I think there will need to be

thrust is coming from the Government on that. We are thinking in terms
of schools and academies operating in chains. Well, one of the virtues
of that is the support that you get from groups of schools working
together. In my work I have seen that schools working in partnership
have enormously empowered structures and have access to all sorts of
things. Some, for example, employ their own child mental health service
people. That is a big bone of mine, because the general national
standard is a

seems to me to be a hazy area, and I worry about that. I worry about
some of the changes on admissions and the role of the adjudicator. I do
not know whether that comes into your area of removing bureaucracy and
pressures on schools. To me schools are the leaders of the education
system, and they have to have the capacity, the self-belief and all
those things. They are also a national education service, and I want my
grandchildren, wherever they live in the country, to have a top- class
service. I do not want them simply  to be lucky in living in

concerned that a teacher might not behave responsibly, and yet in law
they would be allowed to do something that might be detrimental. We
also have the issue of no notice detention, where somebody could give a
child an immediate detention without any thought to their personal
circumstances—they might be a young carer or subject to abuse at
home.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000087">&#160;</a>

the correct channels. In law, it might say that you have to teach a
certain subject, but if the head and governors say that you do not have
to, that is their risk and their responsibility. The teacher does not
take it upon themselves to do that. I understand your concerns, but the

to me that the Bill sends the message that behaviour is important and
that head teachers have to take it more seriously than they possibly
do. Three years ago, Ipsos MORI did a poll—a very interesting
survey. It asked parents what they considered the most important issue
in schools and the challenges that head teachers had. The top issue,
with 65%, was discipline and pupil behaviour—I have the figures
here. What is also interesting is that when head teachers were asked
what their top management priority was, behaviour and discipline came
way down the list. There is a mismatch there, and the Bill sends the
message to head teachers that they cannot do very much, and certainly
cannot promote attainment, unless they have the right behaviour in the
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000092">&#160;</a>

You do not “do” behaviour. It is linked with a good
curriculum, good quality teaching, good relationships within the school
and a good ethos. Behaviour does not just exist unconnected to anything
else; it is also about having good systems. There is a danger of
talking about behaviour in a vacuum, and that is entirely wrong.

which I will pick up on, of which I entirely disapprove is the element
in the Bill about no notice detentions. I have always argued that the
best way to teach behaviour as a parent or teacher is to practise it.
You have to walk the walk. It is nonsense to be discourteous and rude
to parents with no notice detentions. You are actually exhibiting poor
behaviour. It is thoroughly unreasonable and designed to annoy the
parent. The vast majority of schools will not do it because it would
run against their principles and how they operate. In that case, why is
it in the Bill? The danger with these sorts of thing is that someone

did not particularly like some of the language about restraint.
Restraint has actually been in the law since 1996, and I think it was
the previous Conservative Government who brought that in. It is a
highly skilled procedure, and to restrain a child is a significant act.
The last thing you want is inexperienced or junior staff in the
classroom having the assumption that if someone is playing up, they can
use restraint. The language that speaks of giving teachers the
authority to use restraint in the classroom to maintain discipline sent
shivers up my back as a head teacher, because I know who jolly well
will end up sorting out all the problems. We need to be extremely
careful that when we talk about these things, we unpick them. I have to
repeat to myself, “What do they look like? What will happen?

One was that schools would not give notice, but I imagine that in
reality most schools and teachers would contact one of the parents by
mobile phone or e-mail and give them notice. You also made a point
regarding restraint. I know that most teachers use that as the complete
last resort—they all hate it, not only because of the impact on
the child, but the impact on the rest of the class and on the teacher.
Often, the teachers break down in tears afterwards, especially if it
was a younger child who was in need of restraint because they have been
threatening the safety of another child. Surely, the powers in the Bill
are more permissive than
prescriptive.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000104">&#160;</a>

things that they should be looking at when they are hearing appeals or
representations, or actually just getting the head teacher’s
reports on discipline in the school. A guidance checklist would be just
as effective. The moment that you start picking one, you come up with
the next thing to pick up. I am not sure I think this is so significant
that I would legislate on this alone.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000113">&#160;</a>

We talked about incoherence earlier, but considering that we have a

they do to suit better the needs of their pupils, does the English

children should follow the English baccalaureate, but there will be a
proportion of children who are not academic who will find it a real
struggle to get through it. They need to follow a proper vocational
programme, not a watered-down academic curriculum that calls itself a
vocational programme. This is something that we have not got right for
many, many years in this country: a properly structured, rigorous
vocational programme that will meet their needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000115">&#160;</a>

is a great shame that there seems to have been a downgrading of and
criticism of vocational education. We offer BTEC sport and BTEC art,
and the work done by students is absolutely outstanding and engaging;
that is a different repertoire of learning. At my—very
challenging—school, the curriculum has been judged outstanding
in the last two Ofsteds, because it is personalised and engages young
people, who sometimes find it very difficult to believe that they can
be
successful.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000117">&#160;</a>

line? In my view, we still do not put enough focus on the significance
of the consistent, good quality of teaching in a school to impact on
behaviour. We tend to nod at that, and accept it as a universal truth,
which Ofsted repeats and vindicates regularly, and then move on
rapidly.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000119">&#160;</a>

still seems to me an absolute absurdity that we have requirements on
schools, even after the Bill, to have school policies on every thing
under the sun, and yet the one thing that we do not require schools
collectively to determine consistency on is the single purpose for
which they are built, which is learning and teaching. It is so absurd
about the English system, that we demand that schools have policies on
this, that and everything else, but we do not in this country put
sufficient focus on ensuring that a school is the sum of its parts. You
can have a whole lot of brilliant people working their socks off, but
they may not be the sum of their parts, if they are not effectively
being consistent over key things. I know “consistency” is
a boring word. We all nod and then move on rapidly to something else,
but it is the one key thing to improving standards in schools, in my
opinion.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000120">&#160;</a>

reason—sometimes that is financial and sometimes that is a
complete commitment to inclusion, which is not always appropriate. I am

                           </em> This is a very brief point on your question
about clarity on moving between schools. On the point of permanent
exclusion, when a child is very vulnerable and has to move out of
school to an off-site unit or to another school, there is very little
transfer of information. Certainly that point, when there is so much
history about the child that needs to be passed on, should trigger a
case conference or some kind of proper look at the child and the
records, which should be moved. That process should happen or be
triggered at that particular
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000124">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The history of children who are
excluded from mainstream schools and put into off-site provision is not
particularly good, especially for those children with special needs or
with statements of special educational needs. It is simply wrong that
the weakest and most vulnerable children who need a secure environment
and who are used to a particular institution have to go somewhere else
and start all over again. As a country, we have to move towards
handling those issues within the mainstream situation. That might mean
a bit more funding, which is difficult in these straitened times.
Certainly, for a small proportion of youngsters in my institution who
present constant behavioural issues in school and who would be excluded
elsewhere, I have decided to keep them and deal with them in a
specialised
unit.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000125">&#160;</a>

said. You would find other examples of that up and down the country. We

extremely well, and we do not seem to have cracked that one.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000126">&#160;</a>

special educational needs is enormous and I am slightly edgy about
picking up this one thing and saying that we will legislate on it. A
lot of what we currently do is a bit suspect when one begins to
scrutinise it. For example, we talk about early intervention, but we do
not fund it. When we do provide funds for it, we do not ring-fence our
funding, so we just hope that the money we want to be spent on
something will get there. We are not very coherent in a lot of our

problems are so hard to deal with because they have not been addressed
before. I understand what you are saying, but there can be other
factors that can cause those sorts of behavioural difficulties other
than a wrong assessment. Finally, is there the capacity in the system

troubles me, and I think that it is a mistake that will need to be
revisited—I mentioned earlier that I thought it was

partnerships. Schools can deal with problems with themselves and in the
community more effectively when they work together than when they work
in isolation. I do not like the picture of isolated schools—I
referred to this earlier when I talked about chains of
academies—not for the things that people often think about in
behaviour and attendance partnerships, but because their capability and
capacity to be autonomous needs to be increased, so that they can have
joint appointments of specialist staff and so that they can manage and
lead as front runners.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000135">&#160;</a>

one-form-entry Hertfordshire primary school. I wonder what it will look
like to that head teacher when services inevitably disappear at county
hall and so on, and they are told that the school is autonomous. We
already have problems recruiting head teachers in primary schools, and
I see that situation getting worse. That is one of many reasons why my
vision is of autonomous groups of schools working together, mirrored by
organisations such as ARK or whoever it may be, being mutually
supportive in creating their capabilities and capacity. That would be
localism. It would not be the localism of my youth when I first started
teaching, but it would be a localism that I would buy into and

there is the common assessment framework, for example. Will you talk a
little more about what you think would work? All of us are concerned
that those children are the ones who could fall through some of the
gaps in the Bill. I take the point that you are concerned about
legislating for a particular format of special educational needs, but
is there a role— through the behaviour and attendance
partnerships, for example, or through some of the relationships that
you have had with local authorities and local public services when
dealing with young people with those issues—that you would want
us to reflect on when thinking about how we might improve some of the

look at the situation nationally there is such disparity in services.
We probably will not have time to talk about alternative provision,
which is an aspect of this, but we have things nationally that we ought
to be ashamed of. There are children who have gone off our radar
screens to such a degree that we can only guess about them falling into
abuse. We do not actually know that, but an intelligent person would
guess that that is happening because they are perhaps having an hour a
week of home tuition week after week, month after month. It is quite
untenable, and I was pleased that the Government will implement the
requirement that all local authorities must provide proper education by
September. The question is how we will enforce that. That obligation
has been there since 1996—I think—and the local
authorities have not done it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000151">&#160;</a>

thing needs revision. In my view, we do not have sufficient focus on
early identification and intervention. Training issues is one factor. I
know that we can always say training, but you need levels of expertise
to identify what the issue may be. You need reasonable access to
expertise that you do not possess. I do not want to keep on flogging
the same point, but I would have died to have had access to a
psychiatric nurse or social worker. I did not know as a head teacher
whether this child’s display of behaviour had origins in

                           </div>mental health or whether they were being naughty. I might make an
intelligent guess, but I wanted somebody with expertise to act as a
champion for that child and their parents, and take them through an
incredibly complicated and alien system. The area of special
educational needs is enormous and it is not a simple point to answer.
That is slightly dodging your question, but it is fundamental to a lot
of the serious behaviour problems that we find in schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000152">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I totally agree that special educational
needs is a vital area. Children, particularly boys, come to secondary
school with poor reading and writing skills. They immediately go to 10
different teachers and start misbehaving because they cannot access the
curriculum. It is almost too late to do something at that point. If we
address special educational needs, we need to put real intervention
into the primary and reception areas, particularly at key stage 1. That
would stop a lot of the problems that we have by the time the children
come through at 11. It is so linked with behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000153">&#160;</a>

                           </em> We need to differentiate between
children with statements of special educational needs and those on the
special needs register. Most secondary schools have 10 to 20 youngsters
with statements of special educational needs for learning or behaviour
or both, and we need to make special provision for them. Most secondary
schools in the sort of areas I work in will have a larger group of
children on the special needs register. That does not mean that they
will be special needs children all the way through the school. A good
school will deal with their learning problems effectively, particularly
at key stage 3 and in year 7, so that they can access the secondary
curriculum and improve their attainment levels. A good barometer of how
successful a school is can be seen in how many children quickly come
off the special needs register.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000154">&#160;</a>

to behaviour? In terms of anonymity, the Bill addresses an issue that
has given the Association of Teachers and Lecturers cause for concern
for a long time, which is malicious or false allegations against
teachers. We ran a survey two years ago which showed that a frightening
proportion of teachers had either been subject to a false allegation
themselves or had seen one of their colleagues maliciously and falsely
accused. Such allegations have the power to—and often
do—devastate a teacher’s career. Therefore, we welcome
the Bill’s provisions on anonymity.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are
interested, however, in working with the Government to look at how
those provisions can be enforced. With the enforcement of the powers,
it seems to us that the devil will lie in the detail. In particular,
how would the powers work and what sanctions could be taken if a
teacher’s name were used, mentioned or put on a website, and so
on? What would the sanctions be if the anonymity powers were not
enforced? So, we are very interested in working with you on that, but
it certainly sends out a very clear signal. For too long, it has been
too easy simply to make allegations and for teachers to be suspended.
Once they are suspended, it is very difficult to get back to school.
You cannot talk to anybody. Very often, your name is blackened and
dragged through the mud, and you simply cannot pick up your career
again. So, in terms of anonymity, we welcome the powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000163">&#160;</a>

first, they are not clear that such powers are needed in the way that
they are put in the Bill and secondly, our members have raised concerns

members. In a sense the concern is that what they are doing oversteps
the mark of a proper relationship between the profession of teachers
and children’s rights. One proposal my members are particularly
concerned about, and do not think will work, is ending the requirement
to

child to be abducted going home in the dark on a country road—or
even in the town—when their parents haven’t been informed
of a detention and haven’t made arrangements for the child to be
picked up, or for something out of the usual to happen which the
same-day detention would do, for the school to be absolutely vilified
and dragged through the mud. The powers are there and clear, but my
members have concerns about their implementation, and indeed about the
proper relationship between teachers, their role and duty in school,
and the rights of children. We would want to work through those issues
with
you.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000166">&#160;</a>

will know that NASUWT has been campaigning for years on the issue of
anonymity. In fact, we worked with the Conservative party in opposition
on a number of occasions to seek to get amendments to Bills on the
issue of anonymity. It is with regret that I am rather disappointed by
the powers in the Bill, as it is something you have had a long-standing
commitment to introducing. Our concern is on a number of fronts. First,
the Bill only refers to teachers. We think it should refer to all
members of the school work

have evidence we can use on the non-teaching staff in schools, to
enable us to satisfy ourselves that we would be compliant with the

Keates:</strong>
                           </em> We don’t have that evidence. My
colleagues from Unison may have, from the casework they do. We
certainly have robust data on the number of allegations we get and we
have supplied them to you on a number of occasions. We are concerned as
well that, if we are to have this provision in the Bill, it should be a
deterrent. We do not think that the offence—and the tariff that
goes with it—is sufficient to deter the media. A maximum
£5,000 fine is not in our view a deterrent. If people think they
have a good story, it would be worth paying that. For some of the
national media, £5,000 is small change.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We also think
that the way the provisions are drafted excludes a lot of areas where
teachers will be vulnerable to allegations. For example, the proposal
talks about the pupil who is registered at the school. It seems to
imply that it is teachers who are working at that school, but does not
cover supply teachers or teachers on temporary contracts, who might
find they have an allegation made against them after they have left.
There is the whole area where schools get together collectively on
things such as educational visits, where there could be an allegation
from a pupil about a teacher at another school. There are wide areas we
do not think this provision will cover, in terms of guaranteeing
anonymity. The other disappointment from our point of view—which
will again come as no surprise to you, Nick, as I have raised it with
you on a number of occasions—is that teachers are also saying to
us that while anonymity would be welcome, the big issue at the moment
is the reporting and recording of soft information, in terms of CRB
checks, and that is not covered. We are looking at the Protection of
Freedoms Bill to see if that could be looked at in that
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000170">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">With regard to
the disciplinary provisions, we have done extensive consultation with
our members. We did a consultation in 2010 and 10,500 teachers
responded. We asked if they wanted more sanctions. In the last decade,
we had unprecedented sanctions introduced into schools to support
classroom teachers. Teachers told us that they did not want more
sanctions; they wanted more back-up in schools from school leaders to
empower them in the classroom, to maintain high standards of discipline
and to back them in using the sanctions. That was the key issue. At the
moment we have a survey going on called the Big Question, and this is
one of the areas in that. So far, of the thousands of teachers who
responded, only 15% expressed any support for extended powers to
search. There was minuscule support for anything to do with the
detention and taking away the 24 hours. We have been doing a whole load
of consultation conferences around the country as well. There is no
evidence to us that there is anything deficient about the current
powers to search. The issue is how teachers are being backed in the
classroom to use these
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000171">&#160;</a>

important that it is not abolished? It was there to try to bring a
national framework for pay and conditions and to stop every school
having to reinvent the wheel and do its own thing. The Chancellor last
year in his emergency Budget promised £250 for every member of
the public sector work force who earns under £21,000. The
Government can deliver that for teachers and they can deliver that for
all sorts of other staff. They have told us that they cannot deliver it
for school support staff. So there will be an irony. There is no
mechanism to deliver it. The School Support Staff Negotiating Body
would have given them that. So that is one body that we would like to

to discipline and dismiss teachers. It allows the Secretary of State to
take over the functions of the TDA, the GTCE and the YPLA, to appoint
the chair of Ofqual, to make changes to the national curriculum and
even to determine what early years education is, to whom it should be
taught and for

centralising and we would want more powers given back to governing
bodies, without the provisions removing some governors from the
governing bodies, and powers to be given back to the local authorities
where they are being removed so that they can provide provision equally
across their areas. However, what we would also want is for the mantra
of respect for professionals to be put in place properly so that
practitioners are involved in devising solutions for the curriculum,
looking at ways in which that can go forward and they can be involved
in regulation of the profession rather than the GTCE’s powers
apparently dissolving or being taken back to the Secretary of State.
Also it should be clear that there should be a requirement for pupils
to be taught by qualified teachers. There is obviously a role and we
are very supportive of the regulation and the national body for support
staff. It is important that all staff within schools are properly
represented and have proper terms and conditions. But we do think that
professionalism is very important and pupils should be taught by
qualified

                           </em> I think it is entirely correct given the
profound implications of the irreversible decision to become an
academy. In terms of the pay and working conditions of the staff, which
are important in providing high-quality education, the interests of
children and young people and, from our point of view, the interests of
parents, it is important that you have a school that is of the
locality, not in the locality—that is the difference. I think it
is perfectly legitimate for us to express our views in ways that are
being
done.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000189">&#160;</a>

McAnea:</strong>
                           </em> The impact on our members: we are currently
carrying out a big consultation on what they want to do and how they
want us to take it forward. It is something we have been working on for
about three years now. We had almost reached an agreement on things
like national role profiles, a new job evaluation scheme and a whole
range of issues that we thought would be useful to schools. Indeed, I
know that the head teachers’ organisations were supportive,
although I think there are some mixed views in the employer
organisations—but the employers were working with us on this.
When the Bill that established the SSSNB went through Parliament, as
far as I am aware no political parties were against the organisation,
so we were quite surprised when it was one of the first things to be
abolished. It gave lots of power to the Secretary of State in terms of
what the outcomes would be. In fact, we had reservations about that and
what the outcomes of the negotiations would be, but it set a framework
for skill support staff. We are in a position in England now where
about 40% of our members who work in schools are no longer covered by
any national agreement. The pay structure for teachers goes across
everything except academies. For our members, if you are outside the
community schools, and if you are in a foundation, a trust school or an
academy, you are outside of national bargaining. As far as we can see,
that is the direction of travel for the Government. We were trying to
bring some coherence and consistency into the
structure.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a predominantly female work force. There are high levels of low pay.
There is a lot of confusion over the working time. Teachers are
commissioned to work 1,265 hours. They obviously work longer than that.
Some of our members have similar contracts. Many of them do not. There
is a lack of transparency. They do not know what they get paid for in
terms of annual leave. They have that big break during the summer. They
do not get paid for it. They do not get paid for the Easter or
Christmas holidays. They only get paid for the number of hours that the
children are actually in school. What we and the employers face is a
situation where we are going to have to get into negotiations on an
individual school by school
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000197">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
your other point about the role of local authorities, our concern is
that local authorities at the moment provide a very valuable service to
schools, albeit variable across the board. I am sure you will have
heard that from other people. What we are consistently seeing now is a
kind of triplication of resources. For everything that would have been
provided by a local authority, they will still have to be provided, so
we work very closely with a range of academies and academy providers.
They are all employing their own marketing managers, finance managers,
HR managers and a whole range of people. That’s great—we
will try to recruit them. But it does not seem to be making sense. It
seems very inefficient. If the Department for Education is going to act
in the way that a local authority has acted for many of the schools,
which in a sense are semi-independent, a centralised service—or
indeed one where every school replicates

Bousted:</strong>
                           </em> I think Christina said everything about
SSSNB. I just want to say something on the provisions on academies. My
reading of the Bill means that the local authorities are left with huge
responsibilities. The key responsibility is the provision of good
schools. But any powers that the local authority has to actually plan
that, or to plan it sensibly, are taken away from them. The powers that
the Secretary of State takes to himself around the provision of land,
the disposal of land and the compulsory purchase of land, and the
presumption that any new school will be either an academy or a free
school really takes away from the local authority any leverage to
fulfil their responsibilities. So local authorities are left with
responsibility but no
leverage.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will give you one example. I live in Kingston and the local authority
went through a competition with an academy sponsor. For years a new
school was needed in the north of the borough, and one is now being
built. The local authority, with parental and popular support, won that
competition, and will not now be able to build that school because of
the provisions in the Bill. It will have to be built and run by the
sponsor, who was rejected in the competition. So local authorities are
left with the responsibilities but no leverage and no locus to be able
to fulfil them. That runs through the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000200">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
issue that I have with the Bill is the belief that competition will win
and will provide the mechanism for ensuring quality. I believe that
that is profoundly mistaken. The Bill sets the school system afloat and
the Government are not keeping the proper accountability that should be
there for public money and for public education, which is paid for by
the taxpayer. Children have more rights than that which should be given
to them by parents who want to send them to such and such a free
school, or by the collaboration of exam results. They have rights that
are greater than that and I do not see in the Bill or in any of the
other Government proposals where the accountability levers will lie to
ensure that every child gets a rounded curriculum and a good
education.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000201">&#160;</a>

That is important for the reasons that everybody has given concerning

that proper provision is made for the most disadvantaged, which can be
spread. I do not want to spend too long going through the detail of it,
although we can do. Things such as the new powers relating to schools
cause concern and the extension of those, and the Secretary of
State’s having much more power over setting up free schools and
academies, concern us for the reasons that we have talked about
before.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000204">&#160;</a>

that education is going, because we feel that it is becoming less

Keates:</strong>
                           </em> In terms of the SSSNB, we think that is an
important underpinning for the development that has taken place over
the past 13 years in terms of the education team around the child.
Children’s learning needs have become more sophisticated, and
the model of just a teacher in the classroom trying to meet all those
needs is no longer a concept that many schools will recognise. As
qualified professionals in their own right, support staff are an
important part of the team around the child. We want to make sure that
both the teachers and the support staff have pay and working conditions
that recognise them as professionals, and working conditions that
enable them to focus on their role. The SSSNB was bringing a much
needed underpinning for that universal entitlement of children, to make
sure that there is that consistency of provision. Christina has
obviously identified all the variations that setting up the SSSNB was
designed to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In terms of
local authorities, we think not having a proper relationship with the
local authority makes a material difference to schools on a number of
levels. First, there is the whole issue, particularly at a time of
economic crisis, of value for money. The move towards more autonomy and
more free-standing schools is financial madness. Why have 22,000
individual spending units when you can get much wider and better
provision from the local authority?<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As well as
looking at issues of quality, that point is also important in terms of
democratic accountability. A lot of teachers whom we talk to see the
local authority as a provider of some very essential services in the
work that they do. That might be in special needs, it might be
behaviour support or it might be curriculum advisory services. We are
getting a lot of feedback at the moment on concerns about cuts to those
very important services. It is particularly important for local
authorities to be able to hold schools to account for things such as
the well-being of children. That is important to everybody. It is very
important that schools are not seen in isolation from other
children’s services and service providers. We are extremely
concerned about sections of the Bill that sever those links with local
authorities, linked to what is also happening in the Localism
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000208">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The only sanction that the Secretary of State will
have to deal with someone who is referred to him for misconduct will be
to ban them from teaching. I have two questions arising from that.
First, does the fact that the referral is just something that a
governing body has to consider, but does not necessarily have to do,
mean that this heavy sanction of loss of ability to teach is
fundamentally unfair because it rests on the subjective decision of
governing bodies as to whether to refer or not? Secondly, should the
Secretary of State have some other sanction other than just the
sanction of prohibition?<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000209">&#160;</a>

                           </div>should be automatically referred for consideration by the regulatory
body. Previously it was the GTC, and when the Bill is enacted it will
be the Secretary of State. That is very important because of the huge
variation in the way in which governing bodies and head teachers
conduct those
processes.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a serious decision to decide whether someone should be dismissed and
prevented from practising the job they are trained to do. If a teacher
is dismissed at school level but not referred, they are in the worst of
all worlds. They are not going to get a job anywhere else, and they
will not have had an opportunity to present their case at an
independent
review.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000211">&#160;</a>

you study some of the cases that have been before the GTC, these things
are very rarely black and white. There are all sorts of issues. We
would argue very strongly that the Bill’s provision, which
alters the current status quo of automatic referral, will be a
detrimental step. We also think that it will undermine public
confidence. The public should be able to have confidence in the
regulation of the profession. There should be a review of decisions
made at local level. If that person is to be able to continue to
teach—they may be able to find a job somewhere else—their
misconduct should be subject to review, both for the individual and for
public
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000212">&#160;</a>

of treatment. Our members tell us that different leadership groups take
different approaches in different situations. It is also important to
remember that there are times when a teacher actually wants to have an
allegation considered properly. If the allegation is considered by the
governing body, unless there is an automatic referral, there are times
at which that will not happen. A supply teacher, for example, may never
get the opportunity to have their case
heard.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000213">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also a danger of inconsistency in the rules on the independent
safeguarding authority. We have to remember that many of the cases that
are referred are cases of assault, rather than sexual misconduct, but
all are classed as child protection. So there is a danger of all sorts
of
inconsistencies.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000214">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
whether prohibition should be the only sanction, we believe that the
current regime with its different alternatives is much better, because
it is very difficult, as Chris has said, to decide whether a person is
no longer safe to work in the classroom or whether there is some
remedial action or additional training that could be offered.
Potentially, if the teacher needs a bit of extra assistance, it would
also be a great waste of resources to train them to the point at which
they could be a very good teacher. There would be the choice of either
losing the teacher or putting the teacher back in the classroom without
that assistance, so we think that alternatives such as conditional
suspension should be
retained.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000215">&#160;</a>

you mentioned that you have surveyed your members on false allegations
and that you welcome this aspect of the Bill. First, what is the trend
like in these terms? Are such allegations becoming more frequent and is
their character changing? What can we do about that in terms of
provisions in the

                           </em> We did our survey last year, and it found
that one in six of our members had been subject to a false allegation.
One in two knew of a colleague who had been subject to a malicious or
false allegation. If an allegation gets to the point at which it has to
be made anonymous, very often it has gone too far. Coming back to a
point that Christina made about discipline, what is more important is
that the leadership of the school has a good policy and that the issue
can be dealt with quickly. Very often, the facts around these issues
can be quickly established, but very often, that does not happen,
because no one takes it upon themselves to actually do the
investigation, to find out what has actually gone on and to find out if
there are any witnesses that say, “Actually this didn’t
happen.” We had an allegation where a teacher, who was away from
school on the day that the incident was alleged to have happened, was
suspended for 10 months. The teacher did not know the details of the
allegation. It was not until there was an investigation finally that it
was found that they could not have been in school on the day that the
incident was alleged to have happened. It does get to be that
ridiculous.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000221">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
requirements are a clear policy, the leadership of the school being
able to act and having a quick investigation. The problem with
allegations is that they can go on for months and months. Something
that is patently ridiculous then has the power to end someone’s
career. Sorry, what was the
question?<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000222">&#160;</a>

point that was made about the greater powers of search and so on for
teachers to deal with problems in the classroom. Is it fair to say that
this has changed beyond recognition, because of the change in
technology and the change in habits in respect of hand-held technology
in particular? Circumstances that teachers face now are extraordinarily
different to those that prevailed 10 years ago, five years ago or even
two years ago. Is it not absolutely right that this dynamic
circumstance requires a fresh

say again that, as my members tell me, what is more important than
having something in law, particularly the measures around taking
something and wiping the data, is the worry that that could get them in
more trouble, because you have a grey area of whether that data was
illegal, morally bad or dangerous to know. It gets professionals into

we did the survey on cyber-bullying—we have done three
now—we found that what is more important to teachers is that the

			Column number: 70<a class="bkMark" name="Column70">&#160;</a>
                           </div>have felt that their school leadership did not back them up when
cyber-bullying was going on or pictures had been uploaded. That
included one complaint from a young female teacher, who had a picture
put on the web with a naked body substituted for her body, and that was
flashed around the whole school. That was not backed up by the
leadership of the school. Very often, these things are not dealt with
by legislation; they dealt with by effective leadership. The complaint
that my members, as classroom teachers, have is that, when things go
wrong, there has too often not been that strong leadership to
investigate something quickly or to deal with the issue. It all goes
back to having good behaviour policies that are consistently
implemented. That is the key to the issues of cyber-bullying, and,
indeed, better leadership on allegations is absolutely key as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000225">&#160;</a>

and the school policy is dependent on the leadership of the school
believing that they will backed beyond the school? My feeling is that
the reason why we need to do this is to send out the powerful signal
that the backing will not just come from the teachers—you know
that I am a great champion of teachers—and will not just come
from the school, but from beyond the
school.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000226">&#160;</a>

that it gives them and how they then exercise them and how that is to
be taken seriously, particularly with the issue of wiping data. That
has provoked a lot of concern. It is okay to give the teachers the
power, but if they are then deemed to have used the power unreasonably

provides a very big sledgehammer, which can crack a nut, but the shell
can get embedded elsewhere and cause other problems. I have never used

                           </em> I have to say that we have been huge critics
of quangos over the years. A review of quangos is not a particular
problem for us in terms of making sure that that review is done
properly and openly. From our point of view, the QCDA has been one of
the groups that teachers have spoken highly of, in terms of its work in
looking at the problems and issues with the curriculum. From that point
of view, it would be a loss if it went. That does not mean that we
always have to keep the groups that we have. It is about what happens
to that provision when the groups go, and that is the big
question.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000229">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Regarding the
powers that the Secretary of State will have over the national
curriculum, we do not have a problem with Parliament having a view on
the national curriculum; after all, we have a state education system.
It is therefore right that Governments take a view on the curriculum
that is to be delivered. The issue is how the debate on the contents of
the curriculum is conducted

                           </div>and, from the NASUWT’s point of view, that we do not move away
from a national curriculum and national entitlement; we campaigned for
years to get a national curriculum. We think that it underpins the
entitlement of children right across the country, and you should not
have a postcode lottery for your curriculum. Therefore, we do not have
a problem with the Government wanting to look at and review the
curriculum, particularly if they do so in a rigorous and robust
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000230">&#160;</a>

concern is the content of the curriculum: is it broad and balanced, and
does it recognise the needs of all young people or will it be too
narrow? I think at the moment, the emerging issues and concerns that we
have are about the narrowness that may come from having a core
classical curriculum and what will happen to entitlement in things that
are outside the
core.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000231">&#160;</a>

is very useful in part, and certainly some of the classroom
practitioner focus groups and some of the materials that they have
provided have been useful. The key was that there should have been
resources for teachers to use, as opposed to something that they were
directed to use, which became problematic. But as a set of resources,
that was very useful. This is one of the examples in the Bill where we
fear that additional bureaucracy or work may be created. By removing a
national provision that works to set some resources, we might be
requiring thousands of teachers across the country to do the same
thing. Where there is a national provision that is a useful resource,
we want to keep it focused in that place rather than reinventing the
wheel thousands of times. I would be happy to talk about some of the
other examples where we think that may be the case, such as in the
abolition of the

transparency. The content of the curriculum should be the subject of a
real debate, because it is absolutely key. I agree with
Chris—ATL has always supported a national curriculum. My fear
about these powers for the Secretary of State is that this Government,
and particularly the Schools Minister, have very clear views on
academic subjects. They want a curriculum that looks to a rosy past, is
based around the accumulation of factual knowledge, does not value
vocational education or subjects around a narrow core, and is highly
unpopular with the very schools that the Government are so keen to
promote—academies. I found out today that the performance of
many grammar schools against the English bac is very variable, so it
does not even seem to be a curriculum for those schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000235">&#160;</a>

right, it is right, and we will not have many more changes. That is
naïve in the extreme. Other Governments will come along and
decide it is not right and will change it again. Rather than having an
external body that can say, “It may not be perfect but we need
to hold with it”, the profession will be subject to whichever
politician comes along deciding that they really want the ancient
Egyptians rather than the ancient Greeks, and changing the whole
curriculum. Every time you change a bit of the national curriculum, you
create exponential amounts of work load for teachers. Every time you do

having on centralising powers, as you put it, and the Secretary of
State’s role, there are two groups of issues. One is what has
happened with the local authority and the relationship there. The other
is the issue of the quangos as Chris put it. Do you think there is an
argument, particularly with regard to quangos, that putting the
Secretary of State in charge makes it more accountable? As a local MP,
one could challenge something the Secretary of State is doing. When it
is a quango it is sometimes much harder for MPs to engage with someone
and hold them
accountable.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000237">&#160;</a>

is set up. It could be an arm’s length body that has a clear
accountability. It depends on the purpose for setting up the quango in
the first place. Some things in the past have been set up to be seen to
be independent of Government, because it was felt that the public would
have more confidence if there was something independent of Government.
At the end of the day, everything should be working within that
democratic structure. It must be right that Ministers who are presiding
over whatever group is set up, whether or not at arm’s length,
are held accountable for that group. There should be some way of doing
that, but it depends on how it is set up in the first place. It is also
a matter of making sure you do not have proliferation, making sure that
they are not crossing over in the things they are doing, making sure
that it absolutely clear. Some of the issues about TDA, the national
college and some of the other bodies, were that they were all doing
bits of the same thing, rather than having a clear focus. I would say
it is important that the Secretary of State has some strategic bodies
at arm’s length that can have that overview of what is taking
place, and be there to monitor, support and give
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000238">&#160;</a>

of State and Governments obviously want to have power over, and a huge
influence on, what happens in education. What seems to be happening is
a politicising of education and taking away the role of professionals
in education. On matters such as the curriculum, of course Governments
want to direct the general policy of the curriculum, but surely you
need professionals who can say, “This is what the curriculum
should be; this is how you get a well-rounded child.” That would
not necessarily, with all due respect, be politicians. If you look at
some other countries in Europe, for example Germany, politicians do not
interfere in the curriculum. They set general directions, but they
allow professionals to come in and run education, health or whatever it
happens to be. That is the same with

out a basic curriculum but give more flexibility to professionals to
build on that and to interpret and use it, that would be a better model
than a very prescriptive one. Having been married to a teacher
throughout the time of the previous Government, she would have argued,
although she was not critical of everything that that Government did,
that there was in fact a lot of micro-management in the previous set
up. To characterise it  in that sense does not ring true. I
wondered whether, if the Government manage to achieve a slimmed-down
curriculum entitlement, that would be the model we would
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000240">&#160;</a>

that had expertise in delivering and saying what the curriculum should
be like. It would take advice and be made up of people who understand
how to deliver a balanced curriculum, without politicians necessarily
being the ones to come and say, “When I went to school it was
useful for me to study classics and therefore I think everyone should
study classics.” In my union, two thirds of our members would be

people will go for judicial reviews. I do not see the provisions of the
Bill preventing that from happening. I am interested that you say that
the Bill gives powers to individual teachers, because I think the
coalition is trying to empower individual teachers, but the fact is
that things do not work like that at school level, and you can operate
only within the policy that the school determines through the governing
body. Hence a lot of sanctions are brought in, but some schools do not
use those parts of their policy. Then, teachers do not feel confident
or empowered to use those policies. So I am not sure anything in the
Bill will guarantee that individual teachers have more power or prevent
them from being

                           </div>subject to judicial review. There is more likelihood of judicial review
about the extension and open-endedness of the discretion left under the
powers to search, for example, as opposed to the current powers, which
provide a defined list of what can be searched for.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000244">&#160;</a>

reality? In many schools—this is already happening in many
secondaries—the framework being brought in says that staff will
be employed specifically to do things like searches, and that often
tends to be our members or potential members. That links very much to
the question Nick asked earlier—I know he has just left the
room—about whether there was any evidence about support staff
and allegations, and we think the two are closely linked. Many of our
members will work in a very intimate situation with pupils and young
people; they will be working one to one and providing very personal
support to young people with special educational needs—perhaps
physical needs—and, without some safeguards, the whole issue of
widening the way they can search children and the things they can
intervene on undermines children’s rights and leaves many staff
open to allegations of improper behaviour, particularly when they are
in that very intimate, one-to-one situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000245">&#160;</a>

likelihood that there will be pupils and parents who seek to make
negligence claims against schools for compensation because an event has
happened and they are saying there should have been a search. That is
certainly a danger. We think teachers do not like to use this power.
Our teachers tell us they do not like to use these searches. There are,
of course, very difficult scenarios in which there might be a need to
search, but people in schools generally do not want to be doing
searches—it damages relationships. However, I would also say
that there is a real difficulty in the Bill with the detail, because
there are lots of different things you can search for; you can search
for an offensive weapon, you can search for drugs, but different
provisions apply to the disposal of items, depending on what you are
searching for. I think there will be all sorts of confusion and a
danger of people overstepping the mark or not being clear about the
provisions. Again, that will potentially lead to difficulties and
further legal actions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000246">&#160;</a>

Bill. It privileges a very academic curriculum, which is inappropriate
for lots of children and young people. It gives the Secretary of State
huge powers, and not only to say what should be in the curriculum. This
is a very interesting dichotomy. The Government say,
“We’re only going to legislate for what should be the
bare minimum.” They say, “We’re not going to tell
teachers how to teach, but we’re going to tell them to teach
synthetic phonics” and so on. The contradictions in the
narrative, the philosophy and the framework of the  Bill are
legion and are evidence of very confused  thinking.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000248">&#160;</a>

replace them, we do not know, because we have not yet had the Wolf

not be—we do not know. The whole issue of skills arises. We are
told that the curriculum should not be about skills but about content,
so skills are neglected as well. The idea is that if you do not
legislate for the skills that a national curriculum should develop,
that will just happen naturally. My experience as a teacher is that
that is not the case; skills do need to be legislated for. So no, in a
nutshell, the Bill will not increase social mobility and I do not

with much of the direction that the Government want to go in. For young
people aged 14 to 19 from disadvantaged backgrounds, the Bill will do
nothing. In fact, there is almost a perfect storm of disadvantage
because of some of the things that are happening. There is the removal
of diplomas, rising youth unemployment at a time when the careers
service is in complete disarray, the removal of the EMA—I know
that is not in the Bill, but it all builds up to almost a perfect storm
for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in that age group. I
can see nothing in the Bill that will improve outcomes for

narrowing of the curriculum—the putting forward of a curriculum
that will not be accessible or approachable for some students; it will
not assist them with that. Access generally to certain forms of schools
is a particular point. Access to the curriculum will be narrowing
because those schools will be able to make more choices about the sorts
of curriculum that they put forward. There are particular issues about
charging for education, whether that is in early years for more than
the 15 hours a week or elsewhere. Also, we are very concerned about
exclusions and how that will impact on the disadvantaged and
particularly on those with special educational needs, Traveller
children, Afro-Caribbean boys—the groups with higher exclusion
rates. The EMA has been referred to and another issue is the market
rates of interest for student loans. We are worried about all those

and to narrow the focus and look deeply, particularly at teaching and
learning, in the school. Reading is part of that. As I left this
afternoon, we were just putting the finishing touches to a consultation
draft. We built a framework around the four areas and we have produced
a set of proposals that are going out to schools and the wider
community for a couple of months, so that people can comment on the
proposals that we are making.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000258">&#160;</a>

there will be four key areas, but a number of things are woven through
them. For instance, spiritual moral and social education—SMSC as
we call it—will go through that. In the curriculum, that is not
identified separately but will be woven through different aspects of
it. There are four key areas, so it is very clear to people. We will do
some consultation, which we are just beginning. At the same time, we
will be doing what we describe as friendly pilots with schools to try
out aspects of what we are looking at. That will be followed in the
summer term by an intensive set of real pilots, where the grade will
matter to the school. We shall be ready in September to publish the

schools believed absolutely strongly that the children would be reading
by six, and in most cases, they were reading by six. It offered
exemplars of what could be done. But other schools up and down the
country that we did not capture in that publication do equally as well.

some time trying to work out what it was because our inspections show
that behaviour is very good in our schools. It is slightly less good in
our secondary schools; but, even there, our schools are generally safe,
well-ordered places. There are two issues. Something we look at now is
what I describe as low-level disruption in class—flicking paper
around, looking out the window and that sort of behaviour—and
how children behave around the school. We actually look at that now. We
look at what goes on in the playground and so on. We will continue to
do that, but we are going to try to focus more on reported bullying,
for instance. One parent might report to us that the school does not
deal with behaviour very well and, when you focus it down, it is an
instance of bullying, or a couple of them. Generally, that has probably
gone beneath the radar. We would have looked at it, but it would not
have impacted on the overall judgment, so we are going to spend more
time listening to what children and parents are telling us about this
and trying to get underneath those particular
instances.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000262">&#160;</a>

could, but actually to get something really different happening in our
schools requires a far deeper focus on teaching than we have had in the
past. I really do value that focus, even at the expense of an explicit

concern about losing a child protection focus, as opposed to education,
just because of the size and the experience. Obviously, you have had a
period of time now of looking at both of those. In respect of those
four areas and behaviour and safety, how much of that do you see as
being about safeguarding issues—the school playing its role
within the area of safeguarding and being part of a local authority
approach to that—particularly as there has been some concern
expressed that a greater number of academies and more independent

whether there is good enough awareness of the need for training and
identifying signs of abuse. We will still look at those broader
elements,

prostitution or trafficking and so on. We have had some in the press
recently. Would you, for example, check whether, if that was an issue
locally, the school was linked into local authority initiatives in the
area? That is the kind of point I mean. At the moment, if you are a
local authority school, there is probably a fairly good link, but if
you are an academy, it would not necessarily be there. It may well be,

this. We now do very full recommendations to a school to help it to
move forward, so I would expect the school to take those
recommendations and build them into its improvement planning. One of
the things that we introduced with the framework that we are using now

that it can take 18 months or three years to deal with a teacher who is
underperforming in the classroom and in whose classroom children are
not learning. I do not want to get into the whole “Are you a
regulator or are you an improvement mechanism?” debate, but what
is your view on performance management processes in our schools at the
moment, and what can be done to make them more effective where
performance needs to be

the very good work that it does in schools. I have a couple of
questions about the benefits of the focus that the Bill permits. My

rather than others, in evaluating schools. What are the benefits of
that in terms of your

                           </em> The benefits get at the nub of what makes a
school work well and give us more time to focus on those four elements.
They give us greater time to spend in classrooms and to use the views
of parents, pupils and staff—staff have been a feature of the
system that we currently run that was not there previously—to
pick up issues and to test them out during the two days of the
inspection, essentially triangulating the evidence to see whether we
can come to clearer judgments  and give clearer advice in our
judgments in our recommendations when we
leave.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000287">&#160;</a>

about weaker performers. We will spend more time, for instance, on
satisfactory schools. If we

to re-visit it. If we think that a school is satisfactory but appears
not to have the capacity within itself to continue to improve, we will
visit it again. We do that now, but we are going to link it more with
inspection, so if we visit again and do not think that progress has
been sufficient, we might well do another inspection, which will
essentially accelerate the improvement

have time, I think that Sue could very briefly say something about

also by looking at what is going on, looking in children’s
books, speaking to children and so on. That is why the new feature in
which we are listening to children read will be important, and very
different from what we have done before. The inspector establishes that
before they go into the school, and when they are in the school they
might well reach a different decision about what it is they

published a report yesterday, which describes what we are doing, how we
are doing it and which countries are involved. We are covering four
subjects: chemistry, history, English and mathematics. When we report
finally, at the end of the year, we should have learnt a great deal
about what goes on in those different examinations, with the intention
of learning what good elements we might be able to translate to

It seems that the fundamental essence of Ofqual is to be independent of

maintained and there is that independent assessment. Does clause 21
help or hinder that sense and perception of independence in respect of
the changes to chair, chief regulator and chief executive—or
have I missed the point, and it is not about that but about improving
governance?<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000303">&#160;</a>

difference to the operation of Ofqual. We are following one model at
the moment, which is that the chair is the chief regulator. It is an
equally common model for the chief executive to be the chief regulator,
as in the case of the National Audit Office, where the Comptroller and
Auditor General is the chief executive. The board, chaired by the
chair, is responsible for governance and for the strategy that the
board is following, but the chief regulator then makes the decision
whether accounts can be signed off or not. We think that that is an
equally appropriate model for Ofqual.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000304">&#160;</a>

we have traditionally looked over time at ensuring that standards are
comparable and that the qualification is fit to be offered. This is a
new requirement for us to look at international comparability. There
could be a tension between those two. The current drafting leaves it,
we think, to Ofqual to determine when to prioritise which of the two.
If it is pointed out to us that history, say, is satisfactory in
maintaining a constant standard over time but we are doing less well
internationally than we did, say, five years ago, we would have to make
a decision whether to prioritise keeping it comparable over time or
making it comparable internationally. That is a tension that we are

different ways. If we look at 18-year-olds, as we are at the moment, we
will find that in some countries students take many more subjects than
they do in this country. That raises some questions. For example, if
someone here is doing history and someone somewhere else is also doing
history but the subject forms a much smaller part of their curriculum,
how do you make the comparison? In some countries, a much larger
proportion of the population go to university, so the exams are
designed to allow for that. In some countries, only a small proportion
go to university. A lot of considerations are needed. We feel confident

                           </em> Thank you for asking each of us. The reason
why I offered is that we recently completed some research with the
National Foundation for Educational Research. It talked to 2,000 young
people up and down England, and bullying came out as a major concern
for many of them—particularly subtle forms of bullying that are
not physical at all, but are cyber or about name calling and singling
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000346">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
I talk to heads and governors, to anti-bullying teams in authorities
and to young people trained to work with their peers on bullying, it is
clear that valiant efforts are going on to tackle bullying in all its
forms. There is a human tendency for some people to want to be what in
the north we might call “cock of the midden”. That is a
very unfortunate human trait, but it is
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000347">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Children
and young people told our survey that the issue is a concern, but that
they consider it is being dealt with in most cases. They are looking
for a culture in which it is okay to tell, so that they are not singled
out for telling at the same time as their peers are being singled out
for bullying. My final comment is that you can never relent. I do not
know whether colleagues have other things to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000348">&#160;</a>

Alliance, in conjunction with the Council for Disabled Children, has
just completed a significant piece of work that particularly looks at
the issue of bullying of disabled children and children with special
educational needs. That gives us quite a good evidence base. It also
gives us quite a good handle on some of the approaches that are likely
to be most effective in growing resilience against bullying. The
promotion of positive relationships between and among children is a
significant factor in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000349">&#160;</a>

Anti-Bullying Alliance is based within my organisation, the National
Children’s Bureau. Bullying continues to appear as the largest
single concern for children. In almost every survey, they say that it

shows that there are some good, effective strategies for supporting
within schools to tackle bullying, but we still want to be able to
ensure that the schools that are not so good at it can learn more
effectively from those that are. The evidence about what works is now
fairly robust, and sector-led improvement models rather than top-down
improvement models are most likely to be effective in improving
outcomes in this

                        <p class="tabbed">One other
area I was very interested in during the inquiry was how we use

which comes from Leicester university, shows that it is starting to
decrease. We always have to be a bit cautious about the data, because
what we are picking up are recorded instances of bullying. We cannot

works according to the evidence? In particular, there are various
applications of restorative justice, at least if one uses it in the
broadest sense. That looks to involve both the bully and the bullied in
a process of understanding what led to the behaviour, tackling the
behaviour that led to the problem in the first place, and seeking to
enable both sides to understand the factors that led to it. There are
some quite good, well-researched models now. If they were applied more
generally, and if staff across the piece were better trained and
supported in the delivery of them, we could expect to see a significant
further
reduction.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000359">&#160;</a>

in and out of schools from Cornwall to Northumberland and all points
between since I took up my post exactly one year ago. The best work
that I see is where children are trained to deal with all three sides
of the bullying relationship: the bully, the victim and the bystander
who stands by and does and says nothing when a friend is in dire need
of someone to stand alongside them. Schools that really work on this
issue work on all three elements of that
relationship.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000360">&#160;</a>

fourth element is parental attitudes. When is children falling out with

escalate from a child falling out with another child to the stage where
the person who is left on the sidelines is marginalised, sent to
Coventry, ridiculed and cyber-bullied? When do parents step in and
escalate things, and when can they help to calm things down?<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000361">&#160;</a>

goodness—that has disappeared, thanks to a lot of the good work
that has gone on in recent years under the previous Government.
Hopefully that work to tackle the issue of bullying will be continued

about signals. We have heard a lot of evidence today that the reason
for introducing some of the specific powers in the Bill is largely
about sending a signal. For example, the clause about the deletion of
material from mobile phones could be tied to the issue of
cyber-bullying. In the view of the professionals before us today, some
of the measures are difficult to imagine using in practice, and I would
be interested in your comments on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000364">&#160;</a>

concerned that one other signal that might be emerging more broadly
from the Bill is that, since duties to co-operate in all sorts of ways
concerning safeguarding and children and young people’s plans
are being removed, a general downgrading is being signalled to schools
about the softer side of the progress made in recent years and the more
holistic approach to children and the impact that has on bullying? That
could concern the social and emotional aspects of learning or
participating in behaviour partnerships and so on. What are the signals
as you see them from that?<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000365">&#160;</a>

excellence in schooling. Ofsted’s evidence across the
system—I know the Chief Inspector was here before we came
in—is that classrooms are not war zones in almost any school in
the land. As the Select Committee’s report found not long ago,
there is a minority of schools where there are real issues and where
adults need to stamp some authority on the situation as well as
teaching an exciting and vibrant curriculum that stops children from
kicking off in the first place.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000366">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Most teachers
I talk to are very reticent about stepping in and exercising powers,
particularly powers of physical restraint. You will have heard that
some of the children’s rights organisations consider educating
children about what boundaries look like, and how they should work with
each other in classrooms, to be a far better solution to some of the
issues that they bring to schools than stepping in automatically in
what could be considered an invasive fashion, and stopping children
from owning their own goods or carrying their materials with them in
school, or whatever. Test cases could easily be brought if a Bill that
has not been properly thought through becomes an Act. There could be
children who can—and will—ensure that their families take
legal action if schools overstep the mark.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000367">&#160;</a>

characterised it as a signal. There is a signalling issue about which
duties we retain and which ones we do not retain. I must note my thanks
for some of the key decisions taken where some other existing duties in
schools could have been removed but were not. That in itself is a
powerful signal.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000369">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 30 and
the proposal about the duty to co-operate is not so much a signal. I
think—dare I say it?—that there may be a misunderstanding
quite widely across the sector. The clause proposes to redefine which
agencies have a duty to co-operate, and it removes the specific naming
of schools, academies and further education colleges, which was a
relatively recent introduction to the system a couple of years ago. We
have not had time to work out what its on-the-ground impact is, because
it came into force only in March 2010. It was introduced on the back of
the encouragement for FE colleges, and a number of head teachers saw
that there was already an existing and continuing duty to co-operate
across the area to try to bring together the key agencies that were
developing and providing services for vulnerable children and families,
and schools wanted to have a voice at the table. Whereas previously
those bodies named as having a duty to co-operate were people who would
automatically be involved in the joint development process, schools and
FE colleges were
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000370">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
my view, the proposal in clause 30 to remove schools, colleges and
academies from the duty to co-operate inadvertently acts against the
interests of schools, because it is clearly in the interests of schools
to have a voice in the planning and delivery of the non-education
services, which are so important to them in meeting their own needs,
particularly in respect of vulnerable children. They need to be able to
have a way of doing that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000371">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I know that
another Bill is intended and planned next year, which will be looking
more widely at the legislation around children’s trusts and so
on. Meanwhile, we are seeing many other changes. Under
children’s trusts at present and in most areas, PCTs are working
in pretty close collaboration with local authorities to jointly plan
the delivery of services. As we are preparing for the new Health and
Social Care Bill, a lot of the arrangements are starting to founder as
PCTs merge into larger groupings. We are all going to need to rethink
the most effective way of delivering services across the piece and to
plan together to co-operate in making sure that the most effective
services are delivered. So there is a potential signal, as you suggest,
in clause 30, but I think it is inadvertently the wrong signal, because
it reduces the opportunities for schools and colleges at a time when we
need to rethink
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000372">&#160;</a>

to a core education for disabled children and children with special
educational needs. Their core education often hinges on that degree of
co-ordination and co-operation. It is not possible to meet the needs of
a child with a medical condition in school without the support of the
medical agencies. It is not possible to support a child with a visual
impairment without the support of a specialist teacher. It is
absolutely critical that that co-ordination sits around the provision
for children with special educational needs. It is about their core
entitlement to education. It is not about a bolt-on service that brings
something additional. It is about meeting a core commitment to their
education. I want to make the point that, for this group of children,
it is hugely significant, and their core entitlement is eroded when
that co-ordination does not take
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000375">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
other issue that arises from any signal that co-ordination might be
reduced is about planning a range of provision for children with a
range of needs. Those are the two things. We need to secure the range
of provision and secure the individual entitlement that is threatened
if there is any erosion of the co-operation between the different
agencies
involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000376">&#160;</a>

bullying. I am sure many of us MPs have had constituents come to see us
to complain about their child or children being bullied at school.
Whenever we have contacted the schools, they have always insisted that
there was not a problem or that the problem had been dealt with
satisfactorily. Different schools talk about anti-bullying strategies,
but I found that that was quite patchy across schools. When I
approached the local education authority about it, it first of all said
that some schools do not log incidents of bullying. Those that do do
not always report them to the local education authority. Very little is
done in the way of counselling of pupils who were victims of bullying,
or providing any sort of mental health support and counselling to bring
them through the difficulties. How far do you think the Bill goes in
addressing those
problems?<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000377">&#160;</a>

get is the same fair, open and transparent deal from a community of
adults who understand that bullying is a human characteristic and that
to say “It doesn’t happen here” is nonsense,
because it happens everywhere. It happens not just in schools, but in
society and families as well. When I go out as commissioner, to anyone
who says “We don’t have any of that,” I smile and
say, “You think not? Let me bring you some child witnesses, and

and on local communications; I long ago lost interest in anything that
does not happen in the east of England. The point about the
communication that you describe—the learning from good
practice—is surely not principally about learning from our
immediate locale, but about taking best practice and extending it
wherever you find it. You talked just now about the disproportionate
impact of bullying on vulnerable groups. What work have you done and
what evidence can  you bring to the Committee on that as a
concept?  How is it changing over time? Is it
getting worse?  Is cyber-bullying an issue? Can we identify a
trend that we can address?<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000386">&#160;</a>

                           </em> It is somewhat more nuanced than that. In
most cases, it seems, there are potentially two things going on. First,
the problem is so underground and so subtle—it is taking place
on the bus or on the footpath between home and school—that
school does not think that there is a culture of bullying within the
building, and that it is happening somewhere else.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000390">&#160;</a>

your school might be judged outstanding by the inspection system.
Something might surface that indicates that there is a condoned culture
of bullying—of whatever sort—in your institution. If you
admit to that, you might fear that you will be judged by the community
around you. You might fear that you are no longer regarded as an
outstanding school and/or that people will start to leave and/or that
you and your governors will attract a degree of notoriety that you do
not want. So there are some subtle human interplays; it is not just
about not getting backing. In an ever-diversifying system, school will
back school and locality clusters of schools will back each other,
because the relationship between the local authority, or local
education authority, and its schools will diminish
somewhat.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000391">&#160;</a>

to ensure, as you have indicated, John, that the learning is not only
within any one locality. The model of sector-led improvement that
National Children’s Bureau colleagues have been working on in
developing the centre for excellence and outcomes seeks to pick up the
best evidence from across the world about what works. It attempts to
identify the lessons that are transferable and those that are not. It
is about writing that into a form that local practitioners can
use—rather than cloaking it in jargon—and then providing
a tailored model of support to a local area. It is about bringing
someone from an area that is good at dealing with the problem, loaning
them to the area that is not yet so good at that and enabling the
learning to take place. That process does not take place through the
flex of inspection and anxiety—or even targets—but
through recognising that somebody, somewhere has found a better answer

to bullying and such issues, a general view has come through from all
the witnesses that good discipline creates a good environment, in which
children can learn, and a safe environment. I am concerned, as are
colleagues, that some of the Bill’s measures could put teachers
and children in unsafe situations and therefore could be more
undermining to that specific situation of giving detention without
notice. I am concerned about the searches, particularly those that
allow a teacher to search a child of the opposite sex on their own
without another adult present. I would like to hear your
views.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000396">&#160;</a>

education experts and I have talked about for some time, and we will
write more about that in our fuller response, by the April deadline.
Suspending the need to give 24 hours’ notice of a detention
could run you up against some real problems if you are a school that
does not know that the 15-year-old you intend to detain on no notice is
the principal carer in their home. If they are in rural Cumbria and
they miss their school bus, there is not another bus to their village
until the next morning. Those are some real issues, and in scrutinising
this Bill you need to take them head on, in terms of children’s
rights and in terms of this country having the United Nation’s
convention 20 years ago. Children are not to be put through degrading
or unusual punishments. Mr Major signed that convention, so
it is a binding international human rights treaty. It is very important
that you take it on board when you scrutinise the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000397">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are equally concerned about the restraint issues, particularly given
that there is no definition of what the exceptional circumstances are
that would allow a staff member of the opposite sex to the child being
searched to undertake that search. There are some serious issues. I do
not think you are safe as a teacher. As a former English and drama
teacher in secondary education, I would not have felt safe or
safeguarded had I exercised such powers. Children and young people tell
us that eight out of 10 of them have witnessed some degree of
disruption or bad behaviour in lessons. They also tell us that the
pupils who instigate it need to be helped, rather than excluded, and
that schools need to be fair, transparent and appealable in how they
exclude. There are issues on how that works in the Bill, which I urge
you to look at.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000398">&#160;</a>

whom I speak to are very wary indeed of physical restraint and, in
particular, of upping the ante on physical restraint in confrontational
situations. Finally, children and adults who talk to me as commissioner

challenging, exciting place, where different abilities are dealt with
properly, the need for restraint and physical searches crops up less

less.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000399">&#160;</a>

concerned about the expertise and knowledge of exclusion panels around
SEN. That would benefit from being looked at again. On restraint, I
have concerns that many schools were excluding children, especially
those with autism or speech and communication difficulties, for
behavioural issues, when good and effective training on behaviour
programmes, which are well established and work, would have benefited
those children and would have stopped exclusions. If the additional
powers in the Bill on restraint and search were applied wrongly to
children with autism—they would not necessarily understand what
was going on—it could make a difficult situation much worse. I
want to see specific training for teachers on those issues, if those

provisions. One that comes to mind is one of the few private
Members’ Bills that passed, the Autism Act 2009, although it
does not apply to the whole of the UK. My recollection is that it was
very much predicated on local authorities in particular establishing
the number and needs of those in their community who had autism. The
Act presumed that local authorities would have that information from
schools and, in turn, the local authorities were charged with passing
that information on to other relevant authorities, particularly coming
up to the age of transition and beyond. That seemed to rest very
heavily on the fact that schools were all co-operating with local
authorities and so on, and were therefore in possession of this, and
that schools would be involved in children and young people’s
plans. Is there any danger that the Bill as it currently stands will
inadvertently knock a hole in some of the assumptions—or
presumptions—that were behind the Autism Act 20090? Is there any
fine tuning needed between the
two?<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000404">&#160;</a>

issue is knowing the population and being able to plan the full range
of provision. When we say provision, that really does mean the sorts of
things that Brian talked about, in relation to the staff skills that
will be needed to make the appropriate provision for those children.

to a provision that is appropriate for them. Children in that group are
also over-represented in the figures on absenteeism and other forms of
being out of school. Outcomes for them are not good. They are twice as

is considering the recommendations made by the Select Committee when it
looked at behaviour, and something for which special educational
consortiums have argued for a number of years. If the exclusion of a
child with disability or SEN is going to be considered, that should
trigger an automatic assessment for those children to ensure that the
reason for the exclusion is not related to an unidentified issue
related to the SEN. If the SEN was already known about and simply could
not be managed by the school, that would be one issue, but so often we
have found that when the exclusion cases get to panels actually there
is an underlying SEN issue that has not been addressed, often around
behaviour. In those circumstances that should be addressed 
first, before the exclusion. If that were put in the Bill  as a
backstop it would at least reduce some of the anxiety about exclusions.
That was recommended by the Education Committee, and I think that was
an excellent recommendation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000412">&#160;</a>

plenty of references are made to the subject here, and there is more
than one reference to it in the Bill and the accompanying notes,
potentially in terms of defining pupils who receive the pupil premium
and defining disadvantaged children in early years. At Committee stage
it is necessary to look at the impact of the upcoming Welfare Reform
Bill, which will significantly change the eligibility for free school
meals. It is likely, at an early glance, significantly to reduce the
eligibility for them, which might inadvertently impact on some of the
planning processes that are currently under way to ensure that those
various services are targeted towards those who are most in
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000413">&#160;</a>

to have responsibility for pupils once they have been excluded. They
are only pilots, so we do not know what will happen. If that does not
go ahead and become a sustained part of the system, what incentives
will there be in the system to address the behavioural problems of a
child in the school rather than to exclude? Are there going to be
incentives in a system that has greater levels of freedom to ensure
that schools want to identify and sort out the needs of the children

am very strongly in favour because it tackles the underlying issue that
you are raising, Graham, which is the risk that inadvertently schools
will find themselves incentivised to exclude children. None of us wants
that. I am not sure whether the pilot will work, but my own view is
that the pilot will make it clear that the most effective way of
reducing exclusions is for schools to federate—to work together
in groups in various different ways and, as it were, swallow their own
smoke.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000415">&#160;</a>

basis—that would not only meet the financial incentives issue

disincentives that schools have at the moment, which they are sometimes
openly honest about to parents, is league tables—“If we
take your child, it will affect our position in the league
tables.” One of the important things that we could do to turn
that around is to focus much more on measures of progress than on
thresholds of attainment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000417">&#160;</a>

could provide an incentive, because in effect this is an easy win. If
you can get the progress for this child, you can make strides for some
children. They may not

                           </strong> I just want to test back with you some of the
things that we have been told by some of the other witnesses today.
First, we were concerned about whether an increase in academies would
cause difficulties regarding admissions for children with special
needs. Certainly, anecdotally we have had examples of pupils who have
struggled to get into academies, and I wonder whether you have any
feelings about that. Obviously, the admissions code applies, but the
ability of schools that are working independently of other schools to
deal with some special needs is different, and I wonder if you have any
thoughts on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000419">&#160;</a>

Stobbs:</strong>
                           </em> We have some evidence that children with
special educational needs have been rejected by academies, and there
have been some high-profile cases of that reported in the papers as
well. I think that we need to be clear that all schools discriminate
against children with SEN in the admissions process. It is very subtle.
It is before there is any official application, and before you get into
the admissions process. It is the casual visit to the school, where the
parent is too readily told, “We are not very good at dealing
with children with this type of difficulty, but the school down the
road has an excellent SEN department.” It is very difficult to
get a handle on that. Therefore, we should be very clear that we want
local authorities to go on monitoring and reporting on admissions of
children with SEN. That is the only way we will get a handle on where
it is happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000420">&#160;</a>

know from the special educational needs and disability tribunal data
that a lot of concerns that parents of children with SEN have are not
necessarily about the schools themselves, but about access to other
support services and how those fit in with schools. How will the
provisions in the Bill, which will uncouple some of those
relationships, affect the ability of children to get those other
support services, which they need to do well, in
schools?<a class="bkMark" name="11030260000421">&#160;</a>

greater independence, and, as Paul rightly said, there is a benefit for
schools in this as well. However, with the proposals to remove the duty
to co-operate, there is a risk of losing the level of co-ordination

their entitlement to access education, and in terms of wider planning
