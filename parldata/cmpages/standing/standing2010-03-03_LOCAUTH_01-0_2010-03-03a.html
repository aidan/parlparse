Chairman:</b> May I welcome everyone to the Committee? Before
we begin the consideration of the Bill I have a few preliminary
announcements. Although it is not very warm, Members may, if they wish,
remove their jackets in Committee. There is a money resolution in
connection with the Bill and copies are available. Please would all
Members ensure that mobile phones, pagers and so on are turned off or
switched to silent mode during Committee? I have not selected the two
amendments on the amendment paper, so we shall move straight to clause
stand part debates on each clause, if the Committee wishes to debate
them
all.</div><a name="10030351000013"></a>

to which this Part
applies</div><a name="10030351000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="10030351000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030351000282"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): It is a
real pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble.
It is the first time I have done so as the promoter of a Bill, although
I have done so in my more normal Back-Bench position. The Bill was
introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr.
Chaytor) on 16 December. I have, however, been asked to see it through
its remaining stages in this House.</div>
<a name="10030351000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to all Members who have agreed to serve on this Committee at rather
short notice, and I ask them all to accept my apologies both for that
short notice and for some of the rough edges that may affect the
procedures in Committee. It was clear to me when I was asked last week
to take on the Bill that we had to move speedily if it was to have any
prospect of making progress before the coming general
election.</div>
<a name="10030351000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
grateful for the support that was voiced for the Bill in all parts of
the House on Second Reading. It is a measure to enhance and expand the
capacity of local authorities to scrutinise activities undertaken by
other bodies discharging public service responsibilities in their
areas, and as such, it contributes to the localist agenda that I know
has support on both sides of the House.</div>
<a name="10030351000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
there will be questions posed<b class="B"> </b>about points of detail in the
Bill, and where it is not possible for those to be fully considered in
Committee, I hope they will be considered on Report. However, I believe
that the overall purpose and objectives are widely supported, so I hope
that the Bill can make good progress. As on Second Reading, I should
make clear my non-pecuniary interest as chairman of the Centre for
Public Scrutiny, a not-for-profit organisation that exists to promote
better and more effective scrutiny.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="10030351000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that it
will help the Committee if I give a short outline of the purpose of
clause 1. The clause sets out the framework for the enhanced scrutiny
powers provided by part 1 of the Bill. Subsections (1) to (4) provide
that the enhanced scrutiny powers will apply when overview and scrutiny
committees are scrutinising matters of local concern in connection with
the provision of public services by authorities or persons designated
in regulations by the Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="10030351000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5) provides that an authority or person may be designated generally or
in respect of particular services. Subsection (2) defines the
circumstances in which a matter is of local concern to a local
authority as circumstances in which the matter affects the local area,
or its inhabitants, to a greater degree than other areas or their
inhabitants.</div>
<a name="10030351000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) defines the term &#147;public service&#148;. For the purposes
of the Bill, a &#147;public service&#148; includes not just
services provided to the public in the exercise of functions of a
public nature, but also those carried out under statutory authority,
such as by utility companies, or those that are wholly or partly funded
by central or local government through grants, subsidies or other
financial assistance. It is immaterial whether such a service is
delivered by a public authority or by another body, be it public,
private or voluntary, and whether charges are made for the
service.</div><a name="10030351000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have set out the key terms that set the parameters for the scrutiny
powers in the Bill. They establish the scope and range of the powers
and the circumstances in which they can be used by overview and
scrutiny committees. They are important parameters. While providing a
broad framework for enhanced scrutiny powers for councils, they also
ensure that scrutiny remains focused on local issues and stays true to
its purpose, which is to be constructive in examining, and suggesting
improvements on, issues of real local
concern.</div><a name="10030351000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections
(4) and (5) provide that the new powers will apply only to bodies that
have been designated&#151;either generally or in respect of
particular services&#151;by regulations. There is scope within the
framework for the Secretary of State to designate a wide range of
persons or authorities as being subject to the enhanced scrutiny
regime.</div><a name="10030351000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading, hon. Members raised concerns about the broad scope of
the regulation-making power and sought further details about the types
of body that will be subject to the enhanced regime. Decisions on which
bodies will be specified as being subject to the regime are ultimately
for the Government to take, and I hope that the Minister will be able
to give us an indication of the Government&#146;s thinking on that
issue today. In any case, subsection (6) provides that regulations
designating bodies as subject to part 1 of the Bill will be subject to
the affirmative procedure, so Parliament will have the opportunity to
consider and debate designation of particular
bodies.</div>
<a name="10030351000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030351000283"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Jacqui Lait</b> (Beckenham) (Con): I, too, welcome you to the
Chair, Mrs. Humble. This is the first time I have sat under
your chairmanship, but in the brief, few minutes in which you have been
in the Chair you have established your personality, and I hope that we
continue to proceed in such an amiable
fashion.</div><a name="10030351000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
did not take part in the debate on Second Reading, but when I was first
approached and asked to take part in the Bill&#146;s proceedings, I
read the Bill, and it reminded 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>me of the title of a play by Pirandello, &#147;Six Characters in
Search of an Author&#148;. It struck me as a case of &#147;Six
Committees in Search of a Role&#148;. Then I started to read the
Second Reading debate and discovered that my concern had already been
voiced by
others.</div><a name="10030351000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have consulted my Front-Bench team, who are very disturbed that,
notwithstanding the timetable problems, there has not been sufficient
time to table the amendments that we would wish to have discussed in
Committee, so that we could try to clarify the issues raised on Second
Reading. We will almost certainly be tabling amendments on Report.
However, I have no wish to hold up the Committee today, or to try to
create a second Committee stage on another
occasion.</div><a name="10030351000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should declare that I, too, have an interest, because my husband is
leader of East Sussex county council. It has an overview and scrutiny
role, which he implemented successfully. The issue is, therefore, not a
personal one to do with overview and scrutiny not being seen to be
effective, because in East Sussex it is effective. It is the approach
taken that is so
important.</div><a name="10030351000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich pointed out in his Second
Reading speech that district councils are excluded from the Bill. I
hope that the Minister will reassure us that such councils will be
included. It is the council&#146;s approach to scrutiny and overview
that makes it a success or otherwise. If a burden of demand,
regulation, officialdom, bureaucracy, cost and requirement is imposed,
I am sure that it will not be long before marks are awarded for how
effective the overview and scrutiny committees are&#151;well, unless
there is a change of
Government.</div><a name="10030351000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
decent overview and scrutiny committee and a good council, with good
relations with its various partners, should not need to require those
partners to turn up for scrutiny. They should already be working
together on any agreement, and should be happy to be open and honest
about what is happening. If we need to impose burdens and regulations
on partners, which should be willing to participate in the good
management of their agreements with local councils, that is the mark of
a poor
council.</div><a name="10030351000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening)
made the point that there are still major ambiguities about which
bodies the Bill will cover. I have seen a list, and most of them are
public bodies, but one area is not clear. These days, so many local
area partnerships involve charities and small and medium-sized
businesses. If those bodies are affected, imposing a burden of scrutiny
and overview will put extra costs on charities, which are raising money
from the public in difficult times, and which should be looking after
every penny, to the benefit of the work that they are doing under
contract with the local
authorities.</div><a name="10030351000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Small
and medium-sized businesses are also struggling in these difficult
economic times. They would have to face not just the cost involved, but
the fact that the management&#146;s time would be taken up. In a
small enterprise, that management can often be the boss, and the boss
is already struggling with the extra burden of red tape imposed on
businesses in the past few years. Yet another burden will mean that the
expertise that small and medium-sized businesses can bring to the
delivery of partnership agreements in various forms will be
withdrawn&#151;but not in some great confrontation; instead, next
time, those businesses will not bid for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>contracts. That expertise will therefore be lost, to the disbenefit of
the public for whom everyone is working. We need to look more closely
at, and have a much better and clearer definition of, the bodies that
the Bill will
cover.</div><a name="10030351000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not wish to go on for too long, but what matters does the Bill
cover? Will it cover just what is in a contract, or anything that
anyone has a bee in their bonnet about? How will a matter of interest
to local people be defined? We all know, working in communities as we
do, that for every person who has one view about a body, there is an
equal and opposite view from someone else, with all gradations of views
in between. If a local authority scrutiny and overview committee thinks
that it can inquire into anything that it fancies, then I am afraid
that it will turn against it the very people on whose behalf it should
be working, or indeed the very people whom it needs to take along with
it in order to deliver the
services.</div><a name="10030351000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
1 stand part may not be the best place to talk about the
conflict-of-interest issues relating to allowing executive council
members to sit on scrutiny committees. I apologise to the right hon.
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich for not having congratulated him on
taking over, at such short notice, what is turning out to be a
difficult Bill, but he did rather run through the Bill very quickly. I
do not want to hold things up, and I am happy to be guided by you,
Mrs. Humble, but I wonder whether I might point out briefly
the concerns about the conflict of interest in allowing executive
council members to sit on the scrutiny
committees.</div><a name="10030351000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already raised the issue of the district councils. This is
probably more a process issue, of interest to the Committee only, and
not to the greater public, but the Bill extends the powers of joint
committees, even though regulations to set them up are not yet in
place. If the Minister can enlighten us on what she expects to happen,
that might at least reduce the number of amendments that we are likely
to table on Report.</div>
<a name="10030351000255"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="10030351000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
those broad comments&#151;I am sorry, but they were not as brief as I
had intended&#151;I would just like to say that, as a matter of
principle, I will ask my colleagues to join me in voting against clause
1 to register that we think that there are difficulties with the Bill
that need to be addressed
seriously.</div><a name="10030351000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030351000284"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship and to take your guidance,
Mrs. Humble.</div>
<a name="10030351000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
powers in the Bill. I hoped that the Bill would get a fair wind, so I
am disappointed to hear that we face a vote on clause 1. I did,
however, have a concern about the clause. That is why I tabled an
amendment, which was not selected. It might be slightly pedantic, but
the use of the word &#147;greater&#148; in the clause gives me
concern. Perhaps that could be described as a local concern, given the
wording used in other parts of the clause.</div>
<a name="10030351000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
welcome the views of my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich on whether &#147;greater&#148; is restricting. It suggests
that only where the impact or concern is deemed to be larger in one
area than another will an issue fall within the remit of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>clause, rather than where the impact of an action, or the decision of a
body, is simply different in different areas. For example, let us say
that there was a large project in an area that was bounded by three or
four authorities, and that they were looking for a large pool of labour
to be employed. We would expect the local Jobcentre Plus to be able to
find work for a proportionate number of people from each of the local
authorities. However, if one local authority was doing particularly
badly, and local concern was raised by local residents, who did not
feel that the performance was as it should be, it might be a question
not simply of the number of people affected, but the service being
offered. I would therefore very much welcome my right hon.
Friend&#146;s views on the word &#147;greater&#148; and on
whether, on Report, an amendment might be appropriate, so that we could
revisit the issue and bring forward a different word&#151;perhaps the
word &#147;different&#148;.</div>
<a name="10030351000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that there is a need to ensure that the clause is kept as tight as
possible to avoid local authorities being tempted to stray beyond their
locality&#151;that picks up a little on the point made by the hon.
Member for Beckenham&#151;and to hold to account those bodies
affected by clearly defining local matters. However, there is a desire
to avoid local authorities behaving in an almost vexatious or frivolous
way by crossing boundaries, or taking a &#147;not in my back
yard&#148; view.</div>
<a name="10030351000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030351000285"></a><b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I strongly agree
with the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport, on the issue raised,
under clause 1(2), about the extent to which the matter has to affect a
local authority before it can come under the consideration of an
overview and scrutiny committee. An example from my constituency of an
issue that is subject to an overview and scrutiny committee decision is
the transfer of upper gastrointestinal cancer surgery to Derriford.
People in Devon will have a completely different experience and
attitude towards that change from people in Cornwall. We could have an
argument about who experienced the greater impact, but we can certainly
argue that people have different experiences and real concerns that
need to be raised. That is an important difference that needs to be
taken into
account.</div><a name="10030351000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was slightly confused by the comments made by the hon. Member for
Beckenham. On the one hand, she says that councils already undertake
such scrutiny, so what is the need to add regulation? On the other
hand, she says that the requirement will be an additional burden. I am
not sure how both things can apply at the same
time.</div>

<a name="10030351000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000287"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> If I may make a further comment on the points
that the hon. Lady made, it is very important that local authorities
should be able to call in and scrutinise whomever they wish if there is
public money involved. I am sure that plenty of charities and
businesses would be keen to come before a Select Committee to outline
how they felt public resources were being misdirected, or how money
could be spent more efficiently. I see the scrutiny as a matter of
proper engagement, working along similar lines to a Select Committee in
this House. Some people come before a Select Committee 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>because they want to make a positive contribution and make changes, and
others do so because they have some uncomfortable questions to ask.
That is entirely the right and proper
process.</div><a name="10030351000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000288"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> I do not see why the hon. Lady thinks that there is
a conflict between councils working closely with their communities, and
therefore not needing the Bill, and the imposition that the Bill would
place on local authorities because it is felt that these powers need to
be there. A good local authority does not need the Bill. If we pass the
Bill, we put on a burden. There is no need for the Bill if there are
good local authorities. The key is having good local
authorities.</div><a name="10030351000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000289"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I still cannot see that the contradiction has
been resolved. Either the council is already doing it and therefore
having it backed up by legislation simply reinforces that, or it is an
additional burden. Both cannot be the case.</div>
<a name="10030351000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the
comments by the Local Government Association, which welcomed the fact
that the Bill would strengthen the available powers of scrutiny. More
generally, I welcome the opportunity to debate the Bill. It is
important that we give it a fair wind. We have to remember that local
authorities are democratically accountable to their communities. If
anything is lacking in the delivery of public services, it is that
there is not enough democratic accountability. Although I personally
would like to see that rolled out more directly, setting up overview
and scrutiny committees goes some way to ensure a closer look at the
impact of the delivery of public services at a local level and greater
democratic accountability.</div>
<a name="10030351000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals
should dovetail quite well with the Total Place pilots that are going
on. This is ultimately not just about what is being done in public
services at a local level but about how money is spent. Local people
have a right to understand how public services are being delivered at a
local level and how money is being spent effectively.</div>
<a name="10030351000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thinking back
to the Sustainable Communities Act 2007&#151;which started
as another private Member&#146;s Bill whose scrutiny I participated
in&#151;one of the big challenges that I found when talking to my own
local authorities about that Bill, which introduced powers that went
way beyond local authorities&#146; existing remit, was that they
found it difficult to get their heads round the fact that they were
allowed to have an opinion on things that went beyond their existing
responsibilities. Similarly, some councils may find it slightly odd
that they are now allowed to have a view on things that are beyond
their existing remit. That is why it is important to have it backed up
in legislation. It will complement Total Place, which I am concerned is
too much of a bureaucratic exercise at the moment. It is useful for
people sitting round a table discussing local area agreements, but
there is an opportunity to engage people and to try to get them to
participate, which is one reason why we should welcome it.</div>
<a name="10030351000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, there are limitations to the way in which the overview and
scrutiny committee system works at the moment. I would cite the
decision-making process on the transfer of upper GI cancer surgery to
Derriford. In that situation, we had an overview and scrutiny committee
making a decision on whether or not there would be widespread
consultation, which the wider 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>public saw as making a decision on whether the services would transfer,
which is a very different thing. The committee was presented with a
petition signed by 30,000 local residents, calling on it not to
transfer. At that point, we did not have a process for dealing with
petitions. Even though we now have that as a result of the Local
Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009, that is a
quantitative decision rather than a qualitative
one.</div>
<a name="10030351000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
problems with the way in which the overview and scrutiny system works.
The public can become understandably confused about whether councils
are expressing an opinion on a service for which they are not
responsible, or whether they are scrutinising a service that they are
responsible for delivering. The proposals do not deal with that
conflict, but would ensure that a light is cast on the delivery of
public services at a local level, so they represent a step in the right
direction.</div><a name="10030351000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000290"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Given the example of the transfer of the upper GI
and the numbers involved, does the hon. Lady share my concern about the
word &#147;greater&#148;? If people in Plymouth, Devonport, where
we have a significantly larger inner-city population, were also to draw
up a petition saying that we wanted that provision in Plymouth, we
could by virtue of numbers alone probably outdo the hon. Lady&#146;s
area. That word therefore needs to be
considered.</div><a name="10030351000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000291"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I completely agree with the hon. Lady. There
is some inconsistency regarding the areas that overview and scrutiny
committees can consider. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich pointed out in his initial remarks that utility companies, for
example, could come under that consideration. However, if they could
not be required to submit evidence or attend, that might make the
process unsatisfactory.</div>
<a name="10030351000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the
structures that need to be in place, a difficulty is that we do not
know which organisations will fall under the remit. The decisions of
the larger regional agencies, which are the obvious organisations to be
included, will impact on many local authorities, and if the amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport was adopted, those
decisions could have many different impacts. I do not understand
whether in principle those agencies would be included or excluded, nor
how the system would fit with the Regional Select Committee process. To
have that kind of scrutiny at a local level would be far more effective
than Regional Select Committee system as it currently functions. I see
that as not a perfect solution, but perhaps an improved
one.</div><a name="10030351000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
what I have seen of the Regional Select Committee process, decisions
are scrutinised after they have been taken, and it has been difficult
to tease out the different impacts that decisions have had on different
communities. There is still a lot, therefore, to be teased out, but I
am happy to support the proposal, given where we are in this
Parliament, and my broad welcome for anything that ultimately gives
more power to local people, which I feel it does. I cannot see any
reason to vote against clause
1.</div><a name="10030351000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030351000292"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): It never ceases
to astound me how illiberal Liberals can be. We have just seen another
perfect example of that in action. There was no thought about the
individual who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>lives in our society, no thought about the possible concerns that the
provision might place on them. It was simply said that we need to
extend the power of Government at all levels, to get more involved and
have more to say and to demand from these poor, depressed individuals,
who are working to earn a living under the ever-growing burden of
society.</div><a name="10030351000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000293"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I think the hon. Gentleman has missed the
point. If we are moving into a tight fiscal situation, it is important
that every penny of public money spent is properly scrutinised and
accounted for, regardless of whether the money is being given to a
charity, a local authority or any other public agency. It is important
that that money is effectively and efficiently
spent.</div><a name="10030351000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000294"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I am grateful for that homily. It did not really
cast much more illumination on my point, but I was perfectly happy to
sit and listen to it. Now, may I go on to talk about clause 3?
[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;No.&#148;] Oh, we are
on the clause 1 stand part debate&#151;my apologies. I shall come
back.</div><a name="10030351000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000295"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Barbara Follett):</b> It is a pleasure to have you
in the Chair, Mrs. Humble, and it is also a pleasure to work
on a Bill that has generated so much interest, and on which my right
hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich is to be
congratulated. He is to be thanked for taking the Bill forward at such
very short notice. Although I was not present on Second Reading, the
Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon.
Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Austin), told me
that at the time, there was significant cross-party support for the
Bill&#146;s aim of providing enhanced powers to local government
overview and scrutiny committees. Just to make it clear to the hon.
Member for Beckenham, district councils are excluded, but there should
be local arrangements in place to allow them to contribute to joint
scrutiny in two-tier areas.</div>
<a name="10030351000256"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="10030351000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000296"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister. The point that
I made in my few remarks is that the regulations for joint scrutiny
have not yet
emerged.</div><a name="10030351000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000297"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> I am aware of that. Obviously there will be a
timing issue, which we will have to look at. The Government
wholeheartedly support the Bill because it implements the proposals set
out in the Department for Communities and Local Government&#146;s
&#147;Strengthening local democracy&#148; consultation, which was
published last
July.</div><a name="10030351000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is not much more that I need to say at the moment, although I would
like to deal with some of the matters raised in amendment 1. Clause 1
provides that the enhanced scrutiny powers in part 1 of the Bill apply
when overview and scrutiny committees scrutinise matters of local
concern, in connection with the provision of public services by
authorities or persons designated in regulations by the Secretary of
State. The bodies that we intend to designate in the first instance are
local area agreement partner bodies, as the hon. Member for Beckenham
pointed out. That will remove the current limitation on the scrutiny of
activities related to LAA 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>matters only, and recognise that the local contribution activities of
partner bodies, such as Jobcentre Plus and the fire and rescue
authorities, cut across the full range of local issues that arise and
are not limited to the delivery priorities in LAA
areas.</div>
<a name="10030351000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also
intend, initially, to extend the enhanced scrutiny regime to two new
sectors by designating energy&#151;gas and electricity&#151;and
transport providers, such as train, tram and bus operators, as being
subject to the regime. I am pleased to confirm that the Government will
consult widely before making such regulations. The Bill ensures
parliamentary scrutiny of a decision to designate any particular body
or person. Hon. Members will have the opportunity to scrutinise and
debate draft regulations laid before
Parliament.</div><a name="10030351000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
starting point is that the new scrutiny powers need to be limited to
matters that are truly local&#151;in other words, matters that come
under the new scrutiny powers are those that predominantly affect only
the area of the council or councils undertaking the scrutiny. The Bill
seeks to achieve that by providing that a matter falls within the ambit
of the new regime</div>
<a name="10030351000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only if it
affects the authority&#146;s area or the inhabitants of that area to
a greater degree than it affects the areas of other local authorities
or the inhabitants of other such
areas.&#148;</div><a name="10030351000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000298"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for being generous
with her time. This may sound trivial, but I want to return to the
point about energy. The Government have just published their tariff for
individuals who use microgeneration to feed into the grid. In rural
areas, many individuals put up wind turbines, which generate extra
electricity that goes into the grid. Will those people therefore be
defined as energy providers, and hence subject to the overview and
scrutiny committee? It is a small point, but if green generation takes
off, there could be a big
problem.</div><a name="10030351000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000299"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> One of the things I most admire about local
government, contrasted with national Government, is its common sense. I
am sure that a great deal of common sense will apply when people are
appointed.</div><a name="10030351000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030351000300"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): Will the Minister
give
way?</div><a name="10030351000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000301"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> No. I will make some
progress.</div><a name="10030351000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000302"></a>Mr.

assistance.</div><a name="10030351000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000303"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> I am not giving
way.</div><a name="10030351000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that the formulation encapsulates the aim of subjecting local
matters to scrutiny, and excluding national and regional matters that
go far beyond the areas of the council undertaking the scrutiny.
However, the formulation does not mean that decisions that are taken
about some local issues as a result of national policy are outside
scrutiny. For example, if there was a policy about closing certain
local offices of a national agency, the policy would not be subject to
scrutiny.</div>
<a name="10030351000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000304"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Is the Minister saying that some regional
agencies will be excluded from the scrutiny process? Where would the
delivery of convergence funding, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>for example, fall in Cornwall? The process is being delivered by the
regional development agency, but it impacts only Cornwall. Surely, that
is an example of how the work of a regional authority should be subject
to scrutiny of a local
authority?</div><a name="10030351000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000305"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> I am not specifically excluding anything at the
moment. I am saying that it will be about matters that are specific to
that local area. How that is defined will be a matter for someone
else.</div><a name="10030351000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000306"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b><b class="B"> </b>I was struck by a perceptive phrase used by
the Minister. She said that she was struck by the common sense of local
government as opposed to national Government. Will she elaborate
further the instances where she thinks that the national Government, of
whom she is a member, have not demonstrated common
sense?</div><a name="10030351000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000307"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> Common sense is applied at the local
level&#151;I speak as a regional Minister&#151;because there is an
attempt to work in a more consensual fashion. That is not the case in
this Committee, however, and such behaviour turns the public off
politics, rather than making them interested in
it.</div>
<a name="10030351000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000308"></a>Mr.

point?</div><a name="10030351000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000309"></a>Barbara

on the Minister a couple of minutes ago, but the Minister was
interrupted by Opposition Members. Will she explain a bit more about
the consultation on the scrutiny of transport undertakings? Such
undertakings are local, but they inevitably have implications that go
across local authority boundaries. Is there a proposal for a consortium
of local authorities scrutinising, for example, a tram system or local
railway, or will it be strictly one local authority at a time, clearly
making the scrutiny less
effective?</div><a name="10030351000087"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000311"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s question echoes that of
the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne. Decisions about exactly how
the scrutiny will operate will have to be taken. The idea is to build
slowly and look at how we can make the proposal effective. We can
expand a local area ad infinitum, but we need local authorities to be
as effective as possible. At this point, I will conclude and commend
the Bill to the
Committee.</div><a name="10030351000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000312"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call Mr. Raynsford to reply
to the debate on clause 1 stand part, as the Minister made reference to
an amendment, I would like to clarify, for the avoidance of doubt, the
fact that no amendment has been selected. We are debating clause stand
part.</div><a name="10030351000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000313"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I would like to focus on three issues. First,
it is important to take the opportunity, on Report, to debate
amendments that hon. Members wish to pursue, because of the short
timetable that has precluded our doing so in Committee. I wholly
sympathise with that view, and I wrote to all hon. Members before
today&#146;s sitting to say that I would happily discuss any
amendments they wish to table on Report.</div>
<a name="10030351000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
emphasise the fact that despite the differences that have emerged this
morning in Committee the Bill has up to now enjoyed all-party support,
and I hope 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>that it will continue to do so. The hon. Member for Beckenham made a
point, which was echoed by the hon. Member for Northampton, South,
about the possible burden and disproportionate impact on business, and
it is very much a concern that we should get a balance and that the
Bill should allow more effective scrutiny but should not impose
unreasonable
burdens.</div><a name="10030351000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to echo the views of the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening)
on Second Reading. She said that overview and scrutiny committees
perform an important function, but that their powers need to be
extended:</div>
<a name="10030351000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is a growing recognition that overview and scrutiny committees need to
have powers over a wider range of external organisations as they become
more involved in local public services, and that councils should
provide sufficient resources and support to those committees so that
they can undertake more
scrutiny.</div><a name="10030351000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
Bill seeks to address a number of issues, and we welcome its intention
to increase local scrutiny powers.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 5 February 2010; Vol. 505, c.
524-25.]</div><a name="10030351000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that we can proceed on that consensual basis, with the clear
undertaking, which I am happy to give, that while I continue to have
anything to do with the Bill I want to achieve a balance between
enabling overview and scrutiny committees to discharge those functions
more effectively, across a wider range of organisations involved in
public service delivery, without imposing any undue burden. Three
points of detail have been raised, which I think will come up later.
The hon. Member for Northampton, South, in discussing a possible burden
on business, was worried about duplication. There is provision in
clause 7 for joint scrutiny, which is also pertinent to the concern of
the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne about the Devon and Cornwall
interest in cancer services at Derriford hospital. Again, joint
scrutiny would probably be the appropriate
response.</div><a name="10030351000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport and the hon. Member for
Falmouth and Camborne both spent some time considering the words
&#147;greater&#148; or &#147;different&#148; in the phrasing of
the definition in clause 1. There is clearly a fine balance.
If we are to avoid imposing an unreasonable burden on the organisations
that are scrutinised, there should be a focus on what is local, and
what has a greater impact locally than it does elsewhere. The failure
of a jobcentre to ensure that there are effective services for a
particular area, to use the example given by my hon. Friend the Member
for Plymouth, Devonport, may have a greater impact on the citizens of
that area than on those elsewhere. However, I should like to take
further advice on the issue, and perhaps we may return to it on
Report.</div><a name="10030351000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree very much with the concerns that the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne raised about the link with Total Place and the scope for
scrutiny to give more sense of public engagement in something that I
believe we all support as a concept, but which has seemed a little
remote and technocratic up to now. Perhaps that is a good way to engage
the public in an important
issue.</div><a name="10030351000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Beckenham raised two specific issues including, first,
conflicts of interest between executive and back-bench members, which
will come up in relation to clause 8, so I will not say anything more
about it now. The second issue was district councils, which will come
up under clause 6; we can perhaps pick it up at that point. I
understand her concerns and hope that we will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>find effective answers. I am interested in how the regulations, which
are crucial, will be introduced, although I am not in a position to
give any guarantees on that. However, it is vital to get the right
balance.</div>

Because of the speed of proceedings, which I accept the right hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000327"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I shall be brief. Clause 2 sets out the
circumstances in which the scrutiny powers in part 1 of the Bill do not
apply. There are some necessary exclusions because there is existing
legislative provision, for example in the Police and Justice Act 2006,
the National Health Service 2006 and the Flood and Water Management
Bill, which is currently before the
House.</div><a name="10030351000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000328"></a>Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> My right hon. Friend mentioned NHS scrutiny, and I
recognise that there are existing scrutiny powers. May I draw to his
attention a problem that he must experience in London, just as I do? A
consortium policy has developed in all the regions of London in which
the local authorities decide on a major reorganisation covering, in
most cases, five or six London boroughs. The London boroughs have
scrutiny powers within each borough but not beyond it, which means that
a significant part of health planning is outwith any acceptable or
effective public scrutiny. I have experienced this in the London north
central area, which covers the five local boroughs, but I am sure that
my colleagues in other parts of London have the same problem. I realise
that this Bill is limited, but can he offer me any hope on this
matter?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div><a name="10030351000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000329"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> When we reach clause 7, my hon. Friend will see
the specific provisions relating to the scope for joint scrutiny. It is
clearly appropriate for authorities to work together across a wider
area where such circumstances apply. One of the important principles
that has been maintained is coterminosity between the primary care
trust and local authorities, which means that London has avoided some
of the problems that have occurred elsewhere. However, I take my hon.
Friend&#146;s point. It is certainly an issue that should be
considered in relation to joint scrutiny and the use of the powers in
the Bill to cover a wider range of bodies than just those directly
delivering specific services, because there is a wider
impact.</div><a name="10030351000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have been reminded, health scrutiny is subject to separate
legislation. That remains, but there is provision later in this Bill,
so that where there is any doubt about the variable impact of different
measures, the provisions in the Bill will be overriding. We are trying,
in an interesting way, to extend scrutiny power, which has developed in
a rather piecemeal way over recent years. This is helping to create a
more coherent framework than the somewhat piecemeal approach that has
followed legislation relating to specific services
areas.</div>
<a name="10030351000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000330"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> This is a very interesting point. My first thought
when the right hon. Gentleman began to outline the powers in the Bill
was that there would be duplication of scrutiny. Would he be prepared
to accept an amendment to the Bill to explore whether the overview and
scrutiny committees would thereby repeal all the other scrutiny
legislation that affects bodies such as health authorities, because
they will just be swamped by people scrutinising them and not able to
focus on patient
provision?</div><a name="10030351000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000331"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Lady by
saying that there is absolutely no intention of creating additional
layers of scrutiny that would have the effect she fears. The Bill will
ensure that there is scope for scrutiny in those areas where it is not
currently possible for overview and scrutiny committees to require
information or attendance. The powers are important, as her hon. Friend
the Member for Putney recognised on Second
Reading.</div><a name="10030351000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is certainly no wish to duplicate measures. The way in which the Bill
is drafted builds on existing legislation, rather than substituting for
it. It would be difficult to accept an amendment that gets rid of all
other powers, because that would leave a series of new holes. I am more
than happy to talk to the hon. Lady between now and Report to see if we
need an amendment to clarify the objective that I am absolutely in
favour of, which is seamless scope for scrutiny without imposing
additional and unnecessary burdens. With those comments, I hope that
members of the Committee will accept the
clause.</div><a name="10030351000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

to require
information</div><a name="10030351000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div><a name="10030351000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000332"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The clause deals with the provision of
information to overview and scrutiny committees. Subsection (1)
provides that an overview and scrutiny 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>committee may by written notice require a designated body or person to
provide the committee with information to enable it to carry out its
functions. It also provides that an overview and scrutiny committee can
require such a body or person to send an appropriate person to attend
before the committee to answer
questions.</div><a name="10030351000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections
(2) to (4) provide that the Secretary of State may make regulations
about the exercise of the powers. The intention is to ensure that
appropriate provision may be made for the handling of personal and
confidential data of all types. I hope that the Minister can reassure
the Committee that that will be the
case.</div><a name="10030351000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000333"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Having had my rant about illiberal Liberals, not
least because of the experiences that we suffered in Northampton under
a Liberal council, I shall now proceed to the matter that I wished to
raise in the first instance. However, because I was not wide awake, I
failed to recognise at what stage we were
at.</div><a name="10030351000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
served as scrutiny chairman for a sizeable time when the Conservative
party was in opposition on Northamptonshire county council. We duly
took control of that council, and my role changed. I am a supporter of
scrutiny. It plays a vital part in local government and if we did not
have scrutiny, many elected councillors would not have much to do. One
of its purposes is to ensure that they are at least kept busy and off
the
streets.</div><a name="10030351000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to ask some questions specifically about the ability to summon
people to provide information or, indeed, to attend scrutiny meetings
in connection with the provision of public services by authorities or
persons designated under regulation by the Secretary of State. I seek
clarification of that particular measure. It seems to be a wide
definition of those people connected with the provision of services.
For example, many small businesses provide services for the provision
of a wider service within the remit of local government. Will the
clause include the many businesses that supply goods or services to
local organisations, which themselves provide a wider and perhaps more
specific service?</div>
<a name="10030351000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
the value of local councils, but I also recognise their ability to be
mischievous, and even more than mischievous on some occasions. I am
worried about the power that will be given to councillors who wish to
be mischievous, so I am looking for confirmation from the proposer of
the Bill, who I know to be a very fair man, and I know he would be
concerned if his Bill were misused in any way. He would certainly not
want
that.</div><a name="10030351000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to know about the legal situation. A small business that supplies
a bigger organisation might be open to giving away information that
might impact on it legally. What protection is there for people who
might be summoned under the new legislation? We all know that scrutiny
bodies do not have the right to summon people at the
moment.</div>
<a name="10030351000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000334"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Later in the Bill, protection for commercial
confidentiality is set out. Committees can keep information
confidential, so there is some security
there.</div><a name="10030351000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000335"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I did see that there was some security and I am
grateful for that intervention, because that properly explains the
situation&#151;&#147;some security&#148;. I am looking for a
greater degree of security for innocent people who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>could be summoned for mischievous reasons at a local level,
particularly, if I may say so, in the run-up to an
election.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000336"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> My hon. Friend will be aware that councils are
responsible under the Freedom of Information Act. Given that the hon.
Member for Plymouth, Devonport mentioned that there would be commercial
confidentiality, I wonder whether my hon. Friend might care to
speculate on how the FOI would play into commercial confidentiality for
small companies.</div>
<a name="10030351000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000337"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> That is what I meant when I made the point about
illiberal Liberals. It is all very well to state in the Bill that there
is some protection. I accept that, but once a matter gets into a formal
arena, there is grave doubt that the protection will still exist; that
is my
concern.</div><a name="10030351000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also concerned about the mischievous nature of the clause. I am
concerned about legal involvement and the cost to suppliers to the
organisations. I want to ask the proposer of the Bill what evidence he
has to suggest that people do not co-operate under the present
arrangements. When we have asked for information from an organisation
that is not directly accountable to a local authority, in my experience
people have been very helpful and we have always got that information.
What evidence does the proposer have that requires this rather more
draconian measure? I favour maintaining a degree of freedom and
independence from local authority involvement, particularly if it turns
out to be a mischievous action rather than an action that is helpful to
the local
community.</div><a name="10030351000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000338"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Once again, I am slightly confused by the
point that the Conservatives are trying to make. They are either saying
that all this already happens and people come forward and co-operate
anyway, or they are saying that it is a massive additional burden,
which will breach commercial confidentiality. I am not entirely sure
how it can be both things. From a party that says that it has converted
to the localist agenda, I have not heard anything to indicate that that
is the case. From the comments that have been made so far, their
apparent support for the Bill is massively
grudging.</div><a name="10030351000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000339"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Will the hon. Lady give
way?</div><a name="10030351000258"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.30
am</div><a name="10030351000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000340"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I have only a brief point to make and, having
been generous, I would like to make some progress. The way in which the
Warm Front scheme operates is an example of how public money and
private companies could open up the need for the kind of scrutiny that
we do not have at present. It is a national scheme involving large sums
of public money, but in Cornwall we have very few installers, which
means that we have had huge problems with installers coming all the way
from Cardiff with no reputational stake in delivering a good service.
As a result, people have their hot water and heating turned off and the
installers simply do not come back. Those are terrible experiences, and
it has been difficult to get information out of Warm
Front.</div><a name="10030351000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000341"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> Warm Front is a national scheme. It is the hon.
Lady&#146;s job to raise the issue here; it is not for local
government to raise it impotently in the local
area.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="10030351000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000342"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> As I am sure the hon. Lady knows, the scheme
interacts with local authority grant funding to help deliver in areas
such as Cornwall, where there is little gas heating and a grant is
required from the local authority to ensure that some local people can
afford
it.</div><a name="10030351000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000343"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Will the hon. Lady give
way?</div><a name="10030351000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000344"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman, since
he has been so
polite.</div><a name="10030351000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000345"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Thank you very much&#151;there had appeared to
be some sort of anti-male attack. May I clarify a point raised by the
hon. Lady? She claimed that I may want to have it both ways. Let me
make it clear that I stand on the side of the great majority of
individuals who are concerned about the over-mighty weight of
bureaucracy and administration. That is the point that I am making, and
I am making it with particular regard to small and medium-sized
businesses, which might be mischievously impacted upon. I want to
guarantee that that will not happen. I would have thought that every
liberal in this country would support that
point.</div><a name="10030351000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000346"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I suppose all I can say is that I stand on
the side of taxpayers who want to ensure that the money that they are
being asked to pay is being spent effectively and efficiently on
delivering services that benefit them. To return to my earlier point,
Warm Front is exactly the kind of scheme where private companies
receive large sums of public money and where there may be problems with
delivery at a local level. It would be helpful to have a power to
ensure that such a scheme provides appropriate information, so that the
weaknesses of its delivery across a local authority area can be
understood, debated and scrutinised. That is why the clause is
important.</div><a name="10030351000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030351000347"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): I am delighted to serve
under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble. I am sorry that I
missed the first half hour. Had I known that it was going to be such
fun, I would have rushed here expeditiously. It is good to see my good
friend the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne
present.</div><a name="10030351000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make a point to my hon. Friend the Minister. How does the
clause relate to the local spending reports in the Sustainable
Communities Bill, which some of us have some knowledge about and
continue to support as it progresses? I hope that the Minister will say
some nice things about how the clause will connect with the ability for
greater transparency on how different parts of the statutory sector are
laid bare in terms of their funding, so that we can do a better job of
spending the money
subsequently.</div><a name="10030351000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000348"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> The Government recognise the need for
proportionality and the need to avoid duplication. That is why we
intend to use the regulation-making powers in clauses 2 to 4 to ensure
that there are certain safeguards and procedures in place to make sure
that the exercise of the powers by councils does not impose a
disproportionate burden on the bodies subject to scrutiny.</div>
<a name="10030351000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">To reassure
the hon. Member for Northampton, South, the duty to attend will apply
to designated bodies only, and the regulations may need to make further
provision 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>to ensure that any burden is proportionate. Such regulations could
provide that information already in the public domain need not be
provided again, and prohibit overview and scrutiny committees from
undertaking scrutiny reviews on a matter more than once in a period
specified in the regulations. They could also make provision on the
disclosure of confidential and personal information to scrutiny
committees, and the description of who is an appropriate person for the
purpose of designated bodies sending a person to attend a scrutiny
committee hearing to answer questions. Our thoughts&#151;as you can
tell from this, Mrs. Humble&#151;are what could be
included in the regulations that are still at an early stage of
development. As with regulations under clause 1, we intend to consult
before making any regulations under these
clauses.</div>
<a name="10030351000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that,
given these assurances, the Committee will see fit to accept the
clause. In conclusion, I would like to say that I agree with my hon.
Friend the Member for Stroud that transparency is always to be
welcomed. I welcome working with him on the extension to the
Sustainable Communities Act
2007.</div><a name="10030351000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000349"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> My hon. Friend the Minister has rightly
highlighted that there will be consultation before any regulations are
prepared. That gives the right opportunity for all interested parties,
particularly the business community, to express views about the
proposals. As I stressed in an earlier debate, it is a matter of
balance. There is evidence&#151;some anecdotal, but widely circulated
and believed&#151;referred to on Second Reading by the hon. Member
for Putney, that in some cases, councils seeking information do not get
the co-operation that they should from bodies such as utilities. Water
companies are often mentioned: the leaky bucket story and other such
events. In those cases, where one is dealing with very large
organisations, there should be no reason for them not to provide
information to a local authority when requested.</div>
<a name="10030351000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Northampton, South is right to express concerns about
disproportionate burdens on small businesses, and they should be taken
into account during the consultation on the regulation-making powers.
With those assurances, I hope that hon. Members will agree that the
clause should stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="10030351000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000350"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Section 21(2)(e) of the Local Government Act
2000 provides that overview and scrutiny committees
may</div><a name="10030351000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make
reports or recommendations to the authority or the executive on matters
which affect the authority&#146;s area or the inhabitants of that
area.&#148;</div><a name="10030351000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
reports will obviously have no effect if they are left to gather dust
on a shelf unread. Clause 4 therefore makes provisions about what
should happen after a  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>scrutiny report or recommendations have been made. Subsection (2)
provides that where an overview and scrutiny committee makes a report
or recommendation under the provisions of the Bill, it may also by
notice in writing require the designated body or person to have regard
to the report or recommendations when exercising any function of a
public nature.</div>
<a name="10030351000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The committee
may also, in making a report or recommendations, require the designated
authority or person to respond to the report within two months of
receipt, indicating what action, if any, they intend to take. There are
various consequential provisions, including those relating to
regulation conditions. This seems a sensible way to ensure that
scrutiny reports are not just left to gather dust on the
shelf.</div>
<a name="10030351000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000351"></a>Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> I understand the point about the requirements of a
limited time to reply&#151;two months seems reasonable and fair.
Would that also apply to private sector organisations, such as Warm
Front, which receive large amounts of public money and virtually become
a delivery agency for the public
sector?</div><a name="10030351000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000352"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The purpose of the Bill is to cover all those
involved in the delivery of public services. The definition of public
services in clause 1&#151;which includes services discharged either
as part of a statutory function or as a result of receipt of grant from

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000353"></a>Mr.

response, and clause 5 simply deals with the publication of that
response. It provides that where an overview and scrutiny committee has
published its report, it may also publish the designated authority or
person&#146;s response. It ensures that scrutiny can be open and
transparent and that the public are properly informed about
scrutiny reviews. It also provides further incentive for bodies to
consider properly and fully the recommendations made to them. Members
of the public will be able to see whether recommendations have been
taken seriously and to better understand the reasons

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000355"></a>Mr.

raised the
matter.</div><a name="10030351000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
one difficulty that will arise in the case of district councils in
two-tier areas is the possible risk of duplication if more than one
district were to initiate an inquiry on the same subject
simultaneously. That would impose an unreasonable burden on local
partners, so it is right that there should be a proper co-ordinated
framework. On Second Reading, I expressed concern that the Bill
appeared to convey the message that district councils in two-tier areas
were excluded. That is not the intention; there should be a proper
co-ordinated framework to ensure that issues affecting more than one
area are the subject of joint scrutiny. There should not be the kind of
duplication about which Opposition Members have rightly expressed
concern.</div>
<a name="10030351000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000357"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000358"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Whatever my personal view on that subject, I
think that we have had enough controversy this morning to lead me not
to enter that particular minefield. I shall pass rapidly over my hon.
Friend&#146;s question.</div>
<a name="10030351000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is my
understanding&#151;the Minister may wish to add her

intention to exclude district councils and two-tier areas. There should

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000359"></a>Mrs.

explanation, and I hope that the Minister can be equally positive.
However, it still prompts the question of when the regulations, which
are meant to be being prepared, are likely to emerge. Without them,
district councils will be excluded. We are considering this legislation
against the background of an imminent general election, so if the Bill
progresses but the regulations do not, the district councils will be
left out.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000362"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> I do not share the hon. Lady&#146;s hopes; in
fact, I have entirely different ones. I look forward to the regulations
being taken through the House but, sadly, I will not be here to see it
because I am standing down at the general election.</div>

provides that the provisions of part 1 of the Bill, which sets out the
framework for the enhanced scrutiny regime, will apply to county
councils in England and to London borough councils, as my right hon.
Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said. Part 1 of the Bill
does not apply to non-unitary district councils.</div>
<a name="10030351000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">That approach
has been taken to minimise the potential burdens placed on bodies
subject to the enhanced regime&#151;I hope that the hon. Member for
Northampton, South, will be pleased about that&#151;and to reduce the
ever-present risk of duplication. However, that is not to devalue the
important work of non-unitary district councils in scrutinising matters
of local concern. I can reassure right hon. and hon. Members that such
district councils will continue to have a very important role, under
both the existing and the enhanced scrutiny regimes, in holding to
account and scrutinising the decisions of local public service
providers.</div><a name="10030351000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000363"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Once again, I would not normally wish to speak
on a clause about consequential amendments. However, for the benefit of
my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North, who raised the issue of
joint scrutiny of health services, I want to highlight the provisions
in the clause that amend section 123 of the Local Government and Public
Involvement in Health Act 2007 to enable the Secretary of State to make
provision in regulations for the appointment of joint overview and
scrutiny committees of two or more local authorities that may discharge
their powers in that respect. I hope that that gives my hon. Friend the
assurance for which he was particularly
keen.</div><a name="10030351000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000364"></a>Jeremy
Corbyn:</b><b class="B"> </b>That is helpful. However, my right hon.
Friend may be able to help me on what might be a slightly arcane point.
I was told by councils in my local authority last week that if they
formed a consortium of north London authorities to scrutinise the
London strategic health authority&#146;s plans for the north central
area, they would lose their ability to scrutinise the same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>plans at an entirely local level. It became a type of either/or
situation, which seems a fairly ridiculous way of proceeding, because
there are clearly regional implications, as well as very local
implications, for any plans made by any health authority. I do not know
whether my right hon. Friend can help me with that point, or whether he
just wants to think about
it.</div><a name="10030351000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000365"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I certainly want to think about it, because
that point takes us right back to the key issue throughout our debate,
which is the importance of achieving a balance between ensuring that
there are not gaps in the scrutiny process and avoiding the risks of
duplication and creating unreasonable burdens. That is the balance that
must be achieved. I believe that what the clause does is correct,
because it closes a gap; there was not the scope for the joint
committees before. I would have thought that the right way forward on
the issue&#151;I am just thinking aloud at this
point&#151;</div><a name="10030351000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000366"></a>Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> Very dangerous.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="10030351000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000367"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> It is always a dangerous thing to do, but those
who know me know that I have form in that particular area.</div>
<a name="10030351000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">My thought is
that the sensible thing would be to have a joint overview and, in the
course of that joint overview process, issues that are uniquely of
concern to individual areas should be highlighted as part of the joint
review, rather than there being a separate and duplicated scrutiny
process.</div>
<a name="10030351000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000368"></a>Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> I accept that, and it sounds sensible. In some
cases, the views of two local authorities might diverge completely, for
example on the location of a specialist health facility&#151;the sort
of issue that is familiar to all of us. We would not want a consortium
of, say, five local authorities agreeing a majority consensus&#151;if
such a thing is possible&#151;while a minority consensus is ignored.
Those in the minority cannot ultimately make their point to the
Secretary of State on behalf of the people whom they represent. That
could become a real problem in some
areas.</div><a name="10030351000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000369"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> My response to my hon. Friend on the classic
issue of the entitlements and rights of minorities in situations where
they might be overridden by the majority view, but where they have a
real local concern, is that their recourse is probably to options other
than scrutiny. Ultimately, we are being taken into the political arena,
and the ability of a public authority to highlight its concerns
politically and to raise them with the electorate is probably a more
powerful
weapon.</div><a name="10030351000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000370"></a>Harry
Cohen:</b> May I take the opportunity to raise an issue on
which I would appreciate my right hon. Friend&#146;s comments? In my
area, Newham is responsible for London City airport. It may agree,
under its process, a change to flight times or arrangements. As part of
that planning process, Newham consults around the airport, but not in
neighbouring areas such as mine, which the planes go over. That causes
some aggravation. Would it be appropriate for the local authority,
under local pressure, to say, &#147;We want to look at
Newham&#146;s consultation process, because it didn&#146;t apply to
our area, even though it affected our area&#148;? Would it be
legitimate for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>scrutiny committee in Waltham Forest or Redbridge, for example, to do
that, even though the decision was made in
Newham?</div><a name="10030351000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000371"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I will be cautious in response, not least
because, as my hon. Friend knows, I have a similar interest, in that I
live in and represent a constituency that lies under the flight paths
to Heathrow and to London City airport. I am well aware of the issues
in areas that are afflicted by aircraft noise but that are not
themselves directly part of the consultation
process.</div><a name="10030351000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
gut instinct&#151;it is always dangerous to voice it, and I probably
should not do so, but I will&#151;is that the establishment of a
joint scrutiny body might be the right way to overcome those fears and
concerns. However, that is very much off the top of my head, rather
than an official
response.</div><a name="10030351000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
health, my hon. Friend the Minister might wish to have some words with
her colleagues in the Department of Health to ensure clarity about how
the scrutiny functions are properly
discharged.</div><a name="10030351000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000372"></a>Barbara

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000373"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> We come to another issue highlighted on Second
Reading and by the hon. Member for Beckenham this morning. I share her
concerns, of course, because I voiced the same ones on Second
Reading.</div><a name="10030351000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effect of the amendments made by subsections (2) and (3) is
to allow an overview and scrutiny committee to include members of the
local authority&#146;s executive, when the committee is not
scrutinising matters relating to the executive. There are also powers
to make regulations for further provisions to avoid conflicts of
interest. My concern is to avoid creating false relationships, in which
a local authority member might be a partner of a body one day and
scrutinising it the next. That is a difficult situation, which should
be avoided if
possible.</div><a name="10030351000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second concern is to avoid the overview and scrutiny members in a local
authority to some extent having their important role usurped by
executive members, who have far greater powers in the normal course of
events. However, I accept that there might be circumstances in which,
in the interests of good scrutiny, the expertise of an executive member
might be useful as part of that process. I look to the Minister to say
that there needs to be very careful drafting of the regulations to
ensure that while the permissive power may be used in appropriate
circumstances, it is hedged around with sufficient safeguards to avoid
the two particular problems that I have highlighted.</div>
<a name="10030351000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000374"></a>Mrs.

<a name="10030351000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000375"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The hon. Lady, I am sure, wants to add to those
remarks, so I shall finish mine on that
point.</div><a name="10030351000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000376"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> I am most grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I
could not have put the point better myself. There is a potential
resolution to the problem, because the issue of conflict of interest is
very important and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>could lead to a lot of trouble in the future. There are not many
councils I know that could be browbeaten, but it is possible that an
executive member could browbeat the other members of the overview and
scrutiny committee, and that is not a satisfactory situation.</div>
<a name="10030351000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich hopes that the
Minister will reassure him, but I hope that it is possible to come
forward with a joint amendment on Report to deal with the issue. My
suggestion, as somebody who has observed local government but has never
been part of it, is that the executive member could be a witness; they
would then not need to be part of the overview and scrutiny committee.
The witness could be called more than once if issues arose that
affected any contract or local area agreement. That would be more
satisfactory than putting the executive member in the unenviable
position of having a conflict of interest, or of being accused of
browbeating the
committee.</div>
<a name="10030351000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000377"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> This is the one part of the Bill that I have some
difficulty with, based entirely on my own experiences. The problem is,
who decides who goes on overview and scrutiny committees and,
subsequently, who chairs those committees? We all probably have, or
know of, examples where a majority group&#151;often a very strong
majority group&#151;can unfairly influence the whole process, which
is based on our Select Committees. However, we come to some sort of
arrangement here in the House of Commons through the usual channels; in
local government there is no equivalent. It is quite within the power
of a majority group to appoint its own chairs&#151;clearly not an
executive, but its own chairs&#151;from that party to every one of
the committee chairs and to influence who goes on the overview and
scrutiny
committees.</div><a name="10030351000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000378"></a>Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> My hon. Friend raises a very important point.
Certainly, in my experience of local authorities, the majority group
often seeks to appoint somebody. It is a paid position and a lucrative
position. In effect, where the majority party appoints them, they
become almost an addendum to the executive cabinet system that
operates. That is absolutely the opposite of what the scrutiny
committee should be and should
do.</div><a name="10030351000260"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="10030351000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000379"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> And that is the whole point. Clearly, they are
entirely reliant on those who appoint to keep themselves in that
position. I ask my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich to look at that issue. In fact, the problem goes beyond that
unacceptable situation. I have seen examples of the majority group not
only appointing the chairs but influencing who goes on the committees,
to the extent that, where another group has put forward a proposal, the
person in question has not achieved the satisfactory level of support
and somebody else&#151;either from another group or even,
ludicrously, from the same group&#151;has been put on that committee
by another party. That brings into question the whole basis of the
independence and objectivity of these committees.</div>
<a name="10030351000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">One thing we
pride ourselves on here is our Select Committees: if they are not
independent and objective they are completely useless. That is why I am
always nervous about PPSs going on to Select Committees, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>even in desperation when we have to make the numbers up. They are
inevitably wearing two hats, even though the Committee may not be in
their Minister&#146;s area. There is inevitably confusion if not in
their minds, then in the minds of other Committee members
and&#151;dare I say it?&#151;in the minds of those whom we
represent. Which hat are they wearing at any one time?</div>
<a name="10030351000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
look at this issue. This is one of the few improvements to come from
the loss of the committee system. As a long-term servant of local
government I had some loyalty to that system, although I accept that it
had its weaknesses as well. The problem is that in moving to the
current system of overview and scrutiny, these committees have to be
independent and objective and must be seen to be so. It is not
acceptable to have people from the executive on them. I hope that we
can look at this again on Report so we can establish that.</div>
<a name="10030351000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am going
beyond where we are now but this is a real problem in local government
at the moment, and it could be a growing problem, because unless we nip
it in the bud, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North said,
there will be some slippage. This could be quite a nice position for
someone who is not on the executive but who is in a strong majority
situation, and who could be encouraged to think that this is another
job they can
do.</div><a name="10030351000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000380"></a>Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> My hon. Friend makes a strong point. A scrutiny
committee chair is a paid position that is subject to annual
appointment. In practice, what happens is that a council election takes
place and an executive is established. A scrutiny committee chair is
appointed, and they may even give up their own job to do this. I am
sure that the knowledge that they may not be reappointed a year later
fetters their judgment and their ability to scrutinise seriously what
is going on. It is a real issue. If we are to achieve effective
scrutiny, there has to be some degree of
independence.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000381"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich knows what I am saying, and I am in no way trying to wreck
this laudable Bill. My hon. Friend the Minister also hears what I am
saying: I am just describing what I have seen as real, practical
problems. Even if they are not in any way what is actually going on,
the perception of what could go on influences for the worse the best
part of the reforms.</div>
<a name="10030351000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000382"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The hon. Gentleman has highlighted some
weaknesses in the existing system, which the clause could exacerbate.
Perhaps there needs to be a wider rethink of the options available to
local authorities. In some cases it might require a return to the
committee system or a more effective counterweight to that. The key
issue is that the set-up of the current overview and scrutiny system
also muddies these waters quite a lot.</div>
<a name="10030351000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
the health and adult services overview and scrutiny committee
scrutinises services that the council the local primary care trust
delivers. Those are very different roles. In one case, it is clear why
there might be an argument for having an executive member sitting on a
committee scrutinising the work of the PCT, but it would be entirely
inappropriate for them to be sitting on a committee scrutinising work
they were undertaking themselves.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div><a name="10030351000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
work out whether it is possible to separate those two issues. Could the
executive member attend at the invitation of the committee? That might
be a way of doing it. Participation could be linked to a specific
report or investigation, so that there was participation only on issues
that went beyond the remit of the local authority, but that were
subject to scrutiny by the committee.</div>
<a name="10030351000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see some
value in this measure if councils need to campaign on an issue. We
should remember that councils not only deliver services but have a
campaigning role to fulfil. I understand the benefit of an executive
member adding weight to an investigation or scrutiny process, but we
must ensure that the various elements are properly separated. I hope
there is some way of doing that, and that the Minister and her
officials will put their minds to it.</div>
<a name="10030351000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000383"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I support the comments of the hon. Member for
Stroud and others, and I agree that this is one of the greatest
weaknesses of the overview and scrutiny process. It is not a party
political thing in any sense; it spreads right across controlling
groups from all political parties. I urge the Bill&#146;s promoter to
think about the matter in more depth. I know how wise he is, and he has
tried to be so with the Bill, but I am not sure that it gives quite
enough consideration to the problem.
</div><a name="10030351000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to make three points. First, scrutiny chairmanships can offer a
massive opportunity to reward loyal retainers. That is the truth of the
matter, and it is happening more and more. Of course, that flies in the
face of the very purpose of overview and scrutiny committees. Secondly,
the bigger the majority, the greater the problem. The very fact that
there is a big majority means that there are not enough people from
other parties to fill those roles. We need to think about that,
too.</div>
<a name="10030351000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, in
such cases overview and scrutiny becomes an adjunct and supporter of
the executive. Again, that totally undermines the reason for the
overview and scrutiny arrangements that the Government initially
proposed. Those weaknesses are not rare, but relatively widespread. I
consequently urge the Bill&#146;s promoter to see what he can do to
make the business of overview and scrutiny a more effective tool for
local government in such circumstances. At the moment, it could easily
become a total supporter of the executive and thus lose all reason for
its
existence.</div>
<a name="10030351000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000384"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> As my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich said, concerns about clause 8 were raised on Second
Reading. In particular, Members were concerned that the provision would
undermine the overall structure of accountability in local authorities,
with scrutiny committees acting as a check and balance against a strong
executive.</div>
<a name="10030351000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the
Committee that we do not intend to use the regulation-making power to
blur the important distinction between the executive&#146;s role in
the strategic leadership of the council and the scrutiny
committee&#146;s role of holding the executive to account. Like the
hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne and others, we believe that there
may be circumstances&#151;for instance, if a committee is
scrutinising an external body on matters of local concern in which the
council has played 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>no part&#151;in which the capacity to enable members of the executive
to be present could improve the scrutiny of such matters and may be
more productive to the benefit of the local
community.</div>
<a name="10030351000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the
Committee, however, the Government realise that that could be
difficult. Allowing each council to decide whether a member should be
present could result in pressure, which is why I urge my right hon.
Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich to work with me and my
officials on a way forward that we could introduce on
Report.</div><a name="10030351000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000385"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s
suggestion, and I would be more than happy to work with her and her
officials. I would also like to engage other members of the Committee
who have spoken on the matter. There is complete agreement across all
parties that the issue needs to be addressed, and I would like to be
able to table an amendment on Report that deals with it, while at the
same time recognising that there may be merit, in certain
circumstances, in deploying the expertise of executive members as part
of such scrutiny. However, it must be on terms that do not undermine
the role of the scrutiny
committee.</div><a name="10030351000227"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000387"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman in just a
moment. I refer to his speech in saying that I would not want such
participation to create a situation where there is patronage and where
the executive, through control of scrutiny appointments, essentially
neutralises the effectiveness of the scrutiny. That would be a complete
breach of everything that we seek to achieve with better
scrutiny.</div><a name="10030351000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000388"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I simply ask whether the right hon. Gentleman
thinks this might be workable: one way of ensuring that the executive
has no role to play whatsoever in the appointment of chairmen and
members of the scrutiny committee would be to leave that for
non-executive councillors to decide among themselves. I recognise that
undue influence could still be applied in that scenario, but less
easily so than in the present situation, in which the executive often
decides who should be the chairman, vice-chairman and so on of scrutiny
committees. They make decisions for their own reasons and not for the
reasons of good
scrutiny.</div><a name="10030351000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000389"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s observation is
interesting, not least because he makes it in the week in which the
House will vote on issues relating to the appointment of Select
Committee members. I would like to reflect on that. It would be
difficult within the structure of the Bill to make far-reaching changes
to existing scrutiny arrangements; nevertheless, he makes a good
point.</div><a name="10030351000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000390"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> In the interests of co-operation, another thought
that has crossed my mind is to give the executive member a status
similar to that of an adviser to a Select
Committee.</div><a name="10030351000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000391"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The role of adviser, and the possibility of
executive committee members being invited to attend by the scrutiny
committee, rather than having a right to attend, as I believe was
suggested by the hon. Member 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>for Falmouth and Camborne, are both interesting options. I would like to
reflect on them and speak further with colleagues and, obviously, with
the Minister and her officials, then try to shape an amendment that
would address those issues on Report. With that, I ask Members to agree
that the clause should stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="10030351000233"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000392"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we move on to debate clause 9, Members
may wish to note that, under the terms of Standing Order 88(2), I am
normally required to adjourn the Committee at 11.25 am. However, the
Standing Order also provides for me to defer the adjournment for a
maximum of 15 minutes&#151;that is, until 11.40 am&#151;if, in my
opinion, there is a realistic prospect that the deferral would enable
the Committee to conclude its proceedings during the sitting. That is
my opinion, so I give notice to Members that the Committee will
adjourn, at the latest, at 11.40 am. There can be no further extension
beyond
that.</div><a name="10030351000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause</i><i class="I">s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000395"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Before we conclude our business, I thank you,
Mrs. Humble, for presiding with great skill and charm over
our interesting proceedings. I thank all members of the Committee for
their time and contribution. I hope that, despite the difficulties that
have emerged in the course of the Committee&#146;s work, we can find
a constructive way forward.</div>
<a name="10030351000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000396"></a>Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> There is an important point to be resolved with
the Minister on the question of scrutiny committees and the chairing of
them. Can my right hon. Friend indicate how quickly that can be done,
so that we do not lose the opportunity of getting this valuable private
Member&#146;s Bill on to the statute book before the great reaper
arrives?</div>
<a name="10030351000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000397"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Alas, that poses all sorts of questions that I
am not in a position to answer. As my hon. Friend will know, I have
done my utmost to try to ensure rapid progress on the Bill. I will
continue to do my utmost to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>ensure that it progresses constructively and, hopefully, with agreement
through its remaining stages in the House. Beyond that, we are in the
lap of the
gods.</div><a name="10030351000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I thank the Clerks for looking after today&#146;s
arrangements so efficiently, and I thank the police and others who have
helped to ensure our proceedings are carried forward in an expeditious
way. I recommend that the Bill now be reported, as the motion
requires.</div>
<a name="10030351000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000398"></a>Mrs.
Lait:</b> May I add my thanks to you, in particular,
Mrs. Humble? It has been a cheerful Committee, despite the
degree of disagreement that has been evident. I was very interested in
some of the Back-Bench comments. The Committee stage has shown which
areas we need to work on on Report and which require more
clarification, so your excellent chairing has allowed us to do that. I
also want to thank the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich for
picking up the Bill at such short notice. We recognise how difficult it
is. We will work to introduce the amendments that we think are required
in the Bill. I thank my colleagues and other members of the Committee
for teasing out the issues, and I thank everyone who has helped to
ensure that we have been able to complete this Committee stage in
relatively good order.</div>
<a name="10030351000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030351000399"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Thank you, Mrs. Humble, for your
very efficient chairmanship and for giving me another 25 minutes in
which to speak. I would not go quite as far as the hon. Member for
Beckenham and say that it has been good-tempered debate, although the
mood seemed to improve as hon. Members woke up. We have discussed
important issues that we hope to resolve before Report. The debate has
also touched on wider issues, which perhaps exposed the Bill&#146;s
limitations. The issues raised about scrutiny committees and membership
go far beyond what we have debated here. Perhaps that is something to
which we need to return in a different debate. None the less, it has
been worthwhile and I am pleased that it has ended on such a concordant
note.</div>

Follett:</b> I echo the remarks made by colleagues. I have
enjoyed the Bill and the work that we have done together on it. I would
like to assure my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North that we
will work as expeditiously as possible to settle the matters before we
see the grim reaper, whose actual time of arrival is not yet
known.</div><a name="10030351000246"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
