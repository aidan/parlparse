                           </span> I expect that you will be
pleased to hear, Mr Amess, that I will not start from  the
beginning on amendment 16. In fact, this morning  I had nearly
come to the end of my deliberations  on it. We had reached the
part of proposed new subsection (2)(a)(f) that deals with a
universal postal service. We were talking about the absolute importance
of rural areas being able to develop e-mail businesses and small
businesses growing up using postal services, because it is sometimes so
difficult to get investment by big companies, with large numbers of
jobs, into areas that are very far from the markets. Therefore
provision that is universal, in terms of both a uniform price and
deliveries six days a week, is critical. That is why we believe that it
needs to be specified, through the amendment, that we expect the
Secretary of State to make clear
exactly<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Such
provision is extremely important for the small business community in
rural
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to stress again why we believe that further consideration of these
matters is necessary and why we tabled amendments 17, 18 and 15. The
current Postal Services Bill has a number of similarities to the 2009
Postal Services Bill, but this Bill will privatise Royal Mail in its
entirety, which makes it distinct from the 2009 Bill. One of our
difficulties is in trying to grasp the detail and to discover exactly
what information is in the Bill about whether there will be an initial
public offering, whether it will happen all at once or in tranches,
whether it will lead to a sale to a proven communications business or a
private equity group or whether it will mean the break-up of the
company into different geographical and functional units, with parts of
the business being hived off and so on. Because we need more detail and
information, we were anxious to table amendments 17, 18 and 15, which
would all, in varying degrees, bring accountability back to Parliament
by ensuring that we had more information about what exactly is
proposed.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000016">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
we have said many times already, there are few examples of 100%
privatisation having taken place. Even countries such as the USA and
Canada, where Moya Greene came from, have postal services that are
publicly owned. I will spare hon. Members a reference to a certain
postal service that I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for
Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East will

                        <p class="tabbed">There
have not been many instances of 100% privatisation. That brings me back
to the specific issue. We are looking at further measures whereby there
would be an opportunity to bring back to Parliament the proposals
outlined in the Bill, about which we want much more detail. We could
move to the alternative resolution or, indeed, a super-affirmative
resolution procedure that would require the Bill to be put before
Parliament. There is more detail that we want to know about, which is
why our preference is for the strongest of the four amendments that we
have tabled. It would ensure the maximum possible involvement of
Parliament in the full scrutiny of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People
might think that we are exaggerating, that we cannot see the wood for
the trees or that we have not understood the detail of the clause, but
previous privatisation legislation has provided more detail. Matters
have been spelt out more clearly. For example, the Railways Act 1993
imposed a series of general duties on the Secretary of State and the
franchising director in respect of the award of franchises. There were
detailed prescriptions concerning to what type of entities assets could
be transferred. Under the Railways Act, the franchise director of the
British Railways Board was restricted to transfer assets to franchised
companies or companies that the board wholly owned under sections 85
and 86 of the Act. The Secretary of State was also subject to several
franchising and licensing general duties to protect the interests of
users of railways services in respect of price and quality, in
particular.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are all concerned about the users of the Royal Mail service and the
users of the post office network as they, by implication, will be
affected by what happens. Under the Railways Act, specific measures
have mentioned such concerns in more detail than are set out in the
Bill. The Secretary of State was also subject to a number of general
duties such as promoting the use of the railway network, promoting
efficiency, promoting competition, minimising restrictions on operators
and ensuring safety. He was further obliged to promote the award of
franchise agreements to companies in which employees had a substantial
interest. We are worried that there is not the same degree of detail
under the Bill as drafted, which is why ideally we would like a new
Bill introduced. Failing that, we would go for a super-affirmative
resolution or an affirmative resolution procedure because such matters
need considerable consideration and it would be a mistake to move
forward too quickly. Parliament needs to have the opportunity for
further scrutiny of exactly what the Government are proposing. It is
for that reason that I support the amendment, about which my hon.

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 256<a class="bkMark" name="Column256">&#160;</a>
                           </div>shows that there would be great benefit if an employee representative
served on the board. Having someone with a trade union background would
allow a direct communicative relationship between the board and the
work force, thus avoiding, as we have sometimes seen in industry, the
unnecessary complications of HR
interference.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the first evidence session, Dave Ward of the Communication Workers
Union said that the representative sitting on the board did not have to
be a trade union rep. There is great scope there and the CWU has again
shown flexibility. The amendment would allow a continuation of the
bridge-building that has happened over the past two years through the
modernisation programme. Also, such representation on the board would
be of direct benefit to all employees, whether they are union members
or not. The board would work with the trade union, which is recognised
on site, but which also represents employees who make the democratic
decision not to be a member of the
union.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said, such a position would also help build on the trust and
relations established over the past two years, after the previous
difficult years. Fundamental to a position on the board for an employee
representative would be the communication between the shop floor, the
board and the other directors on that board. The great
prospect—better than just an employee representative—is
the element of customer representation. We are talking about a
relationship on the board between the producers—the work
force—and the actual customers. I do not think that is very
common but it would be a great industrial practice to take forward. In
fact, ideas for mutual relationships have been proposed in the
co-operative movement. Unfortunately, between the 1930s and 1950s, the
Conservative party blocked such relationships between producers and a
consumers.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000025">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Customer
representatives on the board would also have a great effect in building
up trust between the work force and customers. We avoid the middleman,
which, the majority of the time, tends to be different tiers of
management. We could have the shop floor talking directly to the
customer.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000026">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I appreciate that it is quite confusing in that
instance. It might be something of merit for the Minister to consider.
In the instance of employees, there is a suggestion—in fact,
there is a part of the Bill—that would provide employees with
10% or more of the stakes in the business. Should the employee
representative represent the interests of employees as shareholders,
employees as a whole, or the union members of the work
force?<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000029">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think that it should be employees as a
whole. We have not talked specifically about a trade union
representative as opposed to an employee representative. Obviously, the
union wants to have some input and discussion about whom the
representative would be. As Dave Ward said, the representative need not
be a trade union representative. But communication between the shop
floor and the consumer is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000030">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman’s being so
generous and giving way. If the representative on the board is not a
member of the trade union, is there the potential for conflict between
the two? How would that be resolved in messages to the work
force—a large proportion of which is unionised—if there
is a dissonance between what the representative of the board says and
what the trade unionist
says?<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000031">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That industry relationship exists anyway. If
the hon. Gentleman is advocating collective representation across all
industrial sites, I am absolutely willing to support him 100%. There is
real scope across parties to look at that type of relationship in
industry. We could have a direct conversation between shop floor
employees and consumers, and miss the middleman in between. That would
be a really radical step for genuine industrial relations. It would
allow the shop floor to understand commercial viability and also get
their voice across to the consumer.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000032">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
a board had an employee representative and a customer representative,
it would speed up the time taken to make decisions. A middleman
proposes consumer need—why x, y and z need to be done—to
management, which is then relayed to the shop floor. That process would
be quicker if an employee representative could talk directly to a
consumer representative. There is huge scope for a change of
focus.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I have
said, such a change would build on the good industrial relations that
have been established over the past two years under the modernisation
programme. It would also show employees that they have a visible
democratic stake in the company and are represented by someone who can
reflect their views, as varied as those may be, between unionised and
non-unionised workers on the board. Employees would have a direct
relationship with a board
representative.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
will be a question about what system should be in place, and who should
be consulted to appoint such a person. The amendment proposes that
there would not be a restriction to only one representative, and after
consultation with the unions and other employees at different tiers
within Royal Mail it might be found that two are needed, so that should
be
considered.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000035">&#160;</a>

assets and sell the service on to make a short-term profit, which would
be the case if it were an equity firm or some such asset-stripping
organisation. That is what leaves industry per se vulnerable to
privatisations, unless regulation stipulates that any future business
must have a headquarters the UK. Of course, that in and of itself does
not stop a business from having an HQ in Britain and asset-stripping
the whole

Scunthorpe site. Teesside was producing slab steel. For the 12 months
prior to the mothballing in February, steel was being imported from the
?muiden site in Holland, even though the Teesside site was perfectly
viable, as we now know. I have been arguing, alongside my brothers in
the community, for the past two years, that things had been perfectly

talking about the actual capital in the business and the residual value
of the existing capital, which would be quite easy to sell very quickly
to recoup a lot of the equity initially spent in a sale. Likewise, in
the steel industry, a perfectly viable site such as Teesside, which
unfortunately underwent the overlook of the Prime Minister’s
fiscal friend Kirby Adams, would have to deal with that situation
unless we stipulated quite clearly that there should be a UK

the amendment, capital flows are now truly international, but the

any successful bidder to a recognition of the importance of having a

Perthshire alluded to, there is the history of Royal
Mail—people’s familiarity with something that they grew
up with and that is part of their community, and of their personality
and relationships. It is important, and it is a bigger issue than just
having a UK base. It is a small part of a broader point about ensuring
that the Government have a say in that service going forward. It is
also about preserving the UK identity in Royal Mail at its very
least.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000061">&#160;</a>

elsewhere. If Royal Mail is sold on to another owner, the amendment

be interesting to know whether not only direct employees of Royal Mail,
but contractors and subcontractors, might be balloted—what would
their relationship be to such a ballot, and would they be allowed to
vote? We also need to look at that to ensure that everyone who works
for Royal Mail, directly or indirectly, has a say in its future,

road of hard-line privatisations that we witnessed in the 1980s. Some
people in Guisborough did not understand where that policy of access to
private capital came from, and they certainly are not aware of the

                           </strong> We have had a two-hour debate on the amendments,
which has given me time to think of an appropriate soubriquet. I
christened the group of proposed amendments to clause 1 the Red Bull
amendments because the Opposition wanted to speed through the
privatisation of Royal Mail—in undue haste in more than one
respect. I call the current group the Gordian knot amendments,
particularly in respect of the hon. Member for Ochil and South
Perthshire, because they seek to tie the Government in knots, in an
attempt to delay and put barriers in the way of what is in the Bill.
The question is whether the Committee should give the Government
flexibility as they go about trying to get private capital into Royal
Mail. We are never quite sure of Opposition Members’ intention,
because in the proposed amendments to clause 1 they wanted to speed up
privatisation, but in the clause 2 amendments they seem to want to put
barriers in the way. That is their right as the Opposition, but the
Government believe that it is absolutely vital to retail flexibility on
how shares or share rights are issued or transferred in future. Only if
we have that flexibility can we ensure the best commercial outcome for
Royal Mail and the
taxpayer.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
saw the Opposition’s efforts with the Postal Services Bill 2009,
when they put artificial barriers on the timing and form of the sale,
which was totally counter-productive. That sale did not go ahead.
Indeed, the House did not have the pleasure of debating that Bill. The
current Bill will not do that, and we are clear that we want
flexibility. We have made it clear that, unlike the previous
Government, we do not intend to launch a sale process until after the
Bill receives Royal Assent. We have also made it clear that a sale
could be through either an auction for potential purchasers, or a
flotation. Our aim will be to ensure that the sale process secures what
is best for Royal Mail and the best value for the
taxpayer.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have fully recognised the role of Parliament in this issue.
That is why we have the Bill, and it is why clause 2 requires the
Secretary of State to lay a report before Parliament when he has
decided to undertake a “relevant disposal”, to use the
phraseology of the Bill, or has decided that another person—for
example, Royal Mail Holdings plc or Royal Mail Group Ltd—should
undertake such a disposal. That is why we will resist the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000081">&#160;</a>

history lesson that the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire gave
the Committee. He said that it was Charles I who first allowed the
public access to the Royal Mail system. I was disappointed that the
hon. Gentleman did not mention Rowland Hill, who, as everyone will
know, was the founder of the uniform penny post in 1840. In many ways,
that got rid of the corruption and abuse that had been in the postal
system prior to that, and it was one of the great things that took
postal services forward not just in this country but worldwide. Rowland
Hill should be mentioned in any debate that we have about postal
history, not least because the Government, with this Bill, are
determined to ensure that we protect the universal service and, in
particular, the uniform pricing that he
pioneered.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000082">&#160;</a>

in the 18th century. The hon. Gentleman will know that there is an
exceedingly good school in Bath named after Ralph Allen; it is a very

plethora of criteria and conditions that would need to be met before

believe that such conditions should include a new Bill, in addition to
this one, before there can be a disposal. I thought that we were
debating the issue of Royal Mail and private capital, and that we did
not want to delay such consideration even further. I can see absolutely
no reason for a Government to introduce two successive pieces of
legislation to sell a company. That would be a complete waste of
parliamentary time and would delay the injection of private capital and

do not believe that there is any need for another Bill. The record of
how past Governments have privatised utilities shows that they have not
used a two-Bill model. It would be inadvisable to do so. It would
prevent negotiations on a transaction because any commercial partner
that is interested in investing would say to the Minister or
departmental official, “It is very interesting, but you have
another parliamentary hurdle to leap. How can we invest in the
negotiations and prepare for the transaction, given that Parliament can
veto it?” This proposal is particularly ill
thought-through.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000092">&#160;</a>

(a) and (b) of amendment 16 are predicated on Royal Mail being sold to
a foreign company. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made it
clear on Second Reading that the Government have no difficulty with
foreign ownership if it is in the best interests of  the
company and the taxpayer. It is surprising that the Opposition are
worried about that. Royal Mail has the proud heritage of providing the
universal service across the UK, but it would be inappropriate for
Government to enshrine in statute the location of the offices of a
private sector company. What is important is the service that Royal
Mail provides to its customers. The regulatory regime established by
part 3 of the Bill will ensure that a high quality universal postal
service is provided, regardless of who owns the company and where its
headquarters are located. Unless we tackle the problems facing Royal
Mail and the sector, we will not have a Royal Mail or a universal
postal service left. It is urgent that we take

I challenged Opposition Members in the long debate that we had about
precedents, they did not want to engage. I intervened to ask why the
Labour Government sold off British Energy in 2009 to a French company,
EDF, that has its headquarters in Paris. We might have discussed BAA
plc, the owners of which are headquartered in Madrid. We might have
discussed the privatisation of the electricity industry: one
distributor, London Electricity, was acquired by EDF in 2009 under the
previous Government and another, East Midlands Electricity, is owned by
E.ON, the headquarters of which is in Düsseldorf. If Opposition
Members want to pursue this point, they must explain to the Committee
how the people who have their electricity supplied by East Midlands
Electricity and London Electricity, the passengers who use British
airports owned by BAA and the customers of British Energy are being so
dramatically poorly served as a result of the headquarters of the
companies that own and run those businesses being located in other
European cities. I do not think that they can make that case, and that

focus on why they want to saddle any future owner and operator with
that requirement. It has not happened under previous legislation. When
the Labour party was in government, it did not pay heed to such
matters. Perhaps the Opposition have such high-tax plans for British
business that were they to come back to power, they would have to
require by law companies to stay in this country because otherwise
those companies would flee. Perhaps that is what is behind their

he and his colleague, the hon. Member for Bedford, were making a great
joke about the suggestion that mail would go elsewhere to be sorted and
come back to the United Kingdom. One of the problems of globalisation
is that mail is a commodity just like anything else. I offer the hon.

from Scotland, sending them to Thailand to have them dressed and
bringing them back for sale in the UK all within 24 hours. Why would

consultation exercise along the lines suggested in the amendment. Our
policy is soundly based; it is the result of a major, independent
review by Richard Hooper commissioned by the previous Government. He
and his fellow panel members met all the major stakeholders in the
industry, held more than 200 meetings and accepted further written
contributions. Over the summer, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State invited Richard Hooper to look back at his 2008 report and update
it. During that update, Richard Hooper met all the leading stakeholders
in the industry again. Since I came into the Government, I have met
some of the key players in the sector and discussed Government
proposals with them.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000105">&#160;</a>

hon. Gentleman has done. I do not wish to go around every single block
a third or fourth time. I simply say that I believe the proposals to be
well founded and that they build on a lot of work and consultation
carried out by the previous Government. Richard Hooper told the
Committee that unless we press ahead quickly he was extremely worried
for the future of Royal Mail and the universal postal service. Given
that, further delay and inaction would be deeply
damaging.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000109">&#160;</a>

(a) of amendment 16 is about having an employee representative on the
board. I listened intently to those Labour Members who sought to
explain the measure in detail, although I have to say that we got
fairly little detail. I was quite upset at that as I am a strong
believer in industrial democracy. I am sure that Labour Members will
have read the Bullock royal commission on industrial democracy from
1977. They might have thought that that was an idea that they would
have pursued when in government. I checked the previous Labour
Government’s record on industrial democracy and having workers
on the board over the past 13 years, but I could not find any action by
the previous Government to put workers on the board. In fact, in the
debate on the 2009 Postal Services Bill, two Labour peers, Lord Morgan
and Lord Lea, proposed, in what would have been new clause 3A, that the
Royal Mail board should comprise Crown representation, workers’
representation and corporate partners’ representation. That new
clause was resisted by the previous Government, who did not want

present Government, with a Liberal Democrat Minister, have put in the

this country before. If there is one way to ensure that employees can
have a voice in a company in the future, it is to give them a share of
that company in the future—something that Labour Members refused
to do when they were in government, even last year, when they had the
previous Postal Services Bill and the opportunity to do so. Therefore I
have to say, in response to their warm words about having workers as
board members and how fantastic an idea that would be, that they never
did that when they were in government, that they opposed it when Labour
Members put it forward, and that we have a proposal to deliver on the
force of that idea far more effectively. They did not do that in
government. I wonder whether they will oppose employee shares for

its shareholders, including the employee shareholders, who under our

dictated to by the Government, and it will not be set permanently in

flexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
this debate, Labour Members have referred to what Richard Hooper told
the Committee when he gave evidence on 11 November. It was interesting
that they did not read out the full answer that he gave on that
question to my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford, because at the end
of his answer, Richard Hooper
said:<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
suspect that the answer to your question is that when you are preparing
Royal Mail for privatisation, you need quite a lot of flexibility. I
think that if there are too many rules around it, those people who are
finding buyers will have more
difficulty.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Postal
Services Public Bill Committee, </em>11 November 2010; c. 116,

                        </p>
                        <p>Having
considered the proposal about having workers on the board, as my hon.
Friend invited him to, Richard Hooper basically said,
“Don’t put it in the legislation. Leave it up to the
company. Leave it up to the shareholders.” That is exactly what
we intend to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I come to the part of amendment 16 that would require a majority vote
by employees before a relevant disposal could be made. Again, that
would be highly unusual. It looks like another attempt by the
Opposition to put a barrier in the way of addressing Royal
Mail’s concerns. It should be for the shareholders of any
company to decide on a change of ownership. They own the company, and
they should decide on that. In this case, the Government are the sole
shareholder of Royal Mail, and we believe that it is in the
interests  of the company and the taxpayer to facilitate an
issue or disposal of shares that will allow an injection of private
sector capital and disciplines into the company in the way that we
propose. The idea that the matter should be put to an employee vote
does not make sense at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
17 and 18 would add a requirement for additional parliamentary
approval, either through a super-affirmative procedure or an
affirmative procedure, before shares could be disposed of or issued.
Such a requirement is not necessary. We are now in the process of
scrutinising the Bill, which contains a package of measures that we
should be debating. Those measures secure the future of the Royal Mail,
and they are what the Committee and the House need to decide.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is right
that the power to enable the Secretary of State to dispose of shares in
the Royal Mail company should be considered alongside the other two
parts of the package in the Bill—tackling the pension deficit
and reforming the regulatory regime. The Opposition would have us
separate those two issues, although Richard Hooper emphasised in his
evidence last week that none of the measures he proposed in his
report—whether the one for the previous Government or the update
for this Government—should be taken in isolation. They are part
of a package. Interestingly, if we look at the Postal Services Bill of
2009—I make no apology for coming back to that, because it was
only last year and it was a Labour Bill—Labour included no such
mechanism. There was no such time-consuming mechanism in that
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Additional
parliamentary processes would create enormous uncertainty for potential
investors, as I discussed a few moments ago. Any uncertainty would
reduce the value of the business and, ultimately, undermine the
prospects for selling the company. We cannot support that position. I
am therefore surprised that Labour Members wish to delay the time at
which the Secretary of State should report to Parliament on the
proposed sale of Royal Mail. The clause requires the Secretary of State
to report to Parliament as “soon as” he has decided that
the sale process should be launched. The amendments would leave the
Secretary of State waiting until new investors had been
identified.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
15 would require—as would proposed new subsection (2)(f) of
amendment 16—the Secretary of State to introduce a further Bill
empowering him to dispose of the Royal Mail. As I said earlier, that is
not
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
was some discussion about whether the process of the Secretary of State
reporting to the House should be set down—whether he should make
an oral statement or how he should report. I refer hon. Members to the
Bill, which, if read carefully, can be seen to be giving Parliament a
particularly good role. We are not saying that the Secretary of State
should report only once. If there are different tranches of
sales—if a minority stake is sold, then further shares in
future—on each occasion, we are suggesting, the Secretary of
State should lay a report before the House. That is a
super-accountability, compared with what we have seen in the past, and
therefore meets all the concerns of the
Opposition.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
absurdity of the idea that we should stipulate in legislation that the
report should be made by an oral statement is shown by envisaging a
situation in which the Secretary of State decides at a particular point
in the whole process that he wants to put 100 shares or 1,000 shares
into an employee share trust, as part of a number of different parts of
the transaction. If we stipulated an oral statement, the Secretary of
State would have to come to the House and make an oral statement about
a relatively minor part of a process. That would be completely
inappropriate and waste parliamentary time—were it to happen,
the Opposition would no doubt be complaining. We therefore do not
intend to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, we need to proceed quickly with the process. The proposed
amendments would achieve the opposite. They are not in the interests of
the taxpayer or of Royal Mail, and I urge the hon. Member for Ochil and
South Perthshire to withdraw the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000128">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
was glad to hear that the hon. Member for Angus has sympathy for our
argument. As I tried to say earlier, although amendment 16 may not be
perfect, we have given the Minister an opportunity to take it, or parts
of it, away and return with Government amendments on Report to increase
the transparency. We heard from him a few moments ago that he has no
intention of doing so, and why does that not surprise
me?<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the issue of the headquarters, the fears of the hon. Member for Angus
are important. Yes, we want to see the headquarters of Royal Mail, a UK
organisation and company, in the UK, but we also want to see the
management functions of Royal Mail below the headquarters be retained
within the United Kingdom. I alluded to that when I tried to draw the
steps of employee progress through Royal Mail—how employees
could work up the ladder, as many have done. That would be much more
achievable if not only the HQ, but the operational divisions of
management structures, were held within the United Kingdom.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull East, who is not in his seat
at the moment, again supported the amendment. I am glad that he felt
that it would strengthen the Bill in many ways. My hon. Friends, to a
man and a woman, feel that. We do not agree with the Minister on the
level of transparency in the Bill. As the Bill stands, we do not think
that it is particularly burdensome on the Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000132">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Llanelli spoke well about our intentions
regarding the Bill and the advantages of work force representation on
the board. That would give a level of transparency in
employee-management relationships, which is again lacking in the Bill
as it stands. I made a point in an intervention. We are talking about a
communications company here, and we think that there should be an
extremely good set of communications within it, from the top management
right down to the shop floor. Having one or two representatives of the
work force on the board would achieve that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000133">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend also mentioned the issue of the HQ in the UK, and how the
National Federation of SubPostmasters has been lobbying for it. It is
important to know—I intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for
Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland on this point—that people
want to retain not only the HQ of Royal Mail in the United Kingdom, as
it is now, but Royal Mail in public ownership, which is contrary to
what the Minister stood for in the election a few short months
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On democracy
and the need for a ballot, the Minister sees the amendment as a major
set of hurdles. In some ways, he has himself to blame, because in the
evidence session, he threw a challenge down above the hoops that we
expected him to jump through. He said earlier—from a sedentary
position, I think—that we have excelled his expectations. The
purpose of the amendments is not to put him through the wringer, but to
improve the quality of the Bill, and we feel that each
amendment—16, 17, 18 and 15—would do that; we are talking
about 16 at the moment.

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
16 would give a degree of accountability and transparency. The Minister
persistently refers to the 2009 Bill, but it did not propose selling
off 100% of Royal Mail or putting Royal Mail out of state or public
control. This Bill, however, as we have heard, will put Royal Mail 100%
into private hands. That is why there needs to be a level of scrutiny
in preparation for that happening. Let us not confuse ourselves about
what we are discussing. We are discussing the level of scrutiny on the
deal that is on the table, which will sell Royal Mail. We are not
discussing the level of scrutiny that has got us to this stage of the
Bill. No one can doubt that there has been a degree of consultation,
with Hooper’s reports in 2008 and 2010. We are discussing what
happens when there is an offer on the table that the Secretary of State
wants to accept and sell Royal Mail to whoever it
is.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000136">&#160;</a>

am grateful for the support of my hon. Friend the Member for
Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland. He spoke well about employee
representation, and I bow to his superior knowledge of such matters,
which is drawn from his previous life as a union representative. We all
agree that employee representation would be a significant benefit to
the work force. During my earlier remarks, Mr Amess, when Mr Hood was
in the Chair, I floated the possibility of not only, as the amendment
states, having employee representation, but having consumer
representation on the board. My hon. Friend picked that up and ran with
it. That level of interaction would be significantly beneficial to the
company. It would show that this is a communications company that is
intent on communicating.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000137">&#160;</a>

remarks, the Minister took us back to yesterday and the Red Bull
speeding-through amendments. There is nothing that the Minister should
have been frightened about in yesterday’s amendments, because
all he had to do was come back and revise the sunset clause. We were
not saying, “You must go away and do that.” If the
Minister had wanted to go away at that point in time, we would have
rejoiced with him. At that time, the control to accept the sunset
clause and still sell Royal Mail was firmly in the Minister’s
hands. The Minister will not be surprised that I am disappointed with
his
remarks.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000138">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 273<a class="bkMark" name="Column273">&#160;</a>
                           </div>amendment would need to introduce a new Bill. We feel that the amendment
is needed to scrutinise the deal that is on the table at that point of
time. That would put the desire to sell on a solid footing. We are
sorry to see the Minister disagreeing with the headquarters aspect of
the amendment, which is fundamental to retaining the UK identity of
Royal Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister took us back to previous privatisations, but my hon. Friend
the Member for Telford intervened and made the point that the Minister
does not grasp the cultural significance of Royal Mail to people in the
UK. The tax scam that the Minister suggested was at the base of our
amendments was a jovial aside. The introduction by the hon. Member for
Angus on the issue of langoustines—I bet nobody imagined that we
would have got langoustines into this debate—showed how a
perishable good can be taken to the other side of the world and back in
24 hours. If that can be done with langoustines, it can be done with
letters. Who knows what the future will bring, but we will remember the
Minister’s words today if and when our letters start to be
sorted somewhere
else.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
need for consultation concerns consultation on the deal, as I have
said, and not consultation on the process to get sales. We feel that
the employees’ representative on the board is important, because
of the way in which the Royal Mail will be held—I have made the
point about 100% of Royal Mail being sold into private hands under the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will be quick in winding up, because I know that we want to make
progress. I was interested to hear the Minister say that the Royal Mail
might think that that is a good idea. If so, why not do it now and save
Royal Mail the bother, time and effort, as I am sure that it has other
things to worry about? The Minister discussed flexibility, but I have
offered him significant flexibility in the drafting of the amendment
and in my
contribution.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000146">&#160;</a>

Minister did not even take up my kind offer of amendments 17 and 18,
which would be far less onerous than amendment 16, but which still
provide for scrutiny of the sale. That disappoints me, because it is
clear that he does not want any scrutiny of the deal that is put on the
table to buy Royal Mail. He tried to convince us that the need to lay a
report—or reports if there is a staged sell-off—is
transparency enough. I remind him of his response to my hon. Friend the
Member for Telford in the evidence session, which showed that the Bill
is not strong enough on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000147">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The words with which the amendment is concerned
are brief: “a” and “the”. They may seem
absolutely trivial, but behind those small words is an enormous
difference. It is the difference between selling off the whole package
and
cherry-picking.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
question is why anyone would want to cherry-pick and have bits of the
Royal Mail and not other bits. One might ask why that matters if the
whole thing is going to be privatised anyway. The reason is that some
bits are more attractive and offer better returns. We might find that
the bit that is the most difficult to dispose of is that which is most
closely linked to the universal service obligation. Clearly, the more
of an obligation one has and the more conditions one has to fulfil, the
more difficult it is to race away and make large profits. The real
danger is that, if we split up Royal Mail and allow cherry-picking, we
might end up with the Royal Mail letter service as we know
it—the service that is most familiar to us—being under
the most pressure. This morning, we talked at length about the very
important role of the universal service obligation to the provision of
a personal service right across the country at a uniform, affordable
price. We should, therefore, resist any idea of
cherry-picking.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
may be of interest to hon. Members to know a bit about the components
of Royal Mail. Many people in this country may not have heard of
General Logistics Systems, the arm of Royal Mail operating in
continental Europe. That business has a very attractive look, partly
because it works in markets that do not come under the same types of
regulation—there are fewer obligations to have to fulfil. It is
an attractive prospect. It handles more than 1 million parcels a day,
and it has a network of 667 depots and 29 central transhipment points,
with 16,000 delivery vehicles and 1,700 long-distance trucks. Its core
operation is business-to-business parcel deliveries, and it has 220,000
customers in 34 states across Europe. In the financial year 2009-10, it
delivered 345 million parcels, and had revenues of €1.7 billion.
It is an important organisation, and it forms a large part of the
success of Royal Mail Group. It would also be ripe for cherry-picking,
which would be allowed under the clause as it
stands.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000176">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">GLS
is extremely proud of its quality and its service. Its philosophy is
one of having a united European-wide team spirit, with decentralised
decision making in line with local market demands. In other words, it
operates

                           </div>flexibly across 34 countries, trying to meet business customers’
requirements in the best possible way. It is very proud of its security
record, and of how its carriers take all sorts of precious and valuable
items across the length and breadth of Europe. It is also proud of its
reliability, and of its ensuring that every package should arrive on
time. It tries to focus on each customer’s individualised needs,
and it wants to do exactly what the customer wants. In dealing with
large business customers, large volumes are often involved, which helps
it to make appropriate and profitable deals. It states that it is
transparent in what it does. The way it expresses that  is
strange—it refers to people’s parcels being
“transparent” —but that means that people
can track where the parcel is and what is being done, which keeps them
informed. It is flexible, being able to respond to all sorts of demands
right across Europe, and it provides the customised packages that
people have come to
expect.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000177">&#160;</a>

many respects, GLS is a bargain. As I have said, many people in the
country may not even be aware that it is part of Royal Mail, that
splendid institution which we are seeking to protect. If Royal Mail has
to be hived off as a privatised organisation, we do not want to see it
split up into tiny fractions. As I have mentioned, GLS, for those who
have not remembered, stands for General Logistics Systems—it
likes to tell us that it stands for “European Leader in
Quality”, but I have not fixed those initials to the letters
GLS. It is an attractive offer, which could be part of a cherry-picking
operation.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000178">&#160;</a>

shall move on to Parcelforce, another component part of Royal Mail.
Again, it has a different market from Royal Mail’s, which we
tend to understand as the letter service in our country. It links into
Europe and does not have the degree of regulation under the universal
service obligation that our letter service has.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000179">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Parcelforce
has had some good press recently: only a fortnight ago, it posted a 14%
rise in its operating profit to £8 million for the six months
ending on 26 September. Its turnover increased by 3%, from £191
million to  £197 million for the first half of
2009.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000180">&#160;</a>

said:<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Despite
difficult trading conditions in its highly competitive and unregulated
market, Parcelforce achieved growth.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000287">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is not just a
blip, because in the year up to May, it also revealed that its turnover
had remained static at £399 million, but that its operating
profit had risen 41% to £17 million, from £12 million
during the 12 months to 31 March. That is a pleasing report and will
make Parcelforce very attractive to buyers. That interest is not only
theoretical, however, because we have heard some of the competitor
companies lining up to say that they would be very interested indeed in
considering the purchase of Parcelforce. There are a number of rivals
to Royal Mail Group who are very likely to snap up Parcelforce. It is
profitable and has a wide customer base, which will be extremely
attractive to many parcel carriers. That is not a fantasy of Opposition
Members; customers might line up to buy certain parts of Royal Mail but
not be interested in other parts. As ever, if such cherry-picking takes
place it could be more difficult to get a sensible purchase, by which I
mean an appropriate purchase to get the best possible deal for the
taxpayer. We might be left with a difficult situation in which the
goodies have been taken and there is nothing much left.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000182">&#160;</a>

turn a loss-making business into a profitable one. That is exactly what

                           </strong> As we have said before, we are looking at what
is in front of us and we are talking about very different situations.
We are talking about part Government ownership and complete
privatisation. If I go back to my original point, we are talking about
the effect on the universal service obligation of what might be left,
and that is the problem. It is not about a viable operation that could
be sold off. The problem is that, whereas before there might have been
a stronger Government guarantee about the universal service obligation,
we know that a privatised market would put huge pressure on the
regulator to push back the boundaries a little bit, and that is why the
situation is
different.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000185">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> To be absolutely clear, in the 2009 Bill it was not
the case that Parcelforce could be part-privatised. The 2009 Bill would
have allowed the whole of Parcelforce to be sold
off.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000186">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> But that is exactly the point. When I talk about
the 50%, I am talking about the effect of the universal service
obligation on the part of the service that we all know
about—having our letters delivered at home. If we get rid of a
very successful part of that operation, it is what is left that
matters. Under the previous Bill, there would have been considerably
more Government influence on what was left, because of majority
Government ownership. If we get rid of Government ownership and fully
privatise, there is even less opportunity to influence. We have a
regulator, but when regulators deal with a privatised monopoly, they
are constantly under pressure: “Do you want higher prices or do
you want to get rid of Saturday delivery?” We can hear those
questions being asked almost as soon as privatisation takes
place.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000187">&#160;</a>

that under the restrictions on ownership of both Parcelforce and
GLS—there are no restrictions on GLS, as I am sure the hon. Lady
knows—the successful parts of Royal Mail Group could have been
sold off. The state would have been left to deal with the more
problematic part of losses being made and volumes going down, and would
have got rid of the profit-making parts where volumes were going up.
Will the hon. Lady admit that that was rather an odd position for the
previous Government to
take?<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000188">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Actually, quite the opposite. It is the falling
mail volumes that make it difficult to make a letter service viable and
profitable, even though a lot of changes have taken place in Royal
Mail, which is carrying

customer and what the customer gets in terms of the universal service
provision. It is not unreasonable to want to keep that part, which is
so crucial to the lifeblood of the length and breadth of our country,
particularly rural communities. It is reasonable to guarantee a
universal service obligation. Keeping the problematic bit in majority
Government ownership would mean that we would have a much better
opportunity to ensure that it would not be allowed to
fail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000189">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Difficulty
arises if the business is privatised. It would be a tremendous shame to
split it up when, quite clearly, pressure would be on the letter
service to try to increase profits even more. Again, pressure would be
on the regulator when asked about moving back the boundaries, or to
give in a little here and there. We have already seen permission given
for a first class stamp to go up to 46p, so we can see the direction of
travel. If Royal Mail is to be sold off, it would be helpful to the
letters part of the service if there were a little help and support
from the other parts of the package so that it moves forward completely
and there is less pressure on the regulator to send prices sky-high and
get rid of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000190">&#160;</a>

Worldwide is part of the Royal Mail Group. It is a leading provider of
a full range of services, including a guaranteed delivery at certain
times on certain days. It uses a network of international partners to
extend its reach way beyond the UK to 99.6% of the world population,
which is pretty good. Its European delivery partners include General
Logistics Systems and the E Parcel Group. It delivers 210,000 parcels a
day and operates in three distinct markets. It works with
business-to-business services such as the transportation of parcels and
supplies from one company or commercial venture to another. For
example, a manufacturer could be sending to a wholesaler or a
wholesaler could be sending to a retailer, services that are likely to
be repeat orders to restock a supply chain. It is a different type of
service from the birthday card or the Christmas card market, which
varies significantly. By that, I mean clearly defined, high-volume and

of the Committee heard of the dreadful word “e-tailers”?
It means that we are all buying more things not from the famous
catalogue that used to be delivered to the doorstep by the lady down
the road, but from the pictures on the internet. I am sure that hon.
Members will be interested to know that the items used to be things
like DVDs and books, but now they are clothes. There is a growing
market for people just to click on to the internet, as a result of
which the parcels that come to the doorstep might be bigger and heavier
than they were. Apparently, that is a growing market and those who know

realised that it needed to

to increasing competition and changes in the external environment. It
decided that it needed to refine and reposition the product called
“international datapost,” a service that covered the
urgent, very fast delivery and the deferred, medium-speed categories of
its delivery
range.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000193">&#160;</a>

Worldwide decided that it would differentiate between different types
of users, those who want something instantly the next day and must have
it by a certain time as quickly as possible and those who want
reliability but do not necessarily need the item by the next day. Of
course, people have different ideas about price. Some will pay a
premium if they want to ensure that their particular item arrives on
time, while others will prefer to pay the lower price as long as the
item arrives safety and will organise themselves appropriately.
Clearly, the company was looking at ways in which to improve the
service so that it takes a juicier share of the
profits.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000194">&#160;</a>

us to the more familiar point, which is our Royal Mail Group. We all
know about the letters and packages business, which covers the whole UK
with a one-price-goes-anywhere universal service. That is something
that Royal Mail is proud of, and something that we, as customers,
consumers and their representatives, want. We are proud of the fact
that there are 115,000 post-boxes around the country. I wonder whether
they are going to remain red if Royal Mail is privatised, or whether
they will become blue and yellow, with a large blue stripe and a thin
yellow stripe. The Minister has to have some credit, has he not? Having
post boxes painted after him has to be a legacy worth going
for.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000203">&#160;</a>

number of mail centres, depending on how far down the modernisation

must be another opportunity for a badge, a logo or a stripe—the
Ozymandias legacy that the Minister is obviously
seeking.
<p class="tabbed">We know all
about the technological, “Beam me up, Scotty” stuff, but
these parcel deliverers can still keep in the market, because people
cannot magick parcels from A to B. There are plenty of ways to get
messages through, such as simply speaking on the telephone, sending a
text message or e-mailing, and we know the difficulties that that has
thrown up for the service.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000204">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Essentially,
Royal Mail is the most vulnerable service, because it has to provide
the greatest chunk of its resources for the universal service provision
to ensure that 28 million homes have a postal service that turns up
regularly, six days a week, and offers a uniform, affordable price for
items to be sent right across the UK. That is why my hon. Friend the

everything is shattered into smithereens, people pick up the bits that
they want, and the bit that needs most help and support—the bit
that is most threatened—is left. That bit is then hived off to
the private sector, which might desperately think that it needs to do
some extra profit-making to meet its universal service obligations,
which would put more strain on the regulator. The consequence of such a
situation may be that we lose our services. That is why we have taken

to focus on the use of the indefinite article in clause 2. There may be
an entirely logical explanation for referring to “a Royal Mail

may be that the clause is written in that way to ensure that if the
Royal Mail changes its name—I am sure we all remember its
short-lived branding as Consignia—it would still be subject to
the provisions and definitions in the clause. As I say, there may be a
perfectly rational explanation for the use of the indefinite rather
than the definite article. It may be entirely innocent, but the
unintended consequences of the designation “a Royal Mail
company” in the clause might be profound. Reference to the
issuing of shares in “a Royal Mail company”—or
Royal Mail Group, I should say—allows this or a future
Government, in the form of the Secretary of State, to engage in the
potential asset-stripping of Royal Mail, which is a
danger.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ministers
have insisted that making shares available in Royal Mail is for the
purpose of attracting capital to Royal Mail as a whole. The Secretary
of State for Business, Innovation and Skills said in the debate on the
Bill on 27
October:<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
problems that Royal Mail faces can be addressed through the Bill. After
all, it is the only company with the ability to visit all 28 million
addresses on a daily basis. It has an unrivalled customer base, and it
can build on its position as the leading provider of letters and
parcels by providing a new range of digital products for its customers.
The Bill is the only way that we can make  that positive future
a reality.”—[<em>Official Report</em>, 27 October 2010;

                        </p>
                        <p>However,
the usage in clause 2(5) of the indefinite article—as in
“a Royal Mail company”—makes it possible for him
to split up Royal Mail. Such a split would destroy Royal Mail’s
ability to build on what he called its position as the leading provider
of letters and
parcels.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
most profitable bits of Royal Mail’s business, such as its
European parcels business, to which my hon. Friend the Member for
Llanelli referred, might be sold off separately. That would certainly
please the Treasury, I suspect. It is possible that the use of the
indefinite article in clause 2 is the policy of the Treasury. We all
know that it is a formidable institution. By its own lights, it
promotes prudence, caution and economy, but by definition its focus is
short-term. Its interest in the Bill will be in maximising its
short-term sales receipts. I do not complain about that, as it is what
the Treasury does, but the Committee must take that potential Treasury
interest into account in assessing the clause. Assuredly, the
Treasury’s interest is not to ensure that Royal Mail remains a
public utility of strategic importance. At least, that is not likely to
be its primary interest, which is usually to maximise receipts. As that
is its overriding concern, one can envisage a scenario in which
profitable parts of Royal Mail, such as Parcelforce UK and GLS, the
European parcels wing, are sold off separately, with the proceeds
going—guess where?—to the
Exchequer.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Just
so that the Committee is clear about the precise danger that I am
alerting it to, it is worth recapping the structure of Royal Mail
Group. We know that it was split into several businesses—Royal
Mail, Post Office Ltd, managing post office retail outlets, Parcelforce
Worldwide and GLS. In the round, Royal Mail Group

and chairman of Royal Mail, we know that the industrial weakness of
Royal Mail Group has been or seems to have been exaggerated. That was
my interpretation of the evidence given by the expert witnesses last

                        <p>To me,
there is a fundamental point there. From the evidence that we have
heard, full privatisation is not a technical requirement. It is a
political decision. That emerged from the evidence of both Moya Greene
and Richard Hooper. No one disputes Royal Mail’s need for
additional capital. No evidence that the Committee has heard, however,
has explained why that can only be achieved by full privatisation. No
evidence that the Committee has heard explains why this capital could
not be raised by either the sale of equity in Royal Mail, given the
profitable arms to which we have referred, or the issuing of bonds.
More pertinently, the first line of clause 2(5) and clause 2(5)(a), as
they are written, could be used—I am sure this is not the
Minister’s intention, but unintended consequences are what I am
discussing—to break up Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000218">&#160;</a>

point I made earlier in an intervention on his speech—the clause

                           </strong> I take the Minister’s point. It seems to
me that the report is of some importance, since I suspect that the
report will play a role in how the Minister and the Government
proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000220">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
I want
to briefly set out a scenario. If the Government happened to be short
of money—they tell us ad nauseam that they are—they could
sell off the profitable parts of a Royal Mail group. Such a sale, given
that they are the profitable parts, would possibly generate healthy
sales receipts for the Chancellor. I accept that that is not the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 282<a class="bkMark" name="Column282">&#160;</a>
                        </div>Government’s intention and that the Minister and the Secretary of
State have good intentions, but in politics, intentions change. More
importantly, good intentions only take you so far. In
politics—let us be clear, this is about politics—it is
consequences that matter. The Minister is clearly a very well read man.
I wonder whether he has ever read Weber’s “Politics as a
Vocation”. The greatest sociologist of them all was clear that
politics should be about consequences. To stand up and say, “I
have good intentions; I mean well. We are doing this for the right
reasons,” does not have traction when history comes to be
written.<p class="tabbed">I
am worried that a staggered break-up of Royal Mail is a possibility.
More importantly, such a staggered break-up would make it more
difficult to finance the universal service. Why do I say that? I say
that simply because, the more that Royal Mail is broken down, the more
financially significant the universal service becomes as a burden on
the remaining assets. That is why the Bill also contains clauses that
allow a potentially shrunken Royal Mail to apply for a reduction in the
universal service. If we look at clause 28(3), clause 33, clause 42 and
clause 43, you can see the provision for a potentially shrunken Royal
Mail applying for a reduction in universal service.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000221">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In such a
scenario, the Bill is likely to produce a situation where the Dutch
integrated mail and post office business, TNT, or the integrated German
business, Deutsche Post, will take all or part of Royal Mail’s
business. The post office network could be shrunk in order to make
those Royal Mail businesses more profitable in the short term. That
gives rise to a horrible irony. Profits from UK business will be used
to cross-subsidise the protected post office network in Germany and the
Netherlands. The Governments in those countries decided to encourage
those businesses to operate on a global
basis—absolutely—but they did not think that it should be
at the expense of Dutch and German citizens. They passed laws to make
sure that their universal service, including the post office network,
had legislative
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister previously said to me—I have had a few discussions
about this—that such protection for the post office network
would be socialist over-regulation. I believe that his view amounts to
a Thatcherite overreaction. For those reasons, we must amend
“a” Royal Mail company to “the” Royal Mail
company.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ministers say
that the changes are necessary to preserve the whole Royal Mail
business. If that is true, the indefinite article is superfluous,
whether in a report or otherwise. If Ministers are being careless about
unintended consequences, we should oblige them to alter their position.
Breaking up Royal Mail will diminish its ability to become the
competitor that the Bill is ostensibly designed to create. Breaking up
Royal Mail also reduces the ability of the company to finance the
universal service. We must make sure that such an outcome is
impossible. That is why I support amendments 19, 20 and 21, tabled in

                        <p>Perhaps
if he were sitting on the Government Benches in Committee today, and if
he had finished his constituency casework, he would perhaps be writing,
“To see a Bill in a single word.” We would know what he
meant because we are talking about the word, or indeed the letter,
“a”. The impact of the use of the word “a”
in relation to the clause under consideration is substantial, as we
have already heard in contributions from Labour members of the
Committee. The Bill allows the Secretary of State—perhaps I
should say “a” Secretary of State—to dispose of
shares in “a” Royal Mail company. Whereas the Bill
clearly makes reference to the selling off of shares in
“a” Royal Mail company, the Conservative manifesto made
no such representation on sell-off. The Lib Dem manifesto did. It said
that the Lib Dems would sell off 49% of shares in Royal Mail, and that
the other 51% would be divided between an employee trust and the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000227">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have heard much about the sell-off. Indeed, the Minister has been
desperately trying to defend why he is now selling off all of Royal
Mail. We are now clear, from the contributions that have been made on
the issue, that if the Bill is passed, 0% of shares—a big, fat
nothing—will be owned by the Government. That is a number
usually attributed on a Saturday afternoon to the football results of
Alloa Athletic in Scotland. I hasten to say not now, as Mr Mulraney has
given the club a new direction; I suppose the plastic pitch helps a
little bit, too. Royal Mail will be owned outwith the Government, who
will own nothing. That could be as much as 50.99% less than the
Minister promised in his
manifesto.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the issue of selling some shares, the Minister has at least been
consistent, unlike his Conservative colleagues. As I have already said,
the coalition document has 18 words in it, but nothing
related to the sale of Royal Mail. I guess the Minister has
flip-flopped again. He stood in May on a manifesto to sell off some of
Royal Mail, supports a coalition document that does not mention selling
off Royal Mail, and then delivers a Bill that sells off all of Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill, as it stands, will allow the Secretary of State, or dare I say, a
Secretary of State, to engage in a random sell-off of Royal Mail, in a
way that my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and
Kirkintilloch East has referred to as asset-stripping. I am sure that
this, to use another set of words from my hon. Friend, is an unintended
consequence of the Bill, and that the Minister will quickly understand
our constructive approach on the matter and accept the amendments.
However, if not, perhaps he will be able to tell the Committee what
input the Treasury has had in the wording of the Bill, as my hon.
Friend has alluded to. It appears to us that the way the Bill is worded
may encourage asset-stripping. We fear that the Treasury may be behind
that objective, and that perhaps the Minister is not even in control of
his own Bill. The Treasury’s best interest may not always be the
country’s best interest, which I think was also a point made by
my hon. Friend. Many people will recognise that short-term gain is not
always the best outcome.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000230">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Again, under
the Bill as it is currently drafted, the Secretary of State or—I
do not mean to try your patience, Mr Amess—a Secretary of State
will be able to sell off or asset-strip the best and most profitable
parts of Royal Mail. I believe that we possibly heard something in
preparation for that very issue when the Minister referred to it in
Committee. I quote his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for
Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We

                        </p>
                        <p>Let
us analyse his words, because they could mean a lot in practice. It
could mean the part privatisation of a section, or all of, the Royal
Mail Group, but it could also mean the complete selling off of one of
the companies within the group. Members will know, as we have heard,
that Royal Mail Holdings plc is split into four businesses—Royal
Mail, Post Office Ltd, Parcelforce and GLS. All are of varying sizes
and have varying assets, revenue and profits, making some very
interesting in the eyes  of private UK and private foreign
investors, but others less
so.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Royal
Mail has revenue of £6.5 billion and a profit of £121
million. It employs more than 155,000 staff. The GLS business has
revenue of almost £1.5 billion, with a profit of £112
million, and it employs 12,000 staff. The Parcelforce business has
revenue of £399 million with a profit of £17 million and
employs more than 4,000 people. Last but not least, the Post
Office business has revenue of £838 million, with a profit of
£72 million, and employs more than 8,000
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>The
Minister and the Committee will note that those are large numbers in
terms of both revenue and employment. He should note especially that
all four arms of Royal Mail Holdings are in profit. As the hon.
Gentleman has led me to think, the Bill could mean the selling-off of
Parcelforce and 4,500 UK employees. It could mean the selling-off of
its £399 million revenue and its profits of £17
million.<h4 class="hs_Timeline">3.15

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">Indeed
the competition is already sniffing around, with its comments of
interest in Parcelforce not difficult to locate. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Llanelli said, it is worth remembering why Parcelforce is of
such interest to its competitors. Yes, it is profitable, but that was
not always the case. In 2002, Parcelforce was making a loss, and I want
to take the Committee through some of the important steps that it made.
In response to that loss, those managing the business decided to change
the type of service it offered. Instead of unguaranteed parcel
deliveries, typically taking between two and four days, which all of us
can remember, Parcelforce decided to focus on time and day guaranteed,
express delivery. That resulted in an increased value of each delivery
and an increase in operational efficiency. Parcelforce adopted a
customer-oriented approach designed to attract and retain key
customers. That can be seen when, during the exam season, Parcelforce
regularly delivers millions of exam papers, scripts and
coursework.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Interestingly,
Parcelforce was also the first express carrier in the UK to give its
customers the option of sending their parcels carbon-free. In June
2006, Parcelforce introduced an automated customer information line
that allowed customers to track parcels and change 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 285<a class="bkMark" name="Column285">&#160;</a>
                           </div>delivery arrangements by phone on a 24-hour, no-queue basis. Automated
information was one of the first such services in the
UK’s logistics express industry to provide personalised
information, using advanced speech recognition and caller
identification technologies to recognise repeat callers, anticipate
their information requests and offer personalised information about
their particular parcels. Why was that so significant? It was a massive
change to the business plan, and a change that was made to a company in
public sector ownership. If we ever need an example of how a public
sector company can change, we just have to look to Parcelforce. I am
sure, as my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli said, that many
companies would be keen to get their hands on Parcelforce’s
network of two hubs, 47 depots and 1,800 red
vehicles.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the Bill and the Minister’s words could also mean the selling
off of GLS, which as I said earlier, employs more than 12,000 people

                           </strong> I take the Minister’s point, but we are
arguing that there is a need to retain Royal Mail in its entirety. As
and when it is sold, we want to preserve other parts of the Royal Mail
business as there is a dramatic need to make sure that its very
profitable parts are retained within the group. Perhaps the hon.
Gentleman will tell us which part it will be—GLS or Parcelforce?
If he raises significant capital selling off those parts of Royal Mail,
is it his intention to sell “the” Royal Mail? Does he see
the break-up of Royal Mail as I have described as a problem or a
solution to securing universal
service?<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
preserve “the” Royal Mail, amendments 19 and 20 must be
accepted; otherwise we are trying to protect “a” Royal
Mail, which we know nothing about. Breaking up Royal Mail Holdings plc
places the ability of “the” Royal Mail to provide and
finance a universal service under significant
threat.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
members of the Committee might be puzzled by our deliberations on the
amendments, but we are trying to highlight the fact that
“a” and “the” are extremely important words
and the amendments would prevent the profitable parts of Royal Mail
Holdings from being stripped away while the less profitable parts are
left to wither on the vine. The real question must be, why do the
Government want to relinquish a controlling share in a profitable
company? Let us be clear that all parts of Royal Mail are
profitable.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000240">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With regard
to clause 2, why would the Government want to create a situation in
which their actions allow cherry-picking, which would damage what is
left of the business? Royal Mail’s strength in preserving the
aspirations of its customers is dependent on the strength of the
operation as a whole. That is why we are pressing the Minister, why we
pressed him on Tuesday and why we will do so again, to deliver a 10 or
15-year inter-business agreement between the Post Office and Royal
Mail. The Government fail to recognise that that interdependency means
a lot. As has been said before in the Committee, it means that even
with declining letter volumes there are opportunities for other Royal
Mail holding companies 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 286<a class="bkMark" name="Column286">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to grow their business. The erosion of letter volumes in itself,
ironically, delivers greater opportunity for parcel delivery, as people
utilise e-commerce, which can deliver even greater security to our post
offices, as we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for
Llanelli.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000241">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
Richard Hooper said during our oral evidence sessions, with his
“Beam me up, Scotty” reference—I fear that it will
be repeated numerous times during our proceedings—until we
invent a means of teleportation, there will always be “great
opportunities for Royal Mail”. He said that there would be great
opportunities for Royal Mail, not Parcel Force. I wonder whether that
was a coded message to the Minister to be careful and ensure that he
does not take action that would damage the optimism that he expressed
by allowing cherry-picking. That is what my hon. Friends and I are
attempting to achieve with the amendments. I leave it to them
and  to Government Members to determine whether our proposals
have Mr Hooper’s
support.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
essence, if the most profitable parts of any business are taken away,
the less profitable parts will drag the remainder under. In Royal
Mail’s case, the company needs its parcel arm and its General
Logistics Service arm to support its universal provision. That is what
we must retain, as my hon. Friends and I have
argued.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000243">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I believe that our amendments would increase the likelihood of the UK
retaining a single business that provides a universal postal service.
In doing so, we are more likely to preserve the relationship between
users and service delivery in a way that would allow the brand to
continue to represent the whole UK, rather than just a bit here and a
bit there. We believe that that is very important as things stand
today.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000244">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In closing, I
will return to where I started, with William Blake. He is now seen as a
romantic, but he was considered to be mad by many of his
contemporaries. Perhaps some will see a likeness between him and me,
but I would prefer that they did not publicise whether that comparison
was drawn because of the romantic element or the mad one. During his
lifetime, the British postal network grew and developed, and I trust
that he would not want to see that damaged by a Bill that was defined
by a single letter, a tool of his craft. I urge the Minister to listen
to the case and make the right decision. We will then all know that he
is not mad either, but really a romantic who wants to preserve Royal
Mail for the people of the United
Kingdom.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000245">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have decided that this group of amendments should
be called the indefinite amendments, not simply because the hon. Member

have, and therefore why we cannot accept them. I will then respond to
the debate, although I think that most of it did not focus on the
amendments. In the spirit of scrutiny, discussion and debate I am happy
to deal with the speeches of the Opposition even though they were not
necessarily related to the amendments. I say that just as an
observation, not to carp.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000247">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As I have said
before, the Government want to maintain flexibility for the structure
of any future disposal so that they can secure the right investment for
Royal Mail and the best value for money for the taxpayer. We also want
to ensure appropriate transparency for Parliament, making sure that we
can report on how we go about the sale, and whether that includes any
restructuring. Decisions on that have not yet been
taken.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000248">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
2(5) is constructed to ensure that the report is provided to Parliament
in all potential commercial scenarios for selling shares in the Royal
Mail letters business. We want to make sure that however Royal Mail is
sold, and whatever the structure—in whatever way the transaction
is made—the Secretary of State should have to report to
Parliament on the transaction. The problem with the amendments is that
they would reduce the requirement for the Secretary of State to report
to Parliament on future disposals, and it would be very much against
our policy to accept them. It would reduce our transparency to
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
19 would significantly reduce the scope of the reporting requirement on
the Government. The clause would not be limited to one specific
company, and that is intentional. Amendment 19, however, would capture
only Royal Mail Group Ltd, which is not desirable. We want to ensure
that any of the companies could be captured.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under part 1
of the Bill the Government could decide to sell shares at the level of
the holding company, Royal Mail Holdings plc, rather than that of the
universal service provider, Royal Mail Group Ltd. That could, for
example, be done to enable the creation of tax-efficient employee share
schemes, as we heard about from ifs ProShare in our evidence sittings
last week. If the amendment were passed, the requirement for the
Secretary of State to report on a decision to undertake a relevant
disposal would not bite on all the potential transaction structures,
and would therefore reduce transparency to Parliament. I am not
convinced that that was what was intended, but it would be the effect
of the provisions, and it is why the Government cannot accept
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
to amendment 20, the reference in the clause to “a universal
postal service” is simply to ensure that the definition of a
Royal Mail company, and therefore the requirement for the Secretary of
State to report to Parliament, captures a company providing a universal
postal service. The amendment is not necessary to achieve
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Turning to
amendment 21, subsection (5)(b) would ensure that a Royal Mail company
providing a universal service would be captured by the clause 5
reporting requirement, no matter what the structure of the Royal Mail
group of companies might be before disposal. If we accepted any of the
amendments the Secretary of State might not be required to report to
Parliament when the transaction was made, because of the structure of
the transaction.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It might
be—and certainly the force of some of the speeches
indicates—that the Opposition want to prevent flexibility in the
way the Government approach the transaction and want a particular
structure for Royal Mail Holdings or Royal Mail Group Ltd to be the one
that is sold. That would be a huge mistake and would be unnecessarily
restrictive during negotiations with a potential investor or investors,
and would therefore be against the interests of Royal Mail and the
taxpayer.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000254">&#160;</a>

much aware of all the subsidiaries of Royal Mail Holdings plc and of
Royal Mail Group Ltd, and some of them have been mentioned today. The
hon. Member for Llanelli rightly explained what a profitable and
successful business GLS is. We have heard about Parcelforce and how it
has improved, although that is not unequivocally a story of profits,
unfortunately. Its last annual report shows that, in the year to 28
March 2010, Parcelforce Worldwide made the small loss of
£6 million before tax. It is not, therefore, as
successful as hon. Members were trying to paint, but I accept that it
is moving in the right
direction.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000255">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
whole point, as I said in my interventions on Labour Members, is that
they want to restrict how we structure any company that we decide to
sell, but in both the current legislation, the Postal Services Act
2000, and in the 2009 Postal Services Bill, the Labour Government
allowed itself the freedom to sell off different parts of the Royal
Mail. That would have been the case if they had their way. We do not
want to put any restrictions on how we do this, just as they did not
want to do so. We could—I am not saying that we will—sell
GLS today. We are the shareholder, and there are no restrictions on our
selling GLS, which is not mentioned in the 2000 Act. The 2009 Bill
would have put no restrictions on the sale of Parcelforce by the
previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000256">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
will have an unhelpful debate if we focus on what the law is, what it
might have been and what it is proposed to be on such restrictions. The
critical factor is to provide flexibility, so that the Government have
several options open to them and can make commercial decisions in the
interest of the taxpayer and of Royal Mail. If restrictions are placed
on the law relating to how we go about that, it would prevent our
meeting our core
objectives.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000257">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We are going about this process in a different way
from the previous Government. We  are introducing the
legislation first—sorting out the parliamentary requirements to
enable us to make  the regulatory changes—and then we
will worry about who may or may not want to buy the business. If we do
it that way, we are much more likely to get significant private capital
into the business to give Royal Mail a good future and also to get good
value for the taxpayer. If we do what the previous Government did and
try to sell and to legislate at the same time, we will make the same
mistakes as they did. We would not be able to sell Royal Mail, and we
would still have the problems that are well known to the
Committee—falling volumes, which would not be tackled by
increasing investment, and poor financial performance. We will not do
that; we will pass the legislation first, and worry about the
transaction afterwards. I do not, therefore, have anything to report to

that would cause huge problems. Let me try to deal with that and be as
helpful as I possibly can. First, we simply would not sell to a bidder,
if we believed that they were not interested and could not assist in
securing the future of the universal postal service. In the Bill and in
how we approach the transaction to meet our primary objective, we are
driven by securing the universal postal service. I repeat that that is
our primary objective. I hope that reassures Opposition

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman has anticipated where I was
going, because a number of protections in the Bill will give
reassurance to hon. Members who are worried about that. For example,
under clause 35, Ofcom has the power to impose designated USP
conditions akin to condition 16 of Royal Mail’s existing
licence. Condition 16 does not allow Royal Mail to pursue
things, such as an asset disposal or dividend payment, if doing so
would

                        <p>to
enable it to continue its business. We have a regulatory condition that
can be imposed by Ofcom and that is akin to an existing condition.
Furthermore, if Royal Mail is found to be in breach of its regulatory
obligations, Ofcom can fine it up to 10% of its annual turnover of its
postal business. If a privatised Royal Mail could not, through asset
sales, deliver on its regulatory obligation, it would face a very large
fine. Based on current turnover, a 10% fine on annual turnover would
amount to a fine of £650 million, which is a big

                           </strong> Let me deal with that straight away. Ofcom has a
fundamental duty to secure the universal service and the financial
sustainability of it. Ofcom has a number of powers that it may use in
order to meet that overriding legal duty. I hope that I have reassured
the hon. Gentleman on that
immediately.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000266">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> What concerns me slightly is whether these
conditions will be imposed from day one, because they seem to be things
that Ofcom can react to. However, if the deed has already been done, so
to speak, and the sale made, we could still be left with a
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000267">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am halfway through a list of protections that in
itself is not fully comprehensive. I have a list of protections here in
order to try to reassure hon. Members that these slight nightmares or
fantasies will just not be possible. I have talked about the
protections under clause 35 in relation to Ofcom and about the fines
that can be imposed if Royal Mail is in breach of its regulatory
obligations. Of course, there are also general company law provisions.
For example, directors of any company—Royal Mail or
otherwise—must act in a way that they consider most likely to
lead to the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a
whole. If an asset disposal dividend payment did not meet that test,
that obligation would have been breached. So there are some corporate
law
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are also some fundamental economic issues. I hope these points will
begin to satisfy the hon. Member for Angus, who does not look terribly
satisfied at the moment. Royal Mail’s debt, which we have
discussed on a number of occasions, is secured on its assets. So it is
simply not possible to transfer the assets away from the business and
its debts, which are secured on those assets. Some Opposition Members
proposed that Royal Mail could raise the capital it needs from further
debt financing. One of the problems with that is that Royal Mail has
very few assets left that are not already secured on past borrowing.
Again, that suggests that it is maxed out on security for its debt and
would therefore not be able to transfer assets in the way that has been
suggested.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are other protections. I shall give Opposition Members one more
example, if they are still not satisfied—the pensions regulator
may not allow such behaviour, because it would weaken Royal
Mail’s covenant to its pensioners. There are multiple
protections—some derive from the Bill; some derive from general
company law; some derive from pension law; and some derive from the way
in which the assets are currently secured for past borrowing. I hope
that that long list provides reassurance. Clause 2 is not quite the
bogey-man clause that has been suggested in some of the speeches. It
concerns reporting and how such a report should be made. If one puts
that aside and considers what Opposition Members have said, their fears
are unfounded.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government want to privatise Royal Mail to get sorely needed private
capital and to ensure that it is a success for this country. Our prime
objective is to secure the universal service provision, and we will not
do anything to put that at risk. I hope, therefore, that Opposition
Members have been persuaded by those arguments and will not press the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000271">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for his clear explanation
and for setting out one or two points on the record. We welcome the

extremely important and we always wish to receive it.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000272">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We still have
significant concerns about the weakness of the regulatory framework,
which we will return to in subsequent sittings. Our fear is not one
that is solely expressed by Members of Parliament; it was expressed
clearly in the evidence sessions last week by Consumer Focus. The
provision leaves the door open, once Ofcom has taken over, for
significant opportunities for wriggle room in the EU directive of a
five-day delivery at an affordable price, whatever that might
mean—not a  uniform price. Those would be the overall
safeguards that would remain.<a class="bkMark" name="10111880000273">&#160;</a>

amendments have provided us with a good opportunity to discuss the
different options and parts of Royal Mail, and what might happen if it
were broken up. I hope that the Minister will take on board our
significant fears about the unpurchasability—a nice word for our
<em>Hansard </em>reporters—of part of Royal Mail that may have to
bear the burden of the universal service provision more or less on its
own. We will want an update as often as possible from the Minister on
how

that could be put on the regulator as  a result. Bearing in
