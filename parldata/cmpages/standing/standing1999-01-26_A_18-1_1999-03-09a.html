Bill</a></center></H3>

<H4><center>(Except clauses 1, 2, 3, and 4 and schedules 1 and 2) </center></H4>
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we commence the proceedings,  I suggest that we take a break from about 7.30 pm to  8.30 pm.  
<P>
<B> The Minister for London and Construction  (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Benton.  This morning, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and  Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) raised a slightly dubious point  of order. Nevertheless, Mr. Winterton was pleased, in the  interests of historical accuracy and information, to listen  to the hon. Gentleman talking about the number of  amendments that had been tabled and about whether it  was a record.  
<P>
I have done some research and have established that  more than 1,100 amendments have been tabled to the Bill  so far. If we add the amendments that were discussed on  the Floor of the House, we discover that some 1,128  amendments have been tabled. That appears to be an  absolute record in terms of comparable legislation from  this Department. A total of 1,014 amendments were tabled  to the Local Government Act 1986, which abolished the  Greater London council, and 976 amendments were tabled  to the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which  introduced the community charge.  
<P>
We are clearly sailing into the record books, but I have  a disappointment for Opposition Members. In recent  weeks, they have increasingly stridently voiced their  concern about the number of amendments and the  difficulties that they have encountered because of them.  Opposition Members are, however, largely to blame. Of  the more than 1,100 amendments that have been tabled so  far, a mere 101 were Government amendments. More than  900 in fact, almost 1,000 were Opposition  amendments. It is entirely in the Opposition's hands  whether they slow down our race into the record books.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and  Bermondsey): Further to that point of order, Mr. Benton.  I want to make two brief points. First, if my general  recollection from this morning is correct, I am the only  veteran of the Committee that considered the Bill that  abolished the GLC. That Committee lasted long enough,  but the Minister has confirmed my sense that, in terms of  amendments, this one is longer.   
<P>
My second point is that the Minister tries to blame  the Opposition for the number of amendments  [Interruption.] Well, he tries to attribute them to the  Opposition, but he did not quite answer another question.  How many lines' worth of amendments came from the  Government as opposed to the Opposition? The longest,  most detailed and most complex amendments have come  from the Government. We are happy to consider them,  but they could have been put in the Bill in the first place.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): Further to  that point of order, Mr. Benton. Surely it is generally the  case in the House and in Committee that it is the  Opposition's job to seek to amend Bills. I did not realise  that it was the Government's job to amend their own Bills.     
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that we have had sufficient on  that point of order.  
<H4><center>Clause 200 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Road user charging </center></H4>
<P>
Amendment moved [this day]: No. 989, in page 104,  line 10 leave `13' and insert `(Road user charging)'.  [Ms Glenda Jackson.]  
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be  made.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B> The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda  Jackson):</B> What a pleasure it is to see you back in our  Committee, chairing our deliberations, Mr. Benton.  
<P>
When we adjourned, I had just begun detailing the  applications of net proceeds that are to be raised from  road user charges and private non-residential parking  levies. I intend to set out the arrangements in some  detail; I trust that that meets with your approval,  Mr. Benton.   
<P>
On Second Reading, the Government made it  abundantly clear that for at least the next 10 years,  every penny of the net proceeds of charging schemes  introduced in the Greater London area will be  ring-fenced for transport expenditure, and that those  arrangements would be reviewed only after 10 years.  To put the Government's commitment to hypothecation  beyond question, we propose that the arrangements for  the application of the net proceeds should be written  into the Bill. Paragraph 16 of new schedule 8 makes  it clear that all schemes proposed by the mayor or  boroughs within 10 years of the GLA's inception will  retain 100 per cent. of net proceeds for transport  expenditure for 10 years from the implementation of  the scheme.  
<P>
However, we have included a power to enable the  Secretary of State to guarantee the retention of such  proceeds for such expenditure for more than 10 years  from the implementation of a scheme. That could be  especially valuable if, for example, the mayor wanted  to undertake a PFI-type deal, and the private sector  required a guarantee that the revenues would be  available for more than 10 years.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We welcome the fact that there  is a reference in the new schedule to the minimum  period. We can argue about whether it should be  longer, but we welcome that reference. I accept the  Minister's point that the new schedule allows a 10-year  period to begin at any time during the first 10 years  after the authority comes into existence, and then to  run for 10 years for more than 10 years from next  year.  
<P>
However, will the Minister confirm that paragraph  17 of the new schedule gives the Secretary of State  power to stop the money remaining with the GLA if  he or she decides that any change in the scheme  constitutes a new scheme? Therefore, once the first  scheme is put into operation, the only way to guarantee  the revenues is for no new incoming mayor for  10 years thereafter to change it.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No, that is not correct, because any  new scheme introduced by a new mayor would take  precedence over a preceding scheme. Clearly, there  would have to be agreement with the Secretary of State  with regard to the broad brush of schemes presented to  him by the mayor. We are not expecting the Secretary  of State to have to dot every "i"	 and cross every "t"	  of the detail of a scheme, but there must be a  safeguard to ensure that best value is achieved in  spending such revenues to achieve the mayor's  transport strategy. Before the completion of a 10-year  scheme, an incoming mayor who wanted to introduce  an entirely new scheme would have to present it to  the Secretary of State for broad-brush approval, but  the new scheme would then take precedence over any  preceding scheme. It would be deemed to be a new  scheme, and would therefore run for 10 years.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand the second point about a  new scheme taking precedence over an old scheme.  However, paragraph 17(6) of new schedule 8 as  drafted states:      
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In determining when the initial period begins or expires  regulations"	   
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
which will be laid by the Secretary of State   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may make provision as to circumstances in which the same  charging scheme is to be regarded as continuing in force or a  different scheme is, or is not, to be regarded as coming into force."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
If the Secretary of State does not deem the second scheme  to be a new scheme, that gives him power to foreshorten  a 10-year guarantee of revenue funding under the first  scheme, and not necessarily replace that funding.  
<P>
<B>Ms jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to the  powers of the Secretary of State with regard to  regulations. Before the Secretary of State could make  regulations, he would have to consult the mayor. It would  also be necessary for the affirmative resolution procedure  to be accorded to such regulations. A Secretary of State  would not be able to prevent any changes, but if he or she  does not approve of them to the first instance, he or she  will be able to tell the mayor that the Government do not  deem them to be delivering best value, and to ask for a  scheme that the Government can approve. I hope that that  answers the hon. Gentleman's question.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for allowing  me to intervene a third time. I do not wish to delay her,  but I should tell her that the Liberal Democrats believe  that the power as drafted gives to the Secretary of State  the ultimate say on how long a scheme can fund transport.  The Committee will return to the matter, but we disagree  about the interpretation of the paragraph in question.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I shall be interested in the hon.  Gentleman's more detailed arguments about the matter.  The purpose of the powers is to ensure that the Secretary  of State cannot foreshorten the 10 years of the scheme.  The hon. Gentleman referred to circumstances in which a  scheme is changed, and becomes in essence a new  scheme. If it is a new scheme, it will again be eligible for  the full 10 years.  
<P>
I shall now explain the use of net revenues. The new  schedule makes it clear that revenue from authority and  borough charging schemes will be spent on any measure  that directly or indirectly supports the mayor's transport  strategy. That strategy will set out how the mayor intends  to promote and to encourage safe, integrated, efficient and  economic transport facilities and services to, from and  within Greater London. Providing for charging revenues  to be spent on any measure that can help to deliver the  objective contained in the transport strategy will ensure  that maximum transport benefit is obtained. That means  that charging revenues can be spent on cyclists and  pedestrians as well as on public transport, which reasserts  and reaffirms the Government's approach.  
<P>
The Government propose that a regulation-making  power should establish arrangements for the retention and  use of changing revenues after 10 years. I have already  explained how such regulations could be introduced, in  response to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and  Bermondsey. The regulations will cover arrangements for  schemes introduced after the first 10 years of the GLA. I  should emphasise, however, that they will not have any  impact on the guarantee of 100 per cent. retention during   a scheme's initial period, for schemes started within the  first 10 years of the GLA. Paragraph 16 of the new  schedule makes that absolutely clear, although I know that  the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey  disagrees.     
<P>
Before making regulations, the Secretary of State is  required to assess how much money will be raised from  new charges in future and the potential for spending that  revenue on value-for-money transport purposes. The  Secretary of State is also required to consult the authority  before making regulations, which will ensure an informed  decision. As I said, regulations will be subject to the  affirmative resolution procedure of the House of  Commons.  
<P>
We wish to ensure that only genuinely new schemes  attract the 100 per cent. hypothecation arrangements. For  example, we would not want a mayor to introduce a  scheme in year one of the GLA's lifetime and to seek to  make an inconsequential amendment in year nine, arguing  that the revenues should be hypothecated for 10 more  years. The new schedule therefore allows the Secretary of  State to make regulations determining what constitutes a  new or amended scheme.  
<P>
Paragraph 18 of the new schedule covers arrangements  for how net revenues for charging schemes are to be  apportioned between the authority, Transport for London  and the boroughs. That enables, for example, net revenues  from borough schemes to be paid to the authority or to  Transport for London. The mayor will decide how the net  revenues are to be split, but in all cases the revenues must  be spent on schemes that support the mayor's transport  strategy. It is necessary to allow moneys from borough  schemes to be paid to the authority, Transport for London  or a neighbouring borough because a borough charging  scheme could divert traffic into other boroughs.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): The Minister  says that the funding will be spent on the mayor's  strategy. Will she concede that after 10 years that will not  be possible?  
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No, I cannot conceive that after 10 years  it will not be possible. There may be parts of the mayoral  strategy that cannot be achieved within 10 years. An  incoming mayor may take over responsibility for London  in an era during which there have been major  technological advances in many areas, which could  include Transport for London. We have already touched  on the potential that lies within such hypothecated  revenues for major schemes that a mayor may wish to  introduce [Interruption.]  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There are three or four different  conversations going on, which is not fair to the Minister  or to other members of the Committee. I must insist that  background noise is kept down.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Benton. I was referring  to the potential that is inherent in hypothecated revenues  for a mayor who wishes, for example, to extend London   underground by introducing a new line. The hon. Member  for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) looks as if he wishes  to intervene.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister has made it quite clear that  the money is ring fenced for 10 years. Frankly, we would  not have the scheme at all, but we accept that we are to  have it, and that that is progress. The Minister has spoken  in debates on past clauses about public-private partnership  contracts lasting for up to 30 years. The mayor may want  to spend the money over 30 years, but that is not his  decision. The money is ring-fenced and available for his  use only for 10 years. What will happen for the last  20 years of a 30-year contract?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman again reveals the  confusion that clearly rages within him about the PPP.  The Government would not enter into a PPP if they  believed that it could be effectively achieved only by the  exclusive use of revenues raised from hypothecation. We  have made it abundantly clear that we will conclude a  PPP only in the clear understanding that it delivers best  value not only for the taxpayer but in terms of improving  London Underground.  
<P>
The hon. Gentleman consistently ignores the  responsibilities of the mayor in relation to Transport for  London, which include the buses, the river, the mayoral  roads, the docklands light railway and the Croydon tram  link. The potential for improvements in those existing  transport schemes is abundantly clear. I am sure that  Londoners would like to know that the hon. Gentleman  I presume he speaks for his party is opposed to this  innovative scheme, which will help to tackle London's  transport problems and, at the same time, inevitably  reduce congestion on our streets and improve the quality  of the air that we breathe. The Conservative party is  clearly opposed to such improvements in the quality of  life in London.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister knows that Liberal  Democrat Members support the principle of the scheme  and therefore share her view that to reject it out of hand  is foolish. However, I should like to ask about the issue  that was raised by the hon. Member for Croydon, South.  Does the Minister envisage that, either in the first 10 years  or thereafter, it will be necessary for the revenue stream  from road charging to be used as part of the money that  pays for the PPP, or will it be raised entirely from the  fares of people who travel on the underground?     
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I repeat to the hon. Member for  Southwark, North and Bermondsey that, as I said to the  hon. Member for Croydon, South, the Government will  not enter into a PPP unless we are sure that the PPP is in  the best public interest and affords the best value not  only for the taxpayer in delivering transport services for  London. However, I will not say that the mayor will be  precluded from using the hypothecated revenues from  charging to bring additional improvements to the  London underground.  
<P>
I have already mentioned the potential for technological  advances during the 30 years about which we are talking.  Let us say, for instance, that the incumbent mayor wished   to speed up a programme to make the entire London  underground accessible to people with disabilities. It  would be entirely within the mayor's powers to enter into,  for example, a PFI deal perhaps with a contractor who  was already engaged and use hypothecated revenues  for that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I do not dissent from that. However, if  the Minister steps back one question, would it also be  possible for the mayor to use the hypothecated road  charging revenues not for an additional bit of work as the  subject of an additional contract, but to fund Transport for  London's element of the contractual dues that it must pay  as its part of the public-private partnerships?  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> As I have already said, I cannot conceive  of such a requirement being placed on the mayor.  
<P>
We have made our approach to a public-private  partnership abundantly clear. The detail of the contracts  for which the private sector will have to bid and the  competition will all come within that overriding  consideration of Government best value. However, I  cannot guarantee nor can any member of the Committee  or, indeed, any Member of the entire House of  Commons that nothing would happen between the  inception and conclusion of a PPP over a possible  30 years that had not been considered. For example, there  could be a major collapse of a tunnel, although that is  highly unlikely. In those circumstances, it would be  entirely right and proper for the mayor to make a  contribution to that. We are clear, however, that we are  not setting up a situation whereby the overwhelming  burden of risk will at any stage, from the beginning to the  end of a contract, be borne by the private sector.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That was very helpful. We are trying to  understand the Government's mind. I understand exactly  what the Minister said, but I want to take her one further  step back.  
<P>
Does she agree that given all the normal expectations  of the contract when it is entered into, and given above  all that it will, as she tells us, be signed between  Government and the private sector and not between the  authority and the private sector, all the normal  expectations of the GLA's liability will not be met or  be expected to be met from the revenue streams from  charging? If that is the case, will the Minister at least  consider writing it into the Bill at a later stage so that  there is clarity on that?     
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman's assessment was  correct. It is based on the modelling on which the  definition of the contract will be based. But no, I most  certainly will not come back with an amendment which  puts that on the face of the Bill. That would be giving a  wild card to the private sector in exactly the same way  as setting some artificial concluding date would. We are  committed to ensuring that the PPP is conducted on the  understanding that the Government will secure a deal that  is best value and in the best interests of the underground.  
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): Is the  Minister aware that she will appear to Londoners to be  steaming away from her party's engagement to the   electorate under the cover of smoke about best value?  They will believe that because these charging powers  exist for the mayoralty, the deficiency in the financing of  the underground which is plain for all to see because  there is no timetable for the implementation of the  public-private partnership could be made up at the  expense of motorists in London. That was not the deal  that was sold to the electorate during the referendum  campaign or, for that matter, during the general election  campaign before it.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I find the hon. Gentleman's contribution  extraordinary, given that there was a clear manifesto  commitment to the public-private partnership, which the  people of London overwhelmingly endorsed. We have  made abundantly clear our proposals and the use that will  be made on congestion charging and the use that will be  made of those revenues for the first time, I believe.  Again, the people of London have overwhelmingly  endorsed the clear hypothecation of those revenues.  
<P>
I think that the people of London are under no illusions  as to which Government have the well-being of London  and Londoners and, indeed, of London Underground,  most central to their thinking. It is clearly this  Government. The people of London know full well that  the previous Administration failed for more than a decade  to fund London Underground adequately. They know that  the only solution to London Underground's problems that  the previous Administration could proffer was to privatise  it. It was proposed that it should be a third of its size for  that privatisation. There was no guarantee actually, there  was a guarantee, because the then Secretary of State for  Transport told the then Chancellor of the Exchequer that  post privatisation, under the previous Administration's  scheme, there would be a requirement for millions of  pounds of public money still to be paid in to London  Underground.  
<P>
Londoners can have no doubt which Administration is  most cognisant of the need to fund transport. Post the  comprehensive spending review, an additional 1.8 billion  was given to the Department of the Environment,  Transport and the Regions. An additional 700 million  was provided for local authority transport. My right hon.  Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave an assurance  that there would be an additional 50 million year on year,  for three years, targeted specifically for the introduction  of new rural bus services. There can be no doubt in the  minds of the people of London, or of anyone in the United  Kingdom, which Government are most committed to  creating an integrated transport system nationally and to  ensuring that London and Londoners have the sort of  transport system that this great city deserves.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Was there, spirited away in any of the  press releases on today's Budget, an explanation of where  funding is coming from for the underground for the next  three years?  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Regrettably, it was not open to me to be  present in the Chamber this afternoon when my right hon.  Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer had a triumph yet  again. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."	] Year on year, my  right hon. Friend presents to the country the clear, precise   methods by which the Government are ensuring the  economy of the country, and ensuring that everyone will  benefit from our economic and fiscal policies.     
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman turns his attention to the Red  Book, I am sure that he will find the details in which he  is interested. I am happy to attempt to find that detail but  not, I regret, before we conclude our deliberations this  evening.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister could say that she does not  know and save a lot of time. I am not quite sure whether  that is what she is saying. Is she saying that I will find it  if I look for it and tee hee I should go and find it, or  that she does not know?  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I intend to take no lessons from the hon.  Gentleman in the best use of my time. I am not in a  position to know, because I was not present in the  Chamber. Regrettably, I missed yet another triumph for  my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, and will have to  enjoy it when is is reported on our television screens this  evening. As I said to the hon. Gentleman, I am perfectly  prepared to attempt to find out, but not before the  Committee adjourns this evening.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): Perhaps I can reassure  the Minister that had she been in the Chamber, she would  have been no more enlightened. As she has responsibility  for transport in London is she interested in where funding  is coming from the next couple of years?  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is coming somewhat  late to that concern. That is yet another demonstration of  the fact that the Conservative party does not have the best  interests of London and Londoners at heart. I have had  occasion to say that in response to such questions before  the issue of the budget arose. The Government are  addressing that issue, and there is no question of our  allowing the sort of black hole scenario that is the  favourite of the Conservative party to occur.  
<P>
<H5>6 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
I was touching on the apportionment of net proceeds,  and had mentioned that it will be necessary to allow  moneys from borough schemes to be paid to the authority,  to Transport for London or to a neighbouring borough,  because a borough charging scheme could divert traffic  into other boroughs. That means that some of the net  revenues may need to be spent outside the borough on  traffic management measures, for example or on  improving alternatives to an overdependence on the car in  that borough.  
<P>
Paragraphs 19 to 22 contain the arrangements for  setting out and approving the spending of the net revenues  from road user charging schemes. That will ensure that  Londoners know exactly how charging revenues are to be  spent. The new schedule requires the charging authority  whether Transport for London or a borough to set out  its 10-year plan of expenditure before a charging scheme  starts. The charging authority is then required to produce  four-year expenditure programmes every four years.   
<P>
The mayor must produce similar plans and programmes  for any portion of the proceeds that is not kept by the  charging authority. The Secretary of State will approve  those plans and programmes. In addition, the mayor will  approve the borough's plans.  
<P>
The process will ensure that potentially large sums of  money are spent on value-for-money transport measures  that are consistent with the Government's national  integrated transport policy and the mayor's transport  strategy.  
<P>
Paragraph 17 of new schedule 8 also provides for the  Secretary of State to issue statutory guidance on the  appraisal framework that the authority and boroughs  should use when deciding how net charging revenues  should be spent. That will ensure that the moneys are  spent on the transport measures that deliver the greatest  benefits to Londoners.  
<P>
Road users charging can and undoubtedly will  directly tackle London's traffic problems. These  ground-breaking arrangements for the application of the  net proceeds to transport purposes will also help to  provide the solution.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister is right to say that  paragraph 17(3) provides statutory guidance. Will she  confirm that the guidance given will not actually be  guidance, because the next paragraph states that it shall be  complied with? It will be guidance with which the London  authority will have no option but to comply.     
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I cannot conceive of a situation in which  such guidance would not be conducive to delivering what  will no doubt be part not only of the national integrated  transport strategy but of the mayor's transport strategy. It  will ensure best value in delivering those strategies. We  are discussing the potential to raise sizeable amounts of  money; it is only right and proper that such guidance  should be available.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister confirms that we have a  difference of view. "Guidance"	 here is not guidance in the  normal sense of the word. If I gave her guidance or she  gave me guidance, we would both be free to choose not  to follow it. What is provided here is an obligation. That  means that the GLA will be able to introduce road  charging only to the extent that the Secretary of State of  the day agrees.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No, the hon. Gentleman is incorrect yet  again. What I have been at some pains to point out, but  will reiterate, is that the type of approval that the  Secretary of State must give, and to which the hon.  Gentleman refers, is a broad-brush approval. We do not  expect the mayor to go to the Secretary of State with a  detailed scheme that has every "i"	 dotted and every "t"	  crossed. However, it is only right and proper, and  reaffirms Government policy, that the principle of best  value should apply to the schemes.  
<P>
That principle will apply throughout the country. The  implementation plans of the London boroughs will be  within the overarching framework, as they have been for  the past two years, to ensure that the Government's   approach to integrated transport is adopted and that the  prioritisation of transport needs will be carried out. The  detail of how the mayor's transport strategy is to be  achieved will clearly be for the mayor and for the  boroughs working together to decide. In many instances,  the delivery of the mayoral strategy will depend upon the  boroughs implementing it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Liberal Democrats believe that the  Government's approach is inconsistent, which is why we  are pursuing the matter. I may have missed something,  but when, for example, my local authority, Southwark,  decides on its parking regime and on how much it charges  people to park on the street, it does not have to come to  the Government for permission. It allocates the revenue  into its internal resources to spend as it thinks fit. The  new Londonwide authority is defined by the Government  in law as a local government authority, but its use of the  new revenue stream requires the agreement of the  Secretary of State, which is a different procedure from  that which applies in any other area. There is no logic in  deciding that an integrated national transport policy  should ensure that London can have a road charging  scheme but also that the Secretary of State should decide  what the scheme is.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Again, the hon. Gentleman is incorrect.  He referred to revenue from parking, which is available  to all London boroughs. It is not available to them to  spend on just anything they have to spend it on issues  directly related to transport. Why is that any different to  what a Secretary of State will say to a mayor about use  of the revenues?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee,  but I should point out the difference. Southwark, the  Minister's borough of Camden or my hon. Friend's  borough of Sutton may decide to introduce a parking levy  on meters 20p for 10 minutes, or whatever other price  and will have to keep it. The GLA can decide on a road  charging scheme that it will keep, but the difference is  that it will have to seek approval elsewhere.  [Interruption.] The Minister says that the authority will  not have to do so. Will she therefore change the Bill, so  that it will clearly be entirely up to the mayor to decide  the charging regime, without having to seek the approval  of the Secretary of State of the day and without having to  go to Marsham street or to the replacement office at the  end of Victoria street?  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> That is precisely the relationship that I  have described. As I said, the Secretary of state will  appraise the value-for-money schemes, but it will not be  for the Secretary of State to say yes to every detail of a  mayoral strategy. That Bill clearly ensures that.  
<P>
In addition to clarifying arrangements for the use and  application of net proceeds, we have set out arrangements  for the accounts and funds associated with new charges.  For the benefit of the mayor I apologise, I mean the  right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster  (Mr. Brooke) I should point out that paragraph 15 of  the new schedule sets out the details, and contains the  requirement for charging authorities to keep separate   accounts for each scheme that they operate, and to publish  those accounts annually. That will ensure the  accountability of charging authorities to Londoners, and  makes transparent what is coming into and out of an  account.  
<P>
That transparency will enable Londoners to see that  charging revenues are additional moneys for spending on  transport in support of the mayor's transport strategy.  Published accounts will show Londoners how much  money has been raised and what it is being spent on. They  will rightly want to know that, and we are ensuring that  they will.  
<P>
It is important that schemes are accountable. Motorists  who pay the charges will rightly want to know what is  being done with the money raised. We are ensuring that  that information will be available. If a charging scheme  incurs a deficit in its early years, while it is being set up,  that deficit will be made good from the authority's general  fund. When schemes begin to record surpluses, they must  make good any borrowing made from that general fund  within the past four years. Remaining surpluses can be  carried forward into the next financial year, and ring  fencing of the account ensures that no money can leak  away to other areas.     
<P>
The new schedule includes provisions to allow the  charging authorities control and flexibility in setting up  charging schemes. We have provided for charging  authorities to incur expenses in setting up schemes. They  will, for example, be able to consider long-term  investment in technology with private sector partners who  would initially invest in the scheme's infrastructure and  be repaid from later revenues from the scheme. A  PFI-type arrangement could also provide an opportunity  to improve transport services and facilities ahead of the  introduction of a charging scheme. Such freedom to  explore the best way in which to implement a scheme is  surely in the best interests of Londoners.  
<P>
I have dealt with the important financial issues that are  contained in the new schedule. I want to deal now with  several provisions that are designed to aid charging  authorities in introducing schemes.  
<P>
New schedule 8 enables charging authorities to  introduce road user charging schemes if a scheme can  directly or indirectly help to deliver the policies and  programmes that are contained in the mayor's transport  strategy. That will give the mayor and boroughs  maximum flexibility to introduce charging schemes that  can deliver transport objectives. That will be to the benefit  of London and Londoners.  
<P>
All charging schemes must conform to the mayor's  transport strategy. That will ensure that schemes support  the promotion and encouragement of safe, integrated,  efficient and economic transport facilities to, from and  within Greater London. In order that schemes are  transparent and understandable, the new schedule requires  them to specify the charging area, the roads charged, the  level of charge and the type of vehicles that are covered  by the scheme. The level of charge may change,  depending on the day, the time of day, the class of vehicle,  and the particular part of the charging area. I should make  it clear that those decisions will be for charging authorities  to make and for the mayor to approve.   
<P>
We also propose to allow charging authorities to  determine the duration of a charging scheme. By  removing the references to regulations that surround many  of these issues, we are fulfilling our commitment to a  strong mayor for London. The mayor should have the  freedom to decide how best to introduce an order that  contains a charging scheme and the mechanisms and new  arrangements that will form part of that process. The new  schedule allows that to happen.  
<P>
We have also ensured that the mayor will have a  specific power to consult, or to require charging  authorities to consult, when introducing charging  schemes. A charging scheme would necessarily be an  important element of the mayor's transport strategy or of  a borough's local implementation plan, and boroughs will,  again, be required to consult on such a scheme. There  will, therefore, be an opportunity for views to be  expressed on charging proposals.     
<P>
I would expect the mayor to want to undertake further  consultation on the details of particular schemes. That will  encourage the successful development and  implementation of schemes that are adapted to the needs  and circumstances of Londoners. It will encourage  charging authorities to be accountable for the schemes  that they introduce. We do not, however, propose to  specify which organisations must be consulted. That will  be a decision for London's democratically accountable  mayor and boroughs.  
<P>
The mayor must be able to deliver an integrated  approach across London. He or she must, therefore, be  able to ensure consistency and compatibility between any  borough schemes and with any TfL scheme. The schedule  therefore gives the mayor the opportunity to specify  which aspects of charging schemes, if any, he or she  would want formally to approve as schemes are  developed. That will help to ensure consistency across  schemes, where the mayor considers that necessary, while  allowing charging authorities the freedom to take  decisions on other issues.  
<P>
It may also be necessary for the mayor to be able to  ensure that boroughs implement measures to support  charging schemes. For example, a borough outside a  charging area may be required to put in traffic  management measures to deal with traffic. We are,  therefore, giving the mayor a power to direct boroughs to  use their charging powers or any of their traffic  management and control powers if they are needed to  support a charging scheme. The power is entirely in  keeping with our proposal for a strong and effective  mayor.  
<P>
The mayor is also granted power to issue guidance on  charging schemes, which TfL and the boroughs must  follow. That will enable the mayor to communicate key  features or aspects of schemes that are needed for  consistency across London and with the integrated  transport strategy.  
<P>
We have introduced a safeguard for motorists to  prevent them from being charged by both TfL and a  borough on a single stretch of road. We have simplified  the relationship between the various highway and traffic  authorities.      
<P>
The new schedule contains provisions for regulations  to be made covering the administration and enforcement  of road user charging schemes. It is essential that the  mayor and boroughs have adequate enforcement powers  if they are to be able to make a road user charging scheme  work in practice.  
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
We have made it clear in the Bill that charging schemes  will not apply to vehicles within charging areas but which  are not on the road. That applies not only to charges levied  but also to the differing enforcement options open to  charging authorities, such as immobilisation. It is clearly  right that measures combat congestion on the road do not  apply to vehicles off it.  
<P>
We also make it clear that the non-payment of a charge  will be a civil offence and that the registered keeper of a  vehicle will be responsible for paying charges and penalty  charges. A deliberate attempt to avoid paying road user  charges will, however, be a criminal offence. Such  offences and the penalties for them are written into the  Bill.  
<P>
The new schedule applies to Crown roads as to all other  roads and ensures that Crown roads may be included in  the scope of Transport for London or borough charging  schemes.  
<P>
In conclusion, new schedule 8 provides a framework  within which London's mayor and boroughs will bring  forward road user charging schemes. It ensures that such  schemes can be introduced quickly and that they will be  able to operate effectively and equitably. It also ensures  that the proceeds of those schemes will be retained for the  benefit of Londoners for at least 10 years and that they  can be spent on improving London's transport system.  That is nothing less than Londoners deserve.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I want to make it clear from the outset  that we on these Benches oppose road user charging in  London for reasons that I shall make clear as the debate  progresses.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I do not dissent that we on these  Benches oppose it, but will any Conservative mayoral  candidate be required to oppose it, too? At least one  well-known person if not two is on the record as  supporting it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Who we choose as our mayoral  candidate is a matter for the members of the London  Conservative Party and nothing to do with the central  party.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> rose   
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a habit of  conducting conversations with Ministers by way of  interventions. Instead of doing that with me, can he put  all his points into one job lot? I will then be able to deal  with them all in one go, and I can get on with my speech.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> To follow up my earlier point, is it  Conservative party policy in London to oppose road  charging?  
<P>
<B>  Mr. Ottaway:</B> Yes. We will be voting against clause  200 and new schedule 8 in this Committee. I cannot make  it clearer than that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Is it Tory party policy?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I happen to be the spokesman of the  Tory party. I assume from this, that the Liberal party will  support the clause do I take it that the Liberal party is  making it clear that they support the taxation of the people  of London via a road user charge?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is Liberal Democrat policy, both  nationally and in London, that the Greater London  authority should have the power to bring in a road  charging scheme.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Clearly, the battle lines are now  properly drawn. I hope that no one is in any doubt about  where the Conservative party stands.     
<P>
<B>Ms Karen Buck </B>(Regent's Park and Kensington,  North): The hon. Gentleman has stressed the importance  of giving the boroughs a key role to play. Westminster  city council a Conservative borough in the heart of  London, with probably the greatest traffic pressure of any  local authority in the city has made it clear that it cannot  wait for road user charges to be brought in. I have a copy  of a letter from the leader of my local council. In it, he  criticises the Government for not bringing in those powers  early enough to allow Westminster city council to  introduce road user charging.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have not seen the letter, but I am pretty  sure that I know what it says because I have had a  conversation with Councillor Caplan on just that point. It  says that it cannot be brought in cold, in isolation, but  must be brought in with the consideration of a number of  different aspects not least that the London underground  could not cope with the increase in passenger traffic if  road-user charging was introduced. I should like to make  it clear to the hon. Member for Regent's Park and  Kensington, North (Ms Buck), who spends a great deal of  time attacking her own local authority, that Westminster  city council does not support the proposal as it stands.  Well, that was a pretty good opening sentence.  [Laughter.]  
<P>
You and your co-Chairmen, Mr. Benton, have wisely  chosen to group an extensive selection of amendments  with new schedule 8. A number of different aspects of the  charge must therefore be discussed. With the Committee's  tolerance, I shall deal with the amendments before turning  to our central opposition to the principle of the road-user  charge.  
<P>
Amendment (b) suggests that the mayor should not  introduce a scheme without the approval of the assembly.  We have made it quite clear that we distance ourselves  from the Liberal approach they want the assembly to be  the legislature operating with the mayor. They have asked  for the assembly to monitor almost everything that the  mayor does. The Government are right to resist that.  However, this is the big one. The Government cannot  introduce a new tax on the people of London without a   democratic process there should be no taxation without  representation. To leave that power solely in the mayor's  discretion, without the involvement of the assembly, is a  breach of the democratic principles of this country at  which Conservative Members have to draw the line. Such  substantial measures must not be introduced without the  support of the assembly. What is the point of the  constituency assembly men? Whom are they  representing? What is their standing? While they are there  speaking for people in their constituencies, the  Londonwide members will be speaking for the whole of  London. They will not be allowed to have a say on this  most important of central issues.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): Surely the assembly  has the power through its ability to control the budget.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The budget is a much wider thing. One  could say that about central Government if the Budget  were to be defeated, the whole Government would fall. A  Conservative group almost certainly, all parties in the  assembly will be minority parties may want to support  everything in the budget except road user charging. There  is no way of doing that other than the something and bust  policy of voting down the whole budget.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know from  the Committee's debates on part III of the Bill, when we  discussed the budget, that the assembly has no power to  vote down the budget its power is to amend the budget.  It could amend a budget by specifically changing  provisions that relate to road user charging. The point that  was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster  (Mr. Darvill) is therefore absolutely correct.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If that is the case, what is the problem  with accepting the amendment? If the Minister is saying  that the assembly has the power, the Government should  not object to the amendment. It would give clarity to the  whole democratic process. I think that the Minister was  out of the Room I beg his pardon if he was not when  I made the fundamental point that the purpose of the  constituency assembly men is to act as the representatives  of the people, and that that is a proper exercise of  democracy.  
<P>
Amendment (c) is a small amendment to the provisions  of paragraph 4(1) on making a charging scheme. That  paragraph states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any charging scheme must be contained in an order (a) made  under this Schedule by the authority making the scheme"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I tabled this simply as a probing amendment, but in my  reading of the new schedule there is no definition of  authority. I am pretty sure that I know what is meant, but  those entitled to make a charges scheme are defined as  "bodies"	, not the "authority"	, with a small "a"	. As the  amendment has been tabled for some days, I imagine that  the Minister has a response to that point, and I draw it to  her attention.  
<P>
Amendment (d) relates to the fact that under the new  schedule, the boroughs cannot introduce a charging  scheme without the approval of the mayor. In our  judgment, what goes on in the borough of Croydon is a  matter for the borough of Croydon. Although it is obvious   that boroughs have to draw up their scheme in line with  the mayor's strategic policy, we believe that he should not  have a veto over how the scheme is run in Croydon. They  may choose to put a particular slant on it which the mayor  may not like. For him to have the ultimate veto is not  acceptable to us.  
<P>
The present arrangements are that under paragraph (9),  Transport for London can introduce a charging scheme in  any area. Under proposed amendments (g) and (h) to the  new schedule, the scheme would apply to non-residential  areas. Again, we ask what is the point of a charging  scheme? Is the Minister trying to introduce a user charge  in residential areas? She will no doubt respond that if  there is not a problem, such a charge will not be  introduced. But that is not what the new schedule  provides. It is quite possible that people could be taxed to  get home, and that would be an unacceptable state of  affairs.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): I should like to go  back to amendment (c). I know that an awful lot of words  and waffle have gone under the bridge since we debated  clause 2, but the amendment clearly defines the authority  as the mayor and the assembly. Paragraph (2) of the new  schedule says that the authority the mayor and the  assembly, as defined in clause 2 and any functions  designated to it by the new schedule will be carried out  by the mayor on behalf of the authority. It is very clear  and, as ever, the amendment is redundant.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman is, as  ever, trying to be helpful, but he is referring to a definition  of "authority"	 with a capital A. This is "authority"	 with a  small a. I tabled this as a probing amendment, because  the wording is confusing.  
<P>
I am astonished that the one amendment that the hon.  Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) can try and pick  me up on is a drafting one about whether "authority"	  should be written with a capital A or a small one.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> That is what they are like in Harrow.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It is about the level of political debate  in Harrow, I suspect.  
<P>
I turn now to amendment (j). As the new schedule  stands, when a scheme is set up, any losses can be carried  forward and set against future profit. If a scheme takes  10 years to run into a surplus, that profit in the 10th year  can be used to offset the losses in the early years, but only  for the four years prior to going into profit.  
<P>
Having visited Singapore to look at how road user  schemes work, I know that the only type of scheme that  will make sense and achieve the Government's objective  is an electronic one. In Singapore, 28 gantries cover the  city area and cost hundreds of millions of pounds. A  scheme with 28 gantries would be inadequate for London,  so we are talking about a substantial sum. It should be  possible to offset losses against future profits for longer  than four years.

<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Who paid for the hon. Gentleman to go  to Singapore: did he pay for himself; did his party pay; or  was it someone whom he should have declared in the  Register of Members' Interests?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I paid for myself.  
<P>
Amendment (aa) states that  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"charges shall not apply on any day on which any part of the  underground, bus or suburban rail networks are disrupted or closed  by industrial action."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
It is commonplace for London Transport unions to go on  strike because the Government are unable to agree terms.  People are forced to resort to their own means of  transport, and we believe that they should not be charged  on those days.  
<P>
Amendments (bb) and (cc) relate to exemptions for  emergency services and orange badge holders. The  amendments speak for themselves. No doubt the Minister  will say that it is a matter for the mayor and, having heard  her earlier explanation, I suspect that that is probably  right. Nevertheless, we believe that orange badge holders  should be exempt, and I hope that the Minister will  endorse the sentiment.  
<P>
That is a brief canter through the amendments I  skipped over one or two that have been covered. Until I  hear the Minister's explanation, I want to put down  markers that signal our intention to divide on amendment  (b), which deals with assembly approval, amendment (k),  which relates to ring-fencing for 10 years and possibly  on amendments (aa) and (bb), which are concerned with  disruption on the underground by industrial workers and  with orange badge holders.  
<P>
In conclusion, I shall explain the fundamental thrust of  the Conservative party and why we oppose the principle  of road-user charging. We made it clear in 1995 that we  were prepared to consider introducing congestion  charging. The Minister has drawn our attention to the  presumption in the Green Paper that we would introduce  congestion charging. But that was merely a Green Paper.  It was a consultation document, not a White Paper. A  presumption is rebuttable, and that is what happened. As  a result of the publication of the Green Paper, we  consulted and decided not to proceed. That is why the  proposal was not in the Conservative party's 1997  manifesto. It is worth making that clear before there is  any distortion of what was said and what happened.  
<P>
Had we introduced legislation, it would have been on  a national basis, not a local basis. We do not rule out the  principle that the Conservative party may, some time in  the future, after consultation, introduce road charging on  a national basis. [Interruption.] We will not introduce it  on a borough basis.  
<P>
It was interesting to hear the Minister speak about the  possibility of introducing road charging in the area around  Heathrow. Anyone who looks at the map will know that  Heathrow straddles the London boundary, so road user  charging could be introduced on one side of Heathrow but  not on the other. In my constituency, as one leaves the  southern borough of Croydon one enters Caterham, which  has just as many traffic problems as Croydon. We can   introduce road user charging in Croydon, but not in  Caterham. It does not make sense just to introduce it on  a local basis.  
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> In the examples that the hon.  Gentleman gave, it would be entirely possible for such  revenues to be used to assist contingent boroughs in  guarding against, for example, an excess of traffic being  diverted on to their roads.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> That is fine, but I am not sure how the  people of Croydon would feel about their road tax being  used to sort out Caterham's traffic problems.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am sure that the people of Croydon  would welcome the fact that such assistance from a  contingent borough would also apply to them if the  introduction of a scheme in Croydon was not part of the  mayoral strategy although it is hard to imagine such a  strategy. Clearly, however, it would not be part and parcel  of any mayoral strategy to enter into a sort of  beggar-my-neighbour policy in this area.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister is in for a big surprise if  she thinks that the people of London will welcome  road-user charging.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> They already have.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Then all I can say is that the hon. Lady  is in for an even bigger surprise. I hope that the Labour  and Liberal candidates are campaigning in full flood for  the introduction of road-user charging. I look forward to  escorting a Conservative mayoral candidate into the egg  the new building when it has finally opened.  
<P>
We believe that if we are to institute road-user  charging, London is the last place where we should do it.  It is utterly inappropriate for London to be used as a pilot  scheme for the rest of the country. For a start, the statistics  show that the number of cars per household in London is  relatively low when compared with the rest of the country.  There are far better places than London in which to try  out such a scheme.  
<P>
Moreover, such a scheme would be difficult to  implement in London. The Minister made it perfectly  clear in this morning's debate that clause 200 contains  the word "keep"	 because the Government will want to  introduce a paper-based scheme in a number of areas.  However, she will know that in Singapore they abandoned  the paper-based scheme because it did not work and did  not achieve the effects that the Minister would want.  
<P>
The effects of introducing road-user charging in  London are unknown. The impact on congestion round  the edges of the scheme will be significant. Worst of all,  the scheme will set borough against borough.  
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No, it will not.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister says that it will not, but I  do not know how on earth she knows that. My right hon.  Friend the Member or Bromley and Chislehurst  (Mr. Forth) will know as well as I that the two rival   shopping areas in south London are Bromley and  Croydon. If the mayor dumps a congestion tax on  Croydon but not on Bromley, Croydon will be up in arms  about it while Bromley will be popping the champagne  corks because everyone will go there to shop.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury):  If the problem then occurs in Bromley, it could be tackled  in the same way.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Government Whip highlights the  problem. Further congestion will be caused. The moment  we start to tinker like this, we ruin local economies.  Setting the boroughs against one another will affect local  economies. Furthermore, we are unlikely to solve the  problems of congestion.     
<P>
The Government know from current private schemes  that it will take a charge well in excess of 6 to change  the driving habits of a motorist going into London. The  hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North  will know that it now costs nearly 4 an hour to park in  the west end. Guys driving there think nothing of paying  20 or 30 a day to drive to the west end and park;  another tenner on top of that will be absolutely nothing  to them. Introducing a 5 charge on motorists will not  significantly affect traffic congestion, so extra funding  will be drawn from the London economy for no tangible  benefit.  
<P>
The arbitrary nature of the imposition of the scheme  means that it will affect mothers driving their children to  school. We have already mentioned the disabled; and  there are nurses going to the night shift who will not want  to use public transport. Those whom the scheme will  affect will be those right on the edge the low paid.  
<P>
In the Budget debate today, my right hon. Friend the  Leader of the Opposition said that the people whom the  Labour party tend to spend most of its time attacking are  those who most people perceive that it is there to  protect the low paid. The whole point of the history of  the Labour party is that it is there to protect the  underprivileged. The people who will be most affected  will be those who can just about afford to get some old  banger on the road to get to work; that is the cheapest  form of transport that they can get.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and  Westminster): I am confident that my hon. Friend is aware  that Greater London at present heads the list of all regions  in the country for the largest number of bangers. At  present, 12 per cent. of the cars licensed in Greater  London fall into that category. That reinforces and  sustains my hon. Friend's point.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am, as ever, obliged to my right hon.  Friend for making that point.  
<P>
I turn to the proceeds from the congestion charge,  which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and  Bermondsey and I spent a lot of time discussing with the  Minister earlier. We finally got from the Minister a  perfectly clear picture of what will happen to the  proceeds. Ring-fencing is worthless unless the question of  additionality is addressed many of us made that point at  the outset. The Minister may feel that she gave me a  straight answer about what happens to to the proceeds   
<P>
<B>  The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt again.  Once again, I appeal for the background noise to be kept  down. Not only is it unfair on hon. Members who are  speaking, it is also unfair on the Hansard reporter, who is  having difficulty recording it. I appeal again to the  Committee to keep the background music down.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I was saying that the Minister did not  give a clear answer about what will happen to the  proceeds from the congestion tax after 10 years. That  matter appears to be absolutely fluid at present; the money  could well go to the Treasury, or to something else, as  directed by the Secretary of State. One thing is clear: what  happens in 10 years' time will not be the mayor's  decision; it will be those outside the assembly and the  authority who will decide.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): The hon.  Gentleman is making a point about the ring-fencing of the  new income flow. We have already established that the  Conservative party has no intention of seeking the income  in the first place. Ring-fencing nothing will add nothing  to the mayor's budget. Given that the Conservatives have  also said that under them, the council tax for the mayor  would rise by only the retail prices index each year they  proposed that in an earlier amendment if there were to  be a Conservative mayor, from where would he receive  any resources? The Conservative party is shutting off all  revenue streams to the mayor. If a Tory mayor were to be  let into the new building, he would have his hands tied  behind his back.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We return to clause 1 here. We have a  totally different vision for the mayor from that of the  Liberal Democrats and the Government. We believe in a  voice for London, with an assembly supported by borough  leaders. It is a long time since we discussed that now, but  that is our vision. We believe in a light touch for London,  and do not want to adopt the charging approach at all.     
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman believes in a light  touch for London that would upset Londoners, who  want a strong and firm assembly and mayor to deliver  investment in the underground and in public transport.  Where would the resources come from in Conservative  Members' proposals? They would like to leave the mayor  with his hands tied behind his back. How on earth would  he deliver anything? Under a Conservative Government,  he could shout a lot, but would not be able to deliver.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman may remember an  amendment tabled by the Opposition, I think on Second  Reading, although it is so long ago that I can hardly  remember. In fact, it was discussed during debate on the  referendum Bill. We called for two questions to be asked  in the referendum the mayor, yes or no, and the  assembly, yes or no? If the referendum had asked those  questions, and if the election had not been held on the  same day as the borough elections, we would have the  full-blooded debate that London deserves. The Opposition  believe that London would have said no to the assembly  as currently structured in the Bill.  
<P>
<B>  Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): The hon.  Gentleman has not answered my hon. Friend's question  he is getting almost as bad as the Minister. Under the  Conservatives, where would the money come from to put  right under-investment in the tube system? Would it come  from privatisation? Does he want to admit again that the  Tories would privatise the tube?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> That is a slightly easier question, and  my answer is yes. The hon. Gentleman is looking pleased,  and as if he may have got something out of me. If he  has any doubt about the Conservative party's position on  London underground. I should reassure him that we  announced before the 1997 election that we wanted to  privatise it. We said that we wanted to privatise it in the  election campaign. Our policy has not changed.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> We got more seats than the Liberals.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My hon. Friend makes the important  point that the Conservative party got more seats than the  Liberal party.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have a slight sense of deja vu. I  recall somebody commenting that the Labour party's  result in 1983 was a triumph for socialism because  8 million people voted for the manifesto. I detect a touch  of the same spirit in the hon. Gentleman's remarks, which  celebrate the triumph of the 1997 election, which reduced  the Conservative party in London to 11 Members. Does  not the hon. Gentleman think that that result might in  some way be connected with the electorate's verdict on  his proposal to privatise the underground?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I shall tell the Minister something.  When he discovers that his public-private partnership will  not work, the Government will resort to the private sector  both for the management and the operation of London  Underground. They will not achieve a sensible  underground system until they do so. I believe that the  Opposition are right about privatising London  Underground, and that the Government are wrong in  pursuing their now chaotic PPP. I have never been quite  sure where the Liberals stand on the matter, but one thing  is sure: they are not in favour of privatising the  underground. I suspect that they want to simply leave it  where it is, which confirms what I have always thought  they are the most left-wing of the current political parties.  
<P>
The Opposition believe that road user charging and the  congestion tax are an attack on London's motorists.  Eighty-three per cent. of the public already use public  transport to commute into London. The remaining 17 per  cent. comprise lorries, vans and commercial vehicles. One  has only to go to Oxford street, where private cars are  banned, to realise that it is not cars that cause pollution  problems, but commercial vehicles. Oxford street is the  most polluted street in the country. The amount of  pollution from the motor car is 5 per cent. of that of  20 years ago. It is possible to go even further than that,  and to produce the perfectly clean car. I congratulate the  Government on the policy introduced in the previous  Budget to give tax relief on liquified petroleum gas cars.  The Chancellor said this morning that the Government   would continue with that policy, which is to be welcomed.  To use pollution as an argument to justify the introduction  of road user charging is false.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In the context of what my hon. Friend  said about off the street, may I establish whether there is  a common view across the Committee on one point?  When my hon. Friend refers to cars and commercial  vehicles, is he classifying taxis in the latter category and  not in the former? Taxis are entitled to use off the street,  and the 20 per cent. of them that are not properly  maintained are very heavy polluters.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I completely agree with my right hon.  Friend. One sees London taxis belching out pollution;  they make a significant contribution to pollution levels.  
<P>
The congestion tax road user charging is a tax on  the people of London. At the petrol pump, they are  already paying 8.60 in tax for every 10 that they pay,  and that has probably increased this afternoon. In this  Parliament, the motorist is being fleeced of 9 billion with  no improvement whatever in public transport.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): Will the hon.  Gentleman give way?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am concluding.  
<P>
I want those members of the Committee who vote for  the Government's proposals tonight to know that they will  come back to haunt them. We will not let them get away  with voting for the introduction of further taxation on the  people of London. We oppose new schedule 8.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Benton. As it is  now 7.10 pm, are you minded that we should have a  break? My preoccupation   
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. An announcement was made at  the beginning of our sitting, although I do not think that  the right hon. Gentleman was here. We will suspend the  sitting at about 7.30 pm for an hour.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> If I may say so, the Government Whip  adjourned the Committee at 4.42 pm on Thursday  4 March. I regret that the people of London will not see  adequate debate on the measures that are being put  through the Committee this evening.     
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That that is a matter for the usual  channels. The point of order was about a break. An  announcement was made at the beginning of the sitting  and agreed on by the full Committee. The right hon.  Gentleman will have to take up any other question in that  regard with the usual channels.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> First, on that point, we might not  reach the two other big debates on charging by the  9.50 pm guillotine. The point raised by the right hon.  Member for Cities of London and Westminster  (Mr. Brooke) should prompt us to consider what we do  thereafter.   
<P>
Secondly, the debate is about whether to allow the GLA  and London local authorities to have road-user charging.  I will contain my remarks to the power of the GLA. As  my hon. Friends made clear to the Conservative  spokesman, the hon. Member for Croydon, South, and to  the Ministers, we support the principle that the power  should be given to the GLA it should not be imposed  on it or insisted on.  
<P>
The speech of the hon. Member for Croydon, South  was informative and entertaining. First, he is now on the  record as saying that it is Tory policy in London to be  against road-user charging. The Minister for Transport in  London under the previous Administration, Steven Norris,  gave an interview in this month's Capital Transport  Bulletin. He was asked whether he supported congestion  charges and parking taxes as ways of raising revenue.  He said:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I support road user charging because I believe it can reduce  traffic volume and raise revenue to provide the public transport  improvements that we desperately need."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That is clearly contrary to Conservative policy. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman will understand  that the elected Member of the House of Commons who  serves as the Front-Bench spokesman on London for the  Conservative party namely my hon. Friend the Member  for Croydon, South is the individual who lays down our  party's policy for London. He is not an individual who  happened to be a Minister in the previous Administration. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Of course. The shadow Minister for  London, who is also one of the shadow transport  Ministers, has said that his party is against road-user  charging in London. I was merely pointing out that one  of the most well-known possible contenders for the  mayoralty of London has the opposite view. We will  watch this space with interest. Either Steven Norris will  have to change his view if he wants to become a candidate  or Tory party policy will not be obligatory for Tory  party candidates. 
<P>
The second interesting point about the Conservative  party's approach was that the shadow Conservative  Minister said that it would not in future be against road  charging nationally a very interesting development  and that London would be the last place where it would  implement such a scheme. That seems a back-to-front  policy. Congestion in Britain is normally greatest in the  urban areas, especially in the capital. Therefore, the  logical place to introduce such a scheme is the capital. 
<P>
Thirdly, if road user charging is not introduced and this  revenue stream is rejected I assume from the  amendments that the Conservatives want to reject the next  revenue stream proposed, which is workplace charging,  and that they might oppose the third one, which my hon.  Friends and I have proposed where will the money come  from? If there is no independent way of raising money,  or semi-independent way, as we would call it that is  because we think that it is under the control of the  Secretary of State and if the GLA is to be capped, with  the Secretary of State deciding how much money it gets,  the mayor will be unable to obtain revenue. 
<P>
The term "light touch"	 is a great exaggeration of power.  The mayor will be unable to do anything unless the  Government of the day agree. If the hon. Member for   Croydon, South thinks that he is going to escort a Tory  mayor into the building to be erected in my constituency  or any other building on the basis that he or she will have  no power to do anything, and that that is the Tory policy,  he is mistaken.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We shall see. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Huges:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that we shall see.  Of course we will. I am simply flagging up the current  position. 
<P>
There was one qualification. The shadow Minister for  London said that there will be some revenue, which will  come from privatising the tube. The Tories were in power  from 1979 to 1997, and they did not privatise the tube in  all that time. Indeed, they nationalised it, then they never  privatised it. There are not many people in London who  believe that privatising the tube is the answer. 
<P>
Although we have a different view from the  Government, my hon. Friends and I have always argued  that there should be a public-private partnership of type  what we call a public interest company. We have, in part,  in this Committee and elsewhere, elaborated how we think  that that would work on models around the world, and we  shall continue to do so. 
<P>
The Conservative party has proposed having a mayor  with no power and no money, unless the tube is privatised.  That is not a policy which, going by all the opinion polls  and current evidence, will commend itself to the London  electorate this year, or in the elections in May 2000. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> To clarify our position, we do not think  that the underground should be a part of the authority. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I stand corrected. If that is the case, any  money from privatising the tube, which is currently in  public ownership, will not be going to a dedicated London  revenue stream ether. So goodness knows what the mayor  will have. Some people criticise us for having 1p which  goes a long way. The mayor will not have nay pennies to  go anywhere. Although the right hon. Member for  Bromley and Chislehurst will no doubt be happy about  that, I do not think that that is what Londoners want. 
<P>
My hon. Friends and I will support the Government  amendment and new schedule because we believe that  whoever comes to power in London should be able to  implement a road-user charging scheme. We shall take the  same approach in relation to workplace residential  parking. That does not mean that it will be easy or that  getting it right is not complex. We should get the best  advice from other parts of the world, using other examples  where it has been tried and learning from the examples in  Singapore and elsewhere. It will not necessarily happen  overnight. It will, and can, happen only when careful  consideration has been given to how best to achieve the  objective of reducing private transport appropriately while  supporting public transport appropriately. 
<P>
<H5>7 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
However, we have various criticisms. First, although  we welcome the concession, which is now in the Bill in  the form of the new schedule, that there will be a 10-year   period of guaranteed revenue stream, we think that if there  is to be a 30-year contract for the PPP there should also  be a 30-year guarantee. We foresee big problems if that  is to be the case, to which my hon. Friend the Member  for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) alluded earlier. 
<P>
Secondly, paragraphs 16, 17, 19 and 20 of the new  schedule appear to give the Secretary of State huge  powers to control the mayor. Paragraph 16(1) refers to the  initial period of the scheme, which it defines as being  for the first 10 years. In relation to paragraph 16(7), that  definition means that there cannot be another scheme  under the Bill, because the powers in paragraph 16 relate  only to an initial scheme for a period of 10 years. I agree  that if an authority did not start the scheme until year nine  it could then run for 10 years. However, the Bill does not  allow for a second scheme, following a scheme that was  started in the first 10 years, to be decided on by the  mayor certainly not without the approval of the  Secretary of State. 
<P>
Thirdly, paragraphs 17, 19 and 20 all require the  Secretary of State to approve what the GLA does. The  wording of paragraph 17(3) is a bit odd. It requires the  Secretary of State to issue guidance. 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with respect to the appraisal of whether any application of net  proceeds of a charging scheme for any purpose provides value for  money."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is a slightly odd piece of English. Paragraph 17(4)  states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Authority...and any London borough council shall comply  with any guidance"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Paragraph 17(6) states that if there is to be a change in the  charging scheme when the initial period begins or expires,  regulations, which will be made by the Secretary of State,  may make provision as to whether or when that change is  to be defined as a new scheme. Having looked at it  carefully, we believe that if the GLA proposed a change  of scheme to the Secretary of State and, for whatever  reason, the Secretary of State did not accept it, that would  immediately end the initial period and the dedicated  revenue stream. There is no provision to guarantee that  the next scheme can have dedicated revenue going to  London Transport.    
<P>
Fourthly, confirmation of the view that the Secretary of  State, rather than the mayor, is the power behind the  throne is to be found in paragraphs 19 and 20. The  charging scheme must have a statement of the general  plan for applying the authority's share of the proceeds  during the opening 10-year period, and has under  paragraph 19(3) to be approved by the Secretary of State.  Paragraph 20(1) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As long as a charging scheme remains in force"	, 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
the GLA it applies equally to boroughs have to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"prepare a written statement of their proposed general programme  for applying the authority's share of the net proceeds of the scheme  during the next four financial years"	, 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
which must be submitted "for approval"	  
<P>
I underline those words  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to the Secretary of State"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Therefore, at every turn the Secretary of State calls the  shots, decides on the scheme, gives it approval and allows  it to continue, and not the mayor or the assembly. 
<P>
<B>  Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I want to draw my hon. Friend  back to what he was saying about paragraph 17, and  particularly (6)(b), which is important to his argument.  The Secretary of State can decide whether the mayor has  changed a charging scheme by regulation. Therefore, once  we come to the second set of elections, a new mayor who  makes a fairly small change to a charging scheme may be  deemed by the Secretary of State to have created a  completely new scheme. In such a case the 10-year  ring-fencing of the revenues from congestion charges will  be deemed to be no longer valid. The concern is that,  although the Government have told us that they would  ring-fence the congestion charges for 10 years, paragraphs  16 and 17 contain a loophole. I call it Her Majesty's  Treasury's loophole.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Once the scheme  is in place, an existing mayor or a new mayor who wanted  to change it could be prevented from doing so, because  the Secretary of State, by regulations that we have not yet  seen and will allow to be made later, could define that  changed scheme as a new scheme. London First picked  that up in its briefing. It means that, once a scheme is in  place, for 10 years the Secretary of State has the mayor  of London by the short and curlies. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): Is that a  parliamentary expression? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It depends where they are. The reality is  that, once a scheme is in place, it cannot be changed. 
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is clearly  having difficulty, so I shall attempt to be helpful. The  Secretary of State's approval is essentially for the plan  to spend the proposed revenues that will be raised. The  Secretary of State does not approve, as I have had  occasion to say, the details of the scheme. As I have also  had occasion to say to the hon. Member for Southwark,  North and Bermondsey this is the point made by the  hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton if the Secretary  of State decides that an incoming mayor's scheme is a  new scheme, that new scheme takes precedence over the  previous one and therefore would guarantee 10 years of  ring-fenced, hypothecated funding. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister makes important points, but  we think that they are wrong, first, because, although the  wording in paragraph 17 is odd and the Secretary of State  cannot impose a different scheme, if the Secretary of State  does not like the way in which the moneys are to be  allocated, does not think that what the mayor says  provides value for money or has a problem with the  financing of the scheme, he or she can reject it. The  Secretary of State cannot interfere in the proposed  scheme, but can interfere on the basis of judgment about  value for money. 
<P>
The reason why we think the Minister is wrong on her  first point is that paragraph 16(1) says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In the case of any charging scheme which comes into force  during the period of 10 years beginning with the inception of the  Authority, the net proceeds of the scheme shall, during the scheme's  initial period, be available only for application for relevant  transport purposes"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Paragraph 16(7) defines initial period as 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the period of 10 years beginning with the coming into force of the  scheme; or"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
this is crucial  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such longer period as the Secretary of State may allow"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
If the Secretary of State does not allow it, it will not  happen. 
<P>
The shadow Minister for London, the hon. Member for  Croydon, South, has a list of amendments. We support  him on amendments (a), (b) and (c). We oppose him on  amendments (d) and (e). We support him on (f). We  oppose him on amendment (dd), to which he did not refer.  [Hon. Members: "He did."	] I beg his pardon. He did not  refer to amendments (e) and (f), but he referred to  amendment (dd). We certainly oppose him on  amendments (g) and (h), which are clearly wrecking  amendments that would apply the scheme only to a  non-residential area. The southern part of his  constituency, which leads down the Purley way and out  of London, is non-residential. The amendment is therefore  the Croydon, South amendment, which he wants to apply  only to his corner of London. To apply the amendment  only to non-residential areas by and large, London is  pretty residential strikes us as off beam. 
<P>
We support amendment (i) but we oppose amendment  (aa), which proposes the interesting but zany idea that  charges should not apply on days when there are  disruptions or strikes. The unions could have no greater  incentive to cause disruption than the knowledge that, on  such days, road charges would not apply. Moreover, if  road charging were not to apply in the event of industrial  action, how could investors in London finance, who  would be investing against the opposing revenue stream,  make predictions? 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam  (Mr. Burstow) will deal with issues concerning disabled  people at a later point. [Hon. Members: "Oh no."	] Oh yes.  We support amendment (k), which would require money  to be ring-fenced for the entire period, not merely for  10 years. Amendment (r), tabled by the Liberal  Democrats, is in a similar vein. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South failed to mention  that he supported the removal of paragraph 17, about  which the Minister and I are having a difference of  opinion. Liberal Democrats have tabled a flagging  amendment that would require the mayor to consult the  assembly. In the event of such power being granted, the  Secretary of State should consult the mayor and the  assembly. Logic would dictate that if one is to have a  power, one must have a sanction, and the immobilising  power contained in amendment (o) should therefore  remain.    
<P>
Nothing in the provisions commits anyone to such a  scheme. It would be unfair for Liberal Democrats or  anyone else to be misrepresented as saying that, in  supporting the new schedule and amendment No. 989, we  intend to deliver the scheme at any price. That should be  decided by London government, whoever runs it. We  want to give London government that power, partly  because the Government do not intend to allow it to set  its own budget uncapped. Therefore, it must have access  to other revenues. Londoners want investment, which they  cannot obtain without the ability to raise money.

<B>  Mr. McNulty:</B> The hon. Gentleman's speech lasted  22 minutes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is quite good. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> If I were to use the word that best  described the muddle that road user charges will  engender, your normally benign demeanour would  beclouded, Mr. Benton, and I would be ruled out of order.  Any objective person could foretell the pain, grief and  political cost that the Government and their wholly-owned  subsidiary, the Liberal Democrats, will bear as a result of  the introduction of road user charging. 
<P>
I shall not vie with the hon. Member for Southwark,  North and Bermondsey in respect of prolixity. The subject  can engender such emotion that one runs the risk of  speaking for a long time, but I shall instead make some  extremely simple points. 
<P>
As amendment (b) makes clear, taxation of this sort  should not be imposed without the specific agreement of  the assembly. That is surely the purpose of any such  democratic body. If Londoners are to have an effective  say in the mayor's policy on such as crucial issue, their  assembly men should have a specific power to vary the  level of charges and to influence the policy of the  mayoralty. 
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
On amendment (a), which relates to the "keeping"	 or  leaving of a car on the streets or roads, the notion that  Londoners should be taxed for keeping their vehicle  where they have no alternative place to put it, namely on  the street in front of their home, is preposterous,  regardless of the Bill's final terminology. They do not  want to keep their vehicle there, where it is more likely  to be vandalised and where, as I explained earlier, it will  incur higher insurance costs. The Government's proposal  to tax such people cannot be condemned strongly enough. 
<P>
The strike provision was derided by the hon. Member  for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The Secretary of  State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions  made his famous statement on the private-public  partnership on 20 March 1998, when he said that he was"	 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"writing to every member of staff in London Transport to explain  our policy and the commitments we are given to reassure them."	  Official Report, 20 March 1998; Vol.308, c. 1540.] 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
So much for reassurance. The National Union of Rail,  Maritime and Transport Workers is currently balloting its  members of strike action, and the recent 48-hour dispute  is still vivid in our memories. At the very least, the  Government should concede that even if the Secretary of  State writes to all members of the RMT, strikers still  occur on the London underground system. It would be  appropriate to remove road charging on the days on which  strikes occur. 
<P>
The provisions are a rat-runners' charter. Motorists in  London will find circuitous and devious routes, when  travelling to or from work, to minimise the charges that  they will incur they would be foolish not to do so. That  will cause perverse distortions in traffic patterns, which  will lead to disruptions in areas that were not disrupted  before the charges were introduced. They will also distort   London's economy. Marginal companies, which will have  to pay for parking spaces for their workers, may decide  that it is better to get out of London altogether than to  face such charges.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> My hon. Friend is nearly touching on a  matter that has not yet been sufficiently explored,  although it was raised briefly earlier and it is well  understood by my hon. Friends the Members for  Ruislip-Northwood and for Croydon, South and by me. I  refer to the effect at the boundary, where non-London  meets London. The Government's regime will affect the  cross-boundary flow of traffic in that region in ways that  we do not clearly understand. What will its effect be on  businesses that are close to either side of the boundary?  Does my hon. Friend agree that considerable problems  will be involved, and that they have not been explored  properly? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My right hon. Friend graphically  highlights a real difficulty, which was exemplified by a  reference that the Minister for Transport in London made  to Heathrow. Many of the workers who derive their  livelihoods from Heathrow airport travel to work from the  surrounding London boroughs and from outside London.  It is wholly inappropriate to subject them to charging.  Engineering and air traffic control personnel, for example,  have to travel to the airport at unsocial hours. Why should  they face charges when they get there? The charges will  already be high enough for airline passengers and for  those who work in the airport. We should consider other  workers in this context, including those who work  anti-social hours in the foreign exchanges in the City,  medical personnel, the police, district nurses, social  workers and other such categories, to which I referred  this morning. 
<P>
The entire undertaking is characterised by two  elements. The first is a power for the Secretary of State  to interfere, intervene, second-guess and control a policy  that should in a democratic, autonomous organisation  belong to the mayoralty, even to the extent of stipulating  the equipment that the authority may install. The second  is a propensity to interfere, as my hon. Friend the Member  for Croydon, South made plain, in matters that should be  the jurisdiction of individual borough councils, which best  understand local circumstances and can lay down  appropriate charges for their areas, if such charges are  necessary, that consider the interests of their residents and  not the preconceptions or policies of the mayoralty, which  is, by its very nature, remote from borough issues. 
<P>
The matter goes to the heart of the legislation, and is  the essence of the Government's failure to provide better  government for London as a whole. The electorate was  told that the authority for London would transform the  environment and, above all, transport for London. The  electorate was not told that the authority would lead to  greatly increased taxation for motorists and distortion of  the economy of London or that its elected representatives  would have minimal direct influence in the assembly on  the policy of the mayoralty. It is a recipe for conflict  between the mayoralty and the Secretary of State, between  the mayoralty and the boroughs and for frustration on the  part of Londoners. They will resent the charges, and will   not forget who introduced them. Nor will they forget the  supine silence of Labour Members, who purport to  represent their constituents in London, on a matter of the  greatest importance. We welcome Labour Members'  opinions; we know that many have considerable  experience that they could bring to bear on the debate.  Sadly, they have preferred to remain mute. London will  be the worse governed for it, and motorists will pay for it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I am in favour of the new schedule and  the provisions in the Bill, and find the inconsistency of  the Conservative party quite staggering. On the one hand,  it says that it would like the assembly to have the powers  to decide such matters, presumably after an election to  decide whether to put the policies to the people of  London. On the other hand, it says, like the hon. Member  for Croydon, South said earlier, that it would like a mayor  with a light touch, but subsequently say that it opposes  those powers. 
<P>
I am in favour of providing the assembly with the  power to implement road charging. This Parliament will  not implement road charges; as the hon. Member for  Southwark, North and Bermondsey said earlier, it, rightly,  gives the democratic government of London the power to  introduce them. 
<P>
The provisions in the schedule for hypothecation are  innovative and important in our democracy. During next  year's election, presumably the mayor and the assembly  will campaign on that policy. It seems that Conservative  candidates for the assembly will oppose it. Presumably  the debate will continue from when the Bill is enacted  through to the election next May. That is right, as the  issues that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood  mentioned will be before London. 
<P>
The failure of Opposition Benches Members to refer  to the business community's supporting the provisions is  strange. The Confederation of British Industry and  London First say that the provisions have received wide  support among the business community.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know that the  London Chamber of Commerce and Industry opposes  them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> Yes I also know that the CBI probably  supports them, as does London First. A debate is rightly  taking place on how we finance transport; the provisions  are an important way of doing so. They will add a new  dynamic to the way in which Londoners view public  transport and their cars; it is a debate that will have  important consequences. If the taxation raised through  road-charging levies and parking provisions goes back  into public transport and people see the resulting  improvements, that will be an important factor in limiting  car use. Our provisions are necessary. 
<P>
Opposition Members have said that the provisions are  undemocratic, that we are imposing taxation against the  will of Londoners. The opposite is true. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottoway:</B> We are talking about taxation without  representation. If one has taxation, the elected  representatives of the body that imposes it should have a  vote on the matter. 
<P>
<B>  Mr. Darvill:</B> The mayor will be elected and he or she,  and all the parties, will have a programme; as I said  earlier, the assembly is important because it will approve  the budget and is elected on a proportional basis. There  will be a spread of opinion, even among members of the  Conservative party. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have not had a chance to look back at  the budget resolution procedure, on which we voted,  while the hon. Gentleman has been speaking but if I recall  accurately two-thirds of the assembly is needed to veto  the budget.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> To amend the budget. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister corrects me, helpfully.  There is no way in which a party that is opposed to the  proposals could get together a two-thirds majority to  amend the budget. However, it could get 50 per cent. of  the assembly to vote against congestion taxes. If only a  straight majority were needed, the assembly would have  much more power than it would under the two-thirds  requirement. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I acknowledge that but the mayor will, in  the executive role, campaign on that issue. If the mayor  is elected through a majority of Londoners' votes, he or  she will have the authority to introduce policies. The  assembly as we have said several times will have the  important powers of scrutiny and of the two-thirds  majority, which will act as checks and balances on the  whole structure. That is the basis of the Government's  approach. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned  proportional representation and the election of  11 assembly men on a list system. Those individuals will  not have the close territorial connection of the other  14 members and it is a fundamental defect of the  assembly's composition that local interests, which are  crucial, will not, by virtue of the weighting of membership  within the assembly, have the representation necessary to  ensure that the wishes of people from particular localities  are translated into charging patterns.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> We are having the debate that we had in  regard to earlier clauses. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> But this is more important. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> Yes, it is an important part of the Bill and  it is therefore important that we have the debate, but I still  believe that having local representatives and the top-up of  the 11 members is the right balance for London because  it offers proportionality through the electoral system. It is  a safeguard for the people of London. It also ensures that  the opinions of all parties will be expressed when  important issues are considered. The assembly will have  the power to amend the first budget with a 50 per cent.  majority, which is important. 
<P>
Finally, the hon. Gentleman mentioned the capital  structures that may be required, which is an important  aspect of capital is investment in the facilities. There are   technological advances in the Bill, and I am sure that the  mayor and the assembly will have the opportunity to take  advantage of them, notwithstanding the fact that in certain  areas capital charges may initially be high. In the long  term, there will be a good amount of revenue with a small  investment in new technology.  
<P>
I support these important provisions, and I believe that  when the wider debate takes place next year Londoners  will support the proposals, which will be seen in the  election of a Labour mayor and many Labour members  of the assembly.
