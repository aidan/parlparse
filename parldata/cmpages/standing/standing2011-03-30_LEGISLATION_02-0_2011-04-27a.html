of Members if I explain about the amendment paper. Clause 1 stand part
has been proposed, and therefore no amendments can be accepted to that
clause. That means that amendments 1 to 5, which relate to clause 1,
have been ruled out of order. The grouped amendments that we are going
to take with clause 1 stand part all relate to clause 2, but are akin
to the subject matter of clause 1. They can therefore be debated with
clause 1 stand part and if appropriate moved later, as can new clause
1. That is exactly the

seeking your advice, Mr Gale? As you will recall, before the recess,
the Committee agreed a sittings order under which we would sit for at
least another Wednesday, because we realised that this was a fairly
controversial Bill and no amendments had been tabled for that sitting.
We were a little surprised about that, because the hon. Member for
Rhondda, who speaks for the Opposition, had said on the Floor of the
House that he wanted to put forward a range of amendments, but he had
not tabled any for the first sitting. During the recess, he tabled a
full set of amendments that broaden and deepen the direction of the
Bill. Sadly, however, the hon. Gentleman—perhaps while tabling
the amendments, I do not know—broke his leg, and he is in
hospital in his constituency this morning. I seek your advice, Mr Gale,
as to whether it is appropriate to adjourn and sit again next
Wednesday, or to continue with the business at
hand.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000017">&#160;</a>

Members on either side wish to move the amendments in his name on the

                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause goes to the heart of what the Bill is trying to achieve.
Essentially, it will create a duty on the Secretary of State. The term
Secretary of State is chosen carefully, because this Bill is intended
to influence Government legislation. When publishing draft legislation,
the Secretary of State will have a duty to ensure that the legal and
financial effect of that legislation on each part of the United Kingdom
is separately and clearly
identified.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause is also worded carefully to refer to draft legislation because,
if it were to go any further than that, it might encroach on the
exclusive cognizance of Parliament in respect of legislation. It is
saying to the Secretary of State that, when Government legislation is
prepared, we want spelt out at draft legislation stage its impact, both
legal and financial on each part of the United Kingdom—an effect
that we want clearly identified separately. The purpose of the Bill is
to ensure that, when legislation is passing through both Houses,
everyone examining it will understand both its legal and financial
effects throughout the United
Kingdom.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000022">&#160;</a>

actually pleased to be back here today. I have no other commitments
until 10.30 this morning and can think of no better way to spend the
time until then other than opposing the motion that the clause stand
part of the Bill. In fact, I oppose the whole crazy Bill. My
predecessor in part of my constituency until he retired—Sir
Thomas Dalyell of the Binns, known as Tam Dalyell—flagged up the
West Lothian question. The reason behind such action was the fact that
Tam Dalyell’s school was Eton and, believe it or not, he was
head of the Oxford University Conservative Association. It was only
when he saw what the policies of successive Conservative Governments
had done to his West Lothian homeland when he returned there from
Oxford that he realised that he had to switch sides and stand up for
people who were oppressed by those Governments who did not care for the
miners and
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Tam
Dalyell found out that people who went to Oxford, and others from the
shires—who seem to be well represented here today, especially by
the hon. Member for West Worcestershire, the presenter of the
Bill—were fixated on the machinations of this place rather than
the worries of their constituents. I respect Tam’s view. He
realised that, under devolution, some backwoodsmen and women would want
to ask why parts of the United Kingdom with a devolved Parliament
should allow their hon. Members to come here and vote on matters
relating to other parts of the UK without devolution. He was right. We
now have an example of what happens when we stir up the pot of that
little constitutional oddity, the House of
Commons.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said, I respect Tam’s view because he was opposed to
devolution. That is why he thought that the West Lothian question would
bring out such interminable arguments and the good thing is that, since
devolution

			Column number: 15<a class="bkMark" name="Column15">&#160;</a>
                           </div>has come about, there have not been lots of Bills
such as the one that we are discussing now nor has there been much
controversy. As I confirmed in a question to the Deputy Prime Minister,
both parties in the present Government oppose the Bill. They do not see
it as relevant. They are tackling a task in hand. I do not agree that
they are tackling it with some vigour, but it is important to those who
are represented by members of the Committee. Tam was right. People
would pick at the problem like a sore. Instead of doing what they
should be doing, which is looking for solutions to problems in their
constituencies by applying their own vigour and looking to the
mechanisms of the Government and their own endeavours with the private,
public and third sector to solve such problems, they would blame
someone else, which is what the Bill is all
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
clause 1, the idea that the Secretary of State, when publishing draft
legislation, would ensure that its legal and financial effect on each
part of the United Kingdom is separately and clearly identified is
complete madness. Let us consider a health Bill, for example. We would
have to work out exactly how many people from parts of the UK, other
than England, would come to England for operations because the cost of
those operations would then have to be charged back to the responsible
authority in that part of the country. Let us consider a higher
education Bill. What if the funding authority in Scotland that pays the
bills for all the students from Scotland were charged £9,000 for
every student who came to England? We would have to calculate how many
students would come from Scotland and, therefore, the total of their
student fees of £6,000 or £9,000, so that it could be
charged back to the funding authority in Scotland. That is how
ridiculous the clause
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
what is meant is some sweeping statement, in some small clause as, for
example, we usually get in a Bill about the financial or human rights
effects—just a statement, with absolutely no facts—then
the clause is worthless. If it genuinely means that the Secretary of
State, when proposing any legislation, should have to calculate the
amount that would fall to every jurisdiction, the task would be an
interminable and difficult one. We would have to set up a whole
department in the Treasury just to do that. Does the hon. Lady really
mean
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000027">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman for being here today
and for giving us such an interesting perspective on the Bill. As a
whole, the Bill allows for the possibility that legislation might be
described as applying to the whole of the United Kingdom. It might not
be possible to separate out in any specific piece of legislation what
the effect on particular parts of the United Kingdom might be. However,
in the case of legislation that could apply to one particular part of
the United Kingdom, the Bill might encourage parliamentary drafters to
draft the proposed legislation in such a way that it would be easier to
make such a
statement.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000028">&#160;</a>

contradicts the clause. If we have to have a Bill, for goodness’

			Column number: 16<a class="bkMark" name="Column16">&#160;</a>
                           </div>there was some advice on the drafting. If the
promoter does not mean it, do not put it on paper. Do not pretend that
one thing is meant by putting something else on paper that is not
meant.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
whole idea seems to be that there might be one or two Acts of
Parliament that could be described as entirely relevant to,
for example, local government in England and Wales—or in
England, since Wales is devolved. Would it not be better to have a Bill
that states that about local government legislation, rather than having
a Bill that pretends to be something that it cannot
be?<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Few
Bills going through this place do not have some effect on someone in
other parts of the United Kingdom. We might decide that we will do
something with the armed forces, as we have seen in Scotland recently,
with the closure of one RAF base already and Lossiemouth and Leuchars
still under threat, and that will affect people in the armed forces. It
will affect my local regiment, which is actually based in Kent at the
moment—honourable people that they are—and they are part
of the UK. That is just the beginning. We would have to define the
effect in every such Bill. In that example, therefore, we would have to
state the effect on Lossiemouth or on Fife of the closure of
Lossiemouth and
Leuchars.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is what the Bill states—that every single Bill would have to be
drafted so that it “separately and clearly identified”
all the financial effects of the proposed legislation. That is what the
clause says. If it does not mean that an armed forces Bill should be
treated in that way, then why is it an overarching clause applying to
all draft legislation? For goodness’ sake, if it really means
only local government and planning in England, the hon. Lady should
promote a private Member’s Bill on that issue, not this
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000033">&#160;</a>

there would be no requirement for the Speaker or anyone
else—such as the Secretary of State—to make any reference

not come under the terms of the Bill anyhow. Surely we are only talking
about devolved matters, in which the Secretary of State would have an
interest in stating whether such a matter particularly affected
Scotland, Wales or England. However, defence affects the whole of the
United Kingdom and would therefore not really be subject to the Bill,

it is important that I set the record right. I did not say that there
was no legislation attached to defence. Of course there is. The Armed
Forces Act is passed every five years, and there is one currently
before the House at the moment. That is true, but most defence
decisions are not under legislation. No law is passed in Parliament,
for example, to close an air base or deploy soldiers overseas. Most
defence things happen under of the royal prerogative as decided by
Ministers. They are not carried out under legislation in this place,
although the hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that from time to
time there is indeed legislation, such as the Armed Forces Act. I never
said there was none but there is very little. Where there is
legislation, it affects the whole of the UK and therefore would not be

The hon. Gentleman has just agreed that the Armed Forces Act, which we
consider every five years, would have to be a completely different Act
if the Bill were enacted. It would have to be analysed in a completely
different way. The Bill says that the Secretary of State would publish
draft legislation
and<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Suddenly,
the Armed Forces Act would become a mammoth task in sub-dividing all
the expenditure into different sectors of the UK. If that is not the
case, why does clause 1 of the Bill ask that we do
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
remember when I was the leader of a council in Scotland. I had a degree
in economics and was fascinated by accounting systems. We brought in a
zero-based planned-programme budgeting system and asked people to
allocate the use of all the staff and resources to every single thing
that they did, and if they could do that, they would get the money that
they demanded to fulfil that. The exercise turned into a gargantuan and
difficult task and took up lots of resources. It was very difficult. On
the scale of those accounts, it was minuscule. On the scale of the
United Kingdom and a service such as the armed forces, it would be
unbelievably difficult, but it is a good illustration of what we would
have to do every five
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
know that that is not the Bill’s intention. I know that it is
really about starting a process so that people can express their
grievances against the Scots and the Welsh for coming here and voting
on matters to do with their little shires. I know that that is what it
is all about. But the consequences of the Bill and this clause are not
well thought through. It is a silly Bill. The clause is badly drafted;
it has not been thought through and should be rejected. It worried Tam
Dalyell, and he was correct to be worried about it, although not
because it was a reality. I always said to Tam that his worry about it
was because he had been to Eton where he had seen the performances of
the people who run this country and who thought they could continue to
run it. He knew that the idea that the Scots, following devolution,
should then be allowed to also have a say about things in England and
cause problems in this strange place—where he served for 43
years—would worry some people. He
understood, probably better than I did, that there
are 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 18<a class="bkMark" name="Column18">&#160;</a>
                           </div>people who would be obsessed with the issue instead
of getting on with the business of trying to run the country, generate
jobs and look after the social welfare of their constituents.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So, it is a
badly thought-out clause. I have heard nothing said by anyone so far to
convince me that the clause is well drafted and would not have massive
problems for every single Act of Parliament. I will want to know
exactly what rights people have. As I have said before, my brother
moved to London when he was 16 to work in the civil service. He
continued in the civil service, eventually married and lived in
Gosport. In Gosport, he had to rely on the health service and the
hospital in Portsmouth let him down. It misdiagnosed what was wrong
with him. He eventually had a leg amputated and died of a blood clot
that was not properly treated by that hospital. My concerns for the
people who use the health service in Gosport, Portsmouth or anywhere
else are just as important as the concerns of the Members sitting here
today supporting the Bill. The expenditure cannot be allocated between
areas without substantial
inputs.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
had an operation in Glasgow called a radioablation, where one of the
two natural pacemakers in my heart was taken out, because they can
misfire once people are over 50. People come from over all the UK to
Professor Cobbe’s laboratory, as he calls it—he does not
even call it an operating theatre—to undergo that operation. I
have constituents who have had to come to London for major operations
that they could not get in Scotland. People from all over the UK go to
Newcastle for heart operations. How would that be allocated to the
Scottish budget, to the Welsh budget or the Northern Ireland budget
without making a joke of it? Are the supporters of the Bill saying that
they want that to go on? This Bill would have a broad sweep of a brush
across most Acts of Parliament, but what its supporters really want is
something that says that the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish
should get their noses out of planning business in the shires. I hope
that we reject this clause. In fact, I hope that we throw the Bill out.

would like to start my contribution by correcting the implication of
the hon. Gentleman’s earlier remarks, namely that those of us
who support the Bill are somehow or other Eton and Oxford, south of
England, county folk desperately trying to do down the Scots. He knows
that I attended Hillhead primary school in Glasgow, the High School of
Glasgow and the University of Glasgow, and that I am the son of the
Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. To this
day, my mother lives but a few miles from the hon. Gentleman’s
constituency. I did not leave the borders of Scotland until I was 21,
and am therefore proud to describe myself as a thoroughgoing, 100%

                           </div>shadow Secretary of State for Scotland. Within the
first night or two of my appointment I underwent a Paxman interview on
“Newsnight”, when he questioned me on some previous
remarks I had made on Scottish devolution. I stood by what I had said
previously. Lord Howard, the then leader of the party, found it
necessary, quite correctly, to dismiss me from my job. Being shadow
Secretary of State for six days held the record for shortest ever
political appointment. I therefore have a long and distinguished track
record in standing up for these particular issues as a Scot
representing an English
seat.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000046">&#160;</a>

am particularly pleased to follow the hon. Member for Linlithgow and
East Falkirk, not least because the arguments that he advanced in
seeking to undermine clause 1 were so extremely weak as to be hardly
worthy of discussion. The notion that my hon. Friend’s Bill
falls on detail—it was detail that the hon. Gentleman was
discussing—is laughable. In my 15 years in this place, this is
the first opportunity I have had to participate in a substantive
discussion of the extremely important constitutional issue of the West
Lothian question and how it affects the people of England as well as
the people of Scotland. Saying that, merely because Tam Dalyell had
been at Eton, it was a bad Bill, it was all awful and we all hate the
Scots, is absurd.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000047">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman gave two bizarre examples of why the clause is
absurd. The first was in regard to the armed forces, ignoring the fact
that there is remarkably little armed forces legislation, as we
discussed a moment ago. The second example was particularly bizarre. I
am deeply sorry to hear of the unfortunate experience of his brother in
the hospital in Gosport. It is extremely regrettable, but it is not an
argument for saying that Scottish MPs should have a great
deal of say over the national health service in England. After
all, my mother has been suffering in Stirling royal infirmary, a few
miles from the hon. Gentleman’s constituency. She went on to
recuperate in the hospital in Falkirk, which is in his constituency.
She is currently in the hands of the national health service
in Scotland. That is a matter over which I, as an English MP,
have no say. That matter is entirely decided by the Parliament in
Edinburgh. The funding for the national health service in Scotland is
accounted for entirely separately from that in England. If the system
can work that way round, why should it not work the other way
round?<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000048">&#160;</a>

misapprehension. Tam Dalyell did not say that this kind of Bill would
be bad or good. He had long experience in the House and knew the
obsessions of people in here. I think he also drew on his experiences
with people he had been at school or university with. As chairman of
the Conservative Association at university, he knew that people with a
certain obsession would pick away at the sore of grievance that
Scotland had devolution and that therefore Scots should
somehow be excluded. He did not argue for a measure in the form
of the Bill that we are considering. Look at the Bill—I was not
arguing what the hon. Gentleman claimed, although my
brother’s experience brought home to me in a salutary sense that
the English health system is important.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000049">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman has sought once again to focus on
absurd details in an attempt to undermine an extremely important Bill.
The great Tam Dalyell’s ancestor, General Dalyell of the Binns,
was responsible for hanging, drawing and quartering my ancestor, John
Parker, at the battle of Rullion Green in 1666. I was prepared to
overlook that little historical aberration in support of what he stood
for.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman is right in saying that Tam Dalyell correctly viewed the
matter as a major constitutional worry and, therefore, something that
would indeed be picked away at until such time as it was answered. We
are discussing only clause 1, which takes one step towards solving the
problem that Tam Dalyell correctly highlighted. I am not certain why
Tam Dalyell’s views on such matters should necessarily undermine
the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000054">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman makes an extremely good point against devolution regarding
the health service. From memory, he and I tend to agree on devolution,
unless I am much mistaken. I know that he his sound on first past the
post and I suspect that his views on devolution are sound, too. He
makes a good point that if a Scots person is in a hospital in England,
their MP in Scotland has an interest. One of my constituents might
break a leg in Inverness. I would have an interest in ensuring that the
Inverness hospital is a good one, but I cannot do so, because I have no
say over that whatever; that is entirely a matter for the Scottish
Parliament in Holyrood. That is the nature of the West Lothian
question, and we are trying to address it here.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman went on to say that he thought that some details of clause 1
were drafted in such a way as to make it almost impossible to
implement, and that appallingly complex financial calculations would
have to be made for every piece of minor—possibly even
secondary—legislation in this place. He may be right. I suspect
that my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire might take the
view that the precise drafting of clause 1 could be improved, but the
purpose behind it is clear, which I shall discuss shortly. Perhaps
words could be improved to prevent the kind of administrative and
bureaucratic nightmare that the hon. Gentleman has described. However,
for that to be the main thrust of his argument to undermine the clause
seems wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000056">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
can do that quite easily. For example, the ruling on a national health
service Bill passed in Westminster would be that it has no effect on
Scotland or on Wales. With other Bills, assessing the effect might be
much more difficult. Others might state that they equally
affect all the nations and regions of the United Kingdom—that is
quite possible. Devolution Bills, presumably, might only affect
Scotland—100%. Leaving aside the detail, including such a
statement would not be that
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000061">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
proposal seems to be an extremely important first step towards
addressing the West Lothian question. We know that something is wrong.
We know that 70-odd Scottish MPs coming down to Westminster and voting
on English matters is wrong. Why should the people of North Wiltshire
have their futures voted on by Scottish MPs when I can have no say
whatever on similar matters north of the border? Why should that be the
case? That is the West Lothian question that Tam Dalyell enunciated so
clearly. Only by dividing up legislation and assessing how it affects
constituencies in different parts of the United Kingdom can we take a
step towards addressing the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000062">&#160;</a>

strongly support my hon. Friend’s Bill and therefore clause 1,
which is at its heart. Some aspects or details might need to be
improved, but that can be done in another place or in later stages of
consideration. However, for the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East
Falkirk to attack the Bill and the clause on the slightly dubious
ground that Tam Dalyell thought that the question was a sore that would
run and run, or because his family had unfortunate experiences in
English hospitals, belittles the argument. The argument is vital, and
should not be tackled in that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000063">&#160;</a>

effect, which would mean that everyone could pitch in and have the same

another part of the hon. Gentleman’s argument seems to undermine
his stance. He indicated that such matters were extremely unimportant.
I think he said that a few people in this building are fixated on the
issue, that we ought rather to be down in our constituencies doing
important things for our constituents and that such silly matters
should to be dismissed because they are unimportant. What silly people
we are to be sitting here discussing what he kept calling a silly

                        <p class="tabbed">I
think the hon. Gentleman is absolutely, 100% wrong. The constitution of
the United Kingdom is our most precious jewel, and we tamper with it at
our peril. It was tampered with significantly when the devolution
settlement was introduced, and it is very important that we should get
things right. The same applies of course to the alternative vote, on
which there is a referendum a week on Thursday, and to the House of
Lords. Tampering with the constitution in an
unthought-through way is simply wrong, and to dismiss discussions about
our constitution as insignificant or silly is fundamentally
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000069">&#160;</a>

the outset, I reassure the Committee that, as far as I am aware, none
of my ancestors were slain by the ancestors of another hon. Member.
However, like my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire, I have to
pick up on one point made by the hon. Gentleman. He claims that we are
supporting the Bill because of some debating nicety—that it is
some wheeze for Members from the shires to pass the time—but it
is a real issue that many of our constituents raise. As someone who
passionately believes in the Union and its continuation, it is an issue
that we had to
address.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000072">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not a knight of the shire; I grew up in Hamilton in the central belt
of Scotland during the 1980s. I well remember the political debate at
the time, when policies introduced by Conservative Governments were
vehemently opposed by the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk
and his colleagues in Scotland. They were not simply opposed because of
the details of the policies, as was their right, but because the
policies were thought to be somehow anti-Scottish. It was argued that
because the Conservatives did not command a majority of the seats in
Scotland, they had no authority to legislate on matters in Scotland.
That argument was put vehemently throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and
that helped to pave the way for
devolution.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000073">&#160;</a>

the will of England. I am not saying that that issue is topmost in
people’s minds at the moment, but it does raise its head. People
do write and say, “Why is this happening?” It will
gradually gnaw away at the bonds that hold the Union together if we do
not address the issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000074">&#160;</a>

in that debate as a member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention. I
have to ask the hon. Gentleman where it stops. London has a separate
ability to legislate for the control of its services. It has better
policing than most of the counties of England and most of the parts of
Scotland. When do we stop excluding people in this process? At the
moment, the clause refers to parts of the United Kingdom. Do we have to
state how it affects London as opposed to other parts of
England?<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000075">&#160;</a>

Gentleman any credit. Four nations make up the United Kingdom. It is
perfectly clear that that is what we are talking about, not about
further devolution. I must challenge him. Throughout the 1980s, the
constant cry from the Labour party in Scotland—and other
parties—was that the Conservative Government measures were
anti-Scottish, and there was no democratic legitimacy for what they
were doing. That was one of the reasons why we ended up with
devolution. I am not going to revisit whether that was right or wrong,
but devolution has happened. Now the situation is reversed and the
people of England—I say this as a Scot who now represents an
English constituency—have a perfectly legitimate claim to say
that if a measure affects only England, only English Members should
determine
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000076">&#160;</a>

those that are devolved. There are issues that affect only parts of the

specify the mechanism by which the English voice should be heard. It is
merely the first step to defining whether a Bill applies to the whole
United Kingdom or to different parts of it, and the financial effects
on it. I warmly welcome the introduction of the Bill by my hon. Friend
the Member for West Worcestershire, which may be amended at a later

Falkirk is absolutely wrong. It is a real issue, and my hon. Friend the
Member for Milton Keynes South put his finger on it. It is not the case
now, but as I said on Second Reading, if a Government who had a
majority in the United Kingdom, but who did not have a majority in
England, started implementing policies in England using that majority
from elsewhere, this would become a very live issue, very

different perspectives on this issue, have said that we will set up a

get past my opening remarks. I thought it was worth mentioning the
commission. He is right; the Government, on Second Reading, did not
support the Bill and we still do not support the Bill. I did not,
however, want to describe it in the same intemperate way that the hon.
Gentleman has. He belittled the issue. The Bill raises an important
issue about the West Lothian question, which is raised on the doorsteps
by many electors in England. Indeed, many Scots MPs think that it is
relevant. Members of the Scottish National party who sit here do not
vote on things that do not affect Scotland or are devolved to Scotland,
because they recognise that this is an issue and that those are things
they should not be voting on. It is something that the Government take
seriously and we will address it when we announce the details of the
commission. That is worth
saying.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000087">&#160;</a>

and information for our constituents. As my hon. Friend the Member for

                        <p>The
hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk suggested that the same
problem applied to sub-dividing England, but clause 2, which is about
interpretation, sets out that for the purposes of the Bill, parts of
the United Kingdom means England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
It does discuss sub-dividing England. The hon. Gentleman did raise the
issue of London and matters that are under the control of the London
assembly and the Mayor. The definition in clause 2 of
“separately and clearly identified” means<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000089">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
concern that the Government have is that it is not particularly clear
what “legal effect” or “financial effect”
mean. Is “legal effect” simply a requirement to say to
which part of the United Kingdom the law extends or, where the
legislation extends to England and Wales—which are, of course,
one legal jurisdiction—in which one it applies if it only
applies in one of them? If that is what it means, it does not add a
great deal to the information contained in the extent clause of a Bill
or statutory instrument, or in the detailed notes that go with them to
explain their territorial extent. If that is not what it means, I am
not clear what it does mean. Given that it is not particularly clear,
the duty may be very wide ranging, which I think was the point raised
by the hon. Gentleman, and it may impose significant burdens on a
Secretary of State and be unnecessarily burdensome when they were
introducing draft primary and secondary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000090">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is correct. One thing that came
up in our earlier discussion was that we need to be clear about the
language we use. We have to be careful when we talk about Bills that
apply to different parts of the United Kingdom and about Bills that
deal with devolved matters, and those are not necessarily the same
thing. In other words, a Bill might apply only to England, but might
cover an issue that is not devolved. Similarly, when colleagues talk
about the West Lothian question, they are really talking about issues
that are devolved to the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and
the Northern Ireland Assembly, not just things that apply to them. It
is already the case that legislation could apply across the United
Kingdom, in the sense that a Bill’s extent covers the whole
United Kingdom, but it might apply only in certain parts of the
country, and that is an important distinction.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
thing that clause 1 talks about is the duty in relation to the
Bill’s financial effect, which was one of the issues that the
hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk raised when he talked about
defence matters. Under the present arrangements, all new UK-wide
legislation must already specify its financial impact, and it must be
drafted within Departments’ existing spending plans. If a piece
of legislation is brought forward, it cannot have any Barnett
consequentials, because it must be within existing plans that have been
agreed by the Treasury in financial legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000097">&#160;</a>

Government are not clear what “financial effect” means.
If it meant what the hon. Gentleman suggested, it would indeed be
incredibly complicated to set out. However, I am not sure that it does,
and that is part of the problem with the Bill. My hon. Friend the
Member for West Worcestershire has done the House a service by giving
us the opportunity both on Second Reading and in Committee to debate
such an important matter and to tease out some
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000098">&#160;</a>

Does he agree that, if the Government support the principle behind the
Bill but are worried about some of its details and consequences, it
should be incumbent on them to table amendments to the Bill in
Committee? The fact that no such amendments have been tabled to the
Bill show that the Government are either not content with the principle
behind it or have been slack in not tabling
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000099">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In recommending that the clause stand part of the
Bill, I wish to reassure the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East
Falkirk about several issues. I feel myself to be an embodiment of the
Union. As I said on Second Reading, my grandmother, Flora McLean McLeod
Morison, was born in Dunbar to a general practitioner from the Isle of
Mull so I have strong family roots in Scotland. I promoted the Bill
from the perspective of someone who cares passionately about the Union
and who is worried that, through the process of devolution—which
I also support and thus differ from the hon. Gentleman’s
predecessor—more issues have been devolved and thus more
legislative matters are likely to be brought forward in this Parliament
that apply to only parts of the United Kingdom. That was the motivation
behind my introducing the Bill. About 100 hon. Members can vote on
issues that would not apply in their
constituencies.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
assure the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk that I am proud
to represent West Worcestershire, which I regard very much as the heart
of England and the heart of the shires. There is no question about
that. I was pleased to hear the Minister echo such sentiments. The
issue is raised on the doorstep, so to say that we are not listening to
our constituents when debating such matters does us a disservice. Both
the hon. Gentleman and the Minister asked about the wording of the
clause, but I regret that they have been unable to propose alternative
wording that would satisfy
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause will put the requirement to spell out the territorial extent of
legislation on a statutory footing, as opposed to relying simply on
civil service guidance. Doing that will require drafters to think more
carefully, when they draft legislation, about ensuring that it can be
clearly identified in that way. The importance of that was discussed on
Second Reading: it is possible that the House might ask the Speaker to
certify that a Bill applied to a particular part of the United Kingdom
and, unless it were set out in the measure, that might put the Speaker
in an awkward position and politicise his role. Having it on a
statutory basis and subject to discussion in the House is extremely
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000105">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I respect the hon. Lady’s motivation, but
the points raised by the Minister and me have not been answered. The
clause does not provide for general statements about where financial
and legal implications will have effect. I hope that the hon. Lady, if
she was listening, accepts that people use the NHS in England and that
that is charged back to Scotland, and that even the effect of the
decision on tuition fees, which are paid by the Scottish Funding
Council for every Scottish student going to an English university, will
affect the education budget back in the devolved parts of the United
Kingdom. Therefore, the detail for which she asks is
different from the principle, and the detail is
flawed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000106">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not really want to ask for the indulgence of
the Chair and move on to clause 2, which starts to define all the
different meanings, but that will go a long way towards allaying the
hon. Gentleman’s concern about
clarifications.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000107">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> The problem is that, having looked ahead to it,
clause 2 does not explain in any more detail what those terms mean. To
go back to what happens with legislation, it is already the case that
Bills spell out their territorial extent. I know that the hon. Lady
says that that is in the guidance that officials use for drawing up
legislation and that Ministers use before introducing a measure, but
that seems to work perfectly well. I have not heard any argument about
that process being broken. If it is working well and there is no
problem, the House should not pass another Bill to do
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the hon. Lady can explain where the territorial extent clauses in Bills
are broken and do not work, we can look at whether that can be
rectified without the need to pass another piece of legislation. If
that is not the case, the Bill might make sense, but I have not heard
any reason or explanation about why what we do already is not
sufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> The crucial point is that when civil service
guidance is followed and civil servants work with the Secretary of
State to prepare draft legislation, they often state the territorial
extent in the Bill, but they are not required to do so by law. There is
simply guidance, which future Secretaries of State might choose to
dispense with unless it is put on a statutory
footing.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other reason, which I have just mentioned, is that the Speaker might be
put in a politicised position should the description of territorial
extent be used in the future, with the House’s agreement, to
inform Standing Orders and their application by the Speaker, and should
the Government of the day—whichever political party they
represented—be the only people who, through their civil
servants, had put such an indication in the draft legislation, without
its having gone through a statutory process, which is outlined later in
the Bill, of effective scrutiny by the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
interpretation is important. The Scottish National party, for example,
often decides to abstain on a particular vote if it believes that the
measure before the House does not apply to Scotland. On occasion, it
has found itself unsure whether there is any impact on Scotland through
the effect of the Barnett formula. It has, therefore, erred on the side
of caution in voting in such situations. Including a requirement to
spell out the financial effects, which is supplementary to the guidance
that the civil service is currently required to produce, helps those
who might, for whatever reason, feel that it is not necessary for them
to vote in a particular Division or on a particular issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000132">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall not speak at length, because I covered
several of the Government’s concerns when we debated clause 1. I
still do not believe that the definitions of “separately and
clearly identified” add anything to the current drafting of
legislation in setting out the territorial extent clauses. Indeed, the
definitions might make matters more complicated, because there would
have to be a<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“a statement in

                        </p>
                        <p>Bills
such as this one currently set out in the extent clause that the whole
Act would extend to different parts of the United Kingdom. Clause 2 is
not clear whether the specific territorial extent would have to be set
out for each individual clause and schedule in a Bill.

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
duty also extends to draft secondary legislation, as I said in the
debate on clause 1. Whatever we are doing, the duty should apply only
to primary legislation. Secondary legislation is already covered by the
vires of its parent legislation. Even if secondary legislation were
published in draft, it would have to conform to the territorial extent
of its parent legislation. The territorial extent of that secondary
legislation would therefore already have been considered during
scrutiny of the draft Bill or during the Bill’s passage before
it is enacted. Again, therefore, I do not think the provisions add
anything.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000136">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The final
point relates to the definition of the parts of the United Kingdom,
which refers to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
separately and does not take account of the fact that England and Wales
form a combined legal system. It is, of course, possible for
legislation to take effect only in one of England or Wales, but it
would still be the law of England and Wales, even if did not actually
have any effect in one particular
part.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000137">&#160;</a>

surely have been only right for them to table amendments. Having not

Lothian question or, as she rechristened it on the ConservativeHome

trying to do that for some time, but we have never quite managed to
make that name stick. However, the Government do not support the
principle or the detail of the Bill, because it does not make any
progress in solving the West Lothian question. We did not, therefore,
support it on Second Reading and we do not support the individual

                           </strong> My hon. Friend has explained the purpose of the
declaration. The concept of a declaration of compatibility is something
with which hon. Members are familiar from looking at the declaration
made on legislation about the Human Rights Act 1998. A significant
difference, however, is that in that declaration clear legal principles
are set out in the European convention on human rights, against which
the legislation can be measured. Ministers look at that legislation
carefully when making such a declaration.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000159">&#160;</a>

dwell in this debate on a detailed discussion of the European
convention on human rights. That would, of course, be out of order and
you would take me up on it, Mr Gale, if I strayed. However, there is
extensive case law on what the convention means, and when we discuss
clause 4 I will explain why the declaration under discussion is more
complicated. Because it is not clearly defined, a Secretary of State
would have a real problem in making such a declaration because it is
not clear what the Bill is being declared compatible with. That is a
real problem, but rather than anticipate the debate, I will go into the
issue in more detail when we discuss clause 4. I urge my hon. Friends

puts on a statutory basis new principles of legislative territorial

Although the principles may be welcome, we are talking about creating
legislation that will put duties on Ministers. There is a lack of
clarity about what is meant. For example, it is not clear how far the
Bill would require the Secretary of State to go. In the case of

the comparison we have used, the convention exists and there is
extensive case law so that we know with what the Bill is compatible.
All we have here are the words in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000174">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Would
the Secretary of State, for example, be fulfilling the principles of
legislative territorial clarity if he or she set out in legislation the
legal and financial effect, as required in clause 1 and interpreted in
clause 2? If that is the case—if including the extent clauses
detailing the extent of the legal effect of legislation is required to
fulfil the principles of legislative territorial clarity—clauses
3 and 4 are unnecessary. The Bill would do what it needs to do without
them. If the clauses mean something else and the Minister has to go
further, it is not clear what the Secretary of State would have to do
to comply with them. Would a Bill, for example, have to detail the
effect on citizens and on Members’ constituents, or would that
detail have to be in the explanatory
notes?<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill applies only to draft legislation, which is almost always
accompanied by a White Paper and is often subject to pre-legislative
scrutiny. Those mechanisms, which are already used by the House, are
useful for providing extra detail on the impact of legislation such as
why Ministers are bringing it forward and why the Government think it
is a good idea. I think those mechanisms are more effective than
including many more words in
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be a significant change if, rather than a Bill only containing
the wording of the provisions that change the law, we started including
descriptions of the effect that those changes would have. I am not
clear—and I am not sure that draftsmen, Ministers and Members of
Parliament are clear—about how people would comply with the
requirements in clauses 3 and 4. That lack of clarity might risk
creating a new ground on which people could challenge primary
legislation in the courts, either on the basis that there had been no
declaration or that a declaration was one that no reasonable Secretary
of State would
make.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause either does not add anything to the Bill or it is not clear.
After listening to my hon. Friend’s description I was not any
clearer about what the Secretary of State would be certifying in his or
her statement on a Bill’s compatibility. I am not clear about
the processes and steps that officials and Ministers would have to take
to be able to make such a declaration. When Ministers make the existing
declaration about compatibility with the Human Rights Act 1998 they
make that statement personally. The Minister has to take responsibility
for that, because it is legally challengeable. Ministers consider it
seriously before issuing such a
certification.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000178">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Will the Minister confirm that he continues to
believe that it is a sensible principle, as he stated on Second
Reading? I would have been interested to see what amendments he would
have proposed to the wording, but in general does he agree that the
principle of every citizen being able to see how they are affected by
changes to the law and how proposed changes to the law might affect the
constituents of Members of Parliament is a sensible
one?<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000179">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me draw the distinction I am trying to make
for my hon. Friend. In legislation we set out the changes to the law
that we want to see. With the legislation we publish White Papers,
which expand in more detail on why it is that we are bringing forward
that legislation and what we hope to achieve. The principle and the
detail of legislation are debated in the House, but we do not include
all of that wider information in legislation. In legislation we stick
to writing the law. We do not include all of the surrounding
information on the effects that it will
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000180">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not clear, and I do not think that Ministers and officials drafting
the legislation would be clear about what they had to do to comply with
clauses 3 or 4, which are linked, in order to make that particular
statement. Of course it is important that people know what effect the
law will have, which is why we try to draft it in a very clear and
straightforward way. Then we have extensive debate in Parliament so
that people are clear about what it does, but it is not as
straightforward as my hon. Friend thinks. That is why it is our
business to debate
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Much
argument is made about the effect of legislation, we tease out the
details and legislation is often changed as it moves through the House.
I do not think it is clear and straightforward. The burden put on
Ministers is potentially quite a significant one, without the benefit
of citizens being any clearer than they are today about the effect that
the legislation will have. That is why I think the Committee should
oppose clause
4.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000182">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am increasingly puzzled by the Minister’s
stance. Leaving aside his broad concerns with the general thrust of the
way that the Bill is drafted, the principles behind clause 4 are
incredibly straightforward. The Minister and the Government opposed the
motion proposed by the hon. Member for Stone (Mr Cash) that the House
should be sovereign. Similarly, they seem to be opposing something that
is as plain as the nose on your face. Of course it is right that the
citizens of the United Kingdom have the right to see how proposed
changes to the law will affect them, and that Members of the House of
Commons have the right to see how proposed changes to the law will
affect their constituents. To deny or gainsay those two principles
fundamentally undermines the purpose of having a House of Commons. Of
course those things are
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Minister chooses to vote against the clause, he will be saying that
every citizen of the United Kingdom does not have the right to see how
proposed changes to the law will affect them. Of course they do;
obviously, they do. As a Member of Parliament, he must recognise that
they do. His argument against the clause was that he could not quite
work out how the Secretary of State would conform to the terms of the
clause. He said that it would be very difficult: would they do it in a
White Paper? Would they do it in the explanatory notes? No doubt that
can be sorted out down the road. Surely we can find a way in which the
Secretary of State could
comply?<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
the Minister to say that he is uncertain about how the Secretary of
State will comply and that that is a good reason for voting against our
constituents’ knowing what is happening in this place is
bizarre. I therefore challenge the Minister. He has made his overall
opposition to the Bill plain by voting against clauses and has been

                           </div>humiliatingly defeated on three separate occasions so far. Her
Majesty’s Government have not taken such a beating in recent
times. Despite the Minister’s opposition to other parts of the
Bill, surely he can see that clause 4 is about an absolutely
straightforward and basic principle of democracy. I hope he will find
it in his heart to support what the hon. Lady has
proposed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000185">&#160;</a>

that I am making. Of course it is the case that citizens need to know
how the law will affect them. The job of Members of Parliament is to
scrutinise legislation in detail, which is what we are doing. I am
pointing out that it is not at all clear what the Secretary of State
would have to do to comply and to be able to make a statement of
compatibility. Alternatively, the position is not clear if they cannot
make a statement of compatibility but they wish to
proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000186">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 4 sets out what the Secretary of State has
to do to be compatible with clause 3, so clauses 3 and 4 are intimately
combined. There are already processes that exist in this House when we
are publishing draft legislation—the White Paper and the process
of pre-legislative scrutiny—where the Government can set out
exactly what they mean and the House can then tease out, test and
challenge Ministers on what they mean. But I am not clear about how to
ensure compliance. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire said that a way
could be found for it to work. That may be the case, but the Government
do not want to create significant burdens that will create extra work
and extra cost for Government, particularly at a time when we are
trying to do Government more efficiently and at lower cost, without a
commensurate benefit. If the Government believed that the burden that
the Bill imposed on Ministers would lead to a significant improvement,
and that it would result in Members of Parliament and citizens being
much clearer about the effect of legislation, the Government might have
taken a different view. However, we believe that the burdens are
potentially significant and unclear, and that they will not lead to any
improvement in clarity for Members or citizens. That is why we oppose
the Bill in principle and are opposing it in detail as we work our way
through it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042774000188">&#160;</a>

Member for North Wiltshire is not that the Bill imposes burdens that
may have some cost, but that it is not certain. The scope of those
extra burdens is not at all clear. As I said, on one reading the
territorial extent of legislation is already there, so the Bill does
not add anything. If that is not what it does, then it adds a

out a number of difficulties with the Bill as drafted, it would require
some changes, perhaps significant changes, in the way the legislation
is prepared. The Government would have to give proper thought to
guidance to ensure that the Bill could be complied with, particularly
if we were unable to deal with any lack of clarity about what the Bill
meant. The Government
