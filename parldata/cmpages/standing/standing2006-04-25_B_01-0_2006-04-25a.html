<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000473"></a>The

Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that there is a money

resolution in connection with the Bill and copies are available in the

room. I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given

of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to

called starred amendments. In addition, I ask hon. Members please to

ensure that mobile phones, pagers and so on are turned off or on silent

mode during Committee sittings. Finally, I am content on this occasion

for hon. Members to remove their jackets if they so wish. We come now

to the programme motion, on which debate may continue for up to half an

hour.</div>

<a name="060425127000017"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000474"></a>The

Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. David

Hanson):</b> I beg to

move,</div><a name="060425127000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">That the order

in which proceedings in Standing Committee on the Northern Ireland

(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill are to be taken shall be Clauses 8 and

9, new Clauses relating to Part 2, new Schedules relating to Part 2,

Clauses 13 to 17, Schedule 1, Clause 18, new Clauses relating to Part

4, new Schedules relating to Part 4, Clauses 23 to 27, Schedule 3,

Clauses 28 to 31, Schedules 4 and 5, Clauses 32 to 34, remaining

proceedings on the

Bill.</div><a name="060425127000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome you,

Mr. Taylor, and your co-Chairman, Mr. Atkinson, to the Committee. I

have served under you on several occasions and I know that you will

discharge your duty fairly and efficiently.</div>

<a name="060425127000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate in the Programming

Sub-Committee took less than 30 seconds, so I assume that there is no

opposition from the Official Opposition or others to the programme

motion and I hope that the Committee will support it. It gives us scope

for two days of consideration, although I hope that we can finish

earlier.</div><a name="060425127000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425127000475"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): I join the Minister

in welcoming you to the Committee, Mr. Taylor. I have also

had the pleasure of serving under you and I am sure that this, too,

will be a pleasurable experience.</div>

<a name="060425127000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is right in

assuming that we have no objection to the programme motion, but I

should make just one point, which I have raised before in Committee and

in the House. We have rather a lot of Northern Ireland business to

consider at the moment. We were due to sit today and on Thursday, but

the introduction of another Bill means that we will now not sit on

Thursday. In addition, we had a rather ridiculous 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div>situation on Tuesday or Wednesday last week, when an important statement

was made in the Chamber at the same time as an important statutory

instrument Committee was beginning&#151;the two items of business

overlapped, even though both were extremely

important.</div><a name="060425127000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

therefore ask the Government to be a little sympathetic to Opposition

parties, which do not have as many Front Benchers and officials as the

Government. I also ask them to think about their timetabled

legislation. The Bill deals with important issues, such as devolving

policing and justice matters to the Assembly. The other Bill, which

will be introduced tomorrow, deals with the important issue of setting

up the Assembly. Such issues are not trivial, and I ask the Government

to give a little more thought to the timetabling of Northern Ireland

business. Having said that, I have no objection to the programme

motion.</div><a name="060425127000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000476"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in clause 8,

page 7, line 28, after &#145;by',

insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;Her Majesty The Queen on

the recommendation

of'.</div><a name="060425127000025"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000477"></a>The

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the

following amendments: No. 12, in clause 8, page 7, line 35, leave out

&#145;Secretary of State' and insert &#145;Her

Majesty'.</div><a name="060425127000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">No. 13, in

the dismissal

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000478"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> I have just agreed to the programme motion, but

I do not intend to fill both sittings, although if we need to do so, we

shall. I do not want to drag debates out, so I shall speak briefly to

the amendment, which is intended to probe the Minister.</div>

<a name="060425127000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have mentioned in the

Chamber the fact that the police ombudsman, for example, is appointed

by Her Majesty the Queen, no doubt on the recommendation of the

Secretary of State. However, the chief electoral officer is to be

appointed by the Secretary of State. We had a long debate on that issue

on the Floor of the House during discussion of a separate

amendment.</div><a name="060425127000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was

concerned that there could be a rather incestuous relationship between

the Secretary of State and the chief electoral officer. It particularly

concerned me that, in circumstances that were not clearly

defined&#151;they were defined by the words &#147;public

interest&#148;&#151;the Secretary of State would have the power to

cancel a canvass of the electorate if he felt that

appropriate.</div><a name="060425127000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could

not satisfactorily tease from the Minister the circumstances in which

it might be in the public interest to cancel such a canvass. I have

tabled the amendment to explore the situation again and ask the

Minister why it is appropriate for the Secretary of State to make the

appointment. That seems inconsistent with other, similar

appointments.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="060425127000031"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000479"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b><i class="I"> </i>I hope that I can help the hon. Gentleman,

and I fully understand why he tabled his amendment. I refer him to the

statutory provision that provides for the appointment of the chief

electoral officer&#151;the Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1962,

in which no mention is made of Her Majesty the Queen. However, the post

is, is understood to be and is defined as a Crown appointment. The

wording of the clause will preserve the current position; in essence,

the chief electoral officer will still be a Crown

appointment.</div><a name="060425127000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is

no need for the amendment. In fact, inserting a reference to the Queen

would put the chief electoral officer, for the first time, on the same

statutory footing as, for example, senior clergy in the Church of

England. The amendment is unnecessary because the post will be a Crown

appointment. Given that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will

withdraw his

amendment.</div><a name="060425127000033"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000480"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his

explanation. The concerns that we raised in Committee in the House

remain&#151;we were not satisfied with the explanation on that

occasion&#151;but I accept that we were discussing a different

amendment on a different day. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div>

<a name="060425127000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

withdrawn.</i></div><a name="060425127000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425127000481"></a><b class="B">Lady

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000482"></a>The

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the

following amendments: No. 5, in clause 8, page 7, line 31, leave out

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000483"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I, too, am delighted to serve under your

chairmanship, Mr. Taylor&#151;in this and perhaps a second

sitting.</div><a name="060425127000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are still

discussing clause 8, which concerns the tenure of the chief electoral

officer. Amendments Nos. 20 and 23 stand in my name and I shall say a

little about each. However, I would like to remind the Committee of the

words of the Minister in his winding-up speech on Second Reading.

Speaking about the chief electoral officer and his independence, the

Minister

said:</div><a name="060425127000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

proposal will bring the chief electoral officer into line with other

modern approaches and modern terms and conditions of

appointment.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 13 March 2006;

Vol. 443, c. 1244.]</div><a name="060425127000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

would be thrilled and delighted to hear from the Minister which other

modern approaches and modern terms and conditions of appointment are

mirrored by 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>those of the chief electoral officer. I say that specifically because,

under clause 8(3), the period for which a person holds office as chief

electoral officer must not exceed 10 years. That seems clear. There is

no discretion.</div><a name="060425127000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">This

is where my amendment No. 23 is particularly important. It applies to

subsection (6), which drives a coach and horses through the provision

that the fixed-term appointment must not exceed 10 years. It sets out

an exception to that golden rule and states:</div>

<a name="060425127000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This section applies

in relation to the person who at commencement holds the office of Chief

Electoral Officer as if...the total period which under subsection

(3) must not be exceeded were 10 years plus the period of his

appointment before

commencement.&#148;</div><a name="060425127000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">If

the Minister wishes to have a fixed term and wishes to have, as he said

on Second Reading, the chief electoral officer brought into line with

other modern approaches, let us have a fixed term of 10 years and let

us replace the word &#147;plus&#148; with &#147;less&#148;. Let

us have 10 years. Let us have a fixed-term appointment. That is the

purpose of amendment No.

23.</div><a name="060425127000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to

amendment No. 20, which is the lead amendment in the group. Curiously,

subsection (2)

states:</div><a name="060425127000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A

person must not be appointed as Chief Electoral Officer for more than 5

years at a time.&#148;</div><a name="060425127000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

seems clear. However, it means that the person who is appointed as

chief electoral officer could be appointed for a week, a month or an

hour. I gently suggest to the Minister that one of the modern examples

to which he referred on Second Reading could have been a reflection of

the appointment of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. According

to the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, an appointment as ombudsman

may be full-time or part-time, but

it</div><a name="060425127000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall be for a

period of 7 years.&#148;</div><a name="060425127000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

was the modern approach to take to the appointment of the chief

electoral officer.</div>

<a name="060425127000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the Bill, the chief

electoral officer has no security of tenure and cannot be appointed for

more than five years. Amendment No. 20 would secure a basic minimum

tenure of two years for the chief electoral officer. That is a

significant and responsible position, particularly in Northern Ireland

where we have a history of electoral fraud. Can the Minister explain

why this phraseology has been used? Is it just poor drafting? Will he

accept the amendments, even at this late

stage?</div><a name="060425127000435"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000484"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I understand the spirit in which the hon. Lady

tabled the amendments. There is nothing unusual in the way that the

clause is drafted. It uses similar terms and conditions to those used

in other legislation, for example, provisions relating to the

commissioners on the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the

police ombudsman. The same conditions and the same method of

appointment that apply under this clause apply to those posts. All

those office holders, like the office holder we are discussing, are, of

course, independent of the Government. Therefore, they are useful role

models in respect of the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>appointment of the chief electoral officer. The time limit on their

terms does not in any way diminish their independence.</div>

<a name="060425127000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Lady identified,

under clause 8, the chief electoral officer can be appointed for a term

of up to 5 years, and nobody can hold the post for more than 10 years.

I have also made something clear about the incumbent at the time the

Bill is enacted. Denis Stanley has recently retired as chief electoral

officer and we are in the process of appointing a new one. I am not yet

clear, as you will not be either, Mr. Taylor, when or if the Bill will

receive Royal Assent. Therefore, we have said that the time scale for

the appointment of the chief electoral officer will commence when Royal

Assent is given to the Bill and when it is enacted. An individual might

be appointed in the next few months and they will have up to 10 years,

plus the period up until the Bill receives Royal Assent. I hope that

that clarifies

matters.</div><a name="060425127000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand

the reasons why the hon. Lady wishes to specify a minimum period. I

simply say to her that the normal practice is that individuals will be

appointed for up to five years and that will, in normal practice, mean

five years; there are few circumstances in which I can foresee the

Secretary of State appointing someone for less time than

that.</div><a name="060425127000053"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000485"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> Does the Minister agree that the present wording

indicates that the person who is appointed chief electoral officer, and

who will take up the work that Denis Stanley has been doing so

courageously and well for such a long period, can be appointed for just

a week or just a month? The Minister referred to &#147;normal

practice&#148;. Why will he not simply change the wording to make it

clear that the initial appointment will be for a term of not less than

five years?</div>

<a name="060425127000054"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000486"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I can confirm to the hon. Lady that the Bill, as

drafted, will ensure that a person can be appointed for a term of up to

five years. I am happy, outside the Committee, to reflect on the points

that she has made. There might be merit in specifying a minimum term,

but the normal practice for other posts is the same as is in this

provision. I hope that she can accept that. I shall happily examine

whether it is in the interests of the chief electoral officer and the

Government to consider her proposals, because there might be merit in

them. I shall not prejudge the case. The normal practice is proposed in

the Bill. Given those comments, I hope that she will withdraw her

amendment.</div>

<a name="060425127000055"></a>

Hermon:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister. I am glad that

I intervened, because following my intervention he gave a commitment,

honourably and rightly, as is his habit, to listen to representations,

particularly those from Members from Northern Ireland, who have

particular concerns having grown up there, borne the brunt, and known

what electoral fraud means and how votes are stolen. Stealing votes is

a serious criminal offence. The office of the chief electoral officer

is a particularly important one in Northern Ireland.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div><a name="060425127000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am reflecting on earlier

clauses, which I shall not comment on in detail. The Minister will know

from a debate on the Floor of the House last week, that the Bill, in

its earlier clauses, also abolishes the annual canvass and has

instituted a canvass that might take place at 10-yearly intervals. That

means that it is important that whoever is appointed as Denis

Stanley&#146;s successor has independence. Such independence is

brought about by a secure tenure in post of at least five years and up

to 10 years, and not by their having a short minimum period. If fraud

is creeping back into the system, and if the antennae of those in the

electoral office tell them that there is mischief, such as people being

registered to vote who are not entitled to do so, it is important that

the chief electoral officer has been in post for a considerable period

of time.</div> <a name="060425127000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reflecting

on the change to the annual canvass and the importance of the point

that the chief electoral officer should be independent and have

security of tenure, I look forward to subsequent discussions with the

Minister on this point after the Committee. However, given his

assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="060425127000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000490"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> Amendments Nos. 19, 21 and 22 relate to the chief

electoral officer him or herself, who will be appointed shortly. Again,

it is curious drafting that has caught my attention and led to my

tabling of the amendments. Clause 8(5)(b) is critical in relation to

the amendment. It contains a discretion, not a duty that</div>

<a name="060425127000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Secretary of State

may dismiss the Chief Electoral Officer if satisfied

that&#151;...</div>

<a name="060425127000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">b)

he&#148;&#151;</div> <a name="060425127000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">or

presumably

she&#151;</div><a name="060425127000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has been

convicted of an

offence&#148;.</div><a name="060425127000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">What jumped

off the page was the omission of the word &#147;criminal&#148;. I

am not a member of a golf club, but without anything to limit it, the

word &#147;offence&#148; includes offences referred to as

disciplinary offences, which are breaches of the rules of a golf

club&#151;or those of other organisations. I am sure that it is not

intended that the Secretary of State may dismiss the chief electoral

officer for a minor infringement of golf club rules.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div><a name="060425127000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 19 would ensure

that the word &#147;criminal&#148; is included in the subsection to

make it clear that the current drafting is far too wide and would

ensure that the wording is narrowed to make it clear that only a

criminal offence would be relevant. That would bring the wording into

line with the appointment of members to the Policing Board. I notice

that the Minister has his colleague who is responsible for policing and

security with him, the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,

the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward). Given the recent

controversy about appointments to the Policing Board, I am sure that

both Ministers from the Northern Ireland Office will know that the

Secretary of State may, under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000,

dismiss and remove an independent or a political appointment to the

Policing Board, if that person has been convicted of a criminal offence

in Northern Ireland after their appointment.</div>

<a name="060425127000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding amendments Nos. 21

and 22, I repeat that the office of the chief electoral officer is

important because its holder carries out a job that gives confidence to

the public in Northern Ireland. The person in question must be

satisfactorily qualified and remain qualified to command the respect of

the community in Northern Ireland, whatever community it might be.

Amendment No. 21 would insert a requirement for the Secretary of State

to dismiss the chief electoral officer if satisfied that he has been

convicted of a criminal offence punishable by a term of

imprisonment.</div><a name="060425127000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 22 would ensure that the Secretary of State must dismiss&#151;

<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> This is for the hon. Member for

East Antrim (Sammy Wilson), who, I am sure, will wish to comment on

this amendment. Amendment No. 22 would ensure that the Secretary of

State must dismiss the chief electoral officer if satisfied that he has

been convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to a term of

imprisonment, whether suspended or not. It seems incredible to me that

even if the chief electoral officer has been found guilty of a heinous

crime that carries with it a term of imprisonment, there is no duty

under the Bill to require the chief electoral officer to stand down

from his post. We are not talking about a member of staff in the

electoral office, but the chief electoral officer himself or

herself.</div> <a name="060425127000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

incumbent upon the Minister to accept the amendments so that there will

be no discretion for the Secretary of State and so that the removal of

the chief electoral officer will be compulsory when the criminal

conviction carries a sentence of imprisonment. I am not aiming at minor

infringements of the criminal law, but at the compulsory removal of a

chief electoral officer who has been found guilty of a criminal offence

that is punishable by a term of imprisonment. That is the simple import

of the amendments, which are all sensible and straightforward. The

Minister would do well to accept them.</div>

<a name="060425127000070"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000491"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> I shall speak to amendment No. 9, which may

sound a little heavy-handed and bureaucratic. However, I refer the

Committee back to our debate on the Floor of the House about the

control that the Secretary of State might have over the chief electoral

officer and the concern that was 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>expressed at the time. I refer to the opportunity for the Secretary of

State to cancel a canvass of the electorate that might be recommended

by the chief electoral officer, and the fact that his reasons for

cancelling such a canvass are apparently covered by the words

&#147;in the public interest&#148;. We did not receive a

satisfactory explanation of that phrase.</div>

<a name="060425127000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chief electoral officer

can be dismissed for the reasons set out in the Bill. According to

clause 8(5)(d), those include if</div>

<a name="060425127000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;he is unable or unfit to carry

out his functions.&#148;</div><a name="060425127000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

could be considered slightly vague. In the context of Northern Ireland,

in particular, it is important to have a chief electoral officer with

some degree of autonomy and independence. I am concerned that that will

not be the case under the arrangements that have been made.</div>

<a name="060425127000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not try the patience of

the Committee by going over the ground that we covered on the Floor of

the House, as hon. Members will be familiar with what was said.

However, if relations become strained between the Secretary of State

and the chief electoral officer, it should be made public why the

Secretary of State feels the need to dismiss the chief electoral

officer. It seems a bit bureaucratic to lay the report before the

Houses of Parliament, but I do not think that it would take up a great

deal of the Secretary of State&#146;s time. There are not many

changes taking place with regard to drawing up the list of electors,

but transparency and, more importantly, confidence in the process in

Northern Ireland are essential. That is my motivation in introducing

amendment No. 9.</div>

<a name="060425127000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425127000492"></a><b class="B">Dr.

Alasdair McDonnell</b> (Belfast, South) (SDLP): I want to add

my tuppence-worth to the comments made by my learned colleague, the

hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon). The point is that the chief

electoral officer needs to be seen to be independent and to be as

autonomous as possible. Others have expressed significant concerns,

which are genuine. It is possible&#151;I hasten to add not under the

present Government, as no such thing would ever happen with the present

team of Ministers&#151;that a future Government could try to exercise

control over the chief electoral officer.</div>

<a name="060425127000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The SDLP shares those concerns

and thinks that it would be right to build in that sensible safeguard.

All it will do is require the Secretary of State to set out his reasons

for dismissal of a chief electoral officer in a report to Parliament.

We think that is entirely appropriate. We are therefore pleased to have

the opportunity to add our names to the amendment and urge the

Ministers to take our genuine concern into

consideration.</div><a name="060425127000436"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000493"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his comments.

Hopefully, I can reassure him that the chief electoral officer is and

will be independent of the Government. The safeguards in the Bill allow

that position to be independent. It is reflected throughout the Bill

and in the way in which the current Government operated with the

previous chief electoral officer, Denis

Stanley.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div><a name="060425127000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the points that

the hon. Member for North Down made. I do not believe that the word

&#147;criminal&#148; is necessary. It is used in other

legislation&#151;and there are different drafting styles in

legislation&#151;but the meaning of this Bill is exactly the same as

the meaning of other Acts with regard to criminal convictions. It is

not necessary to specify that the offence in clause 8(5)(b) should be

criminal.</div>

<a name="060425127000078"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000494"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> Will the Minister just name one piece of recent

Northern Ireland legislation where the word &#147;criminal&#148;

has been omitted from in front of the word

&#147;offence&#148;&#151;just one?</div>

<a name="060425127000079"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000495"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I am the fount of much knowledge and I have taken

through a number of Northern Ireland Bills but, off the top of my head,

I cannot answer that particular

question.</div><a name="060425127000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

clause 8(5)(b) does refer to criminal offences, as the clause is clear

that the chief electoral officer can be dismissed only if a conviction

has taken place, and convictions are available only in the criminal

courts. Therefore, although I accept that the word

&#147;criminal&#148; is not included in the clause, in essence, a

conviction means a conviction in a criminal court, and that means

exactly the same as what the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment is trying to

achieve.</div><a name="060425127000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could add

the word &#147;criminal&#148; into the legislation. There is not a

problem with that, but the Bill, as drafted by myself and my officials,

will achieve the same purpose. If the hon. Lady so wants, I am happy to

reflect on whether the word &#147;criminal&#148; should be

included, but the effect will be the

same.</div><a name="060425127000082"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000497"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> Before I give way to the hon. Gentleman, it is

important to clarify matters, because I want to refer to amendments

Nos.21 and 22 that the hon. Lady has tabled. I differ from her because

under her amendments, the chief electoral officer would be dismissed if

he or she were convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to a term

of imprisonment, whether suspended or not, at any time during his or

her career. I want to ensure that a criminal offence would mean a

dismissal if it occurred during the tenure of the chief electoral

officer, not

historically.</div><a name="060425127000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

not suggesting that any future Secretary of State or, indeed, Her

Majesty would appoint a chief electoral officer who has criminal

convictions. However, the clause is designed specifically to ensure

that if a criminal conviction occurs during the tenure of the office,

the Secretary of the State can dismiss the individual. As we discussed

last week in the Chamber, previous convictions are matters for

consideration but are not a bar to holding the particular

office.</div><a name="060425127000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand

the point made by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson). There

may be a need for a statement on the reasons why the dismissal

of the chief electoral officer has occurred. Clause

8(5)(a),(b),(c) and (d) show clearly the circumstances in which a chief

electoral officer may be dismissed by the Secretary of State. It would

be an additional 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>bureaucratic burden for the Secretary of State to undertake the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s proposal. He used those words when speaking to the

amendment. I agree with him that it would be an additional bureaucratic

burden.</div><a name="060425127000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should the

chief electoral officer have need to contest why the Secretary of State

dismissed him or her, he or she has recourse in law, as does any

individual dismissed from a post. They could also make their complaints

public if they so wish. So if the Secretary of State had acted in an

underhand way, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, the chief electoral

officer could go public with the reasons why he or she was dissatisfied

with that decision. To add a legal requirement to produce a report for

Parliament would be a step too far. I hope that the safeguards built

into the clause will satisfy the hon.

Gentleman.</div><a name="060425127000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that,

I ask hon. Members not to press their amendments. I hope that I have

given a satisfactory explanation of the way in which we approached the

legislation and that I have satisfied hon. Members on the points

raised.</div><a name="060425127000088"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000498"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I am terribly sorry to disappoint the Minister but

I did not find his response satisfactory in the least. He kindly said

that he &#147;could&#148;&#151;I am quoting him

directly&#151;add the word &#147;criminal&#148;. That is

precisely what I am asking him to do under amendment No. 19. I

understand from the Minister&#146;s hesitation that he accepts that

&#147;criminal&#148; should have been

included.</div><a name="060425127000089"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000499"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> There is no hesitation on my part; I simply say to

the hon. Lady that the clause does what she wishes it to do. If a

conviction occurred, it would occur in a criminal court, and the

individual would be dismissed on that basis. That is an accepted

definition. There are differences in drafting styles between different

Bills, but that is an accepted definition, and I hope that it will

satisfy the hon. Lady that there is no need for her amendment, which

would add an extra word to the Bill but not change its

meaning.</div><a name="060425127000090"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000500"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister. I can assist

him with some references to recent Northern Ireland legislation on that

very matter. He might like to know that the Police (Northern Ireland)

Act 1998 says:

</div><a name="060425127000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Secretary of State may call upon the

offence&#148;.</div><a name="060425127000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is

written into the Act. Let me refer the Minister also to the Police

(Northern Ireland) Act 2000, a more recent piece of legislation. He may

like to know that schedule 1, which relates to the Policing Board, says

that:</div> <a name="060425127000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Secretary of State may remove a person from office as an independent or

political member of the Board if satisfied that...he has been

convicted of a criminal offence in Northern

Ireland&#148;.</div><a name="060425127000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The word

&#147;criminal&#148; appears in that Act. Those are recent pieces

of legislation in Northern Ireland in which the word

&#147;criminal&#148; is included. That is what I am asking

about.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000501"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I have no wish to cause a row where a row need not

exist. Essentially, the hon. Lady will be aware that the legislation

that we support has exactly the same meaning as her amendment. I am

happy to reflect on the matter with my officials and to write to the

hon. Lady. I would rather do that because as the hon. Lady will

understand, in Committee, the wording of legislation is carefully

thought-out by parliamentary draftsmen to have specific meanings. I

believe that the meaning of the legislation is exactly the same as it

would be if we added the word &#147;criminal&#148;. I would rather

reflect on the matter than accept the amendment for the simple reason

that there may be different

circumstances.</div><a name="060425127000095"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000502"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000503"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for assuring me

that, once again, he will reflect upon the inclusion of the word

&#147;criminal&#148; in front of the word &#147;offence&#148;

in clause 8(5). It just seems a simple, obvious request for

clarification in the Bill to make it consistent with earlier pieces of

Northern Ireland legislation. The Bill is poorly drafted; that is the

problem. I would like the word &#147;criminal&#148;

included.</div><a name="060425127000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The more

important issue&#151;and here I will have an argument with the

Minister&#151;is his refusal to accept the amendments that make

reference to the chief electoral officer, including amendment No. 21,

which

says:</div><a name="060425127000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Secretary of State must dismiss the Chief Electoral Officer if

satisfied that he has been convicted of a criminal offence punishable

by a term of

imprisonment.&#148;</div><a name="060425127000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alternatively,

amendment No. 22 says:</div>

<a name="060425127000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Secretary of State

must dismiss the Chief Electoral Officer if satisfied that he has been

convicted of a criminal offence and been sentenced to a term of

imprisonment whether suspended or

not.&#148;</div><a name="060425127000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister took

issue with the amendments on the grounds that they could relate to a

previous conviction held by the chief electoral officer. I am sure that

it is not necessary to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to this

point, but clause 8(5)(c) gives the Secretary of State the power to

dismiss the chief electoral officer if he is satisfied that</div>

<a name="060425127000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a bankruptcy order has been made

against him, or his estate has been sequestrated, or he has made a

composition or arrangement with, or granted a trust deed for, his

creditors&#148;.</div> <a name="060425127000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does it say

that that must have happened during the term of his office as chief

electoral officer? No, it does not. The Bill does not refer to a

criminal conviction. However, it does refer to a bankruptcy order,

sequestration or a composition arrangement with

creditors.</div><a name="060425127000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

humbly&#151;though in ill temper&#151;suggest to the Minister that

it is much more serious for a chief electoral officer to have been

found guilty of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment. That

should be in the Bill, and the Minister&#146;s excuse for refusing to

include it is woeful, taken in the context of the Bill&#146;s

provisions for dismissal on grounds of bankruptcy, whether past or

current. The Bill does not set a time

<a name="060425127000160"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000550"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. Taylor, for the

opportunity to discuss this clause briefly. Under the legislation,

donations to political parties in Northern Ireland from the Republic of

Ireland will still be permitted. In no way do I want to make a party

political point, but the concern is that donations from the Republic

benefit certain political parties to the exclusion of others. The

objective of much of our debate, and legislation that has been

introduced through statutory instruments and primary legislation, is to

normalise the situation between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I

welcome the attempts to normalise and, where possible, make comparable

the situation. Some of this legislation works towards that. One aspect

that does not is the provision for donations to political parties in

Northern Ireland to come from donors in the south.</div>

<a name="060425127000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a further

complication. It is possible for people who live abroad&#151;in

America, for example&#151;to make donations to political parties in

Northern Ireland not necessarily directly, but through citizens of the

Republic. That is a concern. I would have liked to limit the amount of

time for which the provision exists, stating that from, let us say,

2010, such donations would no longer be acceptable.</div>

<a name="060425127000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s

explanation for allowing donations from the south to be made to the

north is that the two countries are inextricably linked, and one party

at least is registered in both countries, so it is acceptable. However,

if we are moving towards normalisation and equalisation, I do not think

that it is acceptable for that situation to continue. Therefore, I am

concerned that the Government seem to be prepared to let it carry on

indefinitely, whereas I would have sought to end it&#151;not

necessarily today or tomorrow, but certainly by putting a three or

four-year limit on the arrangement. I look forward to hearing other

hon. Members comments, because I know that the issue is of concern to a

number of parties in Northern Ireland, and to finding out what the

Minister has to say about the situation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000551"></a>Dr.

McDonnell:</b> I very much welcome the fact that, in many

ways, this part of the Bill represents a sensible way forward. Some

would argue that the same rules on disclosure should apply to Northern

Ireland as to Britain. There are good reasons why that is not the case

for now. The simple reason is that Northern Ireland is not the same as

Britain at present. Political life, in particular, is very different.

Sectarianism, intimidation, extortion and violence all have a role to

play in that difference, and they played a significant role in creating

it. That is why the Committee on Standards in Public Life originally

asked the Government to consider a short-term and reviewable exemption

from the recording requirements in respect of donations to political

parties in Northern Ireland.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div><a name="060425127000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Matters have improved in

Northern Ireland, and I am grateful for that, but violence,

sectarianism, intimidation and extortion still remain fairly serious

problems. For example, during the Whiterock riots of last year, over a

period of three days 146 blast bombs were thrown, 115 shots were fired,

116 vehicles were hijacked and 81 policemen and women were injured.

Sectarianism remains a problem. Some 700 incidents took place in a few

months last year, amounting to about five a day. Paramilitary extortion

remains a big problem. In spite of that, two thirds of cases could not

be pursued because the complainant did not want the police to take

action. In many cases, the complainant will not approach the police at

all. All that affects people&#146;s willingness openly to support or

donate to political parties, and to contribute the finance necessary to

support genuine democracy and political life. Many business men would

like to operate on a cross-community basis and do not particularly want

to be strongly identified with one particular

party.</div>

<a name="060425127000165"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000552"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that while we are

trying to instil confidence in the political system, the secrecy that

surrounds donations and loans to political parties undermines it?

Extortion is a criminal offence, and it is about time that people

reported it and co-operated with the police. Does he not agree that

openness is the way to build confidence in our political system at

home?</div><a name="060425127000166"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000553"></a>Dr.

McDonnell:</b> I totally agree with the hon. Lady&#151;in a

normal society. The difficulty is that we still have a somewhat

abnormal society. While others might not be, I am fully conscious that

many people who would want to support me, or have done so, or have at

times supported my party, are subject to threats and intimidation from

sources of a paramilitary nature. I do not wish to subject people to

that.</div> <a name="060425127000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">My political

party needs money. It is an open and honest party that survives on the

votes of its supporters and on small donations from a series of

supporters. There is nothing underhand or dishonest about where we

obtain our funds. My point is that, in the short term, to declare our

sources openly is to put those responsible at high risk. I make that

point genuinely and sincerely, and if people wish to disagree I regret

that. However, I am not making it for any underhand reason. People are

threatened and intimidated, and I emphasise that this has happened to

my party&#146;s donors. For obvious reasons, I do not wish to go into

detail and expose them

further.</div><a name="060425127000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would

have been reasonable to continue to exempt Northern Ireland political

parties from reporting requirements beyond 31 October 2007.

However, we understand that Parliament wants greater

transparency. For that reason, we accept that donations above

&#163;5,000 should be reported to the Electoral Commission, although

we are adamant that they should not be made

public.</div><a name="060425127000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we

have concerns even at this stage, as we know that from time to time

paramilitaries have tried to infiltrate public bodies. For example, in

October 2004, a member of the Real IRA, one of the dissident groups,

was accessing personal information from the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>database of the Royal Victoria hospital. That is a concern. From that

perspective, we would be keen to have information lodged in London,

where it might be safer, rather than in an office in

Belfast.</div><a name="060425127000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light

of the intervention by the hon. Member for North Down, I emphasise that

the SDLP is not in any way in favour of unregulated political

donations. We accept the ban on foreign donations, as long as Irish

citizens and Irish companies can donate. Further, and critically, we

advocate the simplest and most effective of all regulation, a ban to

ban

all&#151;</div><a name="060425127000171"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000554"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. The debate is on clause 13 stand part. I

am allowing the hon. Member to make comments on other clauses in part 4

on the understanding that they are not repeated when those clauses

arise, but I request that he conclude his

remarks.</div><a name="060425127000172"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000555"></a>Dr.

McDonnell:</b> I am happy to leave my comments at that, Mr.

Taylor.</div><a name="060425127000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425127000556"></a><b class="B">Lembit

&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): The proposed amendment

aims to hold the Government to their word. They have said that they

want the final disapplication period to end on 31 October 2010 and have

planned for that in clause 17. However, they are notorious for

introducing plan Bs. We are concerned about that, and are therefore

sympathetic to the

amendment.</div><a name="060425127000174"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000557"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I confirm again that we are dealing with

clause 13 stand part. We have not reached the Government amendment on

clause 15, to which I believe the hon. Member may be

referring.</div><a name="060425127000175"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000558"></a>Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> In which case, I shall hold off. As you

rightly say, Mr. Taylor, my points would be better made on clause 15,

so I shall wait until

then.</div><a name="060425127000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425127000559"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Ben Wallace</b> (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con): I want briefly to

comment on clause 13. I am conscious of your comments, Mr. Taylor,

about other clauses. I could speak to clause 18, but as there are no

amendments down for that clause, perhaps it would be best to speak in

this stand part

debate.</div><a name="060425127000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment

of my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury would put a time limit on

the power of clause 18; that is, when it would cease to have effect.

Clause 18 raises some concerns, in that no sooner have we passed the

legislation than much of it can be changed by order&#151;within two

months, in fact&#151;by the Secretary of State. As the hon. Member

for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) said, the Government are

notorious for suddenly coming up with a plan B. Therefore, one

sometimes wonders what this is all for if within two months it can be

changed by statutory

instrument.</div><a name="060425127000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

speaking to the amendment and clause 13 itself, I ask whether it is

right that the clause is put in to allow clause 18 to come into effect

and remove all the work that might be done in this Committee and

perhaps in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>another place. I do not like having so many clauses that allow

legislation to be changed so soon after it has gone through the House.

In principle, that is wrong. Therefore, clause 13 and clause 18, to

which it leads, should be

opposed.</div><a name="060425127000179"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000560"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I should point out that amendment No. 10

has not been

moved.</div>

<a name="060425127000438"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

Wilson</b> (East Antrim) (DUP): Briefly, I want to echo the

points made by the hon. Member for North Down. The more transparency

there is about political donations, the better, especially in the

current climate, where there is great suspicion over how some parties

have raised money and why people have donated to them. It is important

for us all that there is a degree of transparency.</div>

<a name="060425127000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not accept the argument

of the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell). He said that

Northern Ireland is different and that there is intimidation,

extortion, violence, blast bombs and shots&#151;he went through a

whole catalogue of things. It is strange that someone who has lectured

us about the fact that everyone has changed so much should use that

convenient argument as an excuse for secrecy over political

donations.</div>

<a name="060425127000182"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000562"></a>Dr.

McDonnell:</b> All I want to do is inquire whether the hon.

Gentleman is denying the facts that I have placed before the Committee.

The facts are there as facts and they cannot be

denied.</div><a name="060425127000183"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000563"></a>Sammy

Wilson:</b> I am not denying those facts, but they are no

excuse for secrecy over party political donations. Some business men

make their party political affiliations well known, but none has faced

intimidation or been put under pressure because people knew the parties

to which they donated or were affiliated. It is important that there is

a degree of

transparency.</div><a name="060425127000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

other issue is how donations to political parties can be channelled

from the Irish Republic. Given that such donations are likely to

benefit one party alone&#151;Sinn Fein&#151;I would have thought

that the hon. Member for Belfast, South was keen to close that conduit

of funds. As has been said, many of Sinn Fein&#146;s friends from

across the world can channel funds through sympathisers in the Irish

Republic and so add to Sinn Fein&#146;s coffers. When one looks at

the army&#151;I use the word advisedly&#151;that Sinn Fein can put

out during elections, one sees that some of its members are paid daily

to canvass areas and sometimes re-canvass them four or five

times.</div><a name="060425127000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sinn Fein

councillors on Belfast city council say that they are allocated 30

people to canvass and re-canvass areas to ensure that people are

registered and that their message gets across. Such organisation

requires huge funding and disadvantages the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

party perhaps even more than mine, because he is in direct competition

with Sinn Fein.</div>

<a name="060425127000186"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000564"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> The hon. Gentleman will not be aware of a

conversation that I had with Mr. Seamus Mallon, a former Member of the

House. He told me 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>that Sinn Fein had 200 paid activists in his area, and that is from a

nationalist politician, not a Unionist

politician.</div><a name="060425127000187"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000565"></a>Sammy

Wilson:</b> That is exactly the point that I am trying to make

and why I find the attitude of the hon. Member for Belfast, South so

strange. The less transparency there is about funding arrangements or

conduits from the Irish Republic to parties in Northern

Ireland&#151;</div><a name="060425127000188"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000566"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman will have heard me say

that this is a clause stand part debate. Clause 13 relates to periods

of introduction, but I have allowed people a little latitude to refer

to the clauses that it applies to. I ask him to keep his remarks within

those

Wilson:</b> Thank you for that leeway, Mr. Taylor. I will draw

my remarks to a close. The provisions ought to be removed as soon as

possible, so that the laws on political funding in Northern Ireland can

be brought into line with those in the rest of the United Kingdom as

quickly as

possible.</div><a name="060425127000190"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000568"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> The clause states the commencement dates for the

Bill&#146;s provisions relating to donations. I should make it clear

to the Committee that the Government wish to see the situation in

Northern Ireland regulated as quickly as possible to the same level as

in the rest of the United Kingdom. We should move to a situation of

openness and transparency in political party funding and

donations.</div> <a name="060425127000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Passing

the Bill requires the rules on permissible donors and the declaration

of accepted donations to the Electoral Commission to be brought into

line with rules for the rest of the United Kingdom at the earliest

opportunity. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South has

pointed out several areas of potential intimidation, and we are acutely

aware that although we are working toward and wish to see the

normalisation of the political process in Northern Ireland, we are not

quite there yet.</div> <a name="060425127000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

recognise that there are still potential issues of intimidation and

threats, and that individuals in Northern Ireland still cannot openly

declare their funding support for any political party. Due to a range

of potential threats, they cannot publish fully their financial support

in the name of transparency. Clause 13 will establish a transitional

period from November 2007 to October 2010, at the end of which I hope

that Northern Ireland will move to full transparency. As Committee

members will be aware, clause 13 and later clauses create the potential

for donation declarations to the Electoral Commission to be held but

not published until such time as the Secretary of State and I feel it

appropriate to recommend

otherwise.</div><a name="060425127000193"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000569"></a>Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> But can the Minister not see the irony in

that? All that paramilitary organisations must do to ensure that the

Government never implement a change is carry on intimidating people who

donate to other parties.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div><a name="060425127000194"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000570"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a point that could

undoubtedly be accepted by the Committee. However, it is my hope that

the Committee, the Government and all political parties in Northern

Ireland will accept that during the next three to four years, political

party and election funding in Northern Ireland could move from having

no regulation&#151;it is entirely different from the rest of the

United Kingdom in that it has no regulation of foreign

donations&#151;to having regulation on both foreign donations and

political party funding donations, as in the rest of the United

Kingdom. Because of Northern Ireland&#146;s special circumstances, we

will move to full transparency over time. We have determined in the

Bill that that period will last until 2010, but it could be shorter if

the situation removes

itself.</div><a name="060425127000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that

the situation that the hon. Gentleman has described could indeed

happen, but I do not suspect that the Government will be in that

position in due course. I believe that Northern Ireland is moving

toward being a normal society. Tomorrow, the Independent Monitoring

Commission report on the Provisional IRA and progress on

decommissioning will be published. I believe that that will show

further progress, and that Northern Ireland is moving toward being a

more normal society. It is my hope that it will move

speedily.</div><a name="060425127000196"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000571"></a>Sammy

Wilson:</b> Most policies in Northern Ireland are subject to

equality impact assessments. Will the Minister tell us whether an

equality impact assessment has been carried out for the legislation on

foreign donations and what its outcome

was?</div><a name="060425127000197"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000572"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I am happy to confirm for the hon. Gentleman that

an equality assessment on the draft legislation was undertaken. I do

not have the details of the outcome before me, but I would not have

introduced the legislation if it was discriminatory in any way. I hope

that that satisfies

him.</div><a name="060425127000198"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000573"></a>Sammy

foreign donations will benefit exclusively nationalist and,

particularly, republican parties and therefore could not have met the

conditions in the equality impact

assessment.</div><a name="060425127000199"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000574"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> No, I do not accept that. I believe that the ban

on foreign donations will occur, but, as was referred to by the hon.

Gentleman, we have made an exception for the special situation in

Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. We have allowed eligible

individuals and bodies that donate to Irish political parties to

continue to donate to parties in the

north.</div><a name="060425127000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me put it

this way to the hon. Gentleman: I do not know what the 3 million people

who live in the Irish Republic will do with their donations&#151;if

they wish to make any&#151;and to which political parties in the

north they would make them. They might support the Ulster Unionist

party or the Democratic Unionist party in the Republic. They might

support the Social Democratic and Labour party or, indeed, Sinn Fein.

They might support a range of parties.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="060425127000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot speak for the 3

million people in the Republic and their donating habits. The point is

that because of the special relationship and the Good Friday agreement,

we have maintained that position. We will come on to amendments

relating to it in later clauses, and I would prefer to discuss such

matters at that

stage.</div><a name="060425127000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Irish

Government themselves have indicated that they are looking at their own

political funding regime. They have no imminent plans to introduce such

proposals, but they are looking at the possibility. In the event of

such changes arising, and under clause 13 and other powers in the Bill,

we could reflect those changes in legislation by order, should we so

wish. Certainly, Northern Ireland Office officials are in discussion

with Irish Government officials about the joint objective of both

Governments, which is to ensure political transparency in donations and

that foreign donations from outside of the island of Ireland are

banned, as they are in the United

political parties in that I am a member of the Speaker&#146;s

Committee on the Electoral Commission. In that capacity, I take, for

obvious reasons, a particular interest in any changes to legislation

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000579"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I shall try to assist the hon. Lady. In practical

terms, the amendments would allow Great Britain parties, regulated

donees and others to receive foreign donations from Northern Ireland

parties as a back-door route during the disapplication period, because

of the lack of regulation in Northern Ireland during that period. That

is the purpose of the

provisions.</div><a name="060425127000214"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000580"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> That is most helpful. So in clause 14 we are being

asked to approve back-door donations. Did I understand

correctly?</div><a name="060425127000215"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000581"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000582"></a>Lady

that.

but I am sure that he will get his opportunity

shortly.</div><a name="060425127000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

has now indicated that the effect of the clause is to stop back-door

donations to Great Britain parties, and I am delighted with that

assurance. I was particularly struck that, coincidentally, exactly a

week after Second Reading of the Bill on 13 March, the Lord Chancellor

made an important statement in the House of Lords about political

parties and funding, and about donations and loans in particular. He

indicated

that</div><a name="060425127000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Government intend to move amendments to the Electoral Administration

Bill, currently before this House, to make it compulsory for political

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000585"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I confirm that it is the Government&#146;s

intention to introduce regulations to that effect in Northern

Ireland.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div><a name="060425127000222"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000586"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> The Minister is obviously in a good mood this

morning. He may not have been willing to insert the word

&#147;criminal&#148; before the word &#147;offence&#148;, but

he is now indicating that, when there is a mind to do something within

the Government, they can move very

quickly.</div><a name="060425127000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

amendment, may I just test the Minister? The amendment tabled in my

name is intended to remove subsection (5) from clause 14, because it is

difficult to understand, and any member of the Committee may agree with

the hon. Member for North Down on that, not just the Minister. It

reads:</div><a name="060425127000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;References

in Schedule 2A to the 1983 Act to a permissible donor falling within

section 54(2) are to be read, in relation to any donation received

during the final disapplication period by a candidate at an election in

Great Britain, as not including a Northern Ireland

party.&#148;</div><a name="060425127000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment is a probing one, because I need to be able to understand the

legislation that we are being asked to approve in the Bill. As it

stands, and even when read alongside the relevant legislation, it is

extremely difficult to understand. Will the Minister clarify the scope

of the paragraph? My other comments about donations will be taken in

connection with clause

15.</div><a name="060425127000225"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000587"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I hope that through my interventions on both

points, I have assured the hon. Lady. For the avoidance of any doubt,

however, subsections (4) and (5) of clause 14 introduce a ban on

Northern Ireland political parties in the disapplication period up

to 31 October 2010 from making donations to regulated donees

or candidates standing for election in Great Britain. In practical

terms, her amendments would allow GB parties, regulated donees and

candidates to use Northern Ireland parties as a back door through which

they could accept foreign donations during the period in which

donations were not as yet banned in Northern Ireland. Ours is a simple

method of ensuring that during the period when the Act is disapplied to

Northern Ireland, there is no back door by which mainland GB parties

can receive donations via Northern Ireland. That is the sole purpose of

those two subsections.</div>

<a name="060425127000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that satisfies the

hon. Lady. With regard to the statement that my right hon. Friend the

Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs made about loans, we

intend to ensure that, with specific modifications, Northern Ireland is

dealt with in exactly the same way as the United Kingdom. I shall

introduce appropriate amendments to deal with that matter at

an appropriate stage during our

considerations.</div>

<a name="060425127000227"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000588"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister. That was a

helpful clarification, and I pay tribute to those who drafted the notes

to provide that clear explanation of those subsections. The Secretary

of State for Constitutional Affairs confirmed on 20 March that he had

written to the leaders of all political parties represented at

Westminster. Although five Sinn Fein Members do not physically take

their seats at Westminster, they receive money analogous to Short

money. Will the Minister confirm that the Secretary of State has

written to the president of Sinn Fein, the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams), asking that party for its

views about openness in relation to loans?</div>

<a name="060425127000228"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000589"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I am sorry, but I missed the hon. Lady&#146;s

point.</div>

<a name="060425127000229"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000590"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I shall sum up for the Minister&#146;s benefit.

I shall not question what that Secretary of State told the House of

Lords; I simply want it clarified. He said:</div>

<a name="060425127000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I have today written

to the leaders of all political parties represented at

Westminster&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 20

March 2006; Vol. 680, c.

12.]</div><a name="060425127000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point was that there

are technically five Sinn Fein Members and a political party known as

Sinn Fein represented at Westminster, but they do not physically take

their seats; so will the Minister intervene on the hon. Member for

North Down and assure her that the Secretary of State wrote to the

president of Sinn Fein, the hon. Member for Belfast, West, inviting him

to disclose the details of loans and donations to Sinn Fein, and say

whether those details should be

retrospective?</div><a name="060425127000231"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000591"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> Not only did the Secretary of State for

Constitutional Affairs raise the matter, but my right hon. Friend the

Secretary of State for Northern Ireland wrote to political parties in

Northern Ireland and their leaders to ask them for their views on it.

They obviously included the hon. Member for Belfast, West, even though

he chooses not to take his seat in this place. Although he chooses not

to do so, he and his colleagues are still

elected.</div>

the comments of the Lord Chancellor on 20 March on Government

goodness&#146; sake, if the Minister has indicated that Northern

Ireland should be brought into line with the rest of Great Britain in

to bring forward

amendments&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="060425127000247"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000595"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I do not seek to have a difference of opinion with

the hon. Lady where there is not one. The Government intend to bring

forward an amendment to ensure that the provision announced by the Lord

Chancellor applies to Northern Ireland. We will do that during the

parliamentary passage of the legislation. We are not able to do so at

the moment, because we need to consider in detail the consequences of

that provision for Northern Ireland. The hon. Lady has the assurance

that we will do it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000596"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister. I take it that

he indicates that the amendment will be made in this Bill&#151;or did

he indicate that the amendment would be made to the Electoral

Administration

Bill?</div><a name="060425127000249"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000597"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> The amendment will be made to the Electoral

Administration

Bill.</div><a name="060425127000250"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000598"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I am sorry, but I sigh with exasperation. We are

considering the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. We

have just had a stand part debate on clause 13. We have gone through

clause 14 and we are currently considering clause 15, but we have yet

to discuss clauses 16, 17 and 18. A substantial part of part 4 is

dedicated to &#147;Donations for Political

Purposes&#148;.</div>

<a name="060425127000251"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000599"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I want to assure the hon. Lady that what she wants

is what we are going to do. I do not mind being attacked in Committee

for doing things that she does not want us to do, but I find myself in

the strange position of being attacked for things on which I agree with

her.</div><a name="060425127000440"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

pm</div><a name="060425127000252"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000600"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister. That was a

helpful intervention for someone who claims not to be seeking

controversy or a

disagreement.</div><a name="060425127000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister will know that it is exceptional, unusual and extremely

welcome that Northern Ireland matters are dealt with by primary

legislation. It is unusual for us to discuss a Bill that we are able to

amend. The Minister will know that the vast majority of legislation for

Northern Ireland is delegated legislation. I will be aggrieved if the

Minister says that the Northern Ireland amendment to the Electoral

Administration Bill will be made by delegated legislation. We are

considering primary legislation for Northern Ireland clause by clause,

with part 4 dedicated to donations for political purposes and loans, to

bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of Great Britain. I

should have liked the Minister, on indicating that he intends to make

the changes, to make them meaningfully, where they could be properly

scrutinised in discussions on this

Bill.</div><a name="060425127000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Electoral

Administration Bill is in the House of Lords and will come

back&#151;</div><a name="060425127000255"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000601"></a>Mr.

Wallace:</b> The Minister mentioned his intention to

incorporate into the Bill the changes in the legislation going to

another place. However, it is not in his power to incorporate the

legislation in the Irish Republic. This is a perfect example of a

situation where he could introduce in the Bill provisions that would

rule out loans that might have an effect in the north of Ireland being

used under Irish

legislation.</div><a name="060425127000256"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000602"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention,

which moves this debate with the Minister on slightly. Perhaps the

Minister would like to reflect on how he will bring Northern Ireland

into line with the rest of Great Britain in the Electoral 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>Administration Bill. I should like him to resolve the matter of whether

that will be done by Order in

Council.</div><a name="060425127000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Picking up

on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention, my amendment would delete

the reference whereby before a Secretary of State in the British

Government can move, he has to be satisfied

that</div><a name="060425127000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a body of that

description or category would be entitled under Irish law to donate to

an Irish political party.&#148;</div>

<a name="060425127000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an extraordinary phrase to

appear in the Bill. I do not think that any member of the Committee

would be thrilled or delighted if it referred to a body of a

description or category entitled under French or American law to donate

to a French or American political party. Will the Minister clarify what

is intended under the

clause?</div><a name="060425127000259"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000603"></a>Dr.

McDonnell:</b> I am sitting here shell-shocked by the strength

with which the hon. Lady has made her arguments. In the context of

comments made earlier by the hon. Member for East Antrim, I can say

that there is a serious misunderstanding in the Committee.</div>

<a name="060425127000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an implication that

the funding for another political party that has chosen not to take its

place in the House is somehow derived from normal political fundraising

activities. The resources of 200 paid activists in the Newry and Armagh

constituency, as the hon. Member for Tewkesbury suggested there were,

cannot be obtained through normal political fundraising. Neither he nor

I could do that. We are talking at cross-purposes. When 200 such people

are put into a constituency, there is an element of paramilitary

operation involved rather than normal, legitimate political

operation.</div><a name="060425127000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will

make no apology, even if I am in a minority of one, for being

absolutely opposed to any restrictions on the raising of funds from

Irish citizens and corporations. I do not think there is any doubt

about my political views. I come to this place because we have very

much in common and to represent the people of south Belfast, but I have

a different outlook from many Members of the House and of the Committee

and I would like to see things done differently. That does not prevent

me from participating fully here and doing what I feel is the decent

thing.</div><a name="060425127000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The survival

of the SDLP is at stake, and we make no apology for drawing some of our

funding from Irish citizens who do not live in Northern Ireland. That

is quite legitimate. It is legitimate for people who see themselves as

British to support the Unionist parties and for the Unionist parties to

identify closely with people in Britain, and we believe that we are

entitled to the same right and

interchange.</div><a name="060425127000263"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000604"></a>Mr.

Wallace:</b> Does not the hon. Gentleman recognise that all of

his intentions could be put into British law by the Minister in this

Bill? We could help the SDLP and other parties. We do not have to rely

on Irish legislation that is not within the control of the Committee,

the House or this Government. We could achieve his aims without being

dependent on another state.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div><a name="060425127000264"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000605"></a>Dr.

McDonnell:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his

intervention, but it is in keeping with the principle of what he wants

to achieve for the Minister to make some reference to current Irish

legislation, which is fairly tight&#151;as tight as we want to

achieve here. That is a good enough benchmark until the objectives are

attained by whatever means we wish to use to put them in place

here.</div><a name="060425127000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to my

earlier point, the logical outworking of the Good Friday

agreement&#151;the Belfast agreement, as others may wish to call

it&#151;involves the recognition of people&#146;s right to be

accepted as British, Irish or both. When we finally accept that point,

it will leave relationships within these islands much healthier and

more positive, and we will be able to look forward into the 21st

century, rather than back to the 18th or 19th.</div>

<a name="060425127000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be entirely wrong to

suggest that Irish donations, or indeed Irish laws and Irish

regulations, should be treated or viewed in the same manner as those of

France, the US, Germany or any other place. That would be clear

discrimination against those of us who perceive ourselves as Irish but

operating in Northern

Ireland.</div><a name="060425127000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is very

important to accept and to remind ourselves that Sinn Fein funding is

not the issue. Effort is being made again and again to say that if we

take action, that will curtail illegitimate funding going towards Sinn

Fein. I do not wish to delay the Committee, but looking through some of

the reports to the Electoral Commission, we can see that it is not just

on fundraising that there are flaws. There are flaws and holes at

various levels. They relate to returns, money spent and how it is

spent.</div><a name="060425127000268"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000606"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree with me that it

would be much better to have state funding of all political parties,

including the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist party, to get away from any

reliance on donations and, of course,

loans?</div><a name="060425127000269"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000607"></a>Dr.

McDonnell:</b> I entirely agree. State funding could not come

half quick enough for me because, frankly, I have to spend far too much

of my time talking to and working with people on whom I depend for

donations and that distracts me from the work that I want to do. Bring

on state funding quickly, please. Without delaying the Committee, I

want to make the point that the measure that we are discussing is a

direct threat to me and my party, and to make clear my absolute

opposition to

it.</div><a name="060425127000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425127000608"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Alan Reid</b> (Argyll and Bute) (LD): It is a pleasure to

serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Taylor. I have concerns about the

wording in clause 15 that the amendment is designed to remove. Let us

look back to 2000, when the Political Parties, Elections and

Referendums Bill was originally debated in the House. The Liberal

Democrats accepted that parties that operated on an all-Ireland basis

should be able to receive donations from offices in the Republic of

Ireland. However, we recognised that, in the absence of similar

legislation in the Republic of Ireland, the inclusion of Northern

Ireland in the provisions of the 2000 Act, which bans parties in Great

Britain from receiving foreign donations, would create problems. We 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>agreed to the exemption of Northern Ireland from those provisions on the

express condition that the Government would seek talks urgently with

the Government of the Irish Republic on introducing similar legislation

in

Ireland.</div><a name="060425127000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,

what the Government of Ireland do in relation to the funding of

political parties in the Irish Republic is entirely for them, but can

the Minister tell the Committee whether any discussions with the Irish

Government have taken place? For example, were the Irish Government

willing to consider special arrangements for parties that operate both

in Northern Ireland and in the Irish Republic? Can the Minister also

explain who is or what bodies are allowed to donate to political

parties under Irish

law?</div><a name="060425127000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

for North Down referred to the wording in clause 15 that would require

the Secretary of State to satisfy

himself</div><a name="060425127000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that a body of

that description or category would be entitled under Irish law to

donate to an Irish political

party.&#148;</div><a name="060425127000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of

State needs to become an expert on Irish law as it relates to donations

to political parties. That is what we have concerns about. Ideally, we

should be reaching an agreement on this issue with the Government of

the Irish

Republic.</div><a name="060425127000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Electoral Commission has also expressed concerns about these

provisions. Its view is

that</div><a name="060425127000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is difficult to

achieve openness and transparency with such a

regime.&#148;</div><a name="060425127000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission

has stated that it would like to see a clear definition of the tests of

Irish citizenship, so that recipients of donations would be able to

check the permissibility of donors. It also states that the legislation

should clarify to what extent the commission will be able to check

political parties&#146; compliance with the requirements on donations

and whether it will be asked to give an opinion about the extent of

political parties&#146; observance of the requirements. Will the

Minister undertake to deal with all those issues, hopefully today, but

certainly before consideration on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000609"></a>Sammy

Wilson:</b> The remarks of the hon. Member for Belfast, South

are perhaps the most revealing made in the debate so far. He said that

the removal of the clause would affect the survival of the SDLP. He is

known for over-egging the pudding sometimes, but even if we take his

remark with a pinch of salt it confirms the point that I made in an

intervention on the Minister that this part of the Bill is

discriminatory and is aimed at one section of the Northern Ireland

community and one part of the body politic.</div>

<a name="060425127000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that any

Unionist party could make the same comment and claim that without

clause 15 its very survival&#151;or any part of its financial

arrangements&#151;would be adversely affected. The provisions are

particularly directed at the SDLP and will benefit Sinn Fein even more.

Therefore, they do not pass one of the essential tests that Northern

Ireland legislation is supposed to pass&#151;namely, that it should

undergo an equality impact assessment and should not go ahead without

good reason, and indeed, usually mitigation as well.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div><a name="060425127000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be interested to hear

from the Minister, now that we have heard from the hon. Member for

Belfast, South, what he believes the import of the provision to be and

how it got through an equality impact assessment. Anyone in Northern

Ireland would find it difficult to accept the Minister&#146;s

assurance that the clause would have no adverse impact on any section

of the community.</div><a name="060425127000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Member for Belfast, South has made much of the need for the clause

to be passed, to reflect his Irishness. As a Unionist, I respect the

fact that he looks more towards the Irish Republic than towards the

rest of the United Kingdom. However, that does not by any stretch of

the imagination justify determining the rules for fundraising and

political donations in Northern Ireland, which is a part of the United

Kingdom, by means of laws established in another country&#151;albeit

one with which some people in Northern Ireland might have an

affinity&#151;over which neither the hon. Gentleman nor I, nor any

Member of the House, has any

control.</div><a name="060425127000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not

acceptable&#151;especially in the light of the record of some parties

in the Republic, the laxity of the rules that apply to political

donations there and the way parties are allowed to raise money. Some of

the stories of sleaze emanating from the Irish Republic would make the

honours-for-loans affair here look quite acceptable or even

honourable.</div><a name="060425127000281"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000610"></a>Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> Yet is not that very example testimony to the

importance of transparency? The Government&#146;s recent experience

underlines what happens if one gives loopholes for

secrecy.</div><a name="060425127000282"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000611"></a>Sammy

Wilson:</b> Absolutely, and that is why I do not believe that

this clause is acceptable. We would not wish the standards that apply

in the Irish Republic to be translated to us. That is not a dig at what

happens in another country&#151;well, I suppose it is. It also

reflects on politicians in Northern Ireland parties if it is seen that

the rules are so lax that the required degree of transparency does not

exist and there is secrecy that allows parties to hide behind a

smokescreen when it comes to raising finance.</div>

<a name="060425127000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not particularly agree

with the remarks of the hon. Member for Belfast, South on state

funding. Although we have security problems in Northern

Ireland&#151;members of my party sometimes seek to highlight them

more than members of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party do&#151;that

is not a reason for having a cloud of secrecy obscuring the way parties

raise

funds.</div><a name="060425127000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Referring to

an earlier clause, the Minister said he wished to close the back door

on foreign donations to parties in Great Britain. Yet, at the same

time, he is leaving the back door open for foreign donations to parties

in Northern Ireland. As a Unionist, I want the same standards to apply

to fundraising for parties in Northern Ireland as apply for parties in

Great Britain. I also believe that having that degree of transparency

in fundraising is a safeguard for parties.</div>

<a name="060425127000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">For all those reasons, the

amendment is sensible. It would give safeguards to the parties in

Northern Ireland and ensure the integrity of any legislation covering

party political donations. It would also stop 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>back-door funding. Some of that might well go to the Social Democratic

and Labour party, but I believe that far more goes to Sinn Fein. We

know from all the other financial arrangements it has had in the past,

such as money laundering, that it has no qualms about how funds are

raised or where money comes from. Unfortunately, Sinn Fein is now

probably one of the richest parties in the United Kingdom per member.

It has used that fact to good effect to inflate its political standing

in Northern

Ireland.</div><a name="060425127000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

arguments of the Minister and the hon. Member for Belfast, South do not

withstand scrutiny, and the amendment ought to be agreed

to.</div><a name="060425127000287"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000612"></a>Mr.

Wallace:</b> Unlike the Minister, I have yet to hear the

Government talk about the relevant Irish legislation, and I am

therefore unsure whether we in the Committee or the House in general

have been informed about what it means to hand over some power to

Ireland to set electoral rules and laws over us&#151;or certainly

over Northern Ireland and the political parties there. I therefore made

the effort to look at the Irish legislation. In fact, I looked at two

Acts in particular: the Irish Electoral Act 1997 and our Political

Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 as it pertains to the

Republic of

Ireland.</div><a name="060425127000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">To do so is

important, because there are clear exemptions in Ireland that we would

not be happy about having in our legislation. For example, all that one

needs to do to donate to a political party in the Republic of Ireland

is be an Irish citizen. One does not have to live anywhere in

particular. One also can donate through support groups, as they are

called, or friends. The most famous are Noraid and Friends of Sinn

Fein, which are highly proactive and have on many occasions been

involved in raising more than funds for political

parties.</div><a name="060425127000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have no

control over that Irish legislation&#151;not yesterday, not today and

certainly not tomorrow. As it stands, it would allow undeclared loans

to be made to political parties. That is the point that I was trying to

raise earlier with the Minister. He does not have control over the

legislation going through the Lords at the moment; he cannot ask for an

amendment that allows us to cater for Irish

legislation.</div><a name="060425127000290"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000613"></a>Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> I feel it is in order to check whether the

hon. Gentleman agrees that it is utterly unacceptable in any moral

context for a party operating in the United Kingdom to accept loans

from abroad and not declare

them.</div><a name="060425127000291"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000614"></a>Mr.

Wallace:</b> I would certainly say that that has been the

thrust of legislation since I have been a Member of the House. I do not

think that I would want to do that, nor is it appropriate that people

who are arrested for fraud are involved in donating to political

parties. If the Minister were to go to the Committee in the other place

and ask it to cater specifically for Irish legislation, it would

probably say, &#147;No, you have your chance: here is your Bill, so

why do you not do it?&#148; This is a missed opportunity.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div><a name="060425127000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the support groups, the

Standards of Public Office Commission in Ireland will give one the

details of donors because, interestingly, Ireland has transparency for

its donors. I recognise that Northern Ireland is a special case and

that we should allow some leeway in Northern Ireland legislation to

ensure that, for now, anonymity is allowed&#151;certainly outside the

Electoral

Commission.</div><a name="060425127000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

clear that one party&#151;Sinn Fein, which I have chosen

specifically&#151;has received nearly $1 million from support groups

outside the Republic of Ireland since 1997. In an election year, it is

usual for it to receive some $200,000 to $250,000. In addition, it has

received other sums of money from citizens who live outside the

Republic. That is important, as this party generates a lot of money in

a way that it could not in the north of Ireland, nor could any other

party.</div><a name="060425127000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

could use the legislation to cover the aims of the SDLP or the

nationalist parties or those that receive funding from the

south&#151;they can have all the exemptions they like. We could say

that an Irish citizen living in the Republic of Ireland would be

allowed to donate and that a party incorporated north and south of the

border could donate&#151;we could do all that&#151;but to turn a

blind eye and say, &#147;Well, we&#146;ll leave it up to the Dail

to decide, in whichever year,&#148; is short-sighted and certainly

foolish.</div> <a name="060425127000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not

know what position Sinn Fein will take in elections in the next few

years. One has only to listen to the Minister for Justice in the Irish

Republic to realise that there are serious concerns about the position

Sinn Fein might achieve in the Republic and about the influence it

might have&#151;rightly, if elected&#151;on future legislation. If

the number of exceptions and exemptions given to Sinn Fein in the north

are any yardstick to go by, if they are given in the south, I fear for

the future of some Northern Ireland parties, whether nationalist or

republican, if, yet again, they are treated unfairly while an

individual party is

favoured.</div><a name="060425127000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a

Conservative, I do not believe in state funding. I notice that hon.

Members on both sides of the Committee have stated their support for

it. There is one party in the United Kingdom that is state funded.

Because of the exemptions to the Short rule and its wider remit in

receiving state funding, the one party in the United Kingdom that

receives state funding, outside the House of Commons, is Sinn Fein.

That is yet another irony of the peace process. The one party that is

benefiting from all the exceptions and help is not the nationalist

SDLP, which plays by the rules, but the other party, which does

not.</div> <a name="060425127000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">With clause 15,

we therefore get rid of our responsibilities for producing good

legislation to Ireland without even trying to focus on what we are

trying to achieve. That is an opportunity missed and it will not help

the process.</div> <a name="060425127000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find

it fairly discourteous that the Minister and the Northern Ireland

Office have not referred us to or provided us with the detail of Irish

legislation, so that we know what that means&#151;it is important. I

am interested to know whether the Minister will refer to those Irish

Acts and to how people can get round things, and whether he will

explain how we can be sure that those Acts protect the interests of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000615"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am grateful for the contributions from

hon. Members from all parts of the Committee. I can tell the hon.

Members for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) and for East

Antrim straight away that we have an honest disagreement. I share the

view of my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South, in that the

clause states that Irish citizens and bodies should be allowed to make

donations to political parties in Northern Ireland to take account of

the historic nature of the special role that the Republic of Ireland

has in the affairs of Northern Ireland. As my hon. Friend indicated, it

is entirely consistent with the Belfast agreement&#151;the Good

Friday agreement&#151;that relationships between the Republic of

Ireland and Northern Ireland on such matters should

appertain.</div> <a name="060425127000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

understand where hon. Members are coming. From their perspective, the

Republic of Ireland is a foreign power and should be deemed as such

under the Bill, as France, Germany, America, Australia or anywhere else

in the world would be. However, I share my hon. Friend&#146;s view

that it is quite clear that, when implemented, the legislation will in

due course ban foreign donations. We have included a difference in

relation to the Republic of Ireland because there is a relationship

with the Republic of Ireland, whether hon. Members like that

relationship or not, with regard to shared objectives, a shared future

and shared aspects of the democratic process. For the reasons that my

hon. Friend outlined, in relation to the Belfast agreement, that is

part of the

principle.</div><a name="060425127000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the

hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) mentioned, we have on a

number of occasions discussed with the Irish Government their electoral

legislation and the possibility of their changing it. We have

had discussions at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, but

I am not aware of any proposals from the Irish Government to introduce

changes in their electoral legislation, although they have considered

that. I have discussed the issue with my counterparts in the Irish

Republic at ministerial

level.</div><a name="060425127000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the event

of the Irish Republic bringing forward any such changes, the Bill

enables powers to be given to the Secretary of State to make amendments

to the scheme, which the House will have to endorse, to enable those

changes to be reflected in the changes that the Committee is

considering now. I hope that that reassures the hon.

Gentleman.</div><a name="060425127000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.

Members have raised concerns about the Irish Republic&#146;s role,

but we have set down clear standards in the Bill. If an individual is

an Irish citizen, they can donate to political parties in the north of

Ireland for the purposes of electoral contests. We do that for the

special relationship with the Republic of Ireland, for the historic

nature of that relationship and in accordance with the Belfast

agreement.</div><a name="060425127000304"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000616"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> Would the Minister care to comment on the fact

that, as he indicated, the issue has been discussed on several

occasions with his counterparts in the Irish Government? Can he confirm

the transparency of the current situation, as regards donations to

Irish political parties, including Sinn Fein, in the Republic of

Ireland?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div><a name="060425127000305"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000617"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> In the discussions with the Irish Government, I

have shared, as a matter of course, information regarding the

intentions of the British Government in relation to the electoral

changes that we are making in the north of Ireland. At BIIGCs, we have

shared with them the details of the legislation that, potentially, will

come before the House, as one would expect. We feel that it is

important to do so on matters that affect the island of Ireland. I have

shared with them our intentions and I understand that the Irish

Government have looked at the potential for changes in their

legislation. At present, there are no proposals from the Irish

Government, but they are keeping the matter under review. In due

course, they will discuss with the British Government our perspective

on their electoral policy and

legislation.</div><a name="060425127000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">This

boils down to an honest disagreement between me, my hon. Friend the

Member for Belfast, South and other members of the Committee, and

Opposition Members and Members from the Northern Ireland Unionist

parties who have spoken in the debate. We have banned foreign donations

and will continue to do so, but it will be a matter of special interest

that the Republic of Ireland still has a role and responsibility, given

the historical agreements made in Belfast on Good Friday and the

historical nature of the relationship between the Republic and the

north.</div><a name="060425127000307"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000618"></a>Mr.

Reid:</b> There is common ground with the Minister in that we

agree that Irish citizens should be able to donate to parties operating

in Northern Ireland, and also that there should be a ban on foreign

donations, but it concerns me that the measure is such that it may

permit a foreigner to donate money to an Irish political party and that

money may then be spent in Northern Ireland. Can he clarify the

situation regarding foreign donations&#151;that is, from people who

are neither British nor Irish&#151;to an Irish political party, with

the money ending up being spent in Northern

Ireland?</div><a name="060425127000308"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000619"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> Again, at the moment, the measure is framed so as

to ensure that Irish citizens can donate to Northern Ireland political

parties. We have banned foreign donations; we accept in the legislation

that Irish citizens can donate to parties in the north, for historical

reasons. I hope there is agreement with the Liberal Democrats. I say to

the hon. Member for East Antrim that it may benefit Sinn Fein or the

SDLP, but is he telling me that there is no single person in the

population of the Republic of Ireland who may wish to donate to his

party, the party of the hon. Member for North Down or the Alliance

party in Northern Ireland? I cannot rule that out. It is perfectly

legitimate for an individual resident&#151;let us say someone in a

border area of Northern Ireland, or an Irish citizen who believes in

the Union&#151;to donate to the party represented by the hon. Member

for East Antrim for those reasons. There is no reason why that cannot

be

done.</div><a name="060425127000309"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000620"></a>Mr.

Wallace:</b> Perhaps if I put a scenario to the Minister he

may understand. He talked about an Irish citizen, but proposed new

section 71B(2) refers to</div>

<a name="060425127000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a body of that description or

category would be entitled under Irish law to donate to an Irish

political party.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div><a name="060425127000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The scenario works in

one sense if we are talking about the nationalist party. What if a

Unionist party chose to register a body incorporate, which is in the

Irish legislation, in the south of Ireland and a foreign

donor&#151;perhaps a British citizen living in the United States or a

Saudi Arabian donor or whoever we like&#151;donated to an Ulster

Unionist party based in the south, which passed that donation, through

the Irish legislation, to Northern Irish politics, which would be

perfectly admissible? The problem is that anybody can take advantage of

the Irish law to get foreign donations into the

system.</div><a name="060425127000311"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000621"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> The hon. Gentleman will know that that could be an

issue that might need to be examined. The position of the legislation

is clear: we ban foreign donations to British political parties

operating in Great Britain and the United Kingdom as a whole, including

Northern Ireland. Irish citizens are potentially able to donate to

parties operating in Northern Ireland because of the historical nature

of the position between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. I

would not expect there to be any situation whereby under Irish law and

British law foreign individuals could subvert British Government

legislation to secure donations to British political parties operating

in Great Britain and/or in Northern

Ireland.</div><a name="060425127000312"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000622"></a>Mr.

Wallace:</b> It is not subverting Irish law; Irish law allows

overseas donations. They can come from either an Irish citizen overseas

or a support group of an Irish-based political party overseas. It is

not a matter of saying that we can just let Irish citizens donate. No,

we cannot do anything. We do what the Irish say because that is in the

second part of the legislation. It allows overseas donations into

Ireland, so it allows overseas donations via that route into the United

Kingdom Northern Ireland political

environment.</div><a name="060425127000313"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000623"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> Parties that operate in the Republic of Ireland

and in Northern Ireland are separate legal entities. Like individuals,

they will be party to British law. Irish citizens can donate

Irish-based resources and Irish-based finance from Irish citizens to

political parties in the north, but that precludes donations from

overseas individuals who are not Irish citizens. The position relates

to the fact that Irish citizens, but not citizens of other nations, can

support political parties in the

north.</div><a name="060425127000314"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000624"></a>Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> The discussion reminds me of what happened on

the Floor of the House: the longer the Minister spoke, the more

agitated the Opposition became. I shall explain why. Does he not see

that there is nothing theoretically to prevent the Labour party from

setting up something in the south of Ireland and getting foreign

donations into that part of the corporate organisation, transferring

the money to the north and bringing it into the rest of the United

Kingdom?</div><a name="060425127000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

must accept that he is vulnerable because of the recent experience that

showed that political parties will do anything to get round

the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>conditions. What guarantee do we have that the legislation will not fail

to achieve standardisation and elimination of foreign

donations?</div><a name="060425127000316"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000625"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> The simple, straightforward reason that United

Kingdom law bans foreign donations, with the exception of Irish

donations from Irish individuals. That resource cannot be laundered

through an Irish individual to a British political party or to a party

operating in the United Kingdom. It is about individuals who are

resident and Irish citizens being able to donate on the island of

Ireland to support political parties in the north. There is an honest

disagreement in Committee about the Bill and the role of Irish citizens

in supporting parties in the

north.</div><a name="060425127000317"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000626"></a>Sammy

Wilson:</b> The Minister emphasised proposed new section

71B(1)(a) and the role of the Irish citizen. Will he comment on

proposed new section 71B(1)(b), which refers

to</div><a name="060425127000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a body which is of a

prescribed description or category and in relation to which any

prescribed conditions are

met.&#148;?</div><a name="060425127000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that not

cover the point made by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre that a

party in Northern Ireland could set up a body in the Irish Republic and

receive donations from a foreign donor through that body into Northern

Ireland?</div><a name="060425127000319"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000627"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> No, it does not. There is an honest disagreement

between the hon. Gentleman and me on such matters. I believe that the

situation ensures that Northern Ireland political parties and GB

political parties are separate legal entities from those in the

Republic of Ireland. Under the Bill, an individual who is an Irish

citizen and involved in the Republic of Ireland can donate political

party resources to parties operating in the north, as indeed, under

Irish law, can bodies. However, the two are separate entities and

United Kingdom law on foreign donations will apply to that, with the

exception of Irish-based citizens and bodies. From my perspective, that

means that money cannot be laundered through the Irish Government and

Irish political parties or individuals to support British political

parties or Northern Ireland political parties, because that would be

illegal under United Kingdom

legislation.</div><a name="060425127000320"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000628"></a>Mr.

Wallace:</b> The Minister is generous in giving way. The

disagreement is about a technical, legal position that is either right

or wrong. It is not a disagreement about whether we should or should

not accept the provision. It is not illegal to donate to a Northern

Ireland party if the body undertaking the donation is either an Irish

citizen or a body under the rules of Irish electoral legislation. It is

therefore not illegal for a body in the south to give money to a

political party in the north, even if the money that the body is

donating comes from abroad. That is a fact, not an angle of

disagreement. This concerns the reading of the

legislation.</div><a name="060425127000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the

Minister tabled an amendment to remove the provision on bodies donating

and said that that had to be done by an Irish citizen, that would go

some way to alleviate the problem. He

could&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000629"></a>The

<a name="060425127000323"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000630"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> There is an honest disagreement between us. In my

view the matters relating to this are tight in the sense that we have

supported the Irish Government&#146;s definition of Irish citizens

and their definition of donations to political parties. We do so

because we wish the Republic of Ireland to be able, as part of the

Belfast agreement, to support Northern Ireland parties should they so

wish. It is meant to be ring-fenced around the Republic of Ireland. I

believe that that is the effect of the Bill. I believe that hon.

Members have a fundamental disagreement with the citizens and bodies of

the Republic of Ireland donating to parties in the north of Ireland.

That is what motivates them in Committee. That is why I will ask my

hon. Friends to support the clause as drafted and to reject the

amendments.</div><a name="060425127000324"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000631"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I have listened patiently to the Minister and to

remarks that have been made by other hon. Members. I was particularly

struck by the comments of the hon. Member for Belfast, South. If I

could briefly put on my Northern Ireland Affairs Committee hat, I

should tell the Minister that in our first foreign overseas foray we

visited Dublin. It was part of our inquiry into organised crime and the

hon. Member for East Antrim was also

there&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I beg his pardon. He

was not present on that occasion.</div>

<a name="060425127000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were particularly struck by

the witnesses&#146; concern about the Northern bank robbery and how

it affected the way that Sinn Fein&#146;s operation in the Republic

was perceived. Until the recent robbery in the south of England, it was

the largest bank robbery in British history: &#163;26.5 million or

thereabouts was stolen just before Christmas 2004. The Police Service

of Northern Ireland believes that a substantial amount of that horde of

cash was taken to the Republic of Ireland and some notes are believed

to have been

traced.</div><a name="060425127000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was very

notable that witnesses in the Irish Republic did not refer to the

murder of Robert McCartney by the provisional IRA or those connected

with the provisional IRA in Belfast. For them the most undermining

event that had taken place in Northern Ireland had been the bank

robbery. I find it unbelievable and I am offended that the Minister

chose to rely upon the Belfast agreement, an agreement which I

supported, as a defence. I would be amazed if he could turn to a

specific phrase or clause that entitled the Irish Government to support

Irish parties in &#147;the north&#148;&#151;that was the

unfortunate phrase he used: it is Northern Ireland and it is part of

the United Kingdom&#151;if they so wished. That is not my

recollection of the agreement for which I voted. I should be delighted

if the Minister could bring in a copy of the agreement this afternoon

and point out that

phrase.</div><a name="060425127000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the

disquiet felt by very senior members of the Garda about how the

political system in the Republic of Ireland can be wholly undermined by

one party&#151;Sinn Fein, connected with the IRA&#151;by simply 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>buying influence through a bank robbery, I refuse to give my consent to

this

clause.</div><a name="060425127000328"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000632"></a>Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> Does the hon. Lady agree that what we have

seen once again is a Minister who is doing his best to defend a piece

of legislation that clearly has a flaw in it? I do not blame the

draftsmen for this because I believe that the Government want to keep

this loophole. Would she agree that we effectively have here a piece of

legislation with such a large loophole that it will not do anything to

assist the law-abiding parties who obey the principle and spirit of the

law, but will give an open gate to any party that wants to continue

with foreign donations to do it through the back door?

<a name="060425127000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is written in the Bill that

there will be an exemption for Irish citizens. The Minister has

confirmed that an Irish citizen could be in the Republic of Ireland and

make a donation of whatever size. There will be no limit on the size of

a donation, and no suggestion of any criteria that would be imposed. I

cannot in conscience accept that Sinn Fein can not only distort the

political system and undermine it in the Republic of Ireland, but that

I should ask them, invite them and encourage them to do so in Northern

Ireland, the part of the United Kingdom I love so well. I cannot and

will not do it. I shall not withdraw the amendment, and want to press

that he thinks that the Liberal Democrats are supporting the Government

that the previous debate covered an amendment that was pretty much

am not opposed to donations from Irish citizens, but my concern about

the wording of the clause is the reference to other

bodies.</div>

<a name="060425127000361"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000659"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> The only money in this clause stand part debate is

a sixpence, because the hon. Gentleman has just turned on

one.</div>

<a name="060425127000362"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000660"></a>Mr.

Wallace:</b> In speaking to the question that the clause stand

part, I would urge the Minister to come back with some details about

the Irish legislation that has been mentioned. I also want to point out

that this is not about some hidden agenda to stop that, and the

Minister&#146;s accusation was rather insulting. We should do what is

right and what is within the power of this Government and Parliament,

without relying on the Irish Government. We could give even more

benefit, if we wanted, to the parties of the nationalist persuasion,

because it is in our power. To accuse us of trying to undermine things

is disingenuous.</div>

<a name="060425127000363"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000661"></a>Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is

disingenuous of the Minister to say that he simply cannot see the

difference between having sensible legislation that achieves what we

want and ignoring the loopholes? All we are asking is that the

Government have a sensible conversation with the Government in Dublin

to ensure that everything fits together. Does the hon. Gentleman agree

that it is clearly the Minister who is

panicking?</div>

<a name="060425127000364"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000662"></a>Mr.

Wallace:</b> The Government are certainly on the back foot at

the very least. As the hon. Gentleman suggested, we are asking only

whether we can do something in British law to close down overseas

donations via bodies in Ireland. It seems likely that the Minister was

not aware that the issue arose in the Bill until we mentioned it. I

would be interested to know whether he or any of his officials have the

Irish legislation beside them, because he has been challenged to

mention bits of it, but nothing has come back. The Government have

clearly rushed things through, trying to win hearts and minds in Sinn

Fein, and the losers will be the other parties, which play by the

rules. All we are trying to do is introduce British legislation to

ensure that a loophole that is not within our control is not exploited.

If the Minister cannot see that, the issue will rise to the surface in

three or four years&#146; time and he will have only himself to

blame.</div> <a name="060425127000365"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425127000687"></a>Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> We will probably speed up again now, and

there will probably be greater consensus than there was on clause

15.</div> <a name="060425127000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 3,

which is in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll

and Bute, is designed to meet a specific concern. As we said, we are

disappointed by part 4. Under clause 14, Northern Ireland political

parties will have to disclose donation returns on a confidential basis,

but that will still not achieve the full transparency that we would all

like. Under the Bill, full disclosure will not occur until 2010;

indeed, the Government might decide to muck about with the provisions

and postpone it even further. The more I hear in Committee, the more

likely I think it is that they want to give themselves wriggle room to

string the loopholes out even further.</div>

<a name="060425127000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why we are

particularly concerned that subsection (3) gives the Secretary of State

the ability to delay full disclosure by extending the prescribed

period, during which parties need disclose their donations only to the

Electoral Commission. Ideally, we want the system to be as close as

possible to the one that operates in the rest of the United Kingdom. We

want openness and transparency to be achieved as soon as

possible.</div> <a name="060425127000398"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
