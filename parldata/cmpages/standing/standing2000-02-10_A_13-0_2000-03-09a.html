Amendment moved [this day]: No. 370, in page 7, line 34, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The Authority when acting as above will ensure that investigation will not duplicate other regulator's investigations and not allow the parties investigated to be put in double Jeopardy.'.—[Mr. Gibb.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): One of our concerns about the new regulatory regime is its scope for duplication. The consumer council investigates any complaint that it receives. However, the Bill establishes the council as a partial, partisan and pro-consumer organisation that represents consumers' interests. As the council has such a role, any investigation that it conducts will be unlikely to be seen as purely objective. If the consumer council feels after conducting an investigation that action is required, it will have to pass its report to the authority, which will take appropriate action. However, can the authority rely on the objectivity of such a report, given the partisan nature of the organisation responsible for it? If it cannot, it may have to investigate the initial complaint all over again, which would be a waste of time and money. The amendment would prevent that risk, as well as the danger of double jeopardy.
<P>
The regulatory authority, the Competition Commission and the consumer council have investigatory powers. The Competition Commission can impose fines of up to 30 per cent. of turnover and the regulatory authority can impose unlimited fines. The amendment would therefore avoid a double jeopardy as well as the double investigatory time and expense. It seems that when the Bill was drafted, not much thought was given to the interaction of its various provisions or to the relationship between the Competition Commission and the regulatory authority. The amendment is intended to flush out from the Government a statement on how the relationships between the consumer council, the regulatory authority and the Competition Commission will work in practice. Will the Minister explain how the Bill avoids double jeopardy and repeated investigations of the same complaint?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) makes an important point about duplication. In providing for concurrent functions for regulators in the Competition Act 1998, the Government were clear that the exercise of those functions had to be well co-ordinated between regulators and the Director General of Fair Trading and that, most importantly, double jeopardy had to be avoided. That is why section 54 of the Act gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations for the purpose of co-ordinating the performance of concurrent functions under the Act.
<P>
The Government have made regulations: the Competition Act 1998 (Concurrency) Regulations 2000, which were laid before Parliament on 8 February and came into force on 1 March, when the Competition Act prohibitions came into force. Regulation 7 of the statutory instrument contains a provision for the avoidance of double jeopardy. I hope that the hon. Member will accept that the regulations addressed his concerns and ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister's statement is helpful and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Government amendment No. 520.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I think that I have already expressed the view that it is foolish for too many bodies to be running around trying to do half a job. Instead of creating more and more organisations, I should prefer all the current organisations that protect consumer rights to be utilised—perhaps with better Government funding. I have also explained that I should like the councils to be amalgamated with the authorities, so that the authority, which has teeth, could act for the consumer. I shall not repeat my arguments, but I thought that I should remind the Committee of my point of view.
<P>
The amendments are intended to exclude the suggestion that all the council activities should be split between regional boards. I have some sympathy, though not a great deal, with the idea of separate councils for Scotland, because, in the main, different electricity companies deal with supply there. However, although I am not against separate offices where people might come together to give their views, or conduct regional meetings, there is no logic in the idea of separate councils. The business of building up regional activities would be a waste of consumers' money and the councils are, after all, supposed to protect consumers' rights.
<P>
I do not know whether you, Mrs. Roe, have had a similar experience to mine of the Government's push towards regionalism. We have already seen the effect of regional development agencies. The Government Office for the South West seems to be engaged in turf wars with the regional development agency every day. All the relevant bodies are engaged in turf wars with the Ministries in Whitehall, which are defending their budgets like mad. That issue does not relate directly to the amendments, but it highlights the fact that deciding to set up regional organisations has resulted in many different decisions. We could bring about the extraordinary situation in which, to satisfy one regional council that wanted certain rules or regulations in order to deal with consumers in, say, the south-west, the way that customers were represented, or the way that an electricity distributor delivered the service, changed at a county border. It is plainly incomprehensible to have differing methods of delivering and paying for electricity, and handling of bad debts from one region to another. That is similar to the postcode changes in the health service, which the Government say they are so against. It is a reprehensible and foolish step.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): The hon. Gentleman says that that is foolish and reprehensible, but I remind him that we are discussing consumer representation. Are there not problems with party representation at the boundary of his constituency, which suggest to him that amalgamation would be appropriate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman rightly suggests that some problems occur in that way, and hon. Members must deal with that, but let us concentrate on the likely changes for people consuming gas or electricity in different regions. There seems to be a web of so-called consultation and, as we all know, the more bodies that must be consulted, the longer it takes to get results for the consumer. People who have problems with their electricity companies should be able to get answers from them quickly. If they cannot, they can under the provisions go to their council for help.
<P>
I suspect that the council will be at the end of a telephone line. It does not matter where the Government or council decide to put offices—in the south-west it could be in Exeter, Bristol or wherever—because 98 per cent. of the population will not physically go to that office to obtain redress; they will telephone instead. Any sensible organisation will probably have a single telephone call centre to deal with all such problems. I urge the Government not to create so many different organisations throughout the country that the cost to the consumer is increased.
<P>
At the end of the day, the consumer rarely has problems. We have heard about the problems that arose when the Government changed the rules on who was allowed to sell gas. In certain areas, there was an upsurge in the number of complaints. That will happen perhaps once ever 10 years, and it will happen nationally, although I know that changes were first trialled in certain areas. There is no requirement to implement a regional structure or for consumers in one area to be treated the same as consumers in another, but to treat consumers in different areas differently would be unfair.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 362 and 361, which take the opposite line from that taken by the hon. Member for South Dorset. We propose that there should be a requirement, as opposed to a permissive power, that the consumer council should set up one or more committees in England. We go further than that, suggesting that it should establish a council committee for each regional development agency area. In fact, careful reading of the hon. Gentleman's remarks in Hansard would probably establish as clearly as I could why that is a good idea. We are talking about consumer representation. It is important that that representation is close enough to consumers to reflect the differences in various regions in England, and reasonably coterminous with other public bodies that have a hand in such matters, including English regional chambers, development agencies and, in some areas, the assemblies and conventions that are developing rapidly. It is envisaged that that should be available for Scotland and Wales, and it should be available for the English regions.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is interesting that, in another part of the Bill no longer with us, there was provision for regional committees for the Consumer Council for Water. There should be such a provision for gas and electricity consumers as well. The hon. Member for South Dorset's argument for a strong central focus for the issues sits uneasily with his utter resistance to any attempt by Brussels, for instance, to take over representative powers in this country. I believe in subsidiarity, which is the exercise of powers and duties at the appropriate level. I am not afraid to say that consumers are best represented more locally. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would maintain that that was true for South Dorset, although, 57 of his electors might think differently. [Hon. Members: ``Seventy-seven.''] I apologise to the hon. Gentleman and the rest of the Committee for getting my statistics wrong. There are 77 very important members of the public in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. I am sure that as consumers they feel adequately represented locally. If it is necessary to revisit the matter, hon. Members will get the drift by reading the hon. Gentleman's speech and inserting the word ``not'' at the front of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Our concern lies with subsection 3, which reads fairly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The purposes of a committee established under subsection (2) . . . shall be . . . the provision of advice and information to the Council on consumer matters affecting the area for which the committee is established—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is fair enough, and, secondly—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such other purposes as the Council may determine.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendments Nos 384 and 137, particularly the former, seek to deal with the second phrase. The remit will be far too wide. One can understand the purpose of establishing a regional committee to provide advice and information from an area to the London headquarters of the national council, but what possible ``other purposes'' are intended by the second phrase? What does the Minister have in mind? Will he give examples of what the council might wish to do, apart from providing advice and information on consumer matters? I cannot think of anything else that a consumer council should do.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will not just give his usual response that the purpose is to give the council flexibility, because that would not be acceptable. If that is his response, it would appear that the provisions are geared toward the same expansionist tendency that we raised when we debated the regulatory authority.
<P>
Our other concern with the establishment of regional committees, which is shared by industry, is that committees around the country might have different views on the interpretation of the consumer role. I know that that is one issue that the Electricity Association has raised with the Government. It is important, especially because the regional committees can stand in the place of the National Consumer Council when necessary. Given the lack of objectivity in the council's terms of reference and duties, it is important to consider how important the regional committees will be.
<P>
Amendment No. 137 would amend schedule 2, which provides some of the details for the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council and, specifically, paragraph 12, which deals with the establishment of its
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>regional and other committees and sub-committees.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, because of our concerns over escalating costs, we would set the maximum membership of those bodies at six people. That would provide the councils with plenty of flexibility but would put down a marker for the maximum number of people whom they could employee.
<P>
I would be grateful if the Minister accepted the amendment. Alternatively, he might like to propose a different number on which we could agree in Committee or on Report if he felt that six people were too many or too few.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The group of amendments is large; I shall try to address each of them as fully as I can because they are important. The Bill will require the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council to establish at least one committee for areas in Wales and Scotland. It may establish councils for areas in England.
<P>
The amendments of the hon. Member for South Dorset would remove all explicit references to a regional dimension to the council's functions and its organisation. That fails to recognise the continuing important regional dimension of the provision of gas and electricity—a factor that came out strongly in the course of the Government's detailed consultation on consumer councils in the autumn of 1998.
<P>
An acknowledgement that there is still a regional dimension to the provision of utility services does not lead inexorably to the creation of consumer offices or committees in each electricity area. There is scope for a considerable rationalisation of the existing regional arrangements for gas and electricity consumers. However, the Bill should respond to the consultation process by setting out statutory minimum requirements on the council to establish offices in England, Scotland and Wales and to appoint regional committees in Scotland and Wales.
<P>
The council should also have the option to establish regional committees in England when it thinks that they will be cost effective and will contribute to the job of acquiring information on consumer matters throughout Great Britain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman is moving towards my view and I would be grateful if he would express the Government's opinion. He says that the council may establish the other bodies, but sounds as though he is not keen on it doing that. He has acknowledged that the regional committees were established because of the regional electricity companies—the RECs—and, no doubt, because of the regional gas companies. Now, because the companies can operate across the geographical area, the committees are not so appropriate.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I was surprised when I heard the hon. Gentleman expound the virtues of Albanian centralism. This is the party that has embraced and advocated free markets. I recognise that the last thing that we need is the proliferation of such bodies across the country.
<P>
I remember, when first entering the job, visiting councils and wondering what they did for a living. They were packed full of the recently retired great and good—many failed Conservative and Liberal parliamentary candidates—who were not making a good job of representing consumers. The issue is not just about how many councils we have but about their quality. That is important; I agree with the hon. Gentleman that they must do a reasonable job and be cost effective.
<P>
The amendments of the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) were moved by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell). The Government are not sympathetic to the idea of setting out an English regional committee structure. Such a requirement would be over-prescriptive and bureaucratic, and would probably impose significant costs. The question of the way in which the consumer council should organise itself to deliver the tasks that we have given it should be primarily for the council. We are appointing council members to do a job and they should rightly have reasonable freedom to decide the structure.
<P>
We take great notice of the amendments. There should be flexibility for the council to establish the most appropriate arrangements for the English regions, but the current provisions offer that flexibility within the constraints of a robust cost control mechanism, which we shall watch carefully. I urge the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was hoping that the Government would make a statement. The Committee should be told why the Government have amended the Bill, especially as it was published a considerable time ago.
<P>
Government amendment No. 520 makes a change to a previous Government amendment to the Bill. It amends amendment No. 360 because of the withdrawal of the telecoms clauses. The amendment seeks to insert a new provision into schedule 6, changing in turn the application of schedule 2. The new provision is headed ``Consultation by Council before establishing regional committees''. Curiously, however, it ensures the council need not consult before establishing regional committees, provided that they are set up within two months of the Bill's enactment.
<P>
Given our concerns and those of industry about the escalating cost of regulatory bodies and its impact on costs passed on to the consumer, the Government should acknowledge that the establishment of regional committees matters, as do later changes, additions and subtractions from the regional structure which require consultation. Why have the Government tabled an amendment to reduce the amount of consultation on establishing a regional structure?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to the matter. I could not find the Government amendment on the amendment paper a moment ago, but I have now located it. It is a transitional provision that is necessary to enable a regional committee structure to be established as soon as the council is brought into being. If normal procedure was used in this initial period, it would not be possible to establish regional committees for a considerable time. The minimum consultation period is two months. Once consultation has occurred, the Secretary of State's approval is required. Only then can the process of identifying and appointing members of the committees begin. Without the amendment, the result would be a significant gap of perhaps five or six months between the date on which the council is established and the date on which any regional committees of the council can start work. That is undesirable and unnecessary.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Bill already provides for offices to be established in Scotland and Wales, so the amendment deals only with the establishment of other regional offices around England. A strong body of opinion, especially in industry, suggests that regional offices are unnecessary and that they will merely increase cost and inconsistency. Those are the reasons why I cannot accept the Government's view. We discussing the one aspect of the Bill that was probably right, in its original form. Now the Government are trying to make the Bill worse. We should press the amendment to a vote, and I urge the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I should point out to the Committee that we will not come to a decision on Government amendment No. 520 until we discuss schedule 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am afraid that my words may damage the Minister's career. We are starting to see an axis—it must be the Glamorgan or Llantwit Fardre axis—on what should be happening. Will the Minister send a copy of his speech to the consumer councils, pointing out to them the additional costs of a full regional structure? I do not resile from the need for local decision making. I believe that a local council or parish council might send a motion to a consumer council on an electricity or gas problem. Any individual who represents a part of a region will probably have to travel large distances and will be remote from what is happening in the rest of the region.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are no natural regions in the United Kingdom. I have lived in Yorkshire, and west Yorkshire does not believe that it is part of another region. I have lived in Dorset, and I assure hon. Members that it does not think that it is linked to any other county. Indeed, the Conservative party decided to link Dorset and Wiltshire. Although its officials are there in name, two run the party in Dorset and two run it in Wiltshire. The proposal is not the sensible approach. Local is good. Mechanisms are needed to ensure that local people are consulted, either as individuals or through their local authority. We should not be establishing an enormous bureaucracy that does nothing.
<P>
I heard the other day from the regional council for water, which has been removed from the Bill. I have been a Member of Parliament for 13 years and that was the first time I knew of its existence. It wrote to me only because it was concerned that it would be done away with or changed. Organisations that write to parliamentarians only when a Bill is before the House for their abolition or change should not be believed in. It would not be sensible to provide powers that produce an enormous spider's web of offices and committees throughout the UK. However, in view of what the Minister said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 466, in page 11, leave out lines 11 to 16 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`() After 41B of the 1986 Act (which is inserted by section 78 below) there is inserted—
<P>
`Service by
Authority of
certain notices
on Council.
<P>
41C. Where the Authority is required by any provision of this Part to publish a notice or any other document, the Authority shall send a copy of the document to the Council.
<P>
() Before section 57 of the 1989 Act (restriction on disclosure of information) there is inserted—
<P>
`Service by
Authority of
certain notices
on Council.
<P>
56A. Where the Authority is required by any provision of this Part to publish a notice or any other document, the Authority shall send a copy of the document to the Council.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (5) obliges the authority to send a copy of any notice that it is required to publish to the consumer council. The purpose of the provision is to ensure that the council is informed of key regulatory developments when they occur. It is also designed to demonstrate that the council is an integral part of the regulatory process. When we discussed the memorandum of understanding between the council and the authority, some Committee members expressed concern about whether there would be effective collaboration between the council and the authority. The provision helps to cement effective liaison and consultation between the two bodies. That remains our intention, but there are two problems with the clause as drafted.
<P>
First, the subsection is couched in terms of the principal form of consultation that is required by the utilities Acts—namely, the obligation to publish notices that outline a period within which representations can be made. That needs to be broadened to include other modes of consultation. Whenever there is a requirement on the authority to consult publicly or with persons or bodies that appear to be representative of people who are likely to be affected, the authority must send a copy of the document to the council.
<P>
The second difficulty is technical. The clause refers to the authority being obliged to send a notice to the council whenever it is required to do so
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>by any provision of this Act or any other enactment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The term ``any other enactment'' is undesirably wide and lacking in precision. A reader of the Bill would be left unclear about what other Acts that encompasses. It is better to be precise.
<P>
The amendment resolves the two difficulties. The scope of the requirement to send a copy of notices to the council is broadened to include notices and any other document. It also clarifies which Acts give rise to obligations to send notices and other documents to the council. They are the Gas Act 1986, as amended, and the Electricity Act 1989.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This is one of many Government amendments that corrects the poor drafting of the Bill. As such, I do not intend to prolong the Government's agony. We support amendments that correct the Bill's drafting, if not its principal regulatory structure.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 248, in page 11, line 17, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following: Amendment No. 363, in page 11, line 20, leave out `supply' and insert `provision'.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 249 and 250.
<P>
Government new clause 2—Preliminary
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Chapter III deals with the functions of the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council. At various points, reference is made to ``consumer matters''. For example, clause 17(1)(a) gives the council the function
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of making proposals, or providing advice and information, about consumer matters.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In clause 18, the council is given the function
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of providing information about consumer matters . . . to consumers of electricity . . . and . . . gas<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 248 to 250 remove the existing definition of the term ``consumer matters'' and Government new clause 2 replaces it with a definition more closely aligned with the definition of consumer used in relation to the duties of the authority.
<P>
First, the interests of electricity consumers are identified in new clause 2(1) as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the interests of consumers in relation to. . . electricity conveyed through distribution systems
<P>
</UL></FONT>rather than in relation to the supply of electricity. Last time we dealt with the matter—I do not know whether you were in the Chair, Mrs. Roe—we had a bit of fun with it. The reasons for the change were set out during our debate on Government amendments to clause 12.
<P>
Secondly, the amendments require the council, in considering the interests of consumers, to have regard to the interests of four categories of disadvantaged consumers—the disabled or chronically sick, pensioners, those with low incomes and those who reside in rural areas. Those are the same categories of disadvantaged consumers referred to in clause 12, which deals with duties of the authority.
<P>
The Government have made it clear that the consumer council should represent all categories of gas and electricity consumers, both domestic and industrial. We are concerned to ensure that the benefits of increasing competition in energy markets should extend to all consumers, including the disadvantaged.
<P>
We envisage the council's activities may have a particular value for those categories of consumer. Certainly, those particular interests should not be overlooked. We therefore think that it is right to require the council to have regard to those interests, although we do not imply that the interests of other categories of consumer can be ignored.
<P>
The revised definition of ``consumer matters'' in new clause 2, which would be inserted before clause 16, will apply throughout Chapter III. That means that the definition of ``consumer matters'' provided in clauses 17 and 19 can be deleted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am slightly confused about the chapter to which the new definition applies. The new clause states merely ``In this Chapter''. It does not refer to a particular chapter. Will the Minister confirm which chapter is meant and why it is not mentioned in the new clause. I assume that it refers to chapter III, which is the chapter from which the previous definitions of consumer were deleted.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am referring to Chapter III.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I take it that the reason why the new clause does not refer to chapter III is not another drafting omission but a result of how the new clauses are tabled.
<P>
My substantive concern about Government new clause 2 is on regulatory gaming. That subject was referred to on Second Reading and we shall return to it again during the Committee stage. Regulatory gaming happens when competitors to an established utility use the regulatory framework, which is established for the protection of individual consumers, to obtain information or to discredit a competitor. They use the paraphernalia and machinery of the consumer councils by purporting to be consumers and falling within the definition of consumers, using the information and gathering powers or provocation powers to further their own commercial interests. The public at large will accept many of the Bill's provisions, provided that they are reasonable and provided that they protect the consumer; but they will not accept a definition of ``consumer'' that includes other commercial organisations.
<P>
On Second Reading, in an intervention during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning), the shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the Secretary of State said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are aware of the American experience, whereby people try to acquire confidential commercial information by using what appear to be reasonable and legitimate powers. We were intending to deal with that issue in Committee. I am delighted that the hon. Lady will be able to engage constructively with us when we discuss the means to overcome the particular problem that she has identified.—[Official Report, 31 January 2000; Vol. 343, c. 801.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know whether the Government have tabled any amendments to deal with that problem, but I thought that this might be an appropriate time to deal with the matter, given that the new clause relates to the definition of consumer. Will the Minister confirm that the Government have addressed the problem of regulatory gaming and that they will propose a solution to the problem?

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The proposed new clause sensibly tidies up the structure of the Bill, and we have no problem with that. The Minister said that further new definitions would be introduced to ensure that definitions are parallel, both for consumers and for the authority itself. Again, that seems sensible. My question is perhaps essentially the same as that asked by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton because I am not entirely clear that the whole picture has been presented to the Committee to allow us to consider the issue fully, to form a judgment about how the Government are proceeding and to consider what tidying amendments we might want to table on Report.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I hope that it will be adequate if I say that we will certainly have the opportunity to address that issue later in our deliberations because it is important.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am afraid that it is my turn to have some difficulty locating my amendment.
<P>
We believe that there should be greater transparency of information. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton suggested that there was something wrong with the open and transparent regulatory regime adopted in the United States. We do not take that view. In fact, we believe that there is little or no evidence that consumers there get a worse deal. The energy industries in the United States continue to make a profit and everyone benefits from the more open regime.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> That statement intrigues me because one of the previous Government's real achievements was that it managed to keep lawyers out of regulation. The curse of American regulation is that it is litigation-bound. A huge amount of capital is tied up with it, which makes it lethargic. Does the hon. Member for Hazel Grove agree that that militates against consumer interests?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am not an advocate of the American constitution or its legal system. I believe that America has more lawyers than doctors, which is widely regarded as undesirable, so I do not suggest that every aspect of American society should be emulated, certainly not in respect of the legal process. My point is that consumers do not seem to be disadvantaged by the open regulatory regime. For example, following their recent move into the American market, United Kingdom power generators find themselves up against a regulatory environment that is far more consumer oriented and in which regulations are, to an extent, determined by consumers as opposed to Secretaries of State or effective lobbying by power companies. In fact, consumers have a very good deal. The point has been well made elsewhere that we have the opportunity to transfer that benefit into the United Kingdom context, should we choose to do so.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I direct the Committee to amendment No. 233, which would ensure that the council has the widest possible scope to function. Amendment No. 234 would add the duty of promoting and advocating the interests of consumers. When we consider the next batch of amendments—I shall not trespass on your hospitality, Mrs. Roe, by referring to them now—the Committee will see further aspects of the same aim. The intention behind our amendments to clause 17 is to strengthen the council's powers to ensure that it has a wide remit and to provide greater transparency, punch and power for consumers.
<P>
All our amendments, including those that we tabled to clause 16, are along the same lines. They are about bringing the consumer interest closer to home, giving the consumer body the power to take action and ensuring that consumers can get hold of the information and use it in a powerful way. We believe that the three groups of amendments hang together and show the direction in which we had hoped the Government would be prepared to move. Amendment No. 233 and 234 illustrate that, and the next group of amendments will reveal our proposals in more detail.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have considerable sympathy with the motives of the hon. Member for Hazel Grove in tabling the amendments, but I hope that I can reassure him that the wording of clause 17 already achieves the effect intended by his amendments. The clause does not limit the council to one or other of the activities as part of its advocacy function. Rather, it gives the council the flexibility it needs to be an effective lobbyist on behalf of consumers. I do not believe that the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Promoting and advocating the interests of consumers<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
proposed in the amendment, add anything material to the clause. The wording of clause 17 sets out the council's advocacy and policy role in the clearest way possible. Taken together, that is the unequivocal meaning of the words ``making proposals'', ``providing advice and information'' and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>representing the views of consumers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the light of those assurances, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister for his assurances. I understand his point and we shall watch the issue as we proceed through the Bill. In the light of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page 11, line 31, at end insert—

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> As I said a minute or two ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes and I tabled three amendments that all aim to ensure greater transparency for consumers and greater power for the consumer council to carry out its functions effectively.
<P>
At the core of the Bill and the warning are the circumstances in which information may or has to be disclosed and in which it shall not be disclosed. Clause 17(3)(c) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is not information the disclosure of which would or might, in the opinion of the Council, seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of the individual or body.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For those of us—and there are many—who have served on local authorities and other public bodies, the secrecy that surrounds the revelation and the concealment of information is hotly debated. The skill with which those who hold information find plausible reasons for not disclosing it is amazing. We are ingenious when we have the information, and frustrated when we do not. The law gives local authorities a general duty of disclosure unless the information is subject to an exemption. However, some people are adept at finding ways of contaminating information that could reasonably be disclosed with information that might be subject to an exemption. As a result, whole blocks of information are concealed.
<P>
I shall not even begin to describe what Government's—past, present and no doubt future—do to prevent the disclosure of information. They are not so concerned when the test might
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of the individual or body,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as when it might seriously or prejudicially affect their own interests. The amendments would ensure that we do not provide the general and self-serving exclusions that often apply to other public bodies. Although there may be drafting difficulties, the amendments attempt to bring to the fore the general issue of disclosure and transparency.
<P>
The Minister may say that he does not want to follow the American model. That decision is well established—the Government do not want to follow the American model in freedom of information legislation. But we believe that they should. It is appropriate to table amendments to test their argument and ensure that it is fully deployed. The power industry in the United States delivers clear benefits to the consumer. The disbenefits to consumers in this country of concealing and withholding information are also clear. Even when the council has material information, it could be hit by the constraints of clause 17 and unable to use it. That is not right, fair or reasonable.
<P>
We have an opportunity to put the consumer first and to do those things that the Government have said publicly that they want to do. We hope that the Minister will recognise that the amendments hang together to produce an outcome that takes us further down the track of his rhetoric, and that of his colleagues, which is not being delivered.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I shall speak briefly about amendments Nos. 388, 389, 392 and 393. Amendments Nos. 388 and 389 relate to clause 17 and are mirrored by amendments Nos. 392 and 393 to clause 19. I did not table them for any ideological reason or because of a fit of passion. I did so because the Bill does not seem to achieve the Government's aims. Line 37 of page 11 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information relating to a particular individual or body may be disclosed<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
—by the council—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if it is information that is available to the public from some other source.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All information is available to the public from some other source if that source is a mole within an organisation. Subsection (3)(b) is a catch-all provision, saying ``We have released the information because you could have probably stolen it from the solicitor's safe or wherever else''. My amendment is textually better, and would make the Bill read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information relating to a particular individual or body may be disclosed . . . if it is information that is already in the public domain.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that such provision was the Government's aim. However, the Bill currently ensures that if the public can obtain the information from another source, the council is let off the hook because of the catch-all provision.
<P>
Amendment No. 389 would change subsection (3)(c). The Bill currently states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information relating to particular individual or body may be disclosed if . . . it is not information the disclosure of which would or might, in the opinion of the Council, seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of the individual or body.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When one is imposing a restriction on whether a council should give out information that might seriously prejudice an individual or body, one surely cannot use the opinion of the council as a test of protection. The council can, in effect, give out any information, because if it is releasing it, it must have believed that it did not seriously prejudice the interests of an individual or body. Good common sense suggests that the offending words should be removed and that the Bill should state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information . . . may be disclosed if . . . it is not information the disclosure of which would or might seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of the individual or body.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That wording is much better and it surely encapsulates what the Government were trying to achieve. The amendment would ensure that the council did not have two get-out clauses enabling it to do what it liked with confidential information because the Minister had given it the opportunity to make an excuse, however prejudicial and secret the information was in normal circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Clauses 17, 18 and 19 deal with powers to use and publish information obtained from licence holders either by Ofgem, the regulator or the consumers council. Clause 17 deals with the availability of such information to public authorities and clauses 18 and 19 cover its wider publication by the consumer council. A number of concerns have been expressed about the clauses, and I shall try to deal with them by explaining our amendments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 138, 143 and 509 make the same changes but relate to clauses 17, 19 and 23. They deal with a phrase that appears in each of the clauses and which we have heard several times: ``seriously and prejudicially''. The amendments would remove the words ``seriously and''. The clauses enable the consumer council to publish confidential information that it has obtained using powers conferred by the Bill. However, that information can be published only if one or more of three conditions apply: the licence holder has consented to publication, the information is already in the public domain, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset mentioned, or disclosure would not seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of the licence holder. That is a lot of double negatives, but the gist is that the consumer council can publish confidential information, even if it prejudices the licence holder. It can be prevented from publishing only if it seriously and prejudicially affects the licence holder. In other words, it is difficult to stop the consumer council publishing by requiring the information to be seriously harmful to the utility company, not simply harmful.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is odd is that such an approach should be inconsistent with the approach taken in the Freedom of Information Bill. Clause 41 of that Bill exempts from disclosure information that is a trade secret or that would cause prejudice to commercial interests. The proviso is that it would simply cause prejudice, not serious prejudice. It is much easier to prevent publication or disclosure under the Freedom of Information Bill than under the Utilities Bill, which is odd. That is why the Confederation of British Industry stated in its parliamentary brief, of which all members of the Committee have a copy:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are unclear and seek clarification as to why there are provisions in the Utilities Bill concerning the disclosure of information by the Consumer Councils, which are inconsistent with the Freedom of Information Bill. If it is the intention that two regimes will operate, we seek explanation as to how these regimes will interact.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps the Minister can deal with that.
<P>
Industry's concern is about more than consistency; it is about highly confidential information being disclosed and causing commercial harm to major sectors of British industry. As I mentioned in the previous debate, given that the definition of ``consumer'' will include commercial competitors of the various electricity and gas companies—they will not necessarily be British companies—the risk is that complaints will be made to the consumer council either merely to embarrass the competitor or to obtain useful information about a competitor. As we heard on Second Reading, that already happens in the United States. The Secretary of State assured us that he would deal with the problem during the Committee stage. I am pleased to say that he assured us that the Government will propose a solution to the problem during the Committee's remaining sittings.
<P>
The CBI commented further. It said that it welcomed the fact that, on Second reading, the Secretary of State was dealing with the problem of gaming. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Safeguards should be in place to prevent people seeking information and placing it in the public domain to undermine competitors. This is of particular concern where consumers may also be competitors, in the context of a Consumer Council with wide powers of publication.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The same debate took place during Second Reading on the Freedom of Information Bill on 7 December 1999. The Home Secretary agreed with the CBI and quoted the CBI's views, which set out the arguments against the substantial harm test clearly and cogently. The Home Secretary quoted the CBI's argument, which was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We believe that the test for disclosing information should be one of simple harm and not substantial harm . . . Any attempt to limit the ability to withhold information to that which may cause substantial harm to a business may prevent the voluntary disclosure of information to Government. Without proper assurances, we do not consider that the Government's approach will achieve the objective of two-way openness and trust.—[Official Report, 7 December 1999; Vol. 340, c.725.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Home Secretary agreed with that view. That was the Government's view on 7 December 1999. The question is: why is that no longer the Government's view? The point is made even more cogently in the Government's response to the fifth report of the Public Administration Select Committee, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government believes that to preface the word ``prejudice'' within the test with ``substantial'' or ``significant'' would add an unquantifiable standard which may itself cause confusion. The Government propose to include, within clause 14, a greater steer to public authorities in balancing the public interests in the exercise of their discretion to disclose.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government made that clear refutation of the arguments in their response to the Select Committee report on the Freedom of Information Bill. Will the Minister set out the reasons for the change of approach? Is it another error or omission in the drafting, do they intend to amend the Freedom of Information Bill or is the inconsistent approach between the two Bills intentional? If it is the latter, will the Minister say why?
<P>
I hope that the Electricity Association has had a good meeting with the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe. I am surprised that she is not in Committee to withdraw the clauses on electricity; that might happen next week. In the association's view
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The industry wishes to see the Council's subjective test of ``seriously and prejudicially'' affecting the interests of an individual or body replaced by an objective test of ``harm'' to such interests.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I hope that no harm has come to the Minister. She unfortunately had food poisoning the last time that she had a good lunch. She was away for a week and, when she returned, half the Bill had been removed. Her long lunch might suggest that we could have more dramatic news later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention.
<P>
Whether or not it suffered food poisoning with the Minister, the Electricity Association has made it clear that the definition in the Bill is wrong and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Council should have to take proper account of any objections to the provision of information to third parties and/or publication of information which it receives from the relevant individual or body.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I hope that the Minister might accept amendments Nos. 138, 143 and 509, which would remove the words ``seriously and''. Amendments Nos. 139 and 144 would add to clauses 17 and 19 a requirement on the consumer councils not only to consult the licence holder before disclosing confidential information, which is already required, but to set out the reasons for deciding to disclose.
<P>
That would not be unreasonable—it is simple courtesy for a public body to give its reasons. Public bodies, with the weight of statutory powers behind them, are sometimes inclined to ignore the common courtesies that apply to the rest of civilised society and can be bloody minded. If my post bag is anything to go by, roughly half of constituents' problems in dealing with state bodies is caused by one or two individuals in an organisation. An element of civility would be ensured by the requirement to give reasons when proposing to disclose information. There would also be an additional safeguard to ensure that disclosure was necessary; requiring statutory bodies to set out reasons would focus minds.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 140 and 145 would require the consumer council to seek out the opinion of the regulatory authority on whether such disclosures would be seriously prejudicial to the licence holder. The clause currently leaves it to the authority whether to express such an opinion; the council has merely to see whether the authority has done so. The amendments would force the authority to express an opinion if the licence holder wished it to. Given the subjective nature of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the opinion of the Council<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in reference to disclosure being serious and prejudicial, to require a further opinion to be sought from a body not statutorily partial to the consumer's side of a dispute would be to make the regulatory regime fairer, especially as there is no appeals procedure for the publication and obtaining of information. The amendments would help to address the concerns of the electricity industry as expressed in the Electricity Association briefing, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The only check on the Council's powers in this respect is that it shall have regard to any opinion expressed by the Authority, which is in any case a weak provision and one that is easily satisfied. The Bill provides for the Council simply to consult the person whose interests may be harmed, with no provision for the Council to take into account any views expressed during this consultation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 141 would limit the public bodies to which the council can disclose information to those that are involved in utility regulation. It would require the disclosure of information by the council to be solely for the purpose of facilitating the functions of those bodies. It may seem obvious that only those organisations that deal with such matters will want to have the information, but the Bill permits any information to be disclosed to any public body. The industry is worried that that might result in fishing expeditions for information that could prove useful to public bodies.
<P>
The views of the Electricity Association are clear. It is worried about the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>cost implications of granting the consumer councils additional direct . . . rights of access to information held by the utilities. The key concern is that this may result in large scale fishing expeditions and unnecessary duplication through multiple applications for similar information. This could prove burdensome, costly and inefficient for the regulated companies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have published a useful consultation document. In setting out the guidance for the provision of information, it lists circumstances in which it will be possible for the council not to publish information. The fifth item is alarming. It begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Cases where the costs or other compliance burden of providing the information is unjustified having regard to the likely benefit of the information to the council in question,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is a sensible reason for preventing publication. Unfortunately, it goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government doubts that many requests will fail altogether on this ground.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is more evidence that they do not care about or understand the cost implications. Those costs will be picked up by the utilities and passed on to the consumer.
<P>
Amendment No. 142 would delete
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or any other public authority<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Director General of Fair Trading.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Try as I might, I cannot think of a public body other than the Director General of Fair Trading to which the Government would want such information to be disclosed. Could it be the Forestry Commission? What are those other public bodies? If the Minister cannot accept the amendment, will he give examples of the public bodies that he has in mind?

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall try to deal with all the amendments.
<P>
On regulatory gaming, the hon. Gentleman knows that the Secretary of State thought that the telecoms companies would use the telecoms consumer council to press issues of interconnection and interoperability. Insofar as there is an energy issue, amendments Nos. 475 and 418 tighten the definition of consumer complaints. That will help to ensure that companies cannot require the council to investigate spurious or manufactured complaints that are engineered by other companies. The issue is serious and perhaps we can discuss it later.
<P>
Clause 17 gives the council a lobbying remit so that it can be a vigorous advocate on behalf of consumers. Clause 18 gives the council the role of disseminating the information that consumers will need in order to make informed decisions about their gas and electricity suppliers. Clause 19 gives discretionary powers to the council to publish advice or information that promotes the interests of consumers. Clause 21 gives the council the power to investigate matters relating to the interest of consumers. Finally, clause 23 allows the council to publish the reasons given by the authority for refusals to supply the council with information.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government have tried to make the council an authoritative and effective voice on behalf of consumers for each of those functions, while respecting the legitimate interests of business. That theme runs throughout these clauses, especially the provisions relating to the disclosure of information that may be sensitive. Since the lobbying role is one of the council's functions, amendment No. 230 is superfluous, and I ask the hon. Member for South Dorset to withdraw it.
<P>
Clause 18 gives the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council the role of disseminating information to consumers in the form that it thinks will be most useful to recipients and in a way that it thinks will bring it to the attention of those most likely to be interested. The Government intend that the council should bring together information—for example, details on services and tariffs—that is in the public domain but which is inaccessible to consumers because it is kept in diverse places and diverse forms.
<P>
I know that a little scorn was poured on that aspect, but it is important. Anyone who has carried out primary research knows that it is difficult to pool information that is in the public domain but not easily accessible; it is not necessarily always in the same place or in the same journal, and not necessarily available all at the same time. It is not always easy when using the internet. Under that provision, the council will be able to present information in a format that makes it easier for consumers to compare suppliers and to make informed choices.
<P>
Amending clause 18 to duplicate functions given to the council elsewhere is unnecessary, and without proper safeguards, it would be irresponsible. For those reasons, we shall resist amendments Nos. 365, 388 and 392.
<P>
Clauses 17 and 19 allow the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council to disclose information about particular people, companies or others, provided that the information is already public. That provision is to be found in clause 19(3)(b), which refers to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>information that is available to the public from some other source.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset would like to change that definition in amendment No. 388 to information that is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>already in the public domain.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have asked quite a few people, and no one can see what difference that would make to the meaning of subsections 17(3) or 19(3). I am not convinced by the argument that it would make a difference, and I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press those amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 366 would remove the council's discretion and require it to publish such advice or information The hon. Member for Hazel Grove is unrealistic to expect the council to have the necessary resources, time or money to respond to every consumer on every subject. If it tries to do so, consumers risk being swamped by a flood of information about the means to judge what is important to them. We believe that the council must be free to prioritise the information that it publishes in order to achieve the appropriate balance of consumer benefit to cost. For those reasons, we shall resist amendment No. 366.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 231, 367, 138, 143, 389, 393, 502, 503, 504 and 509 deal with the appropriate test to be applied by the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council when deciding whether or not to disclose information that relates to particular individuals, or bodies such as companies. The amendments are important, because they deal with the heart of the Bill. The aim of a disclosure test is to strike an appropriate balance between the legitimate interests of companies and individuals in the confidentially of sensitive information about them, and the benefit to consumers that would result from publication of that information.
<P>
I believe that the Bill strikes the right balance. It provides that if such information is not already public and those to whom it relates have not consented to disclosure, the council may disclose it only if publication will not have serious or prejudicial effects. That is sometimes called a substantial harm test, which is the test that we promised to apply when we published our response to the utilities review consultation in July 1998. It also follows wording currently used in utilities legislation on the regulator's publication powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister has missed out the important phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the opinion of the Council.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee should consider the position of a complainant who goes to the High Court to claim that information is prejudicial, and has spent money to show that that is the case. The judge can point to primary legislation ensuring that if the council believes that the information was not prejudicial, the complainant cannot take action against it for having done substantial harm to his business.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The legislation allows for such information to be published, but only by the regulator. We must have regard to the desirability of avoiding serious and prejudicial effects. If information that would cause substantial harm is to be published, it is right that the decision should be taken within a balanced framework of duties rather than by a campaigning body, for example. Although we want to make the regulatory process as open as possible, we have no wish to erode companies' ability to innovate or compete. That is why we oppose amendments Nos. 367, 231, 502, 503 and 504. I shall come to the point made by the hon. Member for South Dorset in a moment.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 138, 143 and 509 show that, by contrast, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton finds a substantial harm test too permissive. He wants to prevent the council from publishing information that would have prejudicial effects. I am glad to see him nodding in assent; if I had not outlined his intentions correctly, my entire case would have been destroyed. As I have explained, the Government intend consumer councils to be strong and independent consumer champions. To succeed, they must have means to ensure that consumers' needs are served in years to come. They must also have discretion on publication of sensitive information in order to carry out their functions.
<P>
For example, information about companies' treatment of particular categories of consumers might be considered by some parties to prejudice the interests of particular supply companies. If information about such companies shows their staff up as a bunch of incompetents or rotters, they will of course object to publication. On the other hand, such facts fall squarely within the scope of advice or information about consumer matters whose publication will promote consumers' interests. In my view as a consumer it is excellent that such information is published. It will get out anyway, because it will be available on notice boards, the internet and so on, but the Bill provides an important public service in respect of its release. That is why we will resist amendments Nos. 138, 143 and 509.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I know that it is difficult to keep track of so many different arguments, so I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. He is suggesting that the consumer councils should sometimes publish information that is seriously prejudicial to somebody. That is not, however, what the Bill states. Instead, it states that published information should not be prejudicial and gives the council a right to decide for itself on what is prejudicial. It also removes the right of an individual who has been wronged to go to a High Court judge to say so. The judge would say ``Yes, you have been wronged, but according to legislation, as long as the council did not think that the information would be prejudicial, it was not.''
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No, that is not correct. The council can publish information subject to the substantial harm test in the Bill, but it cannot disclose under the prejudice test for freedom of information. I make the point clearly—that is intentional. Freedom of information is a global regime setting a minimum standard for the right of access to information across the public sector. This Bill is concerned with a certain sector in which, in addition to the general reasons for transparency that inform the freedom of information regime, there are specific reasons that increase the need for openness. I know that the hon. Member for South Dorset is aware of them.
<P>
In the same way in which we are setting up an independent consumer council to serve the legitimate interests of gas and electricity consumers, those interests merit a higher level of openness in the utilities sector. Empowering consumers means not only establishing the council to champion their concerns, but enabling it to publish information on which they can base decisions about services and information that will enhance the public debate about regulatory issues.
<P>
Some parts of the sector are not competitive. In others, competition is too new to have taken full effect and consumers have not yet adapted to the competitive environment. As we have heard in Committee on several occasions, switching levels between companies are still too low. There are too many complaints about erroneous transfers and misleading claims. Consumers must have confidence in the markets if the full benefits of competition are to be realised. That is why we need strong consumer bodies capable of articulating the consumer interest.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The Minister makes an important point that is music to my ears in some ways. I commend amendment No. 232 to him, which would achieve precisely what he is saying. Will he assure us that there are no circumstances in which the wording in the Bill, as a restriction on publication, could be used to overcome the requirements for disclosure in the Freedom of Information Bill? He seems to be making his point clearly.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The Freedom of Information commission is not yet in place, as the Information Commissioner does not yet exist, as such. Perhaps I could deal with that in a moment.
<P>
Amendment No. 232 proposes that council should have a general duty to publish information. The Bill gives the council specific functions about publication and disclosure of information that give it the role of consumer advocate. That is the remit that we want it to have, and I see no need to introduce the language of general duties.
<P>
The Amendment suggests that the council should publish information when it is in the public interest to do so. The council is there to champion the cause of the consumer hence it will be well equipped to judge what may be in the consumer interest. However, I do not believe that the council, as a partisan body, should judge what is in the public interest. That is a different definition, but it is one that we must be specific about. That is why I resist the amendment.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 139, 144, 140 and 145 concern the requirement that before the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council discloses information relating to a specific individual or body, it consults those to whom the information relates, and has regard to any views expressed by the authority. That returns to a point made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. The provision is intended to provide the council with information as to the degree of harm that might result if it publishes or otherwise discloses information of a sensitive nature. Armed with that information and guidance, the council will be in a position to apply the serious harm test and decide whether or not to disclose the information. The intention—as implied by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton in amendments Nos. 139 and 144—that the council seeks views on whether disclosure would promote the interests of consumers. That is for the council to judge, not for particular individuals or bodies.
<P>
As with many of the provisions relating to the council, the Government have aimed at striking the right balance between the interests of consumers and those to whom information relates.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Requiring the council to consult interested parties is an important step in ensuring that it takes account of legitimate business concerns about information that relates to them. We are also obliging the council to have regard to any views that the authority may have because it has a wider remit and expertise than the council and may sometimes be a valuable source of advice on the likely consequences of disclosure.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 140 and 145 would add a requirement on the council to seek the views of the authority when asked to do so by those to whom the information is related. That is unnecessary bureaucracy. There is nothing in the Bill to stop anyone who considered that he might be harmed by the council's disclosing some information from appealing to the authority directly and asking it to contribute to the consultation process. I hope that that answers the point raised by the hon. Member for South Dorset.
<P>
As well as being unnecessary, the amendments would militate against the consumer interest that consultation is carried out as expeditiously as possible, because they would allow the consultee to delay publication by waiting until the last minute and then requiring consultation with the authority. It would be needlessly bureaucratic to require the council to ask the authority to contribute its views in each case. For those reasons, we shall resist amendments Nos. 139, 144, 140 and 145.
<P>
We are considering a huge tranche of amendments and I shall refer quickly to amendments Nos. 141 and 142. The clause gives the council the function of making proposals and representing consumers' views to, among others, public authorities. It will give the council the task of lobbying on behalf of consumers. It is conceivable that the council will obtain information relevant to the exercise of regulatory functions by other public authorities. Examples of that include health and safety authorities and environmental protection authorities. I hope that that has answered, in part, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who asked to which other bodies such information could be useful, other than the DGFT.
<P>
We do not believe that, when the council has information relevant to such tasks, it should be inhibited in supplying information to the appropriate authority when it is relevant to the exercise of that body's functions. We are opposed to the amendments because they are unnecessary. I have covered most of them and I thank the Committee for staying awake while I did so. I ask for them to be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I listened with care and interest to what the Minister said as I did to those members of the Committee who spoke to the other amendments. The hon. Gentleman has properly recognised that he is under fire from two directions: those of us who want to see greater openness and transparency, and more powers for the council to pursue its business, and those who believe that the producer interest requires greater protection and that the consumer interest should have less.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> My punch line is that, if Conservative Members believe that we are being far too permissive, and Liberal Democrats believe that we are not being permissive enough, we have probably got the balance right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Perhaps that is another exposition of the third way. There seems to be a pronounced lack of enthusiasm from both sides of the Committee for that hypothesis.
<P>
I appreciate the Minister responding seriously to the amendments. I found a small grain of hope in what he said about the interconnection between the Freedom of Information Bill, with all its weakness, and the extended protection of information under the Bill. It was good that he could say that.
<P>
I am not satisfied with the Minister's response because my amendments would substantially improve the Bill, but I take a little comfort from his rejection of those amendments that would weaken the Bill. Whenever one sees in legislation something that will or might be done, one is at the mercy of lawyers, at best, or the Secretary of State, at worst, as to what judgment will be exercised on the word ``might''. The amendments that would lower the threshold at which information could be disclosed certainly found no favour with me.
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee, but I shall want to reiterate my points elsewhere. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> May I object to the withdrawal of the amendment?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, I shall put the question later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
I want to take issue with the Minister on amendment No. 138 and the related amendments. He said that the balance struck is the right one, but the question is not whether the reasons are too permissive or too restrictive. The question concerns consistency between the Utilities Bill and the Freedom of Information Bill. Every argument raised by the Minister about publishing harmful information applies to the Freedom of Information Bill. He said that the Utilities Bill refers to the utilities sector and that the Freedom of Information Bill refers to a global standard throughout government, but I see no difference between utility sector activities and any other sector of activity in the country about which the Government will have information. I do not understand the reason for a more permissive information policy in the Utilities Bill than in the Freedom of Information Bill. All the Minister's arguments, which are valid, apply to the Freedom of Information Bill. If he insists on leaving the clause as drafted, he must take issue with the Home Secretary and his approach in the Freedom of Information Bill. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. There is an element of hypocrisy if one test applies to the Government and another applies to the utility companies.
<P>
At the appropriate time, Mrs. Roe, I shall press amendment No. 138 to a Division.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman tell me again which amendments he does not understand?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> They are amendments Nos. 468,474, 489, 493 and 519. They are all the same amendment, so the Minister needs look only at amendment No. 468. The wording is the same in each amendment. If he can explain amendment No.468, that will be sufficient for my purposes. I shall explain to the Committee my confusion.
<P>
Amendment No. 468 is an amendment to subsection (4), which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Before deciding to disclose any information relating to a particular individual or body . . . the Council shall—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>. . . have regard to any opinion expressed by the Authority as to the application of subsection (3)(c) to the information or as to the desirability or otherwise of its publication.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When amended, it would go on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and paragraph (b) applies whether the opinion is given in relation to the information itself or to information of a description which applies to that information.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I read the clause several times last night and I am still none the wiser. I should be grateful, therefore, for an explanation from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I must admit that I did not read the clause several times last night, although I read some of the others.
<P>
The amendments affect the council's obligation to take account of the views of the authority about whether the disclosure of information might seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of an individual or body before it decides to publish that information. The council is currently obliged to have regard to any opinion that the authority expresses about the desirability or otherwise of disclosing the information in question. The council is required to do that before disclosing information to public authorities and other persons under clause 17, information about consumer matters under clause 19, information related to investigations undertaken by the council under clause 21 and the publication of notice of reasons under clause 23. The only occasion when the council is not required to have regard to the authority's opinion before disclosing information is under clause 18, where the harm test does not apply.
<P>
The amendments in the group specify the circumstances under which the council must have regard to the authority's opinion before disclosing information under clauses 17, 19, 21 and 23. They ensure that the council will have regard to, first, the authority's opinion in relation to the disclosure of the specific fact or piece of information that can be at issue and, secondly, any opinion previously expressed by the authority in relation to the disclosure of a piece or type of information of a similar kind to the information in question.
<P>
The amendments recognise that many of the authority's opinions on information disclosure will have continuing relevance to the council's information disclosure functions. They remove the need for the authority continually to restate its opinion on identical or similar disclosure issues to ensure that the consumer council takes them into consideration each time it makes a decision on information disclosure.
<P>
The amendments also help to clarify where the council will have regard to the authority's opinion as to whether information disclosure might seriously or prejudicially affect an individual's or a company's interests before it can publish. They are necessary and sensible amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am none the wiser, so I shall press amendment No. 468 to a vote, simply because it is imperative that we have legislation that we understand. As I cannot understand it, I do not see why I should nod the clause through.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) The Council will determine annually how cost effective its publications and information programme has been and published the result of that audit.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The amendment would omit all detail that the council should provide on consumer matters. If it were accepted—and I feel sure that the Government want to give me something this afternoon—the clause would simply state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council has the function of providing information about consumer matters.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (6) would also be retained because, in consequence of the clause, various parts of the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989 will cease to have effect.
<P>
Whenever we table an amendment that would define more closely the action that a particular body should take, the Government always say, ``That's not necessary, and you shouldn't tie our hands. The body is being set up independently—let it get on and decide what information it should give to consumers.'' I have not tried to diminish the body's ability to provide consumers with information. We should tell it: ``You decide what consumers really need.''
<P>
Consumers may decide that everything in the electricity and gas industries is rosy, and that they need no information other than, say, the price of electricity and the range of suppliers.
<P>
As the Bill is drafted, the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council would then say that under the Bill the requirement to provide information, regardless of whether anyone wants or needs it, forms part of its raison d'être.
<P>
When preparing to debate a clause, one often finds relevant material on the internet or elsewhere. I noticed, on returning to my office at lunchtime, that a press statement had been put out by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, who is Green by name and green by nature. He is pushing through the blue-green solutions on global warming. His statement dealt with the ways in which the Labour Government were failing to deal with environmental matters, and with helping the consumer to get a good deal.
<P>
I looked at the juxtaposition between that and the issues that have been highlighted here, such as the 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, from cars or elsewhere, which has certainly not been achieved. I considered the way in which the Government have used environmental policy as an excuse to introduce stealth taxes. I also wonder whether they have kept their promise to obtain at least 10 per cent. of electricity from renewable sources. Will issues such as the reduction in CO2 emissions from using gas be available under the clause for the consumer councils to consider? I think not.
<P>
A Conservative Government will be in power when the consumer council is set up, and people will want to know what the Conservatives are trying to do. We are looking for new technology to reduce CO2 emission. We would replace Labour's energy tax with tradable emission permits; we would ensure that emissions were efficient and market-driven; we would remove the moratorium on gas-fired power stations; we would support energy efficiency measures in people's homes, especially among the elderly and vulnerable; we would promote renewable energy; and we shall make sure that the green energy commission that the Conservative party will set up next week does its job.
<P>
If we are to have an independent consumer council, it should look at what political parties and Governments have promised, and at whether they deliver. This list will not help it to do that. The best way is to allow it to decide what to do, rather than to tell it what to do.
<P>
Amendment No. 391 presupposes that the Government will insist that all this information will be collected and disseminated to consumers. My amendment would add a seventh subsection, which would require the council to audit the cost-effectiveness of that information. Obviously, if £1 million—or £3 million, or £5 million—were being spent on material being offered to consumers, it would be useful to be able to audit whether people were interested in what was being provided. It might be the case that only two people a year would read it and that they were university students whose interest was entirely academic.
<P>
If the Government want to push ahead and provide all this information, which seems to be of very little interest to consumers, we should at least incorporate amendment No. 391 into the Bill to ensure that a regular audit would tell us how much has been spent on publications and information gathering. It would also tell us whether the exercise was doing the consumer any good by ensuring that prices came down and that environmental effects were being improved.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Clause 18 serves two important purposes. It gives the council the function of providing information already in the public domain
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in such form as appears to the Council to be most useful
<P>
</UL></FONT>to gas and electricity consumers. In other words, it deals with information already available to the public, but not in a form which would be easily accessible or useful to electricity or gas consumers.
<P>
Clause 18 also gives the council the duty of publishing statistical information on the level of performance of utility companies, measured against standards of performance set by GEMA and against energy efficiency targets set by the Secretary of State. The council will also have a duty to publish information on complaints made by consumers. That information should be available to every consumer. That is why a no harm test applies to the disclosure of the information. Those functions will ensure that consumers can make informed choices about gas and electricity, which will stimulate competitive practices among the companies concerned.
<P>
We believe that consumers should have access to the information that will be published under the clause's provisions and that the Bill should contain such provisions. I, therefore, resist amendment No. 390, which would remove from the council the function of providing that information.
<P>
Amendment No. 391 would require the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council to assess annually how cost effective it believes its programme of information has been, and it would be obliged to publish the results of that internal audit. I sympathise with the intention that lies behind the amendment, which is to ensure that a council provides value for money, but I do not believe that an internal audit to determine the cost-effectiveness of the council's information and publication activities will achieve that goal.
<P>
It will be incredibly difficult—well nigh impossible—for a council to assess accurately how cost-effective its publications and information dissemination programmes have been. For example, how can it assess the degree to which its publication and dissemination activities resulted in cost savings for consumers? That is simply not measurable.

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Is the Minister aware of the parliamentary answer that stated that one of the performance targets of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority for the coming year is to raise the proportion of positive press comment from 43.5 per cent. to 50 per cent.? In view of that answer, does the Minister want to reconsider his view on whether such matters are measurable?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am not responsible for a parliamentary answer that was given to the hon. Gentleman in response to a question about nuclear power. I do not see the word ``nuclear'' in the clause.
<P>
On Government amendment No. 470, the clause as it is currently drafted would give the council the function of providing information that is useful to consumers, for example, information on comparative tariffs, to consumers who are supplied by licence holders. That creates an anomaly—such information may be just as useful to consumers who are supplied by exempt suppliers as it is to those who are supplied by companies that hold supply licences. There is no reason for distinguishing between consumers in that way. Amendment No. 470 will remedy that anomaly by making it clear that the function is concerned with the provision of information to consumers who are supplied by either supplier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will that involve effectively extending the licensing arrangements to those companies that are exempt from having to acquire a licence? Are they not subject to the same burdens?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The council is not the authority. We want to ensure that those who receive their electricity from exempt suppliers will benefit from the council's services in the same way as those who receive their electricity from licensed suppliers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Amendments Nos. 171 and 172 would refine the use of the word ``complaint'' in the clause, so that it refers to a complaint ``of a consumer nature''. That would avoid involving the consumer council with other types of complaint and there would be no confusion about whether the authority or the consumer council should investigate a particular matter.
<P>
Page 3 of the draft memorandum of understanding between Ofgem and the consumer council contains the heading, ``Handling consumer complaints'' and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We agree that the Council is the main agency for handling complaints where the consumer has approached the company and remains dissatisfied.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That reference to consumer complaints is a step in the right direction. The memorandum of understanding is not statute, albeit that it is required to be produced by statute. It is better to incorporate into legislation the fact that the consumer council should investigate complaints only of a consumer nature. That assists with the on-going problem of how to deal with gaming, whereby competing companies can use consumer paraphernalia to obtain and publish information about each other.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concern, but his amendment is not necessary to ensure that the complaints statistics produced by the council under clause 18 will be focused purely on consumer matters. The Bill specifies that complaints to be included in the statistics must be made by consumers. It is safe to say that the vast majority of complaints made by consumers will be about consumer matters or, to use the words of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, complaints of a consumer nature. Therefore, in the vast majority of cases, the present formulation of the Bill—complaints by consumers—will produce the correct result.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am always delighted when my hunting strategy works. I set up amendment No. 390 a little like the beaters, while amendment No. 391 was the bear trap into which the Minister fell. We all heard the Minister say that however much one examines campaign information one cannot determine whether it saves a penny for the consumer. It is therefore not cost-effective. Having reached the conclusion in the bear trap of amendment No. 391, I am surprised that the Minister will not accept amendment No. 390. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Amendment No. 136 would apply a cap to the number of people whom the Secretary of State can appoint to the consumer council. The amendment suggests a maximum of eight people, but perhaps the Government would prefer a smaller or larger figure. The Opposition believe that a cap is necessary to prevent those bodies from expanding in the future.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 59 and 60 insist that the Secretary of State consults the Trade and Industry Committee before appointing a chairman to the consumer council, and before appointing its members. The Government have already signalled, in the Green Paper, that the new regulatory bodies should be more accountable to Parliament.
<P>
Paragraph 7.43 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A select committee would provide a formal, high-profile platform for the regulators to explain their decisions to Parliament and to the public, and would thereby improve the accountability of the regulators and assist public understanding of what the regulators are doing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That issue was debated earlier in relation to the regulatory authority. The Government responded that it was not workable, but it is. It works perfectly well in relation to members of the Monetary Policy Committee, who appear before the Treasury Committee. Their curricula vitae are circulated to members of that Committee, and they are questioned thoroughly before their formal appointment. That works extremely well. I see nothing wrong with appointments to the consumer council and the regulatory authority also being subject to that approval, particularly given that that was signalled in the Green Paper. In many cases, even if they are not refuted by the Government, the views expressed in the Green Paper seem to bear no resemblance to the Bill. Unless a specific paragraph in a response document states that the Government will not take a particular approach, it is important that they draft into Bills promises made in preliminary documents. Nothing that I have read suggests that the Government do not want to take the route of parliamentary accountability.
<P>
The amendments are important in respect of parliamentary accountability, and would keep under control possible expansionary tendencies of the consumer council. I do not doubt that the regulatory authority will also be subject to such tendencies. We are worried not about consumer bodies, but the natural expansionary tendencies of quasi-autonomous state bodies. If we are proved wrong, the amendment would not affect those bodies. If we are proved right, it would prevent them from expanding beyond eight members.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The amendment would restrict membership of the council to a chairman plus
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>no fewer than 3 and no more than 8.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is unnecessarily prescriptive. It is preferable to retain flexibility on the number of appointments, so that the council's composition can be aligned with the functions and tasks that it has to undertake at a particular point. Of course, this is an important issue and we must listen to the views of the new body's chairman designate on the question of numbers.
<P>
The Government always envisaged that consumer councils should be small, focused and professional. Indeed, the consultation document on consumer councils, which was published in September 1998, stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there are attractions to having a small, focused council of perhaps 4 to 6 members plus a chairman, in utility sectors where the key issues are predominantly national.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is certainly the model that I favour.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 59 and 60 would oblige the Secretary of State to consult the Trade and Industry Committee before appointing the chairman and members of the consumer council. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton acknowledged, Committee members have already debated this issue in the context of appointments to the regulatory authority. We rejected the relevant amendments then, and the same considerations apply to appointments to the consumer council. The hon. Gentleman's amendments would risk giving the Trade and Industry Committee only the appearance of responsibility and influence. Although the amendments would require the Secretary of State to consult the Trade and Industry Committee before making an appointment, they do not establish how any disagreement would be resolved. Appointments would still be made by the Secretary of State, and the Trade and Industry Committee would be powerless to block them, even if it fundamentally disagreed with the Secretary of State.
<P>
More important, the amendments would weaken the Trade and Industry Committee's ability to scrutinise the regulatory process effectively. By involving that Committee in the process of appointing consumer council members, the amendments would risk undermining it, were it subsequently minded to criticise the way in which the council carried out its functions.
<P>
The amendments risk blurring the essential division between Ministers' responsibility to carry out functions entrusted to them by Parliament, and the scrutiny of Government on Parliament's behalf by Select Committees.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is complete nonsense. I knew that the Minister would trot out those reasons for opposing the referral of appointments to the Trade and Industry Committee. He mentioned that disputes might arise where the Trade and Industry Committee does not approve particular appointments. If he agrees with the concept of the amendments, I should be happy to work with him to devise a solution that could be incorporated in mutually agreed amendments, so that such appointments are not made. Where a major Committee of this House disapproves of an appointment, it is logical that it should not be made. Such a provision should be included in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> There is nothing to prevent the Trade and Industry Committee from commenting on any proposed appointment, and I believe that it frequently does so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am not sure that it comments on appointments to such bodies without first having been asked. It would be rather impertinent if there were no mechanism for it to do so. Although the Bank of England Act 1998 does not require members of the Monetary Policy Committee to attend the Select Committee on the Treasury, at least the then Chief Secretary made it clear during the passage of that Bill that he would expect the Treasury Committee to interview those people. The Minister has given no such indication during this debate, which is a great pity.
<P>
The Minister said that the Trade and Industry Committee would be weakened by the implication of its members in appointments to the consumer council. Similar arguments were put forward when we discussed the regulatory authority. That is nonsense. The Treasury Committee is not implicated in the Monetary Policy Committee's decisions on setting interest rates. It is extremely critical, when it wishes to be, of those decisions. It does not fear being critical because it interviewed and did not oppose the appointments to the committee when they were made two or three years earlier.
<P>
On the maximum number of members, the Minister again trotted out the weak argument that the council needs flexibility, and quoted from his own document stating that the ideal number is a tight group of between four and six members plus a chairman. On the basis of that document, I arrived at a figure of eight. That allows for four to six, plus one, and, being generous, I added another one for flexibility. The Government seem to be intent on resisting all the measures that we propose to try to prevent expansion. If the Minister is right, and Callum McCarthy and Ann Robinson want a tight group for their organisations, nothing will be lost by accepting the amendment. If I am right, there is everything to be gained from preventing the bodies from expanding and creating ever higher costs—which will arise not only from salaries and the large offices that they are likely to occupy, but the work that will be done by the people who are employed. Everything that they do on a day-to-day basis will require more work by the people that they are regulating.
<P>
I shall not press the amendment to a vote, because the Committee voted on a similar amendment during the debates on the regulatory authority. However, it is deeply disappointing that the Government are resisting it, as they have resisted many others, because consumers will have to pay for the escalating costs involved in the Bill through their gas and electricity bills. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 153, line 36, after `to', insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The amendments are so straightforward that they almost speak for themselves. They would ensure that those who are appointed by the Secretary of State, in whatever numbers, have appropriate qualifications and are not burdened with interests that would undermine their credibility or bring the council into disrepute. I hope that the Minister will accept that they are probing and exploratory, and designed to ensure that the body is representative of consumers and their interests, rather than anybody else and their interests.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman about that. The appropriate measures are in place to ensure proper public probity, honesty and openness with regard to those who apply for the new bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 63, in page 154, line 23, after `State', insert `and the Treasury.'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendment represents a further attempt to keep the costs of the consumer council under control, as we sought to do in respect of the regulatory authority. It would ensure that any pay arrangements for the chairman and members of the council are approved by the Treasury, which is eminently sensible. Any compensation payment arrangements for leaving should also be subject to approval by the Treasury.
<P>
We do not want to see repeated the absurd situation regarding Jennie Page and the millennium dome. She was sacked by the Government for mishandling the whole dome project, yet we read in today's newspapers that she is to receive a £200,000 bonus. Given that the Labour party made such political capital out of large salaries for utility executives, it is breathtaking that the Government are allowing a bonus of that size—which is equivalent to ten years' worth of the average wage in this country—to be paid to any Government appointee, let alone one who has patently failed.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would help to prevent the consumer council, with the approval of the Secretary of State, from paying itself vast sums. It would also prevent the chairman of the consumer council from being in hock to the Secretary of State with a promise of bounteous riches when he leaves office if he just keeps the Secretary of State sweet. The amendment attempts to establish an element of independence between the Secretary of State and the chairman of the consumer council on remuneration packages.
<P>
Amendment No. 63 would limit the number of employees who can be employed by the consumer council. If the Government again resist the amendments, that would show that they have no understanding of our concern about escalating cost.
<P>
Will the Minister also consider amendment No. 210? If he cannot agree to the remuneration packages being approved by the Treasury, at least there should be a requirement for the information specified in the amendment to be published so that people can see it. The consumer council and the regulatory authority are keen to publish all sorts of prurient information relating to the utilities, so let us see whether they would approve of their own salary and remuneration packages also being published. If so, perhaps the Minister can accept amendment No. 210.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The Government consulted the Treasury on whether its approval for matters such as the remuneration of members of the consumer council and the number and terms of staff employed by the council need to be set out in legislation. The Treasury is content to be consulted by the Secretary of State on those matters on an administrative rather than a statutory basis.
<P>
There are certain special issues in connection with the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General when auditing the consumer council's statement of accounts. We want to provide reassurance that the Treasury can, if it wishes, require the statement of accounts to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is right that information about the remuneration of members of the consumer council should be in the public domain and I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. The amendment is, however, unnecessary. There are detailed requirements governing the disclosure in their annual accounts of information about the emoluments of council or board members of non-departmental public bodies. Those are set out in so-called ``Dear Accounting Officer'' guidance issued by the Treasury to Departments sponsoring executive non-departmental public bodies. They are enforced through financial memorandums drawn up between the sponsoring Departments and the NDPBs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for that response, particularly on the publication of salaries, but I am disappointed at hearing the same response about Treasury approval. I do not care whether the Treasury wants to give approval or not, but it is a useful safeguard and I am disappointed that the Minister is not insisting that the Treasury approves the packages. We have had the debate before so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 211, in page 155, line 7, at end insert

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) would have moved the amendment, but he had to be in his constituency today. It covers a simple point and would require the Secretary of State to lay a copy of each annual report and accounts before both Houses of Parliament
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as soon practical after receiving the report.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Time and again, when reports have come to the Government, the body concerned, knowing that there is critical information in the report that everybody wants to get hold of, rushes it to the Secretary of State, who then decides, on the grid—on the news management—whether to allow anybody else to see it. Therefore, this is a helpful amendment to ensure that the Secretary of State, who will shortly be a Conservative Secretary of State, gives that information to the relevant department.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Listening to the hon. Member for South Dorset is sometimes like listening to somebody sleep-talk. He makes the same statement over and over again.
<P>
The amendment would require the Secretary of State to lay the council's annual report before Parliament as soon after receiving the report as is practical. The detailed timetable for the preparation and presentation of annual reports and accounts will be addressed in the memorandum between the council and my Department. I assure the Committee that we will make it as expeditious as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am not sure whether that would satisfy my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch, but on his behalf I shall seek to withdraw the amendment, as we are trying to make progress. In particular, we are waiting to hear the speech of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs. Gilroy), which I am sure is what everybody came here to hear. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall be brief, because the amendment is a straightforward and uncontentious improvement to the Bill.
<P>
Paragraph 15 of schedule 2 permits any member of the council or any regional or other committee of the council to act on the council's behalf if it is properly authorised; employees are not included. That is unhelpfully restrictive. If a council member always has to be available, that could lead to inefficiencies in the way in which the council conducts its business. The amendment therefore extends the lists of persons who can act on behalf of the council to include employees.
<P>
The amendment would align the position of employees of the council with that of employees of the regulatory authority in schedule 1, who can act on behalf of the authority where they are properly authorised. The amendment would improve the efficiency of the council's procedures, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Schedule 2, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 20</center></H4>
<H4><center>Complaints</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 475, in page 14, line 8, leave out from `by' to end of line 18 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`an authorised supplier of gas (``the complainant'') has in his capacity as such against—
<P>
(a) the supplier, in respect of any matter connected with the services provided by him in the course of carrying on regulated activities; or
<P>
(b) any other authorised person, in respect of any matter affecting those services which is connected with the carrying on by that other person of regulated activities.
<P>
(2) Where a complaint to which this section applies (other than one appearing to it to be frivolous or vexatious) is referred to the Council by or on behalf of the complainant, the Council shall (subject to subsection (5)) investigate the complaint for the purpose of determining whether it is appropriate to take any action under subsection (6).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 476 to 486.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We intend that the consumer council should have a duty to investigate complaints made by individual consumers about the service that they receive from their gas or electricity supplier. Amendments Nos. 475 and 481 make identical amendments to the gas and electricity Acts to clarify the definition of a complaint that will engage this duty.
<P>
First, the amendments put beyond doubt the fact that a complaint from a consumer must be made in his capacity as a consumer. I know that that has troubled the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Complaints made by consumers in another capacity—for example about street works unconnected to their supply—will not qualify.
<P>
Secondly, the amendments make it clear that the complaint is to be about the service provided by the gas or electricity supplier. That is, after all, what the consumer is interested in, rather than whether a particular matter is or is not regulated by the licence.
<P>
Thirdly, each of the subsections (1)(b) allows that a complaint against a licence holder other than the supplier—for example against the distributor—falls within the definition if it is about something affecting the service from the supplier. Therefore, a complaint against the electricity distributor about an interruption in supply would qualify.
<P>
Finally, we propose to amend each of the subsections (2) so that the purpose of the council's investigation is given. The amendment includes a cross-reference to subsection (6), where the purpose is stated as the reaching of a satisfactory resolution of the complaint.
<P>
As a result of the amendments, the definition of a complaint which engages the duty to investigate will be clearer, and the purpose of the investigation will be explicit. I commend amendments Nos. 475 to 486 to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I hope that the Minister does not intend that group of amendments to deal with the problem of gaming, because it will not do so. Instead, it seeks to prevent consumers from complaining about issues such as street works and to prevent vexatious consumers. It does not deal with the real problem of commercial organisations making genuine complaints as consumer, albeit consumers in a commercial capacity rather than an individual capacity. We are concerned about that issue, and the Minister has not yet addressed the problem. I seek an assurance from him that the Government will attempt to deal with the problem of regulatory gaming while the Bill is in Committee.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We are very much aware of the problem of regulatory gaming, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that the provisions are here in order that that can be resisted. If he wishes to continue this debate elsewhere, I shall be happy to accommodate him.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendments are crucial, in that they highlight one of the fundamental problems in the Bill, to which we have recently referred.
<P>
The consumer council is, in the words of the Minister, a partisan advocate for the consumer. It is to act as the consumers' representative—an unelected representative, but none the less, in some unspecified way, a representative of consumer interests. Under the clause, it is instructed to investigate consumer complaints and to hand over the results of the investigation to the authority, if the consumer council believes that action needs to be taken against a licence holder.
<P>
Will the regulatory authority be able to rely on that report? We have touched on that question in earlier debates. Will the report be objective enough to be relied on without further investigation, having been prepared from a partisan viewpoint? Alternatively, should the regulatory authority conduct a new report process? That would present the problem of having to duplicate the investigation, which would be a burden for the utility under investigation. It would also incur unnecessary costs to the regulatory authority, which would be passed on to the consumer.
<P>
The amendment seeks to deal with such problems by incorporating into the Bill a statutory requirement that any investigation to be carried out by the consumer council should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>conducted in an objective and impartial manner.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It should then be possible for the regulatory authority to rely on the report from the consumer council without having to repeat the whole process. That sort of difficulty with the Bill—even more than the problems with drafting—highlights how appallingly the policy behind the measures has been thought through.
<P>
The amendments try, in a helpful way, to mitigate those problems, although we still believe that the entire regulatory structure of the Bill is wrong and should be withdrawn. If the Minister will accept the amendment, it would at least help to deal with one of the key problems in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman would like to amend clause 20 to require the council to ensure that the investigation of complaints would be conducted in an objective and impartial manner. It is in the council's interest to ensure that the process by which it carries out investigations is unbiased and impartial. Any suggestion that the council had acted improperly in investigating a consumer complaint would only rebound on its reputation. That, in turn, would undermine the council's ability to act as an effective advocate for consumers.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has tabled a similar amendment to clause 21. That clause provides the council with the function to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>investigate any matter . . . which appears to it to be a matter relating to the interests of<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
gas and electricity consumers.
<P>
The Government intend to leave the council free to investigate any matter that it regards as necessary to fulfil its role as consumer advocate and for any purpose that advances consumer interests.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman further proposes that the council prepare and publish guidance on how to ensure that investigations under clause 21 are conducted objectively and impartially. It is for the council to manage its own staff and decide the process by which it carries out investigations according to the circumstances of individual cases. The council may wish to pursue overtly partisan objectives. When investigating complaints, the council's reputation and ability to advocate consumer interests will suffer if it does not set about investigations conscientiously.
<P>
Accordingly, it is not appropriate to include the requirement in the Bill. I shall therefore resist the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not accept that. If the council conducts investigations in such a manner, there is no harm in adding the amendments to the Bill. However, if the council does not conduct investigations impartially, the amendments would be important.
<P>
I do not accept the Minister's argument that it is in the council's interest to be seen as impartial and objective in conducting such investigations. Being seen as an activist and pro-consumer organisation is in the council's interest. Indeed, that is its remit, as set out by the Minister, and it conflicts with establishing a reputation for conducting objective investigations.
<P>
The council will go down the route of being as pro-consumer as possible. Understandably, the Bill attempts to build in an adversarial regime, involving the council, which represents consumers, and the regulatory authority, which represents the industry. That is how it has been described and that is what will happen. It is naïve of the Minister not to expect the council to go down that route.
<P>
However, if the Minister is right, the amendments would have no impact and would not need to be used. In view of the fact that we shall probably return to this matter later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 251, in page 16, line 40, leave out `31' and insert `32'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 258 and 498.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall be brief, as these are essentially technical amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 251 corrects the reference to sections of the Gas Act 1986 repealed as a result of clause 20. Amendments Nos. 258 and 498 are needed to ensure that references to sections in the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989 repealed in clause 20 are included in the full list of repeals in schedule 7.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): I beg to move amendment No. 499, in page 16, line 47, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The power to undertake an investigation under this section includes, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), power to investigate any matter relating to or to anything connected with gas fittings (or their use) or the use of gas supplied by gas suppliers.
<P>
(1B) In subsection (1A) ``gas fittings'' means gas fittings used or intended to be used by persons supplied with gas by gas suppliers.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In 1999, more than 6,200 complaints—equating to about 9 per cent—dealt with by the gas consumers council involved gas safety and fittings, installation, service and repair. The wording of clause 21(1) may be wide enough to give the new council power to investigate and report on matters connected with gas fittings or the use of gas equivalent to that of the present council under section 33 of the Gas Act 1986.
<P>
However, amendment No. 499 would put that beyond all doubt by making an express statement on the matter in clause 21, ensuring that the new council can deal with important issues such as death and illness resulting from carbon monoxide poisoning, metres and their accuracy, and the gumming up of gas appliances through a nasty gas quality problem known as sulphidation. I trust that my hon. Friend the Minister and other hon. Members will accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As always, my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton has made a helpful contribution to the Committee's scrutiny of the Bill and the Government accept her amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 487, in page 17, leave out lines 1 to 3.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 491.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The amendments remove from the council the requirement for it to notify both GEMA and the Secretary of State before undertaking an investigation under the clause.
<P>
The purpose of the requirement was to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, and consequently wasted resources, where GEMA or the Secretary of State was already conducting an investigation into the same, or a similar, matter as that proposed to be investigated by the council. However, we have listened to the gas consumers council, which raised the objection that it conducts thousands of investigations a year. It argues that it would be neither workable nor practicable for it to inform GEMA and the Secretary of State every time that it wanted to conduct an investigation, no matter how small.
<P>
The intention had been that the council's obligation to notify GEMA and the Secretary of State would apply only to formal investigations involving an extensive commitment of resources. We have never intended such a notification to be given every time a member of the council picks up the phone to raise a minor query.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 508, in page 19, line 7, leave out `desirability' and insert `imperative'.
<P>
Government amendment No. 512
<P>
No. 148, in page 19, line 8, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) The Authority or a licence holder shall not be required to comply with a notice under subsection (2) where—:
<P>
(a) the information required does not exist substantially in the form requested and could only be provided at disproportionate cost to the Authority or licence holder; or
<P>
(b) the information is of a description which the Authority or licence holder could not be compelled to produce, or give in evidence, in civil proceedings before the court.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendments Nos. 510, 511 and 512 deal with drafting changes and corrections, so I shall be brief.
<P>
Amendment No. 510 removes an unnecessary qualification to the type of information that the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council may require from the authority. Amendment No. 511 changes the terms used to refer to a gas and electricity licence holder in the clause. Amendment No. 512 would remove the word ``any'' from the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Authority and any licence holder<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in subsection (3), because it is superfluous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> These are more drafting changes from the Minister. Now that he is spreading his Government amendments around among other hon. Members, I shall always remember to add one when I total the number of the Government's drafting amendments. He may, of course, have been persuaded by the long and persuasive speech of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton.
<P>
I hope that the Government can accept amendment No. 148. They owe me at least one acceptance, given all the amendments that Conservative Members have tabled. I bet that they accept one next week.
<P>
The amendments again try to minimise cost. Amendment No. 148 in particular would insert into the clause details of when the licence holder would not be required to comply with a request for information. That would occur in two circumstances. The first is where the information required does not already exist in a shape that enables it simply to be handed over to the authority. For example, information might be requested about the number of consumers who have a Ford Mondeo. That information does not exist, and the licence holder would have to go to considerable expense to find out which of its customers had a Ford Mondeo. Alternatively, it could involve analysing or reprocessing information that it already has, but is not in the format requested by the authority. It would be unreasonable to expect the licence holder to go to the trouble of reprocessing that information, unless there was a legitimate reason for doing so. That is why the amendment refers to disproportionate cost compared with the benefit that the information would give.
<P>
The licence holder does not have to supply information in those circumstances, which is reasonable, or where the information is to be used in a court of law as part of civil proceedings. That point is referred to in paragraph 3 of the Government's consultation document, which states that information relevant to court proceedings is exempt. Therefore, the Government should accept at least the second part of the amendment. If they are truly serious about wishing to keep costs under control, they should also accept the first part.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> If the council has a long and complex set of questions, it will almost certainly put them in writing, if only to act as a record of the request. That will be the best way of ensuring that there is no misunderstanding and it gets what it wants. However, what about a case in which the council wants a quick piece of advice? For example, it might want to know what tariff a licensee was offering to a particular group of consumers at a particular moment in time. In that case, it should not have to go through the rigmarole of a formal written request.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wants the consumer council to specify to what functions the information relates and the reasons for requiring its disclosure. Taking the latter point first, clause 22 does not deal with the disclosure of information, and it is by no means certain that the council will ever seek to disclose information that is given to it under those provisions. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman means disclosure to the council, in which case the latter point adds nothing to the former. There is nothing to be gained from requiring the council to give those reasons formally on every request. It would be needlessly bureaucratic and overprescriptive. I therefore resist amendments Nos. 146 and 147.
<P>
Amendment No. 148 would excuse the authority and licensees from supplying information that was disproportionately costly or could not be required in civil proceedings before a court. The Secretary of State has the right to make regulations under subsection (6) prescribing the descriptions of information which the authority or licence holders may refuse to supply. We are currently consulting on the appropriate coverage of such regulations. Our consultation document includes precisely those two classes of information as candidates to be withheld from the council. Government regulations are the appropriate vehicle for that kind of exception. I am sad to say that I must therefore resist amendment No. 148, despite the natural generosity that tempts me to give the hon. Gentleman some satisfaction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I am aware that the points that he covered are in the consultation document. However, with regard to the costs element, paragraph 5 of the document states that the Government doubt that many requests will fail altogether on those grounds. That implies that any regulations that are introduced under subsection (6) are likely to restrict the availability of that provision. Given that there will be a continuing debate about costs, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
