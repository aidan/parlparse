consideration of the Bill, I have a few preliminary announcements.
Members of the Committee may remove their jackets, if they wish, during
our sittings. Will they please ensure that their mobile phones and
pagers are turned off or are on silent mode during our proceedings?
Before we start discussing the Bill, I call Mr. Dismore to
move the sittings

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000126"></a>Mr.
Dismore:</b> Most people in the House know that, for 20 years
before I entered Parliament, I was a personal injury lawyer. I suppose
that I still am&#151;once a lawyer, always a lawyer. I still have my
practising certificate, but I do not take cases. I remain a consultant
with my law firm, and people will know exactly how much I get next
month, having had to declare
it.</div><a name="09070166000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070166000127"></a><b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): Tell us
now.</div><a name="09070166000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000128"></a>Mr.
Dismore:</b> It is not a great
deal.</div><a name="09070166000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a result of my experience, I have maintained a keen interest in the
development of personal injury law, and one of the issues that has been
around for three years is compensation for pleural plaques&#151;or,
as the law stands, the lack of
it.</div><a name="09070166000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pleural
plaques are a thickening of the lining of the lung, which is usually
visible on an X-ray or a CT scan, and are caused by exposure to
asbestos. They represent an increased risk&#151;between 5 and 10 per
cent.&#151;of more serious asbestos-related diseases and, because of
that, pleural plaques cause real anxiety and stress for those who have
them. It is hard to imagine someone&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>fear if they are at risk of developing a disabling illness, such as
mesothelioma, which is painful and always
fatal.</div><a name="09070166000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until
recently, pleural plaques were compensated at common law. Since 1984,
there have been a series of cases mainly against the Ministry of
Defence, the leading one being Church <i class="I">v.</i> Ministry of Defence,
when it was decided that the condition constituted an injury, enabling
damages to be claimed. The amount of compensation has varied from up to
about &#163;7,000 down to between &#163;3,000 and &#163;4,000 for
provisional damages, and as high as &#163;15,000 for full and final
settlement of a
claim.</div><a name="09070166000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the 2006 case of Rothwell <i class="I">v.</i> Chemical and Insulating Company
Ltd, the Court of Appeal found that pleural plaques are not
compensatable, mainly on public policy grounds. The Court refused to
aggregate the condition of pleural plaques with the anxiety and
distress that they cause, deciding that each individual condition is
not compensatable and that courts cannot look at the aggregate of both
pleural plaques and the psychological conditions that they
cause.</div><a name="09070166000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
autumn 2007, that decision was upheld by the House of Lords in Johnston
<i class="I">v.</i> NEI International Combustion Ltd. In fact, it was a
consolidated appeal, including the Rothwell case, with the House of
Lords deciding that pleural plaques were not compensatable. The
Government held a consultation, which ended in October last year. We
are still awaiting the outcome of that consultation, which included
three different options: a no-fault payments scheme, presumably funded
by the taxpayer, only for historic cases prior to the House of Lords
ruling; a general no-fault scheme, which would relate to historic cases
and those in the future; and a return to the common law scheme. The
Government have so far not made their position clear about which they
want to
do.</div><a name="09070166000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
1 is the meat of the Bill. It is modest. All the Bill seeks to do is to
turn back the law to what we all thought it was prior to the decision
in the House of Lords. It relates purely and simply to pleural plaques.
It maintains the basic principles of negligence or breach of statutory
duty as the test for liability. Causation and the burden of proof that
the claim exists are still on the
claimant.</div><a name="09070166000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause simply states that pleural plaques are a personal injury
constituting actionable damage and that people may recover damages in
respect of them, but nothing affects the normal operation of the rule
of the law of negligence and breach of statutory duty. I hope that the
clause will find favour with the
Committee.</div><a name="09070166000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070166000129"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): It is a great pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr. Bayley. As the hon. Gentleman
confessed, once a lawyer always a lawyer. I was an academic lawyer in
precisely the same field. Just as his earnings might well be revealed
this month, my rather pathetic royalties from various works in the
field will soon be revealed as well. I have a few questions, which the
hon. Gentleman might be able to answer, or the Government might, if
they are to come up with a comprehensive scheme to solve the
problem.</div><a name="09070166000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause operates by declaring&#151;deeming&#151;pleural plaques to
be a personal injury constituting actionable damage. The object of the
exercise is to make sure that pleural plaques cases do not fail on the
grounds that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>they do not meet one of the most important tests in a negligence case,
which is that there is legally actionable damage. Damage is the gist of
a negligence action; no one can sue for negligence unless there is
legally recognised damage. That is one of the most important principles
of the law. The clause ensures that, regardless of what the House of
Lords said in the Johnston case, a pleural plaques case will meet that
test.</div><a name="09070166000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members know that I have been particularly concerned about one aspect
of the House of Lords decision in the pleural plaques case, which the
hon. Gentleman has not yet dealt with. I want to put on the record that
I am still worried that his solution does not obviously solve the
problem that I have in mind, which is the problem in the Grieves
<i class="I">v.</i> Everard case. That was a pleural plaques case, but with an
extra element, which should have made the case more easy for the
claimant to win than other cases. That extra element was that the
victim was suffering from a recognised mental illness as a result of
the pleural plaques that had been discovered in his
lungs.</div><a name="09070166000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
law on psychiatric damage is extremely confused and is hostile to
claimants, which is completely at odds with modern views about mental
illness&#151;as I explained in a Westminster Hall debate that we had
on the subject, so I do not want to go into details again. The
hostility of the courts towards psychiatric illness goes back to a time
when not everyone was convinced that mental illness had reality and
when people believed that mental illness could easily be faked. That
hostility is completely inappropriate now, in an era when we fully
recognise that mental illness is illness. Someone with depression is
just as ill as someone with a broken
leg.</div><a name="09070166000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Grieves case, however, that hostility to claimants with psychiatric
illness continued in the House of Lords. Mr. Grieves was
told that he could not claim, for a variety of reasons, one of which
amounted to saying that a person of ordinary fortitude would not react
to being told that they had pleural plaques in such a way as to cause
them depression. I find that rather difficult to follow, because that
was what happened in reality. The judgment seemed to be blaming the
victim. If someone suffers an ordinary injury and it turns out to be
worse than expected because of some pre-existing condition of the
victim, the victim does not have compensation reduced. The defendant,
whose fault the whole thing was, has to take the risk of that extra
injury. The ordinary fortitude rule seems to be
unfair.</div><a name="09070166000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, there was a notion that the real problem was that the doctor
had told Mr. Grieves that he had pleural plaques and somehow
it was the doctor&#146;s fault that the victim developed psychiatric
illness, which again seems extraordinary. It was the employer who
exposed the victim to asbestos. It cannot really be unexpected that a
doctor would tell a victim of a
condition.</div><a name="09070166000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was also a sense that there was no stressful event caused by the
employer but that the stressful event was caused by the doctor or the
victim himself. All those notions are hostile to victims who have a
perfectly valid claim. I am simply concerned about whether 
clause 1 helps victims in those circumstances, because
subsection (1) says:</div>
<a name="09070166000102"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Asbestos-related
pleural plaques are a personal injury which constitute actionable
damage.&#148;</div><a name="09070166000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not mention psychiatric illness.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="09070166000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a number of possible
relationships between the concept of personal and psychiatric injury,
which the courts have explored over the years, and the law is not
entirely clear. One view is that psychiatric illness is simply a form
of personal injury. When I was an academic, that was the view I tended
to take, but it is not the view that the courts have taken over the
years. Some courts have tended to separate personal injury and
psychiatric illness to a great extent, so I am not sure that clause 1
would solve the problem in the Grieves case. I hope that when we get to
a final answer, we will address the problem of Mr. Grieves.
That is my fundamental
point.</div><a name="09070166000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make one or two other points about clause 1. As the
hon. Member for Hendon said, the object of clause 1 is to leave the
general law of negligence alone and simply deal with the one specific
point of the actionability of pleural plaques. I am grateful for that,
because a difficulty in this area is that the law of negligence is a
very delicate flower. We do not want to upset the whole thing and
interfere with how it works just by accident, by trying to solve a
particular problem. He has not quite got over the problem of causation,
as one would hope, because he has used the phrase
&#147;asbestos-related&#148;, and we still need to think about how
a cause is liable to work in that context. More important than that, he
has not addressed the question of damages&#151;how much compensation
someone would get. He has deliberately left that alone and I want to
ask him what he expects the measure of damages to be under his
clause.</div><a name="09070166000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman referred to taking the law back to where it was before
the House of Lords decision, but the law before that decision assumed
that pleural plaques were actionable, not just because an Act of
Parliament said that they were, but because there was an assumption
that there was some sort of actionable damage at common law. If we take
away that assumption, the courts will start again and will be looking
at the law anew. They will not be going back to the previous law in
terms of the amount of compensation; they will be thinking about it
from the start.</div><a name="09070166000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a question about the extent to which anxiety will be a part of the
measure of damage. In ordinary law, pure anxiety&#151;pure emotional
distress&#151;is not recoverable. One cannot get damages just for
distress. Distress, though associated with personal injury in some
way&#151;for example, with pain&#151;attracts a degree of
compensation, but in most pleural plaques cases there is no physical
pain at that point of the disease, but simply anxiety about the fact
that one has pleural plaques. I am concerned about whether the courts
will go along with offering compensation for anxiety. If they do not,
we could have a pleural plaques case in which there is no other
disability at that point. Pleural plaques are an indicator that
something might happen in the future, but most of the time, there is no
disability at that point.</div>
<a name="09070166000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned that we will end up in a situation in which the courts say
that something is an actionable loss because it is deemed to be so by
clause 1, but there is no other way in which we can measure damages.
The damages would therefore come out as either zero or nominal. I do
not think that that is what the hon. Gentleman intends, so I want to
get on the record what he does
intend.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000130"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Bayley. Before I comment on
clause 1, I say to the Committee that we have been dealing
with this issue for some time. I am beginning to lose count of the
number of debates on pleural plaques to which I have replied.</div>
<a name="09070166000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The main
focus of the clause is about providing compensation for pleural
plaques. The Government recognise the legitimate grievance that exists
on that issue, particularly for those whose claims for pleural plaque
compensation could not proceed as a result of the decision by the House
of Lords. They had a genuine expectation that compensation would be
available, but that has now been denied to them.</div>
<a name="09070166000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
compensation was payable, people who were diagnosed with the condition
were then able to establish the liability of their employer for
negligent exposure to asbestos. That gave them the opportunity to get
swifter compensation at a later date if a more serious asbestos-related
condition developed. That benefit has now been lost as a result of the
House of Lords decision. In recognition of those concerns, we carried
out a consultation exercise on pleural plaques. That consultation
proposed action to improve the understanding of pleural plaques, and to
provide support and reassurance to those who have been diagnosed with
them, to help allay their concerns. It also considered the issues that
arise in relation to changing the law of negligence, and we invited
views on whether that would or would not be appropriate. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Hendon said, we sought views on the merits of
offering no-fault financial support to people diagnosed with pleural
plaques, and suggested two possible ways that that might be
achieved.</div><a name="09070166000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
publishing the consultation paper, we emphasised the importance of
ensuring that any decision taken by the Government had to be reached on
the basis of the best available current medical evidence. For that
reason, we asked the chief medical officer and the Industrial Injuries
Advisory Council to review the medical evidence during the consultation
process. Published copies of those reports are in the Library, and I
hope that they are available to members of the Committee and to other
hon. Members.</div>
<a name="09070166000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070166000131"></a><b class="B">Jim
Sheridan</b> (Paisley and Renfrewshire, North) (Lab): The
Minister will be aware that the Scottish Parliament has recently
overturned the decision to award compensation to people in Scotland. I
work on the assumption that it also received medical advice. Does the
Minister have any access to that medical advice, and will she make it
available to the Committee?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000132"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I do not have direct access to that advice. The
Scottish Parliament listened to medical experts at oral hearings. My
understanding is that those experts came to the same conclusion as the
chief medical officer and the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, but
that they made no comment about whether the Parliament should make a
decision on allowing compensation. If I can get recorded evidence of
those discussions, I will make it available to the Committee and the
wider parliamentary estate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div><a name="09070166000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me set out
a couple of the key findings in the two reports. The reports
demonstrated a consensus on a number of important issues relating to
the medical nature of pleural plaques. For example, it is generally
accepted that although a diagnosis of pleural plaques confirms that a
person has been exposed to asbestos, pleural plaques do not, in
themselves, produce any significant change or loss of lung function,
and are unlikely to cause physical symptoms. I shall come to what the
hon. Member for Cambridge said about psychological issues.</div>
<a name="09070166000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pleural plaques do not become
malignant or lead to mesothelioma, or other asbestos-related diseases.
Any increased risk of a person with pleural plaques developing an
asbestos-related disease arises not because of the pleural plaques, but
because of that person&#146;s exposure to asbestos. We are
particularly keen to address that point.</div>
<a name="09070166000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman makes a fair point about the issue of psychological and
psychiatric illnesses. I know that he raised it before, in the case
that was also overturned by the House of Lords. The courts have
established the parameters governing claims for psychiatric illness,
and my understanding is that Mr. Grieves&#146; case was
decided according to those principles. We prefer the courts to continue
to develop the law in that area and we are publishing a consultation
paper&#151;a response paper&#151;today on damages, which reflects
that position. The hon. Gentleman may well want to come back to me once
he has read it.</div>
<a name="09070166000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise
that we are still considering what our response to the issue should be
in light not just of the reports I have mentioned, but of all the other
evidence that has been presented to us. As my right hon. Friend the
Justice Secretary indicated recently, we are committed to publishing
our response before the summer recess. We recognise fully that those
conclusions will have to address the grievances that have been outlined
by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon and the hon. Member for
Cambridge, and be made in the context of the medical evidence and other
submissions.</div>
<a name="09070166000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
represents one approach to the issue, but a number of other approaches
could be appropriate and we want to assess the best response. It is
therefore not possible at this stage to give a firm indication of the
Government&#146;s position on the Bill, pending those conclusions
being reached. For that reason it has not been possible for me to table
any amendments for consideration at this stage.</div>
<a name="09070166000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
basis, if the Committee decides that this clause&#151;and the
others&#151;should stand part of the Bill, it may be necessary for
the Government to oppose it, or table amendments to it, at a later
stage.</div>
<a name="09070166000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070166000133"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Anderson</b> (Blaydon) (Lab): The hon. Member for
Cambridge spoke about people going for compensation and being told by
the courts that depression was not an issue that they could rule on, so
they could not get compensation. I have to tell the Committee that I am
massively depressed by having to keep coming back to the
issue&#151;we have been listening to the debate for nearly two
years.</div>
<a name="09070166000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
depressed when I think that civil servants told solicitors that I have
been working with on this issue that pleural plaques are no more
serious than freckles. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>I am depressed that in real life, people like Bob Chaplin
from Gateshead lost his wife, who was our mayor, this year. I am
depressed that I have to keep going to fundraisers organised by people
like Anne Craig, who lost her husband. People such as Chris Knighton do
tremendous work to raise money, when what they should be doing is
enjoying retirement, but they cannot because their husbands have died
of an asbestos-related disease.</div>
<a name="09070166000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
depressed that no one from the Conservative party could even be
bothered to come here today to give support, or argue against what is
being said
here.</div><a name="09070166000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000134"></a>Mr.
Dismore:</b> In fact, the Conservative party was going to
attend in the guise of the hon. Member for Epping Forest
(Mrs. Laing). Unfortunately there was a mix-up on the
appointment to the Committee. The hon. Lady was to be substituted for
the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham), but
it was not done properly. I have spoken to the hon. Lady and she has
indicated that, in principle, the Conservative party is content for the
Bill to go through. I think that it was a mix-up rather than a
deliberate desire to ignore the Committee.</div>
<a name="09070166000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000135"></a>Mr.
Anderson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I
am slightly less depressed&#151;I do not know what the alternative to
being even more un-depressed is. I was pleased that my hon. Friend the
Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton) was so interested in
the debate that he came into the room when he was not even serving on
the Committee&#151;that is how supportive he is on the
issue.</div><a name="09070166000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">But
the truth is, I am more depressed than anything else by the fact that
we have to come here today and listen to my hon. Friend the Member for
Hendon, because it should not be him who is coming here to hold the
debate&#151;it should be the Government. Time and again, we have been
told by our Government, by the Prime Minister, by the Secretary of
State and by the Chancellor that, &#147;Yes, the issue will be
resolved.&#148; But it is not resolved, and it still does not look
like it will be resolved.</div>
<a name="09070166000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070166000136"></a><b class="B">Linda
Gilroy</b> (Plymouth, Sutton) (Lab/Co-op): Is my hon. Friend
also depressed by the fact that, at the moment, those who discover that
they have pleural plaques, and then go on to discover that they have a
more serious disease, have the additional hurdle of having to prove
that the employer is responsible? That is one of the most worrying
aspects of the whole
issue.</div><a name="09070166000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000137"></a>Mr.
Anderson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. Of
course, it is about people who are in a desperate state, having to go
through all the legal and medical hoops to try to get their just
deserts. The real issue, at the bottom of all this, is that none of
this was made by God; it was made by man. People knew what they were
doing; they knew that they were poisoning people at work; and they knew
that they were not looking after people properly. They also know, every
time they go to court and win, that they are escaping their just
deserts. They should be looking after the people who they have poisoned
deliberately and criminally. But it looks again as if they are getting
off the hook today, and that is totally out of order.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div><a name="09070166000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that we have lost count of the debates that we have had on the
issue. She is right, but I ask her: have we lost count of the people
who have died as a result of the issue since we started talking about
it in October 2007? Have we lost count of the people who have been
refused compensation? We should not do that. What we should do is stop
looking for the middle way and behaving like the new Labour Government
that have let the people down. We should start acting in the interests
of our class, because this is a class issue&#151;it is the people who
have done the work who, in the main, have suffered as a result of
asbestos. So I say to the Minister today: support us on the Bill and
get on with the real job. If there are flaws in the Bill and if what
the hon. Member for Cambridge said is still an issue&#151;I recognise
and acknowledge the work that he has done on the issue over a long
period&#151;put it right, and put it right
now.</div>
<a name="09070166000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000138"></a>Mr.
Dismore:</b> Working backwards, I agree with what my hon.
Friend the Member for Blaydon has said. The issue has indeed gone on an
awfully long time&#151;three years since the House of Lords
judgment&#151;and it is necessary to have it resolved. I am grateful
to my hon. Friend the Minister for making it clear that the Government
will announce before the summer recess how they intend to proceed. My
Bill may not be perfect. It will come back on Report in October if it
gets through the Committee today, and I am quite happy to work with my
hon. Friend on amendments to the Bill if we can come up with a solution
we can all agree with.</div>
<a name="09070166000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly, I do not think that
there is a great deal of dispute about the medical evidence. Pleural
plaques are asymptomatic. They carry a risk of 5 to 10 per cent. of
developing into one of the more serious asbestos-related conditions,
and they cause considerable anxiety and, often, recognised psychiatric
injury to those who have them. I do not think that there is a great
deal of dispute about that. The question is: what do we do about
it?</div>
<a name="09070166000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
mention, as I did in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for
Blaydon, that although the Conservative party is not present in the
body of the Committee, they are, in the shape of the hon. Member for
Epping Forest, observing the proceedings closely from the Gallery. I am
sorry that she is not able to participate, because she made a useful
contribution on Second Reading.</div>
<a name="09070166000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
for the substantive points made by the hon. Member for Cambridge,
because they are important. In particular, he mentioned the case of
Grieves <i class="I">v.</i> Everard, which I am familiar with. He is right to say
that the law is very bad when it comes to looking at psychiatric
damage. For any physical injury, we apply subjective tests, but for
psychiatric damage, it is an objective test. There is no logical reason
for that&#151;it goes back into the mists of time, when we had the
old nervous shock cases before the second world war. It has been a
long, hard battle to get psychiatric injury established.</div>
<a name="09070166000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think I am
right in saying that I fought and tried the very first case of
post-traumatic stress disorder, as it became known, in the 1980s. We
had a sympathetic judge who commented in the judgment that psychiatric
injury was significantly under-compensated, and he gave us a pretty
good award within the framework of the compensation rules at the time.
Perhaps next year I can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>work with the hon. Gentleman on another private Member&#146;s Bill to
try to put some of these things right, but that is not the substance of
what we are discussing
today.</div><a name="09070166000105"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div>
<a name="09070166000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked about the wording &#147;asbestos-related&#148;.
This is an issue not of causation but of definition. The wording arises
in subsection (3), which mentions &#147;asbestos-related pleural
plaques&#148;, and I suppose that it could say
&#147;asbestos-caused pleural plaques&#148;, but I think that the
point is definitional rather than causative.</div>
<a name="09070166000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
substantive point that the hon. Gentleman raised was about quantum,
about which he is right. It is still an issue and it should be an issue
for the courts, as it is not right for us to legislate as to what
quantum should be. The hon. Gentleman also made some important points
about anxiety, but that issue has been dealt with in the courts. In the
Rothwell case, the Court of Appeal delivered a unanimous judgment on
what quantum would have been had actionability been established. The
courts often do that, Mr. Bayley; they put your case down
and then tell you what you would have got if you had won. It is
extremely annoying. The worst example of that I have seen was when Lord
Judge, then Mr. Justice Judge, tried the case, kicked us out
and said that if I had won, the client would have got &#163;70,000.
The client was not at all amused; he would rather not have
known.</div>
<a name="09070166000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a habit of the courts, and in the Rothwell case, the Court of Appeal
delivered a judgment of what quantum would have been, based on a review
of the county court and High Court decisions of the previous 20 years.
Also, the House of Lords has held that if the claimant has suffered
more than minimal damage, they are entitled to recover for psychiatric
consequences, including anxiety and psychiatric harm that constitutes a
recognised diagnosable psychiatric condition. I think that is the point
that the hon. Gentleman made. The  Bill confirms that pleural
plaques are actionable, so compensation for psychiatric consequences
would follow. In the Rothwell case, provisional damages were assessed
at &#163;6,000 to &#163;7,000.</div>
<a name="09070166000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Full and
final damages take into account contingent financial risks in addition
to the award for anxiety&#151;that was dealt with in a case called
Hindson, which went to appeal and was remitted by the Court of Appeal
to the High Court for determination of damages. In the full and final
settlement, damages were &#163;20,000. Actionability was not in issue
in that case, because it concerned only the principle of assessment of
quantum where the claimant elected for full and final damages rather
than provisional damages. We already have case law that deals with the
problem on a contingent basis should pleural plaques have been
actionable. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points.</div><a name="09070166000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000139"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Perhaps it would help the Committee if I said
that we have had a fairly broad, Second Reading-style debate on clause
1, and that the subsequent clauses are pretty narrow, so I shall be a
strict Chairman. That is not because of any wish not to debate the
issue&#151;my constituency is a railway constituency with a very high
incidence of asbestos-related diseases that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>obviously came from a former carriage works&#151;but because there is
a severe shortage of Committee time for private Member&#146;s Bills.
As the Chair, I think it my duty to help Members to make progress with
their private Member&#146;s Bills in the limited Committee time
available. Without wishing to prevent any Member from speaking about
the matters in the subsequent clauses, I hope that we will
make some good
progress.</div><a name="09070166000011"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
2</h4><a name="09070166000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Pleural
thickening and
asbestosis</div><a name="09070166000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09070166000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000140"></a>Mr.
Dismore:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bayley. I do not think
that the remainder of the clauses will take up a great deal of time as
they are pretty technical. Clause 2 gives effect to the general
principles in clause 1, which I have discussed, about the asymptomatic
nature of pleural plaques. It restates that the burden of proof remains
with the claimant, which is an old principle of personal injury
law.</div><a name="09070166000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000141"></a>David
Howarth:</b> My only point on the clause has already been
referred to by the Minister in what she said on clause 1. Arguably,
anyone who has been exposed to asbestos is in a similar position to
someone with pleural plaques, asymptomatic pleural thickening or
asymptomatic asbestosis, in that they are at risk of developing the
serious diseases in the future. The clause does not deal with such
people and I hope that the Government will bear that in mind when they
come forward with their proposals. We are dealing with a much broader
class of people who are in a similar
situation.</div><a name="09070166000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000142"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I take exactly what hon. Gentleman says. The
clause extends the provisions in a way that was not included in our
consultation exercise, so we would have to consider carefully, in light
of our conclusions, whether that should be included in any legislation.
I leave it at that, with the same caveat as I left at the end of clause
1, that we shall reflect further on whether we need to amend the clause
at a later
stage.</div><a name="09070166000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000143"></a>Mr.
Dismore:</b> I do not think that the hon. Member for Cambridge
is right about that point. It is not just exposure to the hazard that
counts; there is physiological change, albeit asymptomatic, which is
revealed in an X-ray or CT scan, so there is an additional element
beyond mere exposure. Although any change may be asymptomatic, the
claimant will know that they have something inside their body
detectable in that way, even if it is not causing them any problems. It
goes slightly beyond mere
exposure.</div><a name="09070166000081"></a>

differently situated from the victims that he is talking

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000146"></a>Mr.
Dismore:</b> Again, the provision is a technical one, to deal
with the question of limitation. The normal limitation period in
personal injury is three years for an ordinary accident, or three years
from the date that the individual could reasonably be expected to know,
for example, that they had a disease. We have a particular problem to
provide for, which is the hiatus caused by the House of Lords judgment
which will last until the day that the Bill becomes law. Effectively,
the clause suspends the limitation period for that time, so that in
such circumstances people whose cases were not brought will not be
time-barred as a consequence. Also, it provides for cases that have not
been determined in those circumstances to
proceed.</div><a name="09070166000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070166000147"></a>Bridget
