<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Keith Bradley): It is important when considering the amendment to put into context the issue of backdating, so it may be helpful to the Committee if I outline in some detail--and, I am afraid, at some length--our proposed approach to backdating and how that is reflected in the Bill, before turning specifically to the amendment.
<P>
Clause 70 provides for a general limit of one month for the backdating of claims for all benefits. It also provides for regulations to prescribe exceptions to that time limit. It is proposed to introduce that provision from June 1998 for all benefits, except housing benefit and council tax benefit, which the provision will cover from October 1998.
<P>
Clause 70(1) replaces section 1(2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 so as to provide that a person shall not be entitled to benefit in respect of any period of more than one month before a claim is made, or treated as made. We propose to use the provision for the automatic backdating of claims for any non-income related benefits, such as retirement pension, widow's benefit and child benefit, for a period of up to one month.
<P>
Clause 70(1) will also be used to provide, as a general rule, that claims to income-related benefits, such as income support, will not be backdated.
<P>
Clause 70(2) amends section 3 of the 1992 Act which provides for late claims to widow's benefits in rare cases such as those involving a missing person, where death is difficult to establish. The new provision aims to ensure that although the time for making a claim will continue to run from when it is determined that the husband has died, or from when the widow first knew of the death, the time limit for claiming benefit following notification of the death will be one month. That will be consistent with clause 70(1).
<P>
I bring to the Committee's attention, however, an anomaly that has arisen in the current drafting of clause 70(2). An unintended effect has been identified which restricts also to one month the time allowed between identification of the husband's body and the widow being made aware of his death. Clearly that is unreasonable. I can, therefore, give the Committee an undertaking that an amendment will be tabled on Report to ensure that in those circumstances, although the widow, once notified of the death, will have one month to claim benefit, 12 months will continue to be allowed between a body being discovered and the widow being advised of the discovery. That will cater for circumstances in which, for example, the widow has changed address or must be traced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns (West Chelmsford):</B> May I just seek clarification on what the Minister has said? If a widow's address and whereabouts are known, but the Department of Social Security is having difficulty in tracking her down, will the time limit for claiming benefit still be one month from the discovery of the body?
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The limit will be one month from the widow being notified of the discovery and identification of her husband's body. A change of address is just one example of a reason why a widow might not quickly be traced.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention, however, to the fact that clause 70(1) also provides powers to prescribe in regulations different backdating periods as well as cases or circumstances in which a person could be entitled to no backdating. I have considered carefully whether exceptions to the general time limits should be allowed. In that, I have obviously taken note of the points put to me in correspondence from individuals and various welfare rights groups. I am grateful for those representations. Taking into account those views, we propose to introduce regulations to provide for a range of exceptions to the general time limits.
<P>
The exceptions will fall into three broad categories. The first category will allow backdating beyond the general one-month time limit. They will apply to non-income related and income-related benefits. They will include cases where entitlement to a benefit is dependent on the claimant's, or another person's, entitlement to another benefit. It is obviously unreasonable for administrative delays in awarding one benefit to deprive a person of entitlement to another.
<P>
In addition, refugees will be allowed, where appropriate, backdated awards of income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit to the date of a successful asylum application. Incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance and maternity allowance claims will also be able to be backdated to protect customers from delays by employers in notifying them that they had no entitlement to statutory sick pay or statutory maternity pay.
<P>
The second group of exceptions will be for income related benefits where the basic rule will be no backdating. Backdating up to the one month time limit will be permitted where special reasons apply. Those will include cases where, first, the customer has difficulty communicating because he has learning, language or literacy difficulties, or he is deaf or blind and there is no one else to make the claim on his behalf; secondly, except in the case of a claim for jobseeker's allowance, the customer is ill or disabled, and there is no one else to make the claim; thirdly the customer is caring for a person who is ill or disabled, and there is no one else to make his claim; fourthly, the customer was given misleading information by an officer of the Department of Social Security or of the Department for Education and Employment, or the customer was given misleading advice, in writing, by a solicitor or other professional adviser, or by a medical practitioner, a local authority or by a person working in a citizens advice bureau or a similar advice agency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> One of the qualifications given by the Minister was that of misleading advice given to a claimant by a Benefits Agency officer. All too often, we deal with constituency cases in which a claimant says that a Benefits Agency officer has told him something, but the officer says that that is not the case or that the person has misunderstood. What mechanism will give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant or will the current situation continue--according to which what the officer says is taken as fact?
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, but I would not go that far. From cases that I have dealt with, I know that the Benefits Agency interpretation is not always taken as correct. Currently, adjudication officers examine cases. Under our proposals for streamlining the system there will be much more opportunity for discussion at the first interview, but if people do not accept a decision they have the right of appeal. That will continue--the facts will be presented and a decision made on who was correct.
<P>
Backdating up to the one month time limit will be permitted if, fifthly, the customer, or his or her partner, was given misleading information in writing about his income or capital by his employer, or former employer, or by a bank or building society; sixthly, if the claimant is required to deal with a domestic emergency affecting him and there is no one else to make his claim, or if the claimant is prevented by adverse weather conditions from attending the appropriate office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne):</B> I am sorry to break the Minister's numerical order, but I want to return to his sixth point, which was about a domestic emergency. Are we talking about a temporary domestic emergency or--I intended to speak about this later if necessary--a bereavement? Someone who is bereaved may take weeks or months to get round to examining his benefit entitlement. Will that type of emergency be covered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> In the particular circumstances that I have outlined, we would be talking about a short-term domestic emergency. I shall, however, deal with widow's payments later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin (West Dorset)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> May I make some progress? I am trying to put the Government's position on the record. That will not limit debate; indeed, it may help it if the position is clear. I am not trying to prevent the hon. Gentleman from participating and I will return to any points that need clarification or further information.
<P>
Finally, the Government propose a third group of exceptions. Regulations will provide for up to one month's backdating where the customer is forced to delay claiming because first, the appropriate office is closed and alternative arrangements are not available; secondly, the customer is unable to attend the appropriate office due to difficulties with his normal mode of transport and no reasonable alternative is available; thirdly, there are adverse postal conditions; fourthly, the customer was previously in receipt of another benefit, and notification of expiry of entitlement to that benefit was not sent to him before the date on which his entitlement expired; fifthly, for family credit or disability working allowance, he had previously been entitled to income support or jobseeker's allowance and the claim for family credit or disability working allowance was made within one month of expiry of entitlement to the previous benefit and vice versa; sixthly, he has recently separated from his partner; and finally, one of his close relatives--a partner, parent, son, daughter, brother or sister--has recently died. That is a more specific point, to which the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) referred.
<P>
I appreciate, from comments made by hon. Members in this debate and, indeed, on Second Reading, that they are concerned about the effects that clause 70 will have on customers who claim specific benefits. I would now like to deal with those concerns.
<P>
Some concern has been expressed about delays in claiming child benefit. I can advise hon. Members that, under our proposals, child benefit will be automatically backdated for up to one month, irrespective of the reason for delay. That appears consistent with the intended effect of part of the Opposition amendment. In most circumstances, that provides a reasonable time for a claim to be registered, bearing in mind that the vast majority of mothers in hospital receive a bounty pack within three days of their baby's birth. Such packs contain child benefit claim forms which are simple to complete.
<P>
Of course, I accept that in a limited number of instances, such packs will not be available, perhaps because the mother and baby have returned home quickly or, indeed, because the baby has been born at home. I have, therefore, asked my officials to explore the possibility of improving the child benefit claim process and, in particular, the possibility of hospitals, health visitors, midwives and others who have early contact with the family not only issuing the claim forms, but ensuring that parents are aware of their entitlement to child benefit at that point. Such communication is particularly important in the case of home deliveries or domino deliveries because contact with the hospital may be limited. The hon. Member for Eastbourne looks puzzled, so let me explain--a domino delivery is when a woman goes into hospital, has the baby and returns home the same day. We can have a wide-ranging discussion about birth if the hon. Gentleman wants.
<P>
Some concern has been expressed about the effect that the Government's proposals will have on late claims to widow's benefits, which I have already briefly mentioned. Under the Government's proposals, claims to widow's benefits such as child benefit will be backdated automatically by as much as one month, irrespective of the reason for delay.
<P>
I appreciate that such claims are obviously made at traumatic times. I consider that in most circumstances, however, one month should be a reasonable period for a claim to be registered. I understand from the Benefits Agency that nearly all widow's benefits claims are already made within one month of the spouse's death.
<P>
In many circumstances that is helped by the claims process itself. It may interest hon. Members to know that a claim for a widow's benefit is dependent on the registration of the death of the husband, which, under current law, generally has to be done within five days.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
When the death is registered, the widow is provided with a notification of death certificate that is designed specifically for social security purposes. The certificate asks whether the person wishes to claim widow's benefit. If the answer is yes, the form should be sent to the Benefits Agency, which will return a detailed claim form to the widow for completion. The date of claim will be the date on which the death was notified and not the date on which the claim form is completed.
<P>
Although the system appears to work well and does not hinder the claiming of benefit, in the interests of streamlining the process even further, I again have asked my officials to see whether further improvements can be made, perhaps by collecting more information at the time of registering the death, rather than relying later on additional information.
<P>
I am examining especially the availability and content of the widow's payment forms that are available when death is registered. In the context of streamlining the process, the Government are not expecting people to visit, for example, two agencies more than once at an especially difficult time. They should not have to in circumstances in which, by simplifying the system, we can resolve the matter at the initial stage.
<P>
I have announced a general review of benefit leaflets, which will more closely examine client-based leaflets, so that available information covers a range of benefits, and so that people do not have to find an appropriate leaflet from a whole series.
<P>
Anxiety has been expressed about our proposals' effect on housing benefit and council tax benefit. I recognise that that issue is difficult. I have, therefore, considered very carefully whether those benefits should be included in the backdating proposals. I have concluded that they should for a number of reasons. Under the proposals, thos benefits will, dependent on the range of exceptions that I have outlined, still be able to be backdated for up to one month. The fact that current rules allow up to 52 weeks backdating, subject to the local authority deciding that good cause exists, does not mean those benefits will generally be backdated for that period.
<P>
The current system, which depends on the local authority accepting that continuous good cause existed for backdating, can be confusing for staff and customers. A number of local authorities have suggested that more prescriptive rules should be introduced to achieve greater efficiency in determining such claims.
<P>
That said, as with other benefits I have mentioned, it is important to consider whether the claims process should be simplified. As hon. Members may be aware, there are two types of housing benefit and council tax benefit claims. First, there are claims in which the claimant receives income support and is automatically entitled to maximum benefit, subject to eligible rent. Secondly, there are those claims in which there is no income support in payment, and benefit entitlement is subject to the claimant's income and capital. It is important to remember that housing benefit and council tax benefit may be paid to people in full-time work who have an additional source of income.
<P>
If specific conditions have been satisfied, existing legislation allows local authorities to treat a claim as having been made on an earlier date. For example, income support claim forms contain a short tick-box for claimants to show whether they want to claim housing benefit and/or council tax benefit. The form can be given to the Benefits Agency with the income support claim, and it is then passed on to the local authority. If the Benefits Agency delays passing the form to the local authority, housing benefit and council tax benefits claims should still be treated as having been made on the date from which income support entitlement starts, even though the period involved may be more than one month.
<P>
I am grateful for your indulgence, Mr. O'Hara, in giving me the opportunity to explain in some detail the Government's proposals.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister may not be able to answer on the hoof, but the original proposals gave the figure to be saved as some &#163;57 million. Does the hon. Gentleman have any feel for how much that figure is likely to be reduced by the exclusions that he set out so coherently in his speech?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I believe that the figures for savings scored include the exceptions that I have outlined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb (Northavon):</B> I am somewhat puzzled. The written answer from the Minister to me on 3rd November gave the figure as &#163;58 million in a full year. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he knew then that these concessions would be made?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> What I am saying is that in the deliberations on the savings, it was always the case that the Government would bring forward exceptions. These exceptions are net in the sense that the savings have been scored. I have now given the details of the exceptions because it is only now that the details have been finally agreed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I should like to pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) and my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne. If it was always the Government's intention to make exceptions, why were we not told on Second Reading, when the issue featured heavily? It seems odd to me and, I assume, to the hon. Member for Northavon, that the Government produced a costing of the savings as a result of the provisions in the Bill, yet now they say that they had already calculated the exceptions in that costing. How did they know at that time what exceptions to make when they had not received any representations on the issue from interested parties or Members of Parliament?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> It is only now that the details of the exceptions have been given because I have been considering, between Second Reading and today, whether there will be additional exceptions and what other circumstances may be appropriate. The details will be contained in regulations and will be debated further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I think that I have answered the point. The hon. Gentleman can make his points in the relevant debate on this issue.
<P>
I am grateful for your indulgence, Mr. O'Hara, in allowing me to describe precisely how we will treat the clause. The amendment appears to provide a general time limit of three months for all benefits except income-related benefit, industrial injuries benefit and child benefit. Those would have a one-month limit. I have already informed the Committee that we propose to provide, in regulations, for the automatic backdating of claims to any non-income-related benefits, such as retirement pension, widow's benefit, industrial injuries benefit and child benefit for a period of up to one month.
<P>
I have also said that, as a general rule, claims to income-related benefits such as income support will not be backdated although regulations will provide for up to one month's backdating, subject to prescribed special reasons. On that basis, our proposals are at least consistent with the apparent intention behind part of the amendment. However, the amendment would also introduce an additional provision to allow the backdating of contributory and non-contributory benefits for a period of three months.
<P>
This aspect of the amendment would complicate the system by introducing different time limits for making a claim, depending on which type of benefit was being claimed. This would be particularly difficult for customers to understand and staff to administer.
<P>
Let me give an example. A person is entitled to both income support and incapacity benefit which have been claimed on the same day. The customer asks for both to be backdated--say, for a period of two months. If the amendment were accepted, backdating might be allowed for the whole two months for incapacity benefit but for only one month for income support. It would be difficult to explain why the two should be treated differently. Customers could find the situation confusing. This would inevitably lead to more inquiries and possibly more appeals.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the concerns expressed by Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Is the Minister saying that the proposed system, with the exceptions that he has described, will not introduce any differences? Does he therefore object to the amendment because it will introduce such differences between claims?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The purpose of the alignment is to simplify the system. Apart from the exceptions that I have laid out, the one-month backdating will apply in every case. That will remove the confusion about benefits and different entitlements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does the Minister accept that use of a phrase such as ``exceptions that I have laid out'' introduces just the sort of differences for which he criticises the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Yes, but I am talking about different backdating rules applying to claims for benefit and to entitlement to benefit. I am not talking about exceptions to the general rule, which is that backdating will be aligned to one month.
<P>
These measures, in the short term, will allow us to focus spending on areas of higher priority. We will not implement unpalatable measures that we inherited from the previous Government. For example, we have not proceeded with the housing benefit single room rent for people under 60.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> What about people under 25?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Member for West Chelmsford, from a sedentary position, asks about the under-25's. He refers to a policy introduced by the previous Government. We have given a commitment to evaluate the impact of that change. Research is under way in that regard and, as I have said on the Floor of the House, we shall give our views on it when it is complete.
<P>
I hope that our proposals for regulations providing for a wide range of significant exceptions will allay some of the unease expressed by the Committee. Our proposed arrangements also provide the basis, as part of our review of social security, for our medium and long-term aim of steamlining exising arrangements for claiming benefits.
<P>
In that context, I consider that a one-month time limit for backdating benefit claims, coupled with a prescribed list of exceptions, will be simpler for people to understand, when compared with the plethora of rules that existed in the past. It will also underline customers' responsibility to make claims on time, and is consistent with the expectations of the public.
<P>
Taking into account the principles underlining this proposal, as well as the exceptions that we intend to adopt, I ask the hon. Member to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Is the Minister giving way so that one final point can be cleared up before he sits down?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I have finished my explanation and sat down. As I said earlier, I shall be glad to respond to any points arising from debate. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you, Minister, I was about to make exactly that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight (Arundel and South Downs):</B> I thank the Minister for his description of the detail of the proposal's implementation. Will he confirm that the clause will mean that many cases will not be backdated by even one month? Will not the exceptions be granted in cases where one months's backdating, rather than any longer period, will be permitted? I do not think that he described a case involving backdating of more than one month. The proposals are structurally in line with the amendments, in that more time will be allowed for special cases than for more straightforward ones. However, is not the difference that the Minister is talking about backdating of zero and one month, whereas we are talking about one month and three months? Will he confirm that my understanding is correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Secondly, I am especially worried that the creation of many different circumstances will confuse customers, and will cause the unnecessary argument that the Bill is designed to obviate. People are not likely to be able to assimilate and understand in what circumstances the one-month backdating applies. The amendment offers a simpler approach that would be easier to administer.
<P>
Thirdly, my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) raised the question of computer administration. My understanding is that the one-month backdating applies one month from the date of claim. I am slightly confused as to which dates would pertain if the current mess in the Child Support Agency occurred on a wider scale in the Department of Social Security because information was being mishandled by the computer administration.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I shall try to limit debate on computers in this clause. If a computer goes down, that is clearly an administrative problem, which I have already said would be an exception to the general rule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Fourthly, I am particularly concerned at the lumping together of contributory and non-contributory benefits. I understood the Minister to say that that approach was being taken to avoid confusion, yet there will be confusion because people may receive some benefits which, under the various listed exceptions, are entitled to one month's backdating and others that are not. That already creates a non-symmetry.
<P>
I believe that there remains among the public a feeling that national insurance is an insurance under which one's benefit is just like any other insurance benefit. I submit that the Minister for Welfare Reform, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), would feel that the Government are going in the wrong direction. Maybe they are awaiting a more thorough reform of social security law, but it is too glib for Governments of any persuasion simply to sit back and treat the two sorts of benefits in the same way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The principal contributory benefit to which the hon. Gentleman refers is retirement penison. A person is notified four months in advance of retirement age of his or her entitlement. There is overwhelming evidence that people claim their retirement pensions on the date of their retirement, so backdating is not an issue in that case.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am glad to hear that that is the case, but this is an issue of principle. I believe that the present rule on backdating for contributory pensions is six months, not three months. I am not certain whether that applies in all circumstances, but I suggest that it is a major departure of principle, even if in practice, as the Minister suggested, the impact is not great.
<P>
To conclude, I am happy to hear that the principles advocated by Conservative Members have, by and large, guided the Minister's interpretation. I remain of the view, however, that worthy though the cost-saving is, the measure will cause many problems in practice. Our amendments, which propose the relatively straightforward principle of three months' backdating where there is genuine hardship and contribution and one month's backdating for income would mean an easier framework in which to operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, to this morning's sitting.
<P>
First, I repeat what I said before: it was helpful for the Minister to intervene early and, I hope, save us all some time by setting out the exclusions. Perhaps he will bear with me and my colleagues if we did not manage to take it all on board at one go and feel free to intervene--on me, at any rate--if I have misunderstood or misheard something.
<P>
Broadly speaking, Opposition Members welcome the exclusions. They should assist many people who are mentioned in the briefings of, for example, Age Concern and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, which we have all received. There is, however, always the problem that when we draw lines between people, we include as well as exclude. It is important to be clear, either today or at a later stage of the Bill's progress, where those lines are to be drawn. I am sure that the Minister would concede that there is a fair bit of work still to be done on defining the lines.
<P>
Age Concern says that backdating is being reduced in many instances, it would be helpul at the same time to be taking some measures to increase take-up. Age Concern speaks from the point of view of old people, but it is a fair point across the board, for all age ranges.
<P>
I should like to press the Minister further on the saving that will be made. There is still some puzzlement among Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members about the figure of &#163;57 million or &#163;58 million. We told that 50,000 housing benefit claimants and 115,000 council tax benefit claimants lose out each year and that there would be an estimated further saving of some &#163;57 million.
<P>
The Minister now seems to be saying that the figure of &#163;57 million or &#163;58 million--let us not quibble about the odd &#163;1 million in the context of the social security budget--is still correct and already took full account of the long list of complex exclusions about which we have just heard. Is that really the case? At what point did the figure of &#163;57 million or &#163;58 million crystallise in his Department's thinking? Is it really the case that the exclusions will not make a difference of a penny more or a penny less to the predicted figure--as far as it can be predicted, of course, in the real world?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman's final point is absolutely right. The scoring of savings is done with a broad brush--one cannot be precise but one estimates a figure.
<P>
I have made it clear throughout our discussions and on Second Reading that we would make exceptions to the rule--that was always part of our thinking, which is why the estimated savings took exceptions into account. I said on Second Reading that we would be considering further the matter of hardship provision through to and in Committee. We were therefore clear that the estimated savings took account of the fact that exceptions would be made and today I have given details of those exceptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful for that response, but I am not sure that it wholly answers my question. If the Minister is indeed saying--and said on Second Reading--that exclusions were envisaged, surely for the figure still to be valid he had to have in mind precisely these exclusions--no more, no less. I hope that I am not making a false point, but surely there has to be a shift in the estimated savings figure. It may not be a big shift in the great scheme of things, but it cannot still be exactly the same figure. Would the Minister like to tie off that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> This leads me to another general point, which was raised by Age Concern and in a useful briefing from Kent county council, which is Conservative-controlled again--as they will all be in due course.
<P>
This provision is the Government's idea. They cannot try to hide behind the claim that it is all down to the wicked Tories and nothing to do with them. The clause is a home-grown idea from the Labour Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> It has fairly clear parentage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The hon. Gentleman remarks on the parentage of the clause, but I am sure that we can agree that the clause is not part of the Peter Lilley memorial Bill, as we have come to know it. In view of the rough passage that Ministers apparently had yesterday from their parliamentary colleagues, perhaps one can see the reasoning behind the exclusions, as Ministers were forced into making a series of concessions. We are particularly appreciative of them.
<P>
The sole reason for clause 70 in its original form was to meet the costs of the Government's decision to revoke the single room rent restriction on single housing benefit claimants under 25, about which we have heard much over the past few months--and in the past year or two.
<P>
It was interesting that the Minister had absolutely nothing to say about the future for 25 to 59-year-olds--I am paraphrasing--except that it has gone into the great black hole at the centre of the Government, the review process. He will have seen research by someone called Steve Griffiths suggesting that the Government's plans are based on there being 155 more rent allowance claimants than there are. I shall not go into more detail. However, a recent report by the national federation of landlords estimates that housing benefit expenditure could be as much as &#163;500 million less in a year than has been anticipated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> On a point of clarification, did the hon. Gentleman, and does he still, support the previous Government's proposal to extend the single room rent restriction for people between 25 and 60?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am not wholly convinced that that was right. I totally supported the restriction on under-25s. It was absurd that under-25s not in work--this was true in my constituency--were often in better accommodation than those in work. But that does not solve the Minister's problem. He is the Government, for current purposes; he represents their approach and how they will deal with the fact that the estimates that form the basis of the clause have shifted.
<P>
There are two moving targets: the figure of &#163;57 million or &#163;58 million, which clearly cannot still be right--it must go up or down, presumably down, as a result of the detailed specific exclusions--and the money needed for housing benefit, which again seems to be on shifting sand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It may induce the Minister to give the reply that we are all looking for if we add that it is not evident that savings will go down as a result of the exceptions. Some may tighten matters; it is not clear from his remarks just how much tighter things would be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point, one on which I have not focused. But, in fairness, we have only just heard of those exclusions. We and others will have to focus on their precise effect.
<P>
For example, I should like to hear from Age Concern whether all or most of its anxieties have been addressed. It will be interesting to read the small print of the Minister's speech to determine who will and will not be better off and whether, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset spotted, the figure of &#163;57 million or &#163;58 million will go up. It would also be interesting to know whether and how the extra saving will be spent within the Department or whether it will be raided by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for another Department.
<P>
It is fair to say that, on the face of it, many of the worries of organisations such as Age Concern have been addressed by the exclusions. We welcome them, as far as they go and hope that we have had a major hand in pushing the Minister in that direction. Like you, Mr. O'Hara, I have the honour of being a co-chairman of the all-party group for older people. We have heard about Age Concern's worries about the clause. From one of its briefs it appears, at least in some respects, that the Minister has tackled its anxieties. However, may I tax him further with some specific points?
<P>
I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) said--in fairness, the Minister happily took this on board--on misleading information from local authorities, the DSS or whoever. In constituency mail and at advice surgeries people claim that they have been given misleading information--that is a sad fact--but sometimes there is what we lawyers call a conflict of evidence. All too often, officials try to stonewall. I understand that the Minister might not be in a position to respond to that point, but I would be interested to know precisely how such conflict will be tackled. The Minister mentioned appeals; I wonder whether there might be ways of dealing with that conflict at administrative level without the necessity for a formal appeal.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Penultimately, I want to refer to a point made by the National Council for One Parent Families. The third group of exclusions described by the Minister included people who have recently separated. The national council's briefing says that at least one study shows that there is often a considerable gap between a couple parting and any application for benefit, and that in some cases, that can lead to benefit losses of more than &#163;1,000. How, therefore, does the Minister expect the word ``recently'' to be interpreted in such cases?
<P>
Finally, the Occupational and Environmental Diseases Association has made a point relating to cases of asbestos-related diseases, particularly mesothelioma, which is untreatable asbestos-related cancer. As we all know--I am familiar with at least one case, and very sad it is--months, if not years, can pass between someone contracting the disease and being diagnosed as having it, and subsequently claiming benefits. The association says that the period for which sufferers are entitled to benefits should start from when they first display symptoms.
<P>
Another exclusion relates to people who are ill or disabled. Presumably the Minister intends that to cover people who have a pre-existing condition that may go back some time and of which they were for a long time unaware. There should be no difficulty there, but the OEDA has expressed concern on that point to which I should like the Minister to respond.
<P>
I broadly welcome the exclusions. They are overdue. There are matters of definition to be considered, but the last thing I want to do is be churlish towards the Minister. I thank him for so clearly setting out the exclusions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> As we have tabled our own amendment to clause 70 which we will come to in a moment, I will restrict my remarks to amendment No. 297 and the Minister's response to it. My only misgiving about the amendment is that it does not go far enough--we regard it as being only one third of the loaf.
<P>
There have been bizarre events this morning. Normally I would be falling over in gratitude if a Minister admitted that some of the criticisms of a Bill were valid and then made concessions. The Minister's remarks this morning mean that certain needy people will receive money that they would otherwise not have, and that must be welcomed. However, this provision is a dog's breakfast. We have been sitting here for three or four weeks being told that the Bill's aims are streamlining, simplification and standardisation, but now we have been informed of three major categories of exemption, each with half a dozen subsections. Although I followed the Minister's remarks as carefully as I could, and I think that I know something of the benefits system, I did not entirely understand what he said.
<P>
We have also been told that in July, when the Bill was printed, including as it did the figure of &#163;57 million, the Government knew that four months hence the net effect of the changes would leave that figure unchanged. The Minister has not told us what the gross effect of the changes will be. If the concessions that he has listed this morning were not implemented, what would be the gross saving from the measure? In other words, what is the price of the concessions? We have not yet had an answer to those questions.
<P>
The Minister's announcement means that a very draconian measure will become fairly draconian. The Minister's long list of exemptions--bad weather and bus strikes and so on--makes us feel that for once we are on the side of the angels because we are in favour of a broad, good cause exemption, rather than that long, tedious list. We may disagree with Conservative Members about how long the list should be, but we want a simple provision, and the Minister has described provisions that will be bewildering to claimants. Two claimants might apply for different benefits and one of them might get the bus and the other might not or it might be snowing. The provisions are a complete shambles.
<P>
I almost want to raise my next point as a point of order. Is it appropriate for the Minister to come to us with a whole raft of provisions that we have no time to take in when we have already started debate on the clause? We will have to vote on them before we have had time to think about them. The Minister ought to guarantee us a debate on the Report about those provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I entirely endorse the hon. Gentleman's comments about that, but is it really the case that he and his colleague had no inkling of the Government's tremendous shift, given the close relations that his party enjoys with the Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> As the hon. Gentleman may be aware, I am not a member of the Cabinet Committee, although I am working on that. I can, therefore, confirm that I was wholly unaware of the concessions.
<P>
The amendment advocates a much simpler approach than the Minister's, and it is important that he gives us some flavour of what the cost of the concessions will be--it is clearly not nil. Is the Minister telling us that he just happened to know that &#163;57 million or &#163;58 million was always going to be the net cost? He could not have received representations from interested organisations in July because the Government had not even published the Bill then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I stress the point that clause 70 could be interpreted to mean that one month was the norm. From what the Minister has told us, I understand that the norm will be no backdating and that there will be one month for the exceptions. I am unclear about what was originally intended, but the savings could well be greater.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I have to say that I share the hon. Gentleman's confusion on this occasion. I have accepted the conventional wisdom that the Bill took backdating from three months to one month. Perhaps that is a reflection of my slack reading of the clause and understanding of the system, but I had not understood that zero was the norm for categories of benefit, unless it was snowing, in which case claims would be backdated for one month.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> May I just advise the Committee that nil backdating on income-related benefits has always been the case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that, but I am still not clear about whether we are talking about nil backdating for people with good cause for claiming late. We are obviously mainly concerned about such people and not about just anyone. I am fairly clear that nil backdating was not the case for people with good cause.
<P>
As I said, I and my hon. Friend will set out our general approach to backdating in our amendment. We welcome the concessions, but the timing and the answers that we have had on costs are wholly unacceptable. The Minister has, on the whole, attempted to respond point by point to the issues that have been raised. [Interruption.] He has certainly responded to the points that we have made and has written to us on occasion and tried to deal with our concerns. It is regrettable that he has let us down badly on this occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore (Hendon):</B> May I raise with the Minister one or two problems to do with industrial injuries benefit? In particular, I want to refer to industrial disablement benefit and industrial diseases, following the point made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. He mentioned the problems of lung diseases such as asbestosis and mesothelioma, and similar problems occur in connection with other industrial cancers, which can take years to develop and some time to diagnose. It should be relatively easy in such cases to show good cause for delay in making a claim. There are, however, other diseases and illness, which develop very quickly. The claimant may, however, not realise the causal connection between the illness and his working conditions and it may be arguable whether good cause should apply.
<P>
To give an example, I dealt last year with the case of a dental nurse who developed respiratory and nasal problems from exposure to gluteraldehyde. It took her a little while to realise that the illness, which had developed very quickly, was attributable to her working conditions. It also took some time for a diagnosis to be made.
<P>
Another example of such illnesses is dermatitis, which is caused by industrial processes, cutting oils and so forth. It can develop very quickly and it is often a week or two before the claimant realises that there is a causal connection. Again, the diagnostic testing--such as patch testing, and so on--could take several more weeks.
<P>
Another good example is repetitive strain injury, which can take several months to develop and some time to diagnose. Indeed, it has been argued that it is not a genuine industrial disease. The risk is that failure to take account of some of those problems will cause unjustifiably early claims based on people's suspicions rather than on a clear medical diagnosis. That would defeat the object and clog up the system.
<P>
I look forward to my hon. Friend the Minister's thoughts about those problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not wish to repeat the arguments that have been aired so ably by the hon. Member for Northavon, but I am interested in a matter touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight).
<P>
The element of the amendment that deals with contributory benefits is the one that gives Conservative Members most cause to pause. It is common ground in the Committee--at last--that there is much to be said for making such benefits genuinely contributory. Speculation about whether the Government's proposals will achieve that is well outside the ambit of this debate, but there is consensus that the aim should be to move towards a genuine distinction between contributory and other benefits.
<P>
The analogy between contributory benefit and the ordinary practice of commercial insurance is becoming increasingly strong. A claim for a contributory benefit increasingly should resemble, therefore, a claim made to a commercial insurer or pension provider. So the theoretically correct time limits to be set in respect of contributary benefits should be very long and should parallel the limits set by law for claims against commercial insurers and pension funds. Those limits are much longer even than what is proposed in the Liberal Democrats' amendment No. 282.
<P>
The proposal in amendment No. 297 of a three-month time limit is perhaps unduly modest, but Conservative Members wanted to be extraordinarily accommodating. Our compromise was to recognise the Government's desire to make savings, even though that aim ran counter to a trend of Government policy. Our proposal does not approximate to the theoretically correct limit, but at least it would ensure that claimants for contributory benefits would have sufficient time to get--and therefore a reasonable prospect of getting--the help to which, in an absolute sense, they would have a right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I correct an earlier statement of mine? At present, the six-year rule covers contractual claims against the Government and not contributory benefits. However, given the move to the principle of full insurance, the six-year term available for a contractual claim looks appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend is right. A genuinely contributory and funded benefit is in practice a matter of contract. It is a contractable right, or at any rate a right enforceable in tort. It is a general legal and commercial right, and should therefore be associated with a long time scale. The amendment is peculiarly accommodating in suggesting a period of only three months.
<P>
The second class of item which we propose should be subject to the three-month rule is hardship. The Minister has admitted the principle that there need to be exceptions for cases of hardship. I must admit that I may have done even less well than the hon. Member for Northavon and those of my hon. Friends who have spoken in tracking what the Minister was proposing. But I had the distinct sense that there was no case in which he was extending the amount of time available. I sought to intervene just at that point in the Minister's speech, but was told to wait until he had finished his oration, and am therefore genuinely confused. However, I do not believe that there was a single case in which he extended the time scale available to claimants.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I had the distinct impression, therefore, that the current position may be tightened up by the proposals. Therefore, the list of exceptions by no means has the same flavour as it appeared to have when we first heard it. The Minister may wish to clarify that in his winding-up speech. Let us suppose, however, that the list did have the flavour that it seemed to have. The Government are clearly making exceptions, because the Minister did not mention contributory benefits as a source of those exceptions. He must be making exceptions in cases of hardship or when hardship could be caused were there not an exception.
<P>
If the Minister is admitting that principle, there is a strong argument for having a clear, broad-brush approach to cases of hardship, which is what the amendment suggests. Non-contributory benefits all relate to cases associated with hardship and our proposal is to allow a quite modest three-month limit.
<P>
The Minister argued repeatedly, in many contexts, that it was not necessary to have such a time scale because in practice there was no problem. For example, he said that when someone who has just been widowed goes to the relevant office, the procedure is relatively well organised under the current system. Even under those dreadful circumstances, people tend to get good and rapid information about their rights and how to exercise them. We all accept that. The hon. Gentleman mentioned numerous other cases in which he thought either that a good system was in place or he would be taking steps to improve the existing system. We welcome that. But if he is right, and not many cases go wrong, his argument unfortunately works against his position. If very few people are widowed and are not immediately able to claim, the extension to three months--after all, we are not talking about three years, 30 years or 50 years, or about incredibly elaborate claims--to handle what are by the Minister's own admission just a very few cases that, for one reason or another, have slipped through the net, would not cause a major dislocation of the system.
<P>
I could not detect any exceptions relating specifically to widows, although I may have missed them in the rapid list of complex cases that we heard. I believe that the Minister said rather that he would seek to tighten up further the procedures for alerting widows to their rights. If there is no exception in that case, and the Minister is right that there are very few people for whom such a problem arises, unless our proposed extension to three months is accepted, a few widows who, in circumstances that are not easily envisaged but may arise, cannot claim within a short period because of the great confusion and trauma they are suffering, will be consciously excluded by the Bill.
<P>
I cannot believe that that is really the intention of Her Majesty's Government. It would be interesting to hear about the costs of the benefit to the Exchequer, but I cannot believe that it is anything like in proportion to the amount of personal hardship in such cases. It seems an utterly disproportionate measure.
<P>
In respect of both the contributory and hardship benefits, the Opposition have, if anything, erred by being peculiarly attentive to the need to compromise with the requirement for administrative efficiency--an aim to which we all subscribe--by suggesting a limit of three months. The Government have given the Committee a list of exceptions, a manner of proceeding to which various hon. Members have alluded. I share their doubts about the matter. It would have been far better if the Government had agreed to the amendment, notwithstanding its origins. The Opposition should, perhaps, have offered the amendment to the Government, so that it would have been less embarrassing for them to agree to it. Accepting the amendment would have stood them in good stead. More importantly, it would have been more coherent for them to do so, in terms of their policy on contributions. They would have been more attentive to the needs involved in, according to the Minister's definition, a very small number of cases of real hardship.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I shall try to cover some of the points that have been raised. I assure hon. Members that if I do not cover all of them, I shall write to them about specific points.
<P>
I stress again that the Government have always intended to bring forward exceptions. We have made that clear throughout the Bill's passage, and that is why it was taken into account for the purposes of the savings. If it would be helpful, I shall write to hon. Members about that in more detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> We are grateful for the Minister's assurance that he will write to us. The hon. Gentleman said that the Government always made it clear that they would make concessions. Will he cite evidence? The Minister's comments on Second Reading, recorded in Hansard of 22 July, volume 298, column 851, did not suggest in black and white that the Government would make concessions. The hon. Gentleman told the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) that the Committee should have an opportunity to debate in detail the provisions of clause 72(2)(b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made my point exactly. I said on Second Reading that clause 70(2)(b) contained hardship provisions. We recognised that, and I said that we should ``explore that further in Committee in due course''.--(Official Report, 22.07.97; Vol. 298, c. 851.]. That is what the Committee is doing now. I also said that we should consider all of the ways in which the clause will operate in practice. I have been clear about our intention--Hansard makes that clear. The Committee does not need to pursue that point.
<P>
Under current rules, contributory benefits are treated differently from income-related benefits. In the rules introduced in April 1997, contributory benefits had three months automatic backdating, and income-related benefits had up to three months, subject to special reasons. That distinction has always existed, and the Government are not changing it.
<P>
Several hon. Members made a point about mesothelioma. From April, industrial injuries disablement benefit has been available when the disease was caused by exposure to asbestos in the work place. Exceptionally, the usual 90-day waiting period has been waived, so that benefit reaches sufferers as soon as possible after the disease has been diagnosed and claimed. The matter of diagnosis is important. The change from three months to one month does not affect this category of people, for whom it may have been many years since the disease was caused. I assure hon. Members that I am sensitive to this point. Further discussions about it are ongoing, and I shall keep the House informed of them.
<P>
My attempt to help the Committee this morning has been thrown back at me rather ungraciously. I accept that--it is my job. I have tried to outline exactly how the Government will deal with exceptions, as I said on Second Reading that I would. I have communicated my determination to ensure that people know their rights, which is related to the point about take-up, and to which I commit myself absolutely. The system should allow them to claim the benefit to which they are entitled at the earliest opportunity, so that backdating does not become the norm.
<P>
No one wants a social security system that relies on people backdating because they are not claiming at the point where they need the benefit--that is what entitlement is about. We want a system that is efficiently handled by my Department. I am looking across the agencies for which I am responsible to ensure that we have the most efficient system possible so that people claim, take up and receive their benefit at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
On the point about widows' benefit, to bring in an exception beyond one month for a particular area would complicate the system. Currently, there is no problem. We should not create exceptions which will then create a problem. I am determined that, through the opportunity for information sharing provided by the Bill, the organisation of agencies will be such that when information is given the correct procedures will be triggered, ensuring that entitlement flows. That is the best way to proceed so that people do not have to rely on backdating to receive their entitlement.
<P>
With those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister is unduly sensitive this morning. I put it on record that the Opposition are genuinely grateful to him for intervening early in the debate to set the tone. We found his speech interesting and helpful. I should hate him to think that we were responding churlishly--he was clearly seeking to assist the Committee.
<P>
The Minister must have got up in a particularly good mood today, unlike the day we debated lone parents, when he refused to answer questions. Not only has he been helpful, he has sent us a helpful letter in which he accepts our arguments on gratuities. In response to our pressure in Committee, he will table amendments on the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> In the spirit of co-operation, I accept that the Opposition have forced me to make a concession--the removal of the word ``gratuity''--and am prepared to allow them to take the credit for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> We are especially grateful that the Minister has humbled himself as a true servant of the people before the Committee. As he must have learnt over our 18 years in government, Oppositions are always grateful for any crumbs that fall off the ministerial table.
<P>
As we said on Second Reading and during the debate on the clause, we are extremely concerned about its seemingly draconian nature, which is why we tabled the amendment and others which will be dealt with later. Furthermore, several organisations which deal with the benefits system on behalf of their clients and interested parties have expressed grave concern about the time restriction on backdating benefits. We are grateful that the Government have, uncharacteristically, listened to our argument--and, to be fair, to the arguments of other hon. Members--and are prepared to accept the logic and the force behind our amendment.
<P>
As my hon. Friends have said, our approach is administratively more efficient, but we understand that the Minister will not go beyond the system that he wants to implement--the making of specified exceptions. I will not push my luck, because we are grateful that the Government have accepted the force of our argument.
<P>
I will, however, enter one caveat--the Minister's speech was detailed and dealt with a complicated subject, so we will want to reserve our position until we have read in detail the report of this sitting and understood the small print in the Minister's comments. I give notice now that we may return to the issue on Report.
<P>
I shall briefly return to the question of savings. We all heard and accept what the Minister said, but the sequence of events means that we have difficulty in reconciling those remarks with what has now developed. The Bill's explanatory and financial memorandum clearly specified that the cost implications of clause 70 were &#163;57 million.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon and my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne raised that matter with the Minister and he gave the impression that he had always understood that concessions would be made and that the costing was based on those concessions. What puzzles me is that if the Minister planned to consider concessions, how could a costing be produced without the knowledge of what the concessions would be? I do not want to dwell on the figure, but now that the Minister has decided on the concessions, has he made any assessment of the cost implications specific to them? If the Minister cannot answer that question now, he could perhaps write to us.
<P>
As the Government have accepted our arguments in principle--although they have taken a slightly different tack and we may want to revisit the matter at a later stage--I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 282, in page 44, line 39, leave out `one month' and insert `12 months'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 285, in page 44, line 39, leave out `one month' and insert `three months'.
<P>
No. 286, in page 45, line 4, leave out `one month has' and insert `three months have'.
<P>
No. 287, in page 45, line 7, leave out `one month' and insert `three months'.
<P>
No. 288, in page 45, leave out lines 1 to 7.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> In all the technicalities in the Minister's lists of exemptions there is a danger that we will lose sight of the big picture of the clause. Just as the hon. Member for Eastbourne has become fond of quoting the National Council for One Parent Families, with which he obviously has much sympathy, I shall quote the Law Society, with which I have a great deal of sympathy. It puts the point as well as anyone when it says that the whole issue of restricting backdating rests on the view--for which it says it can find no evidence--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that claimants delay making their claim on the assumption that the delay is of no consequence since benefits can be backdated.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Law Society goes on to say that its experience is that when claimants are made aware of their entitlement and are given the correct support, they make their claim without delay because they urgently need the benefit.
<P>
The philiosophy behind a clause that restricts claimants' entitlement to backdating of late benefit claims is fundamentally flawed. It rests on the assumption that people voluntarily delay making their claim, when presumably most people who want cash do what they can to get it as soon as they can. A clause that penalises such people cannot be justified.
<P>
It is possible that the Minister's list of concessions is actually nothing of the sort and that the list is broadly what is contained in current regulations as cases of good cause. I should like clarification from the Minister about the status of that list of exemptions. First, are those exemptions exhaustive, or will there be others? Are they precisely those currently covered by good cause, or are there others currently covered by good cause which will no longer apply? Are they illustrative? Will they be set out in regulations? Their status is unclear. Unless that is clarified, it is hard to assess whether the clause makes sense.
<P>
Amendment No. 282 is naturally paired with amendment No. 288, in that they both allow a 12-month backdating period. Amendments Nos. 285, 286 and 287, to which we are pleased that Conservative Members have added their names, would reduce that period to a general three months, compared with the one month provided for in the Bill.
<P>
We agree that the last thing that we want is a system in which people claim benefits late and then have to rely on backdating provisions. However, that is irrelevant. If the Minister is right and a new, swish and streamlined social security system will allow everyone to get their money quickly, the clause will not be necessary--people will get the money when they need it and benefits will not have to be backdated by three, six or 12 months. That will be true especially if the Minister is sincere about take-up--which I doubt.
<P>
In practice, people in exceptional circumstances will have good cause to backdate claims. The system will never be perfect, so provision will have to be made for those cases. Imposing restrictions will be in no one's interest and will be useful only as a means of saving money to pay for another benefit reform. We welcome the abolition of the single room rent measures for people over 25, but it is sad that that has to be paid for by victimising people who do not understand the benefits system.
<P>
There is plenty of money in the Government's coffers. More than &#163;5 billion of public sector debt was repaid this month. Just a fraction of 1 per cent. of that would have covered those vulnerable people, but the Government prefer to take money off them.
<P>
How much money are we talking about? I wonder whether the Parliamentary answers that I have received to that question had been overtaken by the Minister's list of concessions, but he said that those answers took account of the concessions. The three-months restrictions already applied as a result of Conservative measures have therefore cost pensioners &#163;36 million so far this year, rising to &#163;63 million in a full year. Long-term sick and disabled people eventually will lose &#163;50 million a year as a result of measures that have been introduced already. On top of that, the proposed restriction to one month will take another &#163;14 million off pensioners and another &#163;18 million off the sick and disabled.
<P>
Why should pensioners and the sick and disabled have to pay for an otherwise desirable benefits change? They do not understand the benefits system. Are there not better sources for the money?
<P>
How many people are involved? The restriction of three months has hit 40,000 pensioners already, and 100,000 people claiming council tax benefit. The further restriction to one month will cause hardship for 100,000 income support claimants. The benefit is the fundamental safety net. Those claimants now will have to do without that money. They probably got by without it in the first place by running up debts, getting into rent arrears and so on. Now the Government will not give those people the money, even if they are entitled to it. How can that be justified morally?
<P>
The paradox is that the Government talk about helping people to get the benefits to which they are entitled and at the same time penalise people who claim late. That just does not stack up. 
<P>
We have heard the evidence from citizens advice bureaux, which shows that the people affected by the measure are not scroungers or the undeserving. The example was given of a bureau's client in Dorset. In her late 50's and widowed five months previously, she was in frail health and living in a rural area. Her housing benefit was stopped and she ran up rent arrears after she failed to reapply. The landlord's estate manager advised her to claim benefit. At present, she has 12 months with good cause in which to make a claim. According to the bureau, clause 70 would leave her with substantial rent arrears and in danger of losing her home.
<P>
These cases are not marginal or trivial. They involve needy, elderly and disabled people who are having to pay for the Goverment's approach to public spending.
<P>
Then there is the question of the role of the Social Security Advisory Committee. That independent committee examined the cut to three months, which the amendment opposes, and said that it was wrong. Yet the Government want to go further. Even the previous Conservative Government did not dare to make that cut, a fact that should worry the Government. 
<P>
The Government have ignored the SSAC's opinion about one-parent benefit and about backdating. If they are not going to listen to that committee, why do they not just abolish it and save a few hundred thousand pounds? What is the point of the SSAC if, on two key issues, its advice is ignored?
<P>
The provision to restrict backdating will have perverse consequences, as the Minister is aware. It will encourage multiple benefit claims. The Minister said that there will be exemptions on backdating for people for whom one benefit is contingent on another, and I hope that that will fully cover the situation. What is not clear from the list of exemptions is whether one's exemption is from nought to one month. In other words, once one is exempted from the harshness of the regime, how much more lax does it become? Is one allowed three months, six months, 12 months or an indefinite period? If one has good cause for breaking through the strict barrier, where is the next barrier?
<P>
Ultimately, the measures will penalise vulnerable people. I was contacted this week by the mother of a 21-year-old constituent who has Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer. The lady rang me up in distress because her daughter's benefits had been taken from her. She said that she had told social services--by which she meant social security--and added that her daughter had been getting incapacity benefit--by which she meant income support. That lady did not have a clue about the benefits system. When, on further investigation, I phoned the Benefits Agency, it became apparent that although the daughter had been turned down for incapacity benefit because of her poor contribution record, she would probably have been entitled to severe disablement allowance 12 months ago.
<P>
The system has clearly got it wrong in that case. How far could the claim of someone in a similar situation be backdated under the proposals? It is not clear from the list of exemptions whether a claim could be taken back one month or three months--or 12 months, as in our amendment. We are talking about vulnerable people. They are not wicked or evil people who are trying to mess up the system--they just do not understand it. They are elderly, disabled, or sick and the Government are penalising them.
<P>
The Minister has shown good faith on many issues and has sought to make concessions when representations have been made. We are not saying that everyone should be able to claim 12 months late and that we want lots of late claims. We, like the Minister, want claims to be prompt, but a safeguard of at least three months and preferably 12 is needed, just to catch extreme cases like that of my constituent. On her behalf and on behalf of pensioners and disabled people across the country who do not understand the benefits system, I ask the Minister not to penalise them for that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I should like to address amendments Nos. 285, 286 and 287. We do not support amendments Nos. 282 and 288, which were tabled by Liberal Democrat Members, because we feel that they would provide for too lax a regime, but we support the other three amendments because in them, the views of Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members coincide.
<P>
In some ways, the debate is a rerun of our previous discussion. The amendments are designed to further the view that a blanket time limit of three months--rather than a complicated system requiring a list of exceptional circumstances--would be a cleaner, more effective and more efficient way in which to proceed in this difficult matter.
<P>
As I said, we have grave concerns about the potentially draconian effect of clause 70 on some vulnerable and exposed members of society. As the Hansard written answers referred to in the previous speech illustrated and as the briefings which have been sent to all hon. Members explain in convincing detail, many pensioners and people who are ill are, for a variety of reasons, confused and worried and do not understand the letters and forms that they get. It would be far better, fairer and more equitable if a longer time limit than one month were allowed for backdating, excluding the exceptions in the Bill, which the Minister has outlined.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be prepared to think again. He should study the written questions that he answered on this subject and fully consider the implications for a relatively large number of people who are among the most disadvantaged because they are elderly or not in a position fully to understand what is required of them within a relatively tight time scale. In the light of the comments that have been made and notwithstanding what the Minister has already agreed to do, will he reconsider the matter to discover whether he can go some way towards meeting our concerns either in specific amendments or by thinking of another approach that would give such people extra protection?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon has already given an excellent explanation of why the amendments should be accepted. I do not want to go over all the ground that he has covered or to give further examples--which we could all do--of the sort of person who will be affected by the clause if it remains as it is. Only yesterday, I received a letter from someone who will be much affected by the clause, and we are all receiving such letters all the time. There is no need for me to give further explanations and examples.
<P>
I do, however, want to support my hon. Friend's arguments in two ways. First, the Minister will remember that my hon. Friend asked whether the exceptions about which we have heard today covered all the good causes for backdating that are currently accepted. In a sense, I can perhaps answer my hon. Friend's question. If savings are to be made as a result of the clause--we have been told again today that there will be savings of &#163;57 million or &#163;58 million--they must come from people who previously had good cause for their claims to be backdated beyond the limits that are being given now.
<P>
That is the nub of the argument. The fact that money may no longer be given to people who had good cause to claim it shows how immoral the clause is. The definition of what we as human beings mean by good cause surely dictates that, if there is good cause for a back claim, it ought to be allowed. I do not understand how the Minister can argue that only certain good causes can be allowed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman describe how and where good cause is used in income-related and contributory benefits?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> What I am saying is that, as I understand it, all the changes that are being made refer to areas that are otherwise subject to the understanding of good cause that is held by the social security commissioners. My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon has just told me that good cause is explicitly mentioned in appendix 2 of the explanatory notes--I do not know whether that answers the Minister's question. I hope that that explains the moral point that I am trying to make.
<P>
My other point is that the provisions are being explained as simply a question of money. The Minister has made it quite explicit that this is his way of saving the money that would otherwise have been needed because of the changes that have been made with regard to single room rents for those over 25. The figure that we have been given is &#163;57 million. That is rather less than one thirtieth of the amount by which the public sector borrowing requirement is expected to have reduced this year between July--when the figure was given and the decision was made to include the clause in the Bill--and now. It is just one thirtieth of the change in the PSBR. The Minister is saying that his budget cannot afford to allow the clause to be removed from the Bill.
<P>
I do not understand how any Government can say that because they have to keep within their budget, they cannot afford this minute change in the Minister's budget, even though there is a massive change in the PSBR anyway, which the Chancellor is expected to announce in a few days. The change would be as a result of totally different factors that are outside anything to do with social security. As we all know, the social security budget in total is a large part--much more than one thirtieth--of Government expenditure. Yet we are simply asking for one thirtieth of the change in the PSBR to give the Minister the chance to remove the clause, as he could do if he accepted the amendment.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon made the case very clearly a moment ago. I hope that the Minister will respond in a way that I feel that many of his colleagues on the Labour benches, as well as Opposition Members, would like him to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> We recognise that there are hard cases and that hard choices have to be made. The problem with the Liberal Democrats is that amendment after amendment after amendment of theirs would cost money. They always refer to each one in isolation, saying that we could just afford this one at 11 o'clock on a Thursday morning, and this one at 12 o'clock and then another one later. But they take no account of the overall situation. It is because the Liberal Democrats will always be in opposition that they do not have to make real, hard choices.
<P>
Let me make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that there is no general good cause provision in the current rules on backdating. There is a general discretion within housing and council tax benefits for local authorities to have good causes, and we are changing that to bring in the prescribed list that I have identified this morning.
<P>
The exceptions made in my speech to the general rules are not exhaustive, but they are comprehensive. I am listening very carefully to the points made by hon. Members and the cases that they bring to my attention. If hon. Members wish to write to me on particular matters, further consideration can always be given, because the list is prescriptive, but not exhaustive. I hope that that is helpful to the hon. Gentleman. However, we do not intend to have a catch-all provision for good causes in the way suggested by the hon. Member for Northavon, not only because we do not believe it to be right, but because it is not in the current system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> This is an issue of uncertainty on my part. Appendix 2 of the Library's briefing lists the different benefits, the maximum backdating claims and administrative errors for normal and good cause claims. Against income support, family credit, disability working allowance and jobseeker's allowance it gives three months under the good cause heading. Is that consistent with what the Minister has just said?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I cannot answer for the House of Commons Library, but I will look at this to see whether it is clear from the way in which the tables that the hon. Gentleman has identified were laid out whether there is any contradiction between what I am saying and the way that the figures are given in the document. I will write to the hon. Gentleman and be absolutely clear. It is not my intention to mislead the Committee, but I hope that he accepts that I need to look at the document and then come back. I believe that my explanation is correct, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that I will look at it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I would like to follow up further the point about good cause. What if some case came to light in future and any normal human being--including, perhaps, one of the commissioners--considered that there was good cause for backdating, but the person was not covered by any of the exceptions? Is the Minister saying that that person would not receive any backdating because the Government would then consider changing the regulations to take that sort of case into account? If so, first, it would be unfair on the person who made such a claim if he were not given backdating and other people were; secondly, regulations would have to be changed time after time. A much simpler process--including good cause in the regulations--could be used and cases could be decided by commissioners as they arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I do not intend to introduce good cause for backdating. As I understand it, there is no good cause within backdating now, but I have promised to write to the hon. Gentleman on that point. The list of exemptions will be prescribed in regulations, and if could be amended if one thinks that another exception should be included. However, such an exception will not be a catch-all provision of good cause.
<P>
I shall not go over the arguments I used on the previous amendment. I tried to be clear about how we intend to bring forward in regulations the prescriptive list which I have already identified. I shall write to hon. Members with any clarification they seek. I will also consider the case raised by the hon. Member for Northavon--it would help if he wrote to me to clarify the details, which he could only sketch this morning--to see how it fits into our proposals.
<P>
Following those helpful remarks, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The Minister understandably says that we object to certain money-saving measures. He is correct, and we make no apology for that. He suggested that we can object because we have the luxury of not being in government. The Government's priority for extra cash is tax cuts. Apparently, the Chancellor will announce next week a planned 10p starting rate for income tax. If there is money available, desirable though a 10p tax rate might be, it should be spent on elderly and disabled people who do not understand the benefits system and are about to be penalised by the Government. Government is about priorities, but it seems to me that the Government's priorities are wrong in this case. Presumably, that is a legitimate comment for an Opposition Member.
<P>
We are not convinced that the Minister addressed our points. The clause would not have been in the Bill were it not for the need to pay for another benefit change. The Government do not seem to want this and various other measures, but they are introducing them while simultaneously telling Back Benchers that they do not really want to do so. Unamended, the clause will take further tens of millions of pounds from elderly and disabled people. That has not been addressed, save for a few minor concessions.
<P>
We want to return to the issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 70 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 48 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 49</center></H4>
<H4><center>Payments treated as remuneration and earnings</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government new clause 7--Payments treated as remuneration and earnings.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. John Denham): We propose that clause 49 should not stand part of the Bill, and that it should be replaced by new clause 7. New clause 7 repeats the measures already in clause 49, which tackle avoidance of national insurance contributions using non-monetary payments under restrictive undertakings. It also introduces a new measure, treating as earnings for national insurance purposes the taxable gain on exercise of a share option in an unapproved share scheme. This enables the national insurance treatment of share options to be brought closer into line with income tax.
<P>
Although they are quite different in character, the measures for restrictive undertakings and share options are grouped together in a new clause because both measures require amendments to subsection (4) of section 4 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. That subsection treats as earnings for national insurance purposes payments that would not ordinarily fall within the definition of earnings for the purposes of the Contributions and Benefits Act. I shall deal first with non-monetary payments made under restrictive covenants.
<P>
Proposed subsection (4)(b) of the new clause is intended to block national insurance contributions avoidance schemes, which exploit a loophole in the current legislation. Under those avoidance schemes, instead of the usual cash bonus, employers and employees collude to enter into a restrictive covenant. Such convenants are legally binding agreements, usually not to leave and join a competitor, in return for which the employee is paid non-cash compensation in gold bullion or gilts. Payments in cash for entering into a restrictive covenant are already liable to national insurance under current legislation. Non-cash payments are not. Gold bullion and gilt payments made under restrictive covenants have no commercial purpose other than the avoidance of contributions.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Does the Minister have any calculation of the amount that blocking up this loophole will save the Exchequer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> In just one case of this form of avoidance, the director and main shareholder of a company was given a &#163;10 million payment in gilt-edged stock under a restrictive covenant. The company thus avoided &#163;1 million in national insurance contributions, and the director sold the gilt immediately for &#163;10 million in cash. Our estimate is that the likely effect of introducing the amendment would be to raise some &#163;20 million to &#163;30 million.
<P>
The clause treats non-monetary payments made under restrictive covenants as payments of earnings for the purposes of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, thereby making them subject to national insurance contributions. The clause is retrospective to the date of introduction, which was 10 July 1997. Without that, some companies would simply move their bonuses forward to take advantge of the loophole that we have highlighted by introducing amending legislation.
<P>
We are determined to act firmly against national insurance avoidance abuses such as the one tackled by the clause. Contributions paid for benefits and pensions go to some of the most vulnerable members of society. The national insurance scheme is founded on rights and responsibilities. We will take necessary measures to counter the actions of employers who blatantly seek to avoid their responsibilities.
<P>
The new clause would introduce changes to the national insurance treatment of options on non-approved shares. The changes will put right problems with existing regulations. Under the regulations that were introduced by the previous Administration in November 1996, payments to employees, by way of certain non-approved shares and options, were brought for the first time into earnings for national insurance and pay-as-you-earn. The shares brought into pay-as-you-earn and contributions were those that are tradeable, and options over those shares. Shares and options of that type were quite readily exchangeable for cash, and prior to the regulations they were used widely to avoid national insurance.
<P>
The proposals for share options in this new clause would raise some additional revenue from some employers, but that is not their primary aim. The Government have listened to criticism of the current regulations and propose to overhaul the charge to ensure greater fairness and to make the charge easier for business to administer. No new types of share scheme will be brought into national insurance.
<P>
The starting point for our overhaul of the share options provision is sub-paragraph (1) of new clause 7. This introduces a new measure to treat as earnings any gain taxable under section 135 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Currently, contributions on share options are based on the undervalue--the amount by which the sum paid by the employee is less than the market value of the shares--at the time that the option is granted. We will replace that charge with national insurance on the taxable gain when the share option is exercised. That will enable the national insurance treatment of share options to be brought closer to the income tax position.
<P>
In bringing forward the new clause and in drafting the regulations that will follow, we are keen to work with business to ensure successful implementation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The present rules for option schemes allow exemptions up to a certain modest amount, under which gains on options are taxed as capital gains. Thereafter, they are subject to income tax. I cannot remember the precise details of the rules, but I seem to recall that all options schemes come under the legislation covering income tax. Is the clause in line with the rules governing income tax and capital gains tax arising from options schemes? I assume that national insurance does not cover the modest amounts involved in capital gains, and that it does cover amounts to be treated as income.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> It would be better for me to answer the hon. Gentleman's question in writing. The aim of the clause is to bring the national insurance treatment of share options closer to the income tax treatment, as I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands.
<P>
We are keen to work with businesses to ensure the successful implementation of the measures. Officials have listened to what specialist lawyers and accountants have had to say, and they have met with business representatives to discuss this highly technical legal matter.
<P>
We shall discuss with business how best to operate the change. The two measures in new clause 7 represent sensible reforms of the present system. They will make national insurance fairer and easier for business to administer by bringing national insurance closer to the tax provisions. As a result, I hope that the Committee will agree that clause 49 should not stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
<P>
Clause 49 disagreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 50</center></H4>
<H4><center>Class 1A contributions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The clause ensures that a class 1A national insurance contribution will be payable in respect of cars provided to employees and directors taxable under section 157 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, even if the benefit of the car is the only payment of earnings made to that employee.
<P>
Class 1A national insurance contributions are paid only by employers, and only, in respect of employees who receive over &#163;8,500 a year, and most directors.
<P>
At the moment it is possible for a company to organise payment of its employees or directors in such a way that, if they receive no earnings other than the car, there may be no liable secondary contributor--that is, no employer--who can be held responsible for the payment of the class 1A national insurance contribution. The class 1A charge therefore may not bite.
<P>
We do not believe that it is fair that employers should be able to escape payment of contributions in this situation, simply because the employee or director has no other payment of earnings. For example, an employer may avoid a class 1A charge of up to &#163;700 in respect of a director provided with a car valued at &#163;20,000. The clause will put an end to that gap in the law.
<P>
I should make it clear that it does not in any way widen the scope of class 1A national insurance contributions beyond employees taxed under section 157 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The clause both simplifies and removes an anomaly in the class 1A arrangements, making the law fairer in distinguishing between those who have earnings and those who do not. It will remove the scope for national insurance avoidance in this area. I commend it to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> We would be grateful if the Minister explained exactly what the clause is designed to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The clause addresses the situation where class 1 contributions have been paid in error because workers who were classified as employees were actually self-employed.
<P>
Under current rules, refunds of national insurance contributions can be made for up to six years. Under this clause, contributors will be able to claim refunds of class 1 contributions up to a maximum of only 24 months. Once that period has expired there will be no further opportunity to question the class of contribution paid and it will, for benefit purposes, then be treated as of the proper class.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does not the Minister discern any incoherence or oddity in setting the period at 24 months, in the context of our recent debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I will deal with that point, but it would help the Committee and the hon. Member for West Dorset if I first set out in full the reasoning behind the clause.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is to protect the national insurance fund and to limit the administrative burden currently placed on the Contributions Agency when it has to go back and assess and pay refunds for six years.
<P>
Decisions on employment status are not always straightforward--there can sometimes be a thin line between self-employment and employment, and we know that mistakes can occur. However, it must be right that at some point we draw a line under those decisions and limit the extent to which we go back to pay refunds and correct records.
<P>
The Government have to strike a balance, and we have concluded that it is fair both to employers and to individuals to pay refunds for up to two years, rather than six. That will protect the national insurance fund and thus the wider interests of contributors generally.
<P>
An example will perhaps illustrate how the clause will work. In May 2000 a worker is engaged as an employee liable for class 1 contributions. In March 2006 it is confirmed that the worker was in fact self-employed and that the class 1 contributions had been paid in error. All the class 1 contributions paid from May 2000 to March 2004 would be treated as being of the proper class and no refund could be made. A refund may be made from March 2006, when the error is discovered, back to the start of that tax year, April 2005. In addition to those 11 months, a refund could be made in respect of wrongly paid contributions in the previous tax year, 2004-05. In the example, a total of 23 months of wrongly paid class 1 contributions could be refunded.
<P>
I hope that that explanation is helpful. I can, if hon. Members wish, give further information. We have tried to strike the right balance between the period for which refunds can be made, the protection of the national insurance fund and the protection of employees' interests which is appropriate to the work of the Contributions Agency.

regulations under sub-paragraph (2)(e) above shall not require any such interest to be paid until the decision has been made.'.
<P>
For several years now, the Contributions Agency has charged interest on late contributions to compensate the national insurance fund for the loss incurred. However, when a contributions debt is under dispute and an employer has asked the Secretary of State to make a formal determination under section 17 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, no interest is charged and interest cannot be recouped for the period in which the question was under consideration, even if the determination is in the Department's favour.
<P>
Following the introduction of the new decision-making and appeal measures, the list of situations where interest will not be charged will be far wider than now. It will include the periods when all decisions or revisions of decisions are being considered by the agency, as well as cases that are appealed to a tribunal. Thus in almost every case where there is any dispute as to the amount of contributions owing, interest will be lost.
<P>
To protect the national insurance fund, we believe that after a final decision is made, interest should be collectable from the date of original liability to pay if the decision is in the Department's favour. That will deter unscrupulous employers or contributors from raising pointless appeals merely to avoid paying national insurance contributions on time in the knowledge that they could gain interest on the unpaid money without having to compensate the national insurance fund for the loss. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I draw the Committee's attention to a striking contrast, which applies to all the clauses that we are considering. It relates back to my intervention on clause 52.
<P>
Amendment No. 84 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regulations . . . shall not require any such interest to be paid until the decision has been made.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, it constrains the regulations. In the same way under clause 52 the Minister admirably introduced a limit of 24 months rather than one month for a certain type of effective backdating.
<P>
There is a striking contrast between these, tributory parts of the Bill, where regulation making is decently constrained and time periods are appropriate, and the previous parts. It is almost as if they had been invented by entirely separate elements in the Department. In this case, it seems from the atmosphere of taxation, so to speak, as if the Treasury may have played a part. What a regrettable fact that that splendid atmosphere should pervade this part of the Bill, which in general deals with the better off, while a less splendid atmosphere should pervade those parts of the Bill relating to the less well off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> There is perhaps a further point, which the hon. Gentleman has not noticed. For the previous part of the Bill, we were not allowed backdating on claims, let alone interest on the backdating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I do not want to delay the Committee unduly, but it was an issue worth raising.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> Opposition Members are trying to build a large building on shaky foundations. This is a prudent measure which is designed to prevent unscrupulous employers from exploiting the system to obtain an interest-free loan at the expense of the Contributions Agency. It will enable us to ensure that when a determination is made in the Department's favour, we can recoup the interest that would otherwise be lost.

<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 39, line 38, after ```such a certificate''' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`,in the first place where they occur,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is the most minor of drafting amendments. It makes it absolutely clear that the new words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as is mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) above''
<P>
</UL></FONT>are to be inserted in subsection (3) of section 118 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 after the first use of the phrase ``such a certificate''. The amendment has no policy implications at all.
