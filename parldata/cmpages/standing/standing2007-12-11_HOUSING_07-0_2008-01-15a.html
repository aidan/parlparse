						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000327"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Thank you for that guidance and clarification,
Mr. Gale, and I apologise for any confusion caused to the
Committee. I want to stress that these provisions are not new, as they
are modelled on the provisions for the Urban Regeneration Agency. The
legislation sets out what the agency must do before it compulsorily
acquires land or new rights over land. The legislation applied by
schedule 2 also provides the gateway to the compensation code, which
specifies the manner in which the price paid for land is to be agreed
and governed. That is an amalgamation of statutes and about 150 years
of case law.</div>
					<a name="08011632000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 2
ensures that the Homes and Communities Agency is subject to the same
statutory procedure as most other bodies that have the power to
compulsorily acquire land. The procedure includes appropriate
safeguards, such as the opportunity to make representations, and allows
public inquiries to be held. It also ensures that the usual additional
safeguards that apply to commons, open spaces and allotments
apply.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>
					<a name="08011632000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 2 allows private rights of way
and the laying down of equipment to be extinguished on completion of a
compulsory acquisition. That practical provision ensures that the
agency will be able to use the land it acquires, free from any
interference from private rights over that land. Again, it is not a new
provision, but is modelled on an equivalent provision for the Urban
Regeneration Agency.</div>
					<a name="08011632000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 17 is a simple, technical amendment that ensures the
correct application of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965. It allows the
Act to apply to all acquisitions by agreement, so far is applicable, as
is the position for the Urban Regeneration Agency. That is important
because the Act is the gateway to the compensation code that I
mentioned earlier, and therefore ensures that appropriate compensation
will be paid.</div>
					<a name="08011632000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011632000328"></a>
							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): Our interest in the
amendment is technical, and we seek clarification, particularly of the
wide powers that we are discussing. We note from the memorandum that
the schedule and the powers are modelled on similar
provisions for the Urban Regeneration Agency. We are entitled to ask
precisely what that means, as the question comes up rather often. We
want to know what is being changed and why. If the amendment is a
straight lift from another provision, we should know. If, however, it
is modelled on such a provision, something may be hidden behind that.
The Homes and Communities Agency&#146;s combined powers not only to
acquire but to develop land could lead to a conflict of interest not
present in the powers of the Urban Regeneration Agency.</div>
					<a name="08011632000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a common theme in this
set of provisions&#151;the combination of the HCA&#146;s powers
make it incredibly powerful. We therefore require genuine clarification
of the extent of those powers and, when we come on to other clauses, we
will seek guidance as to how they will be used. The Minister may not
have the answer at his fingertips, but how often have the powers been
used? Are they used on a regular basis, have they been used many times,
or are they available in theory but not necessarily used in
practice?</div>
					<a name="08011632000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
three brief areas that I wish to explore. First, why and to what extent
do the powers differ from those previously granted? Secondly, does the
Minister acknowledge that the combination of powers available to the
Homes and Communities Agency makes the use of those powers a cause of
concern? Clarification of the way in which they will be used would be
helpful. Thirdly, how often have those powers been used in the past,
and how often does he expect them to be used in
future?</div>

						<a name="08011632000329"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): I would like to make a general
point. The subject of compulsory purchase is a complex one, but we live
in a country of owner-occupiers who tend to relate everything that
happens in their area to the price of their house. We are sometimes
parsimonious in compensating people affected by development, and we
would meet less opposition to worthy schemes if we were a little more
generous at the beginning in compensating people whose properties are
subject to a compulsory purchase order. That could
unlock certain projects and speed up their development. I am not an
expert on the subject of compulsory purchase, but will the agency be
constrained in what it can offer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>when it purchases a site? That probably relates more to another
measure&#151;the Planning Bill&#151;that is being considered in
Committee today. Is there a formula for such purchases? Is it fixed or
can it made more generous to speed up a housing development and obtain
the
benefits?</div>
					<a name="08011632000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000330"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> We have had a short and sweet debate on an
interesting and important clause that deals with the subject of how we
fulfil the agency&#146;s regeneration objectives.
The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire made a number of points and
I hope to be able to answer all of them effectively. He asked to what
extent the HCA&#146;s powers are different from those of the Urban
Regeneration Agency. They are more or less&#151;I know that that is
not a satisfactory phrase&#151;modelled on the Urban Regeneration
Agency&#146;s objectives. The subject that I think that he is trying
to tease out&#151;and I am happy to have this debate&#151;is the
brownfield restriction. I believe that the hon. Gentleman and his party
have tabled amendments to a later clause on the issue. The brownfield
restriction applies to the URA&#146;s objectives, but it is not
proposed that it should apply to the HCA&#146;s powers, because
limiting its compulsory purchase powers purely to brownfield land would
reduce its ability to deliver regeneration and housing where they are
needed, regardless of where that is in
England.</div>
					<a name="08011632000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s policy is that brownfield land should be developed
before greenfield land. That has been our policy for a number of years,
and it has served us extremely well&#151;something like 74 per cent.
of all development is on brownfield land, and we would like that figure
to increase. The point that the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire
made about the agency&#146;s compulsory purchase powers was made by
the hon. Member for Poole, too. Importantly, we are not talking about a
vacuum and the agency&#146;s compulsory purchase powers can be
exercised only within the usual statutory framework for compulsory
purchase. The Secretary of State has to authorise any compulsory
purchase orders made by the agency. We discussed in previous sittings
the agency&#146;s wide-ranging powers to achieve its objectives of
securing the most appropriate housing, regeneration and development in
England, and it will operate within that framework. The power that we
are debating today can be referred back to the Secretary of
State&#151;again, that is extremely important.</div>
					<a name="08011632000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked how the provision was modelled
on previous provisions. As I said, it is not a straight lift. We are
trying to modernise legislation&#151;it is a question of the language
used for drafting measures&#151;and the provision was developed with
modern drafting procedures. The objects of the agency are wider than
those of the Urban Regeneration Agency, so the application of the
powers will be slightly different. I hope that that reassures the hon.
Gentleman . He asked how many times the powers had been be used. I do
not have the precise numbers to hand, but I can write to him and other
Committee members.</div>
					<a name="08011632000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can give the Committee examples of compulsory purchase order powers
that have been used by English Partnerships that have worked very well.
For example, in Gardiners Lane South in Basildon, a CPO was proposed to
acquire under-used and ineffectively used land so that a comprehensive
regeneration scheme 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>could be delivered. In Liverpool&#151;as capital of culture, it is on
our minds at the moment&#151;a CPO was utilised to acquire land
necessary to facilitate the Kings Waterfront scheme, as well as land
that will be used to construct and maintain a pedestrian bridge over an
adjacent estate. Again in Liverpool, at the Lime Street
gateway project, English Partnerships used CPO powers
to provide the necessary regeneration. The area was regarded as being
in need of regeneration because of vacancy, under-use and ineffective
use, and the Gateway site is a prominent location that could be better
used.</div>
					<a name="08011632000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again&#151;and I am looking
at my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich&#151;in
the Greenwich peninsula, EP has made a CPO under the terms of a legal
agreement with development partners. There are therefore examples of
ways in which the new Homes and Communities Agency could use CPO powers
to exploit land that would not be developed by the private
sector.</div>
					<a name="08011632000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000331"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The Minister may need to write to the
Committee to clarify this, but in the specific examples he mentioned in
relation to Liverpool, how will the HCA&#146;s powers dovetail with
the pathfinder programme and the various powers given
to it? Problems have arisen in Liverpool with the time scale for the
acquisition of property, and some areas&#151;specifically
Anfield&#151;that were intended to be developed quite quickly have,
in fact, waited a long time for development. How will the HCA&#146;s
compulsory purchase powers work where there is an existing pathway
programme?</div>
					<a name="08011632000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000332"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I should be happy to allow the hon. Gentleman to
intervene again to clarify something. When he says the pathfinder
programmes, does he mean urban
renewal?</div>
					<a name="08011632000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000333"></a>Alistair

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000334"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> The whole aim is that the agency should work in
consultation with local authorities and relevant organisations on
issues such as housing market renewal. We should not forget that the
agency will have responsibility for that function. I would imagine that
there will be a dovetailing of the things that the hon. Gentleman
mentioned. The wider point about using CPOs to utilise under-developed
land is an important one, and I hope that he would accept that
regeneration vehicles need compulsory purchase powers to fulfil their
objectives.</div>
					<a name="08011632000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000335"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> May I pick up on something the Minister has just
said, because we may have missed something in last week&#146;s
announcement? Is he saying that it is proposed that responsibility for
the housing market renewal initiative, which was criticised by a
parliamentary Committee, should be taken away from the Department and
given to the Homes and Communities
Agency?</div>
					<a name="08011632000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000336"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Yes, that is certainly the intention, and I
thought I made that clear in earlier sessions. I apologise if I did not
do so.</div>
					<a name="08011632000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have answered all the questions that were asked. As I have said, these
are important powers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>for regeneration vehicles, and they will be used
within the statutory planning framework and with the direct consent of
the Secretary of State. It is important that the agency has them so
that it can fulfil its objectives, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman
supports the
amendment.</div>

Moran:
						</b> I am very pleased to be here under your
chairmanship, Mr. Gale. The purpose of the amendments is
really to facilitate the HCA&#146;s objectives. The Bill, as it
currently stands, implies restrictions on the disposal of lands by the
HCA for less than the best market price. In other words, the
opportunities for the HCA to dispose of land that might be in the wider
public interest are limited within the Bill. The purpose of this
amendment is to give the HCA power to dispose of land at less than best
consideration&#151;a Treasury term, as we know, which in practice
means highest market price. So the concept can be used to further the
objectives of the HCA, as the Minister has repeatedly outlined. The
objective of the HCA is not only to improve the supply and quality of
housing in England and to secure regeneration of land or infrastructure
but to support the regeneration and development of communities and
their continued well-being; to meet the needs of people living in
England. Now that is a very wide objective which requires wider powers
of disposal than are currently outlined in this Bill. So by deleting
and replacing the words</div>
					<a name="08011632000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may not dispose of land for less
than the best consideration which can reasonably be obtained unless the
Secretary of State consents&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08011632000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">the need is removed for
the HCA to gain special permission from the Secretary of State each
time it seeks to dispose of land outwith the current requirements for
best consideration. So amendment No. 38 removes from the Bill the
exception basis, if you like, which means that there has to be specific
permission from the Secretary of State.</div>

					<a name="08011632000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 39 deletes subsections (2), (3) and (4), which contain conditions
as to where land might be disposed of for less than
best consideration&#151;for example, where there is a grant of a term
of less than seven years or where the HCA has compulsorily acquired
land. The amendment would make the clause a positive rather than a
negative one&#151;that is, it would enable the HCA to dispose of land
in pursuance of its objects. The restrictions would no longer be
needed.</div>
					<a name="08011632000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The register
of surplus public sector land contains about
&#163;10 billion-worth of land&#151;about 4,500 hectares&#151;and
that includes a mix of local authority, central Government and
Government agency land. There are surplus public-owned sites in just
about all of our constituencies. I know that in my own area of Luton
the incoming Labour council has, unlike the previous Liberal-Tory
administration which did nothing in this respect, spent a great deal of
time identifying small pockets of land which can be used for affordable
social housing. I emphasise small pockets of land because in my
constituency our housing crisis is acute. We are landlocked&#151;we
are green-girdled&#151;so every available small bit of infill land is
vital to us. Every local authority has a list of public-owned sites,
but the details of those sites, to whom they are sold and what price
they go for, remain restricted, according to the Town and Country
Planning Association.</div>
					<a name="08011632000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, one of the biggest
and most important objectives in this Bill and indeed in the housing
Green Paper is to secure those additional sites, those surplus
public-sector sites, for housing and, as stated, to create up to 50 per
cent affordable homes on such sites. The Government announced in the
Green Paper that 550 additional public sites would be brought from the
British Railways Board (Residuary)&#151;about 340 sites&#151;the
Highways Agency and the Ministry of Defence.</div>
					<a name="08011632000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless legislation enables the
HCA to dispose of land at less than best consideration in order to
achieve its stated objectives, it is very difficult to see how much of
that land can be brought into use for affordable social housing, and
therefore how the HCA and the Government&#146;s targets are going to
be achieved. Without legislation to enshrine the principle that I am
outlining in amendment No. 38, so that the HCA can dispose of land for
less than best consideration in furtherance of its objects, it is
possible that the HCA will find itself in a perverse situation. That
has already occurred in a number of areas. For example, agencies such
as NHS Estates have sold their land and buildings at full market price,
believing that they were required to do so, often to private developers
who were able to outbid registered social landlords. At the same time,
however, the very same NHS trusts need new key worker accommodation.
They then have to apply, or through RSLs bid, for further Government
funding to provide key worker homes for their health care staff. So we
are finding a double whammy and the Government are paying twice out of
the public purse. That is why the amendments are so
important.</div>
					<a name="08011632000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">A recent
internal transfer of 96 surplus NHS sites to English Partnerships at a
cost of about &#163;320 million was described as a
successful disposal scheme. The costs had to be recouped from the
residual development. In other words, the developer had to sell off a
proportion of those homes to recoup those costs. That makes it
extremely hard to secure a significant number of affordable homes from
the final scheme.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>
					<a name="08011632000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know that because social
rented housing does not make a profit, it is usually the first thing to
go on a private developer&#146;s site when margins are squeezed. So
we see repeatedly that sites like these, even sites that are in public
sector ownership and disposed of at full market value effectively, are
squeezed of the affordable rented housing that we know is desperately
needed. So we have to look to ways in which we can ensure that the
public sector land referred to in the Green Paper will be available for
genuinely affordable homes that will go on being affordable in the long
term and not just at first purchase. I think we have an opportunity to
provide some leadership through the HCA. We all know in our own local
authority areas of cases in which public sector land is disposed of and
RSLs are outbid by private builders who do not take the same
attitude to increasing the amount of affordable rented
accommodation.</div>
					<a name="08011632000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
had experience in the real world. Before I came to this place, I was
chief executive of a housing association. We saw local authorities who
had the power to dispose at less than the full market value, but used
the protection of the kind of terms that are currently in this Bill to
avoid developing land. Dare I mention local authorities in London
beginning with the initial W, predominantly Tory authorities, who use
the argument that they have to dispose of what land is available at
full market value in order to avoid their responsibilities for
developing social rented housing? I saw that when I was running an
RSL.</div>
					<a name="08011632000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know that
there are difficult sites to develop, such as land-locked sites. In my
own constituency we have tiny sites in the most densely overcrowded
areas which are simply not viable for RSLs to develop. I have had the
experience over and over again of trying to develop sites in the most
acutely overcrowded areas of housing need. Such projects simply would
not stack up according to the Housing Corporation&#146;s total cost
indicator, as it was then. We then saw private builders
come in with larger amounts of money to develop those
sites for sale rather than social rented
accommodation.</div>

						</b> I am following the hon. Lady&#146;s argument
closely. A key part of her amendment involves taking out the consent of
the Secretary of State and giving the responsibility solely to the HCA.
Is that a deliberate omission or an oversight and does she not feel
there is a potential conflict of interest because of the wider powers
of the HCA? I agree with the sentiments behind what the hon. Lady is
saying, but would it not be safer to retain some element of Secretary
of State
involvement?</div>

							<a name="08011632000341"></a>Margaret
Moran:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I
understand his sentiments in raising that. The thrust of the amendment
is purposeful. It should not be seen as an exception that land is
disposed of for less than best market value. At the moment, having to
refer the matter to the Secretary of State in every instance, as
suggested in the Bill, is a substantial impediment and it presupposes
that land will always be disposed of at full market value. While I
agree with him that there may be some caveats and some circumstances in
which the Secretary of State&#146;s involvement and interest needs to
be safeguarded, that should not be automatic whenever land is disposed
of at less than best market value.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>
					<a name="08011632000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">My constituency in Luton is part
of the Milton Keynes South Midlands growth area. I chaired a housing
conference recently, at which I was very pleased that the Minister for
Housing was able to speak. There is a great deal of enthusiasm,
certainly in my own local authority, about delivering more affordable
rented accommodation, and it has taken some time to get to that stage.
The idea is perhaps not so enthusiastically supported by our
neighbouring authorities of Bedfordshire county council and South
Bedfordshire district council, but they are coming round to the idea.
The need that we all articulated at that conference was to deal, as the
Bill does, not just with physical regeneration&#151;in other words,
not just the numbers of new homes, important though they are&#151;but
with social regeneration and the wider employment and economic impacts.
Often, they require additional subsidy and funding, which is very
difficult for RSLs to achieve unless they receive land at less than
best market value. Once again, it illustrates that if we are to achieve
the stated objects of the HCA, we need to amend this part of the Bill.
I thank the Minister for Housing for the helpful letter sent to members
of the Committee on this issue. She has clearly gone to some lengths to
find a way of overcoming this predicament. It is right that clause 50
contains a general consent, which includes a public benefit test, and
also that the Local Government Act 1972 makes it possible for local
authorities to be allowed to dispose of land at less than best
consideration in certain circumstances. How many times has that
been used in proportion to the number of sites that local authorities
deal with? My understanding is that the number is very small indeed. It
is seen very much as the exception rather than the
rule.</div>
					<a name="08011632000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come back to
the point that the Bill makes disposal at less than best consideration
an exception. The ability of local authorities to dispose of land at
less than market value, if it is in the public interest to do so, is a
source of a contention. Many local authorities are aware that they have
such a power and choose not to use it, sometimes, as I said,
deliberately for their own political reasons or
because of their view about whether they should have more affordable
social housing in their area. I know from my experience as leader of a
council, that officers sometimes feel under pressure because the
district auditor is breathing down the local authority&#146;s neck to
discourage it from selling at other than best market price. More often
than not, the financial circumstances of the local authority seeking to
achieve the maximum capital receipt to invest back into other
services&#151;sadly, often not into housing&#151;simply precludes
the frequent use of the existing power.</div>
					<a name="08011632000297"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div>
					<a name="08011632000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">So I simply say
to my hon. Friend that resting on this existing provision in the Local
Government Act and perhaps extending that to the HCA is not necessarily
going to deliver the outcomes that we are all seeking to achieve here.
I therefore ask him to look again at whether the sentiments behind the
amendment could be incorporated into the Bill so that we can ensure
that it is not presumed that best market value is the usual way of
disposing of land. That would encourage a much wider view of how we can
get the best value for our communities.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>
					<a name="08011632000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind my hon. Friend that
there was a brief discussion of this in the evidence that we were
provided with by the chief executive of the National Housing
Federation, as I believe it is now called&#151;it is a long while
since I have been involved in front line housing. He indicated that the
existing local government provision was confused and that the
definition of public interest was very confused&#151;and confusing
for local government. He offered to help to clarify the definitions so
that we could achieve our objectives for the HCA. With that in mind, I
ask the Minister to reflect on whether the Bill gives sufficient powers
to achieve the objectives that he has stated for the
HCA.</div>

						<a name="08011632000342"></a>
							<b class="B">Andrew
George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): I am pleased, as a co-sponsor of
amendments Nos. 38 and 39, to speak to amendment No. 108, which takes
another approach to trying to nudge the culture of the public sector in
the right direction. Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 do not propose a
revolutionary change; nor does amendment No. 108. It is a question of
addressing a problem which has existed for many years, which is that
there has been a failure of joined-up government in respect of the need
to ensure that the assets that the public own&#151;and
hold&#151;are put to good public use and that an authority achieves
the best possible income.</div>
					<a name="08011632000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I congratulate the hon. Member
for Luton, South on the manner in which she moved these
amendments and give her my strong support. I also pay tribute
to my hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes), as I know
that he is passionate about this issue. He has been a great champion of
securing public benefit for public assets. He is also a genuine
champion of social housing and council housing in
particular&#151;both across the country and in his
constituency.</div>
					<a name="08011632000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
about a change of culture for the public sector and achieving more
joined-up government. The purpose of the two amendments tabled by the
hon. Member for Luton, South is to ensure that the objects of the HCA
are carried through in more of its activities than would otherwise be
the case. The amendments will ensure that, when disposing of
land, the HCA considers whether it is contributing to an improvement in
the supply and quality of housing&#151;particularly affordable
housing&#151;securing the regeneration and development of land
infrastructure and supporting communities. It should ensure that there
is genuinely the greatest public benefit. The context in which all that
takes place is the planning system, and although the Bill is not about
planning, we all know that when a planning system is fuelled by greed
not need, and open-market housing is developed on the site which will
net a significant market price in comparison with affordable housing,
there is a temptation for any agency or public authority to secure the
money and not put the work into achieving what would be, if it
did put the effort in, of far greater social benefit to the
communities concerned.</div>
					<a name="08011632000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The HCA will face those
challenges. In considering its position, it may decide to dispose of
land, but in doing so, it may apply for planning permission for the
site, as many people do for their back gardens. It may apply for
planning permission prior to disposal, enter into section 106
agreements, attach a covenant to the land and dispose of it, possibly
to an RSL, to ensure that the land achieves the best consideration
within its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>own&#151;the HCA&#146;s&#151;objects. That process would allow the
HCA to achieve those objects, whereas the Bill will force the HCA to
achieve a private-market value for the land, which will be
significantly different from the fettered process that I have just
described. A fettered planning permission and covenant would provide a
belt-and-braces constraint on development of the land, and ensure that
disposal met the HCA&#146;s objects.</div>
					<a name="08011632000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such debates are not new to the
House. For decades, the relative merit and value of, for example,
cost-benefit analysis has weighed heavily on Members of
both Houses on many occasions. If we take a
two-dimensional view of cost and benefit, and construct, for example, a
road through a piece of land taking into account the land&#146;s
development value but not its ecological value, we will end up driving
roads and infrastructure through unique landscapes. I am not straying
from the point; the point is that nothing in the Bill places a monetary
value on the social outcomes and objects pursued by the HCA. The
purpose of the amendments is to redress the balance and ensure that the
social benefits are not overridden by the obvious attraction to any
public organisation of making a quick buck, and to ensure that the
social benefits and the objects of the HCA are realised through the
manner of, and the regulations that apply to, the disposal of
land.</div>
				
					<a name="08011632000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire, in a very helpful intervention, asked whether it was
appropriate to cut the Secretary of State out of the process entirely.
That is a very good question. The Bill requires the Secretary of State
to intervene too much. I have not previously conceived of
circumstances, such as the disposal of burial grounds, in which the
Secretary of State&#146;s role is not about considering market value
but about considering other issues outwith the objects of the HCA.
There may be circumstances in which the Secretary of State would have
to play such a role but, in regard to amendment No. 63, she would
continue to have a role throughout the process and can intervene far
too much and rather unnecessarily. However, the hon. Gentleman may be
right that there are circumstances in which the backstop provided by
the Secretary of State is relevant, and that is something that we may
need to address in future. I strongly support and endorse the
amendments tabled by hon. Member for Luton South, and I hope the
Minister will give due consideration to the objects of the HCA and
ensure they are delivered with regard to the disposal of
land.</div>
					<a name="08011632000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011632000343"></a>
							<b class="B">Sir
George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): I support the
speeches in favour of the amendments, which seek to mediate between two
important imperatives. First, if a public body disposes of public
assets, it should secure the best price for the taxpayer, and there are
powerful arguments within the Treasury for going down that route. There
are also arguments about transparency, because when we go down that
route, there should be no doubt that the proper price has been secured.
The second imperative, which pulls in the opposite direction, is the
imperative behind the Bill, and it seeks to bring about a step change
in housing output. The Government&#146;s position is that there has
been a market failure, and unless intervention takes place, they will
not achieve the output of new homes that they wish to achieve. The
whole object of the Bill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div>is to address market failure&#151;hence the powers, finances, and the
planning powers that we are about to
address.</div>
					<a name="08011632000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">As drafted,
clause 10(1) leans very much towards what I would call the Treasury
interpretation of best value, as it states that the HCA</div>
					<a name="08011632000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may not dispose of land for less
than the best consideration which can reasonably be obtained unless the
Secretary of State consents.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011632000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">That requirement is nuanced by the letter
we received from the Minister, which outlines the circumstances in
which the Secretary of State might consent. We will come on to clause
50, which deals with general consents, but I should like to ask the
Minister whether there is not a risk that if a certain route obliges
the agency to involve the Secretary of State, it would slow the process
that the Bill is designed to accelerate&#151;namely the output of
social housing?</div>
					<a name="08011632000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
imagine that the HCA has acquired some land, and wishes to dispose of
it so that social housing can be built on it. Two routes are available:
it can either dispose of the land for the best possible consideration
to, for example, a housing association to which it gives a large grant
to produce the required output of housing, or it can dispose of the
land to the housing association for less than the best consideration
and give it a lower grant. The impact on public funds would be exactly
the same. As I read clause 10(1), it nudges towards the first route. In
other words, the agency would obtain the best consideration, then give
the housing association a large grant to compensate for the fact that
it had paid market value. I wonder whether the Minister really wants to
have what I would call an un-level playing field and whether the
agency, in the circumstances that I have described, might have good
reason not to go down the best consideration, high grant route, but go
for the less than best consideration, low grant route, which ends up at
exactly the same position, albeit by a different route. Having listened
to other Members&#146; speeches, I believe that we need clarity. The
last thing we want is a whole lot of test cases in which the HCA or
local authority is challenged because it has disposed of land for less
than the best consideration and there is a litigious local council tax
payer who feels aggrieved. Some people may disagree with the planning
decision behind the disposal. I therefore have great deal of sympathy
with the speakers seeking clarity. I think that the
amendments&#151;and the Minister has been offered a wide range to
choose from&#151;seek to inject some clarity what at the moment is a
rather ambiguous
position.</div>

No. 38 but also to promote amendment No.63 in my name and that of other
hon. Friends. I also back the call for clarity made by my right hon.
Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire. I disagree to an extent
with the letter that the Minister for Housing sent us in response to
comments made during the evidence session to try to provide some
guidance to the interpretation of clause
10.</div>
					<a name="08011632000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment
would keep an involvement of the Secretary of State in the wider issue.
We will come to the wider issue of why it is important to have some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>clarity and why there should be a wide definition of the sense of best
value in a moment.</div>
					<a name="08011632000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the concern regarding the new agency if it is not a merger of
two bodies but something new. The coincidence of powers contained in
the new agency makes it very powerful and raises questions that were
not necessarily there when we were dealing with two separate entities.
It has come up before. The Campaign to Protect Rural England, for
example, raised this concern. I quote from its written
evidence:</div>
					<a name="08011632000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given that the
HCA&#146;s sweeping powers may include planning powers, careful
consideration should be given to ensuring that safeguards are adequate
to avoid abuse and to deal with potential conflicts of interest which
may arise, eg. between the HCA&#146;s roles as developer, landowner
and planning
authority.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011632000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I
think we still need some involvement of the Secretary of State. It is
not necessarily designed to hold up matters but to ensure that
somebody somewhere is accountable as the work of the HCA
proceeds.</div>
					<a name="08011632000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
fear that has been expressed several times is the conflict between the
overall objects of the HCA, as set out in the Bill, the comments made
by the Minister and the drive towards achieving a target. Let me pose
the situation that there is concern that the target for house-building
numbers is not being reached and the pressure, therefore, is on the
agency to deliver, or else their chief executive might be sacked like
the chief executive of the Thames Gateway. The concern is that, at that
stage, decisions are made that are not necessarily in the best
interests of the rest of us. In relation to disposals of land, the
determination to get the houses built may lead to decisions where the
interests of the taxpayer and the nation are subsumed under the
interests of reaching a
target.</div>
					<a name="08011632000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Secretary of State is not involved, there is no one for the House to
call to account in those circumstances. That is why I think it is
helpful to keep the Secretary of Sate still involved in this process
because these are big powers. There is a risk of market distortion, the
ability of the agency to go in and outbid anyone
else&#151;&#151;perhaps a small housing association&#151;and the
concerns raised by the hon. Member for Luton, South who moved amendment
No. 38. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield had
that experience in his constituency, where a small housing association
was outbid by English Partnerships. That a late decision was made to
dispose of the land for a much smaller sum to get the house building
going may be evidence of a conflict of interest, so to have the
Secretary of State involved and held to account for such decisions
would be helpful.</div>
					<a name="08011632000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
turn from why the Secretary of State should be involved to why we are
considering clarity in this particular case, I support the general tone
of the arguments made by the hon. Members for Luton, South and for St.
Ives and my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire. It
would be helpful to have something on the face of the Bill that
indicates that best value may be wider than just market
considerations.</div>
					<a name="08011632000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of those who have given evidence have raised this point with us.
Written evidence from the National Housing Federation
says:</div>
					<a name="08011632000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Federation believes that the test of disposal of land is that it should
be for the greatest public benefit&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>
					<a name="08011632000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my right hon. Friend
said, there are a variety of menu options for the Minister to choose
from in getting that principle enunciated clearly. It is
straightforward: because we are dealing with the provision of community
assets, there are circumstances in which going for the pure best
financial value may not be the right thing to do. Accordingly, allowing
the agency to take the risk of being able to take other matters into
consideration is, we believe, necessary&#151;as I know the Minister
believes. That was the import of the letter from the Minister for
Housing on her explanation of clause 10. The point of her letter was to
say that a specific power is not necessary in the Bill, because the
Bill contains in clause 50 a general power that relates back
to&#151;and is presumably modelled on&#151;section 123(2) of the
Local Government Act 1972, which allows the general power. The
Minister&#146;s point, and presumably that of the Government, is that
that does the job and allows the wider consideration. The Minister
suggests that that is the way that it has been used and therefore there
is no particular problem, so let us keep it as it
is.</div>
					<a name="08011632000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">My information, in
talking to people widely about this, is that that is not quite the
case. There is hesitation and uncertainty about the use of the
provision and there have been occasions when possible deals have been
prevented because officers and councils were not sure whether they had
the powers. Someone involved in regeneration and development in
urban areas has given me a specific example relating to a project in
Birmingham, stating:</div>
					<a name="08011632000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Council were
marketing the former Science Museum and were looking for substantial
regeneration benefits including public use of the historic industrial

						<i class="I">]</i> Well, it
is the best term we can use. The gentleman supplying this information
to me says that his company made a bid and was recommended by officers
to be selected, both on the grounds of highest financial offer, and
output, but he adds:</div>
					<a name="08011632000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At the last minute
before the Members&#146; meeting to ratify this&#151;&#151;long
after the deadline for submission and financial
offer&#151;&#151;one of the other bidders raised their offer and
the officers immediately advised Members that this had to be considered
or they would be at risk of a challenge under S123, because they would
be accepting a bid which may not represent &#145;best
consideration&#146;.&#148;</div>

benefits.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011632000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is other evidence of a lack of certainty about the use of this general
clause, which the Minister and his Department are relying upon now.
Accordingly, the amendments invite the Minister to give effect to
what is plainly both his intention and the intention
of the Minister for Housing, namely to allow a wider
interpretation, but would it not be far better to put this in the Bill?
Accordingly, that is what we seek to
do.</div>
					<div class="hs_Para">The Department retains, through the
involvement of the Secretary of State, the power to ensure that such
opportunities are not misused and that there is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>widespread mishandling of the power to the detriment of taxpayers. It
enables the housing&#151;and the country in general&#151;to be
protected because, should there be widespread misuse of such a power,
the House would be able to question the Secretary of State and
Ministers directly and seek an explanation for what is happening. This
is why we prefer the Secretary of State&#146;s consent to be
there.</div>
					<a name="08011632000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
purposes of clarity, and to ensure that the Bill actually delivers what
the Minister says he wants it to deliver, it would be far better to
accept one of the amendments at some stage and clarify the Bill, as
Members in all parts of the House seem to want. The
amendment carries the power of Government Back
Benchers, of the representative of the Liberal Democrats and of
Conservative Back and Front Benchers. In the spirit of the Committee
and the way in which we have been going about our business, it would be
helpful if the Minister, with his own particular style and desire to
move with the feeling of the Committee in the best interests of all of
us, were to accept the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08011632000345"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I have enjoyed the debate. I think hon. Members
have come at it from different angles, but there is some consensus in
the Committee. I hope that I can demonstrate that the amendments are
unnecessary and that the current provisions in the Bill are the most
appropriate way forward. Mr. Gale, I do not want you to rule
me out of order&#151;&#151;you would be on your feet very quickly
if I were&#151;&#151;and I do not want to have a clause stand part
debate on this, but as many amendments refer to &#147;best
consideration&#148;, it would be useful if I outlined to hon. Members
what that phrase really
means.</div>
					<a name="08011632000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Best
consideration&#148; generally means the best market value that can be
obtained. Since the public evidence sessions last December, it has
become clear that matters of wider public benefit may be taken into
account only if the benefit has a monetary value that can be assessed.
The Minister for Housing wrote to the Committee on 10 January on that
matter. The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire spoke about
amendment No. 108, which seeks to set a definition of &#147;best
consideration,&#148; particular to the HCA. It adds a requirement
that the &#147;best consideration&#148; obtained should
mean</div>
					<a name="08011632000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the best outcome
secured in respect of the of the objectives of the
HCA.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011632000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest that that
is unnecessary and provides an added level of complication. It would
risk altering the common understanding of &#147;best
consideration&#148; with regard to this agency&#151;the
HCA&#151;alone. In respect of clause 10, we would expect all the
agency&#146;s actions to be in pursuit of its objects.</div>
					<a name="08011632000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now turn to amendments Nos.
38 and 39, ably tabled and passionately argued for by my hon. Friend
the Member for Luton, South. As the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire said, they would remove any restrictions on how the HCA
may dispose of land. That would leave the Secretary of State no obvious
mechanism by which to ensure that value for money and/or assets was
being obtained. Nor would there be an easy mechanism by which the
agency could be held to account for its decisions in relation to the
disposal of land. This was the point made by the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div>
					<a name="08011632000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our view, the restriction on
the disposal of land is needed to safeguard the public purse and to
ensure that resources that belong to the taxpayer are not used
inappropriately&#151;for example, to give an unfair subsidy to
private companies. Equally&#151;this is an important point, which I
fully understand from the oral evidence sessions in December and the
sentiments expressed today&#151;we do not want to place unnecessary
financial or bureaucratic obstacles in the way of the agency&#146;s
objectives. We want the agency to get the best value for public money
and I fully accept that that will not always mean selling land for the
highest price.</div>
					<a name="08011632000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suggest that the current provisions in the Bill, clause 10 in
conjunction with clause 50, is the Goldilocks approach. It is not too
onerous, not too free, but just right. I think that is probably the
best thing. It is a good balance between providing assurance to the
taxpayer and value for money, while making sure that the agency can
achieve its objectives&#151;namely, to improve housing supply and
regenerate
communities.</div>

Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): I have
followed the Minister&#146;s argument and supported it up to this
point. The question it inevitably poses is the terms of the consent
that may be given by the Secretary of State. He may be going on to
describe in some detail what terms might be applied under the powers in
clause 50 and, if so, I will not pursue it at this point. If not, it is
essential, if we are to feel confident, that the right balance is
achieved between the two competing objectives of
financial probity and facilitating appropriate social housing
development, and that there is clear guidance that enables the agency
to use its powers appropriately to reduce the price at which property
is disposed of in appropriate circumstances to further housing
development.</div>

Secretary of State&#151;will the Minister clarify whether best
consideration would be, in the scenario which I described, the HCA
applying for planning permission, welcoming the constraints of a

trying to make a quick buck. I know that he was being
flippant and I understand the sentiment exactly&#151;it was an
honourable and correct sentiment&#151;but according to the
agency&#146;s intentions and objectives it is not there to be a land
speculator or to make a quick buck. All land that the HCA will own 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>will be sold solely for the purposes of meeting its
objects. I remind the Committee of clause 4(2), which states that
the</div>

are to be exercised for the purposes of its objects or for purposes

							<b class="B">Grant
Shapps</b> (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con): Before we move away from
the point about the balance between the Secretary of State giving
permission for the disposal of land at less than the market rate and
the alternative of removing the Secretary of State, as proposed by
amendments Nos. 38 and 39, can the Minister&#151;in order for the
Committee to fully understand the point&#151;indicate how much that
power has been used by the Secretary of State in earlier legislation?
If he cannot tell us now, he could reply this afternoon or on Thursday,
but how many times has the Secretary of State intervened to allow
disposal of land at less than market
value?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000351"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am grateful for that intervention and I was
going to respond in respect of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton,
South. If the Committee will forgive me, I will try to provide figures
when we discuss clause 50. Given the nature of the general consents
regime, the Committee will recognise that it might not be possible to
provide accurate and complete figures because records may not be
centrally held on the disposing of land at a local level. However, I
will do my best to provide them if I can for the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08011632000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
responding to the point about being a speculator. <i class="I">[Interruption.]
</i>I do not think that the agency will be in that position. The agency
is there to improve the supply of housing and that is the important
point. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> If I may be allowed, I want to elaborate.
This is a very important point: every bid for every site sold by the
HCA will have to demonstrate how its proposed developments will meet
the agency&#146;s objectives, which we have discussed. Where the
agency sells land at best market price I suggest that the receipts of
that sale could be reinvested by the agency into further delivery of
its objects. I do not envisage a scenario in which the agency would be
putting covenants and planning permission on in order to boost the
price. I do not think that that is what it will be
doing.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000352"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> In that case, the Minister may have misunderstood
what I was saying, which was about restricting the options on the
future use of land by placing section 106 agreements and covenants on
the land to ensure that it would meet the housing needs of the local
community. If on most occasions the HCA were to dispose of land where
it is appropriate that the land could be used for housing, made sure
that it sought a restrictive planning agreement with a section 106
agreement beforehand and also placed a covenant on that land to ensure
that it could be restricted, but then sought the best consideration
from those developers who could achieve this&#151;mainly registered
social landlords&#151;would that be within the orbit of what the
Minister is
describing?</div>
					<a name="08011632000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000353"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> That is a theme emerging from today&#146;s
session. This is not being done in a vacuum, but as part of the
planning framework. We do not expect speculative offers that do not
coincide with the local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>development framework. It is important to point out that the agency will
be responsible for ensuring that the specification will be sufficiently
detailed&#151;this will be a key point&#151;to avoid radically
unsuitable bids coming in. I hope I have answered the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. The specifications may require the consent of
the Secretary of State if they are to include conditions for the wider
public benefit that have no monetary value. We would expect the agency
to work on that
basis.</div>
					<a name="08011632000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
63 would require the Secretary of State to consider wider public
benefit if granting permission to dispose of land at less than the best
consideration. I was very struck by the oral evidence sessions in
December, where people spoke about the need for land disposal to
achieve the best possible outcome for the community, not simply the
highest monetary value, and I have a lot of sympathy with that.
However, I suggest that this amendment is unnecessary precisely because
of the Goldilocks principle that I mentioned early on. Clause 50 allows
the Secretary of State to issue a general consent, setting out the
circumstances in which the agency may dispose of land without seeking
specific consent. That general consent can address issues of wider
public benefit, including the need to obtain better value for money for
the public sector as a whole, as well as ensuring proper accounting and
reporting responsibilities, and compliance with state aid
rules.</div>
					<a name="08011632000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">A general
consent has been in place in respect of local authorities&#146;
disposals since 2003. That general consent allows local authorities to
dispose of land at less than the best consideration in some
circumstances. I reiterate to the Committee that my right hon. Friend
the Minister for Housing stated that we would wish to issue a similar
general consent for the homes and communities
agency.</div>

							<a name="08011632000354"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I am very grateful to my hon. Friend, and I do
not intend to push this much further. I appreciate his reassurance that
there will be a general consent, and am pleased to hear that, because I
myself had something to do with the general consent for local
government that was issued in 2003. It is right there should be a
parallel general consent for the HCA. It would help members of the
Committee if, when we consider clause 50, we could have some indication
of what the broad parameters of that general consent would be, how it
will compare with the existing local authority consent and whether
similar or different principles will apply.</div>

							<a name="08011632000355"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I reiterate the point that I made to my right hon.
Friend earlier, which is that he set a very important marker down and I
will certainly want to cover that in clause stand part debates. The
Goldilocks principle is an important one&#151;I like it so much I
have mentioned it three or four times. I think that under the system
outlined in the Bill, clause 10, in conjunction with clause 50,
provides the right balance between making sure that taxpayers have
assurance that the Secretary of State will be able to see what the best
consideration is so that they get value for money, and making sure that
the agency can fulfil its objectives.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>
					<a name="08011632000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point before I ask for
the amendment to be withdrawn is on what came out clearly from the oral
evidence sessions in December: the process of public agencies bidding
up land. I have sympathy here. That process makes sure that we do not
get good value for money, and I will address
that.</div>
					<a name="08011632000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
system operated by English Partnerships is the best approach to take: a
closed bid process. English Partnerships treats all bidders the same.
If two bidders can meet all the quality standards and satisfy the terms
of the brief&#151;do not forget what I said earlier about the
specifications of the bid, such as affordable housing or
whatever&#151;then English Partnerships will take the highest bid.
There are no bidding wars, because the tendering process is closed:
individual bids are not disclosed to other bidders and there is no
opportunity to make a revised
bid.</div>
					<a name="08011632000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
Goldilocks principle, I think that the current balance is the right
one. It satisfies value for money and making sure that the
agency&#146;s objectives are achieved. Therefore, I hope that my hon.

					<a name="08011632000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the Minister, I am sorry to say that I am not reassured by
his attempts to reassure us about the Government&#146;s approach on
clauses 10 and 50. I do not entirely follow the Goldilocks
principle&#151;I do not know if it is the principle of stealing the
baby&#146;s porridge or not. I fear that the Minister did not
entirely follow the scenario that I attempted to describe, which was
quite the opposite of the speculative principle. My scenario envisaged
giving the HCA the power to restrict the market for the potential sale
value of the land assets that it owned by restricting that land to
certain uses&#151;uses that would assist the HCA or be directed
towards the objects of the HCA. It might well dispose of land as a
result of obtaining planning permission, seeking and welcoming the
restrictions of section 106 agreements and itself applying a covenant
on the land in order to achieve a social objective. Only those who
could achieve the objectives would then be
competing&#151;through tender or other means&#151;to purchase that
land.</div>
					<a name="08011632000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words,
such land would not then be sold for expensive executive housing or, in
my part of the world, for second or holiday homes and other activities.
The HCA, which had owned the land, would restrict it and say that it
could be used only for social and low-cost rent
accommodation, meeting a local need. Achievement of that would be
written into the planning permission and the covenant. I will gladly
give way to the Minister, but my intervention sought clarity as to
whether the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>HCA would be entitled to do that routinely and still fall within the
Government&#146;s definition or interpretation of what was the best
consideration on the disposal of that
land.</div>

							<a name="08011632000359"></a>Mr.

						</b> Was not the point that I mentioned during my
contribution the absolute importance of the specification? Why is the
agency disposing of the land? It may be, as part of the specification
of the bid, that it would be that 90 per cent. of the land needs to be
on the basis of affordable housing. That is the way that it would go to
market. The important point is to set out at the start of the process
the whole specification that would provide the certainty required by
the
market.</div>

						</b> That is helpful. If now the Minister is saying on
the record that on every occasion where the HCA is disposing of land it
can set out that clear objective within the programme for its disposal,
then, as I described, I hope that the HCA can go further and ensure
that that is the outcome by achieving the necessary planning
permissions and attaching the necessary covenants to ensure that it is
ultimately delivered and not lost after disposal. I am not personally
reassured yet. This is an issue that I think we will come back to. It
is a big issue&#151;a challenge. It is an issue about the culture of
government and challenging the intervention of the Treasury in the
manner in which land such as this is disposed of. It has
bedevilled&#151;a term that I know a lot of those in local government
like to use&#151;a lot of efforts at local government level to
achieve social outcomes from these extremely valuable assets. I hope
that the Minister will have the opportunity to reflect upon the debate,
because I think and hope that we will have an opportunity to come back
to this, not only in the debate on clause 50, but during future stages

As the hon. Member for St. Ives indicated, we have not got what we
would like in the Bill. As we have a general consensus here and if we
know what we would like to seek, I would be keen to press the Minister
further and to press amendment No. 63 to a vote, if need

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000362"></a>Margaret
Moran:
						</b> I stress at the outset that I do not support
amendment No. 63 precisely because of the point that I made earlier.
One of the problems is that, where there is a presumption of referral
to the Secretary of State, it is a negative presumption. In other
words, the general pattern of life will be disposal at full market
value, with the exception going to the Secretary of State. What I am
concerned about is that, although we all agree on the excellent
objectives of the HCA and can will those objectives, we also have to
will the means to deliver them. I am forever a practical politician and
having also worked on the frontline of finance and development within
RSLs, I know the difficulties of delivering affordable social housing.
Of course, the new organisation will make a tremendous leap forward in
enabling us to achieve our objectives and the delivery targets.
However, as the right hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>Member for North-West Hampshire outlined eloquently,
the practical realities are that there are two options for RSLs. Either
the land is discounted at the outset and developed swiftly or the
subsidy&#151;in effect&#151;or grant goes in at a later stage. As I
know from my experience and from talking to RSLs in my constituency,
that the practical outcome is that, very often, unless RSLs act swiftly
to acquire the land, they are outbid by the private sector. Any delay
in the process leads to practical outcomes that are not what the
Minister wants to achieve. We all what to achieve the delivery targets
swiftly, but I fear that what is outlined in clause 10(1) will not
deliver the practical outcomes that we want as swiftly as we want and
could slow down the whole process. I absolutely agree with the hon.
Member for St. Ives about the need for clarity. We talk about
&#147;best value&#148;, &#147;best value for communities&#148;
and &#147;public benefit&#148; without clear definitions. We all
know that the Treasury likes in all things to have clarity and security
in numbers, but what we are talking about in the Bill is social value
and we have to be a lot clearer in the Bill as to what that means in
practical and outcome terms. We need a great deal more
clarity.</div>
					<a name="08011632000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
raised the issue of how often the Local Government Bill had been used
in the way the Minister described and further questions have been
raised as to how often the Secretary of State has used her powers to
override a market value decision, or had such a decision referred to
her. We need an evidence basis for this discussion, because we have a
lot of anecdotal evidence from people working on the front line to
suggest that those powers are used only in exceptional circumstances
and we could face a situation where the Minister&#146;s best
endeavours to speed delivery of more affordable homes could be thwarted
because of the problem of the exception
basis.</div>
				
					<a name="08011632000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take to heart the point that the Minister made about specifications on
disposal, but it is not how that would work in practical terms. I urge
him not only to come back to us on the two specific questions that were
raised, but to provide greater clarity as to how the proposal would
work in practice. That might provide the assurance we need. I agree
that if there is to be a debate regarding general consent&#151;as my
right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said, we need
to strike a balance that achieves absolute clarity&#151;when we
discuss clause 50, there will be a helpful opportunity to illuminate
some of the issues that have been raised. On that basis, I beg to ask

&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): I beg to move
amendment No. 97, in clause 10, page 4, line 40, at end
insert</div>
					<a name="08011650000004"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;subject to
consultation with landowners whose property borders the land under
consideration for
disposal.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08011632000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologise
for my delay in coming to Committee this morning, Mr. Gale.
I was in another room preparing for government, but I would, I am sure,
be ruled out of order if I justified myself further, although I
am tempted to do so. I tabled the amendment with my hon. Friend the
Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) to clarify certain
concerns.</div>
					<a name="08011632000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Harold
Macmillan said that at the heart of democracy lies dialogue, but that
it could only be made to work if one stopped people talking. We are
only on clause 10 after seven Committee sittings. At the current
rate of progress, I fear that we will finish our
consideration of the Bill on 31 January 2009 as long as we rush through
the schedules and new clauses. In an effort to hasten proceedings, I
will exercise a self-denying ordinance, and I hope that the Minister
can pr(c)cis his comments as well. That will help us to speed up,
and prevent us from abandoning the Bill in Committee at clause 25
which, at the current rate of progress, is where we will end
up.</div>
					<a name="08011632000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks to highlight landowners&#146; justifiable concern about the HCA
seeking to dispose of land without consultation when their land borders
the property under consideration. Would it not make sense to require
the HCA to enter into dialogue with bordering landowners, to ensure
that their views and concerns are taken into account? Without that
mandatory requirement, there is a risk that the HCA will ride roughshod
over local considerations and miss the sage advice of landowners who
may have a perspective on the land under consideration. They may also
wish to make useful proposals about how the land could be used in the
future. The amendment would require the HCA to do something that is not
just about being a good neighbour, but about being a good manager of
land. I should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s perspective, and I
hope that he will accept the amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011632000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000379"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I welcome the hon. Gentleman to the Committee. I
am slightly intrigued by the fact that he is preparing for government
on his own, but we will leave it there. Despite the fact that I like
him, I strongly reject the amendment, which would place the Homes and
Communities Agency under an obligation unlike that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>for any other landowner in England. It would require it to consult
neighbours before it could dispose of any land that it owns. The manner
in which it is phrased is not the right way to address these
concerns.</div>
					<a name="08011632000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I stress
again something that I have said in debates on earlier clauses? The way
to restrict land use&#151;and I imagine that that is what the hon.
Gentleman wants to do&#151;is through the planning system, not
through provisions requiring landowners to consult their neighbours on
the question of whom they sell their land to. If there are objections
to the intended use of a site and planning permission is required,
objections can properly be made at that point. If the requirement in
the amendment were imposed on the agency it would slow down any
progress the agency could possibly hope to make on any schemes that
involved the transfer of ownership, by whatever means, of that
land.</div>
					<a name="08011632000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would also be likely to limit the value that the agency could obtain
for any land that it wanted to sell, although best consideration would
still pertain, because if the concerns of neighbours were taken into
account, that would probably limit the number of prospective buyers who
could be considered and thus reduce competition for any particular
site. That would make it impossible for the agency to obtain the best
consideration for the land, irrespective of the wider community
benefits associated with schemes that we discussed in earlier
clauses.</div>
					<a name="08011632000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would therefore make an unnecessary imposition on the agency. It is
almost like requiring permission from one&#146;s neighbours to sell
one&#146;s house. It is not necessary, and it would slow progress
towards achieving our objectives of 3 million new homes by 2020. I have
set out my strong objection to the amendment, and I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw it.</div>
					<a name="08011632000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000380"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> To clarify the position, I was not preparing
for government on my own&#151;I was preparing for
government with the Cabinet, as it will be constituted after the next
general election. I am concerned that the Committee will still be
sitting then, but as I will be in government, I can table all my
amendments whatever way in hell I want.</div>
					<a name="08011632000301"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div>
					<a name="08011632000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
swiftly on to amendment No. 97, I accept that the Minister strongly
rejects it, but he does so for the wrong reasons. I am not trying to
restrict land use&#151;far from it. The HCA will, necessarily, be an
authority; it will probably operate at arm&#146;s length from many of
the communities in whose land it involves itself. I was simply seeking
to make sure that the HCA is sensitive to the considerations of
neighbours of land that it sells. The Minister re-emphasised the fact
that the only consideration in the HCA&#146;s eyes is financial use,
but it would have been nice if the Government recognised that being a
good neighbour sometimes requires taking other things into
consideration, if only to acknowledge that landowners of neighbouring
property can sometimes provide a perspective that is not self-evidently
apparent in the bald facts presented to the HCA by officials. I am
sorry that the Minister has taken such a robust position, but we will
consider what he said. We want to reserve the right to return to the
matter on Report, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08011632000383"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Broadly speaking, the procedure set out in
schedule 3 is not dissimilar to those found in other
pieces of legislation, and I draw to the
Committee&#146;s attention the Regional Development Agencies Act
1998, the Highways Act 1980 and the Town and Country Planning Act
1990.</div>
					<a name="08011632000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike the
comparable powers in those pieces of legislation, in the Bill as
drafted, there is no mandatory requirement for the Secretary of State
to be satisfied either that an alternative right of way has been, or
will be, provided, or that an alternative right of way is not
necessary, although it is likely that those are matters to which it is
reasonable to expect the Secretary of State to have regard when
deciding whether or not to make the order. Including a requirement for
the Secretary of State to be satisfied that one of the matters outlined
above does in fact apply before making any order to extinguish a public
right of way would make the provision far fairer in terms of natural
justice and bring it into line with comparable legislative
provisions.</div>
					<a name="08011632000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendment No. 19
allows the Secretary of State to make an order to extinguish a public
right of way over any land of the agency, provided that the statutory
procedure is followed first. It is not necessary to exclude land held
by the HCA for its own administrative purposes from that power. For
example, the agency may take office space in a building that forms part
of a larger development for which it is necessary to extinguish a
public right of way. The amendment effectively brings the provision in
the Bill into line with the provisions that apply to the Urban
Regeneration Agency under the 1993 Act. Although I am reluctant to
mention it following our earlier discussion, the amendment has a
modernised
wording.</div>
					<a name="08011632000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000384"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s explanation, but
I wish to raise a couple of matters in relation to schedule 3, largely
on behalf of the Campaign to Protect Rural England. The Minister has
probably seen a couple of representations by the CPRE, which said in
written evidence to the
Committee:</div>
					<a name="08011632000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are similarly concerned by provisions in the Bill that would give the
Secretary of State the power to extinguish public rights of way and
curtail &#145;further investigation&#146;, including a public
inquiry, if the Secretary of State considers he/she has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>&#145;sufficient information&#146; (Schedule 3, Part 2). The
implications of this clause need to be carefully examined to ensure the
legislative framework provides for a full investigation and public
inquiry to take place where necessary. These are essential to maintain
public accountability and transparency in decisions affecting
rights of
way.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011632000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is,
as we know, huge public interest when anything is considered that could
alter rights of way. The Ramblers Association believes as a matter of
principle that changes should not be made, and certainly not without a
public inquiry. It is keen to ensure that the greatest possible care is
taken in dealing with any legislation that might in any way conflict
with the right, hard won over many years, through public demonstration,
public trespass and Acts of Parliament, to ensure that people can
exercise rights of way.</div>
					<a name="08011632000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings me back to concerns
that have already been expressed and the need to ensure that, because
of the huge powers the agency is taking, there is no
constraint on the public&#146;s powers to make sure that the very
best and most open inquiry, procedure or public consideration takes
places. The provisions give the Secretary of State the greatest power.
There is no statutory right, as far as I can see, in schedule 3 to
inquiries. There is a duty to ensure that objectors have an opportunity
to appear . Paragraph (7)(3)(b) states that when the Secretary of State
is considering objectors&#146; opportunities to appear and be heard
he must ensure that that the HCA is present, as well as</div>
					<a name="08011632000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any other persons whom the
Secretary of State considers ought to be given the
opportunity.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011632000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">That does
not give those people the right to appear, as the Secretary of State
has to agree that they have an interest. The provision therefore puts a
large amount of power in the hands of the Secretary of State. She also
has the power hold a public inquiry. The measure may be modelled on
existing provisions but, because of the potential conflict of interest
in the agency&#146;s powers, the matter needs to be considered even
more carefully than it has been in the past.</div>
					<a name="08011632000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CPRE made an intervention,
too, regarding the powers to override easements, and it discussed the
importance of public land. It proposed an amendment, but it was not
included in amendment paper. However, I can express its sentiments in
this debate, as it concerns the use of powers in
clause 11 and schedule 3. The CPRE is interested in the
Government&#146;s view on the openness of proceedings dealing with
areas of outstanding natural beauty, national parks and the green belt.
The CPRE wanted to include in the Bill a</div>
					<a name="08011632000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requirement that in carrying out
its functions the HCA shall have regard to the desirability of
conserving the Green Belt and designated landscape, Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks and should ensure that
its plans and activities fully respect the purposes and objectives of
the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Park and Green Belt
designations in dealing with the extinguishment of rights of way and
the powers to override
easements.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011632000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be grateful if the Minister acknowledged the important powers
that the agency is taking. The combination of powers increases the
importance of doubling safeguards against conflicts of interest. It
would be helpful if he illustrated how those problems will be dealt
with, and provided guidance on the ordering of public inquiries and the
need to ensure that the relevant people have a right to appear to
plead their case.</div>

						</b> I have experience of the vexatious use of
historic rights of way in my constituency. On one occasion, ramblers
insisted on standing in a garden belonging to some of my constituents,
and watched them have a barbecue. They said that in the past there was
a right of way that led into a forest behind the garden. The problem
was resolved at the time simply because the ramblers got bored and went
home, but sometimes we need a greater defence of the rights of people
who have unwittingly found themselves subject to an attempted
enforcement by others of long-defunct rights of
way.</div>

&#214;pik:
						</b> I look forward to the Government&#146;s
perspective on the matter, and perhaps the Minister will comment in his
reply. I can see the case for the amendment, because sometimes rights
of way need to be handled in a common-sense way. The issue is the
all-pervading power of the HCA. I am sure the Minister will say that
his Administration are benign and will not misuse the power, but how
can he be sure that a future Government, perhaps with an ideological
objection to rights of way, will not take advantage of the amendment to
use the HCA&#146;s powers on a wholesale basis to close down rights
of way which, as has been pointed out, have been fought for long and
hard and could be snatched back in the blink of an
eye?</div>
					<a name="08011632000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000388"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I wish to raise a very small matter arising
from the extinguishing of rights of way, and I hope that it is
appropriate to raise it now rather than in a clause stand part
debate. It relates to mobile telecommunication masts or apparatus,
which are covered by paragraphs 11 to 15 of schedule 3. In the event of
an extinguishment of a right of way, it appears to be the rule that the
operator of an affected network mast can abandon their electronic
communications apparatus by serving notice to that effect on the HCA. I
do not expect many rights of way to be extinguished under the
provision, and I do not wish to conjure up a nightmare scenario of
masses of rusting, abandoned mobile telecommunication
masts. It is, however, possible that some masts will be abandoned, so
there is an inequity in the provision.</div>
					<a name="08011632000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">As drafted, the provision would
allow network operators who want to move their mast to another location
to recover from the HCA the cost of doing so under paragraph 14. If,
however, they simply abandon the mast and leave it to rust, there is no
provision for their meeting the cost of its removal.
According to paragraph 15, responsibility for such equipment
&#147;vests in the HCA&#148;. I suppose that the HCA will be
approached by aggrieved parties in the area worried about rusting
equipment that has been left behind, saying, &#147;You have now got
ownership, please remove it&#148;. There is no provision for the HCA
to recover the costs of removal from the operator, and I wonder why
that is the case. I do not expect the Minister to give an instant
reply, as it is a rather obscure point, but I would be grateful if he
wrote to me at a future date to reassure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>me that we will not end up with the HCA&#146;s budget being eroded by
the costs of disposing of unwanted, rusting telecommunication
masts.</div>

							<a name="08011632000389"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I enjoyed that debate, which usefully set out the
Committee&#146;s concerns. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich for his courtesy in accepting that I
may need to write to him about his concerns about electronic apparatus.
I do not wish to box myself in with regard to future correspondence on
the matter, but I imagine that the whole point of the extinguishment of
rights of way is that land is coming up for development, and such
issues would be part of the contractual arrangements. However, I am
grateful to my right hon. Friend for allowing me to write to him about
the specifics.</div>
					<a name="08011632000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
interested in what the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire said,
and he made some important points. It is true that the rights of
ramblers have been hard fought for, and it is right that we should
protect them as much as possible. The Government amendments strengthen
those rights, and the Bill offers a clear procedure for doing so. It is
very important that people have certainty and confidence in our
proposals. I am intrigued by what the hon. Gentleman said about public
inquiries, and I may have misunderstood him. I think that the procedure
in schedule 3 is entirely clear: the Secretary of State must publish
notices, there is a minimum period of 28 days and, crucially,
paragraphs (5) and (6) state that the Secretary of State is obliged to
consider any objection that is not withdrawn or otherwise
resolved.</div>

Secretary of State must, before making a final decision, give the

Secretary of State must cause a public local inquiry to be held in
relation to an objection to a proposal to make an order under paragraph
3 if the Secretary of State considers that the matters to which the
objection relates are such as to require investigation by such an
inquiry before the Secretary of State makes a final
decision.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011632000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, nothing has changed in respect of existing procedures there. If
anything, I am keen, by means of the Government amendments, to tighten
things still further; to make sure that alternative rights of way are
provided, and that the ability to be consulted and heard remain. So I
am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s sentiments, but I hope that
I have reassured him and that he can support the Government in

considered that any strengthening of the provisions might be necessary.
His answer is that he does not think that it is necessary, and clearly
at present there is no evidence to suggest that the powers would be
used improperly or that people would be left without an opportunity to
have an inquiry if they believed that there were strong circumstances
and&#151;objectively speaking&#151;if their view appeared to be
rather stronger and better founded than the Secretary of State&#146;s
decision. That is for the future. The Minister&#146;s position was
quite clear; he believes that the existing procedure will be
satisfactory, even with the new combination of powers that the agency
is taking. That is fine, I accept his position.

Paragraph 25 at the bottom of page 143 is entitled &#147;Power to
curtail decision-making process&#148;. How will the Minister ensure
that no future Minister will use this particular section of the
schedule to curtail the consultation process
unreasonably? As I understand it, this part of the schedule says that
the Secretary of State or the appropriate Minister can effectively
close down the investigation process when he is satisfied that enough
information is available before making a final decision. There does not
seem to be any insurance policy against pernicious

judicial review. As for the suggestion that a future Administration

into subsection (1)(a) so that it

					<a name="08011632000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
for the amendment is that I think that every Member of Parliament has
experienced the frustrations of local communities who
feel that social and geographical considerations&#151;particularly
social ones&#151;have not been taken into account when a development
is forced on them. Introducing the requirement for consideration will
enable local communities genuinely to feel that their concerns have
been heard. It should also be useful to the HCA and to the Secretary of
State because, on occasions, that kind of consideration might prevent a
social catastrophe or the misuse of ground because geographical
considerations have not been taken into account. Had such wording been
in place in the past, perhaps we would not have had so much development
on flood plains&#151;and we know the consequences of
that.</div>

						</b> I feel as if I am being unduly harsh on the hon.
Gentleman today, and I do not mean to be, but I have
to say that I was grateful to him for clarifying the amendment because
I was at a loss as to what it meant. Largely because of that
uncertainty, I do not think that the amendment adds any value to the
clause; it would merely serve as the beginning of a list of
things&#151;we are back to the list principle that we so enjoyed on
Thursday&#151;that the Secretary of State would need to take into
account when considering whether to exercise her designation powers
under clause 13. We have had many discussions, which I have enjoyed,
about the list principle. Placing in the Bill two matters that the
Secretary of State would have to take into account before an area could
be designated suggests the exclusion of other
considerations.</div>
					<a name="08011632000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the context of the Secretary of State&#146;s consideration of whether
to designate an area, I would suggest, with the greatest respect to the
hon. Gentleman, that a list is pointless. Each area will be set out in
a designation order made by the Secretary of State and, in deciding to
exercise that power, she will need to be satisfied that designating an
area and conferring local planning authority powers on the agency is
justified. The Secretary of State&#146;s decision would be open to
challenge in the courts, as well as being subject to parliamentary
scrutiny. She would need to demonstrate that her decision to designate
an area was
reasonable.</div>
					<a name="08011632000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, the amendment is not necessary and adds nothing to the
understanding of clause 13. I do apologise to the hon. Gentleman for
that wording. I hope that the Committee is content with what I have
said, and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No.

short and sweet&#151;I am certainly short. Amendments Nos. 20 and 21

Bill, which is currently being considered just down the
corridor.</div>
					<a name="08011632000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
8 of the Planning Bill makes provision for enforcement of development
control where a development is or forms part of a nationally
significant infrastructure project. Part 8 gives the local planning
authority various functions: right of entry, right to require
information, power to serve notice of unauthorised development and
power to apply for injunctions to stop continuing breaches of
development consent. Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 ensure that, where it is
proposed to confer local planning authority functions on the agency in
relation to a designated area, that could include functions under part
8.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000399"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> The principle concern about the clause and the
amendment is that, essentially, they set up a duplicate local planning
authority&#151;under the auspices of the Homes and Communities
Agency, with a whole pile of additional powers. The interesting thing
to consider is whether this is intended, as we suspect, to
railroad through higher numbers of housing
developments at a time or in a place where the local community perhaps
has perfectly reasonable and legitimate reasons for objecting, such as
local hospitals simultaneously closing or services being cut in other
ways, or at least not provided in terms of infrastructure. What makes
me curious about the clause and the amendments is that the Green Paper
alludes to all
this.</div>
					<a name="08011632000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the Green
Paper talks about applications being granted on appeal. With the use of
the power vested in the HCA under the clause, designation orders could
be used, in effect, to ram through the application. Another aspect of
the Green Paper&#151;surprisingly not carried through in the Bill,
the clause or the amendments&#151;was the suggestion that there would
be something of a carrot approach; that funding would be attributed to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>local authorities that were proactive in creating an over-supply of
housing. Yet I do not see any great move towards that
here.</div>
					<a name="08011632000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister
reassure us that, in using the designation orders, the powers of the
agency will not be used simply to override local authorities and that
the local authority will not be usurped by the HCA coming in with
greater planning powers than those of the local authority, sometimes
against the wishes of the local people, and riding roughshod over local
desires? The Minister and I have different views on how to produce the
increase in housing that we undoubtedly need in this country, and I
think that the clause and the amendments rather describe that
difference, which is all about top-down powers. If the local authority
is not doing it, then the HCA will, through designation orders. I would
be grateful for some reassurance that the intention of the amendments
is not further to augment the powers of the
HCA.</div>
					<a name="08011632000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000400"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> I, too, have a few concerns. It is appropriate to
try and flesh out what the Government intend. For example, in
docklands, I can easily see that there might be a need to go across
local authority boundaries, because those boundaries do not always
conform to a particular development area. I can also see that under
clause 13 the Secretary of State would have to consult, so no doubt we
would be aware of the local authority&#146;s views. A moment ago the
Minister talked about parliamentary scrutiny, so no doubt there would
be an opportunity for us to have some debate or argument about what is
proposed.</div>
					<a name="08011632000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first
concern is that the agency could end up both as a planning authority
and as a developer or involved with development. Local authorities have
to wear different hats, and the planning hat is sometimes different to
the development hat. Secondly, if a designation order is passed, is it
time-limited? While one may have a view about the time in which housing
and development need to be produced in a particular
area of a city or community, the default position
always ought to be that the local authority is the principal planning
authority. Is the objective of a designation order to achieve a
perceived objective over a period of time with an end, when the powers
will automatically be restored to a local borough or authority? It is
quite important that that is the case. When powers are conferred, in
effect, on a quango, and taken away from a democratic body, there
should be some kind of time
limitation.</div>
				
					<a name="08011632000303"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08011632000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another concern
is that the planning hat does require&#151;sometimes through section
106 agreements or through the Government&#146;s latest
proposals&#151;some degree of planning gain in respect of local
authorities. With some of these developments, the money no doubt will
be going in, rather than a great amount of money
being generated. Who would get the section 106
development money? Would it be the Housing Corporation or would there
be some means of sharing that money with the borough in which these
developments are going up?</div>
					<a name="08011632000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">In east London for example,
some boroughs are not that wealthy. If a particular corporation is
allowed to be the planning authority of an area, it would negotiate the
section 106 agreements. Who gets the cash? Could 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>it be remitted to the local authority for leisure,
recreation or other things, or would the money raised through section
106 agreements or by planning gain be spent specifically within the
geographical remit of the designation order? What would happen with any
moneys when the designation order ended, if there was an end date? If
the particular area designated is across two or three boroughs, what
arrangements will be made for some kind of financial sharing? Cash may
be generated that is necessary for schooling, leisure, recreation or
some other services within that area.</div>
					<a name="08011632000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would really like the
Minister to state whether the scheme is time-limited and what happens
to any money from planning gain. I am also curious to hear him give
some examples of where this might occur. I used the
example of the docklands development in east London,
where we had the enterprise zones. Could he give some indication of how
large this could be, or how small? I have not got a feel for whether we
are talking about small areas of several hectares in a key development
costing some hundreds of millions of pounds, or quite large areas. I
just do not understand what the Government want with this aspect of
clause 13.</div>

Member for Welwyn Hatfield said about railroading and riding roughshod
over local authorities. I have made it clear time and again that that
is simply not our approach. We want to make sure that local authorities
are stepping up to the plate. That is the whole purpose of the Homes
and Communities Agency. We are absolutely committed to working with and
supporting local authorities.</div>

&#214;pik:
						</b> I remind the Minister that although that may
not be his approach&#151;I take him at his word on that&#151;that
is not how we must test this legislation. How can he be sure that other
Governments and other Ministers, who may not take his benign approach
towards this issue and who may have a political agenda of their own,
will not abuse the legislation that we are introducing, including this
specific
amendment?</div>
					<a name="08011632000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000406"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> All that I can do at the moment is look at the
facts of what is going on now. For example, more than 70 local
authorities have volunteered to work with us on growth in the first
round of new growth points, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>and bids for a second round are now being considered. Taken together
with the growth areas, that means that some 200 local
authorities&#151;half of all local authorities in England&#151;will
be working with us on the growth agenda. The picture that the hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire paints of local authorities shutting
up shop and saying, &#147;We do not want to hear any of this&#148;
is simply not borne out by the evidence that we have seen on the
ground.</div>
					<a name="08011632000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
reiterate to the Committee that local authorities are very much the
repository of skills and expertise, particularly in their own local
circumstances. They have the means by which they can regenerate their
area; they are best placed to know what their area needs.</div>
					<a name="08011632000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some admittedly rare
cases&#151;I imagine that the whole Committee agrees with
this&#151;the regeneration challenge that some local authorities face
means that they will need additional help and support. That is the
purpose of clause 13. In such circumstances, the
Homes and Communities Agency will be there to take a more direct role.
The agency will play a part in that skills agenda&#151;in ensuring
that people have the required skills to step up to the plate and make
sure that homes and regeneration development is carried out in their
area.</div>
					<a name="08011632000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
earlier&#151;it is a recurring theme of mine&#151;that the new
agency has a unique position. It brings together land and investment
for the purposes of regenerating and developing areas for the benefit
of the wider community. In order to exploit that unique position and
the huge potential for development, we need to be able to give the
agency direct planning powers wherever appropriate. That is unlikely to
happen frequently, and in any case it is not a new
concept.</div>
					<a name="08011632000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
worth pointing out that the agency will have wide powers in relation to
regeneration, infrastructure, land acquisition and compulsory purchase;
we have mentioned those powers before and discussed them in earlier
clause stand part debates. In contrast, planning powers will only ever
be granted to the agency on a case-by-case basis and in relation to
defined localities. Each area will be set out in a designation order,
made by the Secretary of State, so she will need to be satisfied that
designating an area where the HCA can operate as the local planning
authority, rather than the existing council doing so, is demonstrated
and justified.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000407"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I still seek clarification on this issue, because
it seems to me that a local authority could carry out some sort of
consultation on, for example, building more homes, decide
that&#151;for a variety of reasons, including lack
of infrastructure and services&#151;it would be inappropriate in that
particular area, and then be overturned by the HCA coming in and simply
saying, &#147;Actually, we are not interested in that process. We now
have the designation order, which will have those 5,000, 10,000 or
20,000 homes built right there.&#148; Where are the safeguards in
this clause to prevent the local community from being
overridden?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000408"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> The Secretary of State is required to consult all
local authorities who have an interest within the area that it is
proposed to designate. I suggest that this whole designation issue
would be a long way down the process and, as I have said before, I
think that it would emerge only in very rare circumstances. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>came out in oral evidence sessions in December. The one
example&#151;there has been only one&#151;that we have regarding
English Partnerships is the Milton Keynes issue. I imagine that this
situation will be extremely rare, and there would be a long process.
The duty will be taken extremely seriously, because we understand that
these are extremely wide powers. Only following consultation with local
authorities would the Secretary of State consider whether to designate
the area and, crucially, if the area is designated, decide which
functions to confer on the agency in relation to that
area.</div>

there anything specific in the legislation, or is he planning anything
on Report, that would provide a double lock&#151;a security that is
more than simply a hope that Secretaries of State continue to be

						</b> Future Secretaries of State of a non-Labour
Government would be able to change the legislation as they saw fit, but
that is the case for all legislation. I am happy to work with
the hon. Gentleman to make sure that we have a Labour Government
indefinitely: that is in the best interests of the country. The
argument does not hold up, because a future Secretary of State
could override anything in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011632000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to reassurances, controls
and locks, it would be a long process that would be considered
extremely carefully. I reiterate, and I hope it does provide
reassurance, that the Secretary of State is required to consult all
local authorities that have an interest in the area. Following that
consultation, the Secretary of State would consider whether there was a
need to designate the area and, if so&#151;this is very
important&#151;what functions to confer on the agency in relation to
that area. As part of that, there would be a timing issue. The hon.
Member for Poole asked whether designation would be time-limited. An
example would be Milton Keynes, which is designated until 2016, and I
imagine that similar situations would
arise.</div>
					<a name="08011632000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000411"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for being as
helpful as he can in trying to sketch the circumstances in which these
powers might be used. He said that this was unlikely to happen
frequently and would happen only on a case-by-case basis. Are there any
areas at the moment where he is contemplating using these
powers?</div>
					<a name="08011632000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000412"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> No, there are not. As I have said before, we need
to be working in conjunction with local authorities to ensure that they
have the skills and expertise&#151;or that they are provided for them
by the agency&#151;to make sure that they can express their concerns,
and that they the relevant infrastructure and development in order to
achieve the ambition to have the relevant number of homes in their
area.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>
					<a name="08011632000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">To come to a blunt point, I
would like Members to consider the opportunity cost of all this. It
will involve an enormous amount of time, energy and effort
on the part of the HCA. It will not be doing this on an
everyday basis, because the opportunity cost of working in other areas
will be tremendous. It will have to consider the scope of this measure.
Given the massive investment in staffing resources and in making sure
that everything is carried out in conjunction with the appropriate
legislation, an enormous amount of time will be taken up within the
agency, from senior management downwards. It is in the agency&#146;s
interests, frankly, to work with local authorities in the spirit of
co-operation and partnership, rather than making sure they go down this
route. In real-world terms, the opportunity cost issue is incredibly
important.</div>
					<a name="08011632000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
operating in a vacuum. All planning decisions are subject to planning
laws and regulations on involvement, consultation and appeals, and
national and regional planning policies on decisions. The HCA will not
be riding roughshod over planning legislation, but will be operating
within the local development framework. The case-by-case basis is the
important point I want to push, as well as the opportunity cost.
Members have asked the scale on which the designation orders will be
given. I still think that this power will be used sparingly, and that
there will need to be extremely compelling cases. It is very important
that we consider in detail those particular controls. The Secretary of
State must consult every local authority that could be within the
designated area. We would expect to consult on the area to be
designated, and the powers to be conferred on the agency where that
power would be used.</div>
					<a name="08011632000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the designation order
must be made by statutory instrument and would be subject to the
negative resolution procedure in this
House.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000413"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> Apart from consulting local authorities where the
new planning authority would be, it is important to consult
neighbouring authorities because what happens may have a knock-on
effect. Someone may consult on an area of land across two east London
boroughs, for example, but may not include in that consultation a third
borough over the river, which may also be affected and may not wish the
project to go ahead. There must be much wider consultation, or
investment may be focused in one area while another is
neglected.</div>
					<a name="08011632000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000414"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
sentiment. The issue would be dealt with by the provision stating that
the Secretary of State would consult local authorities any part of
which is included within the designated area. The area to be designated
would also be considered as part of the broader
concept.</div>
					<a name="08011632000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of designating an area is to drive forward large and
complex regeneration or development projects. There would be little
point in doing that unless we equipped the agency with the requisite
powers to plan for and take forward that development. Clause 14
provides the framework for doing so and we will discuss it
later.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>
					<a name="08011632000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have reassured
hon. Members that the provision will be used sparingly because there
will be an opportunity cost in terms of the agency&#146;s resources.
Many controls will lie with the Secretary of State and the House in
considering matters, including those relating to local authorities and
designated areas.</div>

					<a name="08011632000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
23 ensures that some non-local planning authority
functions may be given to the agency concurrently with the existing
body&#151;for example, keeping registers of enforcement notices.
Amendments Nos. 24 and 29 highlight the general power later in the Bill
that would allow a designation order to a supplementary, incidental and
consequential provision.</div>
					<a name="08011632000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 25 adds section
330 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to the list of functions
that may be conferred upon the agency in relation to a designated area.
This function gives local authorities power to require information as

							<a name="08011632000418"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to
Government amendments Nos. 23 and 27, which are connected. Amendment
No. 23 refers to</div>
					<a name="08011632000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
functions concerned instead of, or concurrently with, other
persons&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>
					<a name="08011632000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister define who &#147;other
persons&#148; are in that context, as it seems to be missing from the
description? Government amendment No. 27 might reveal something of the
answer, to give him a helping hand. It refers to relevant functions of
London borough councils and the common council of the City of London. I
suspect that those might be the &#147;other persons&#148;
described.</div>
					<a name="08011632000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern
is that these proposals could set the HCA up in direct competition to
others, such as the London Development Agency and the Mayor of London.
That conflict could take many different forms including direct
competition. The end concern is that there could be delay and confusion
about who ultimately is responsible. We have good evidence that, when
that happens, it causes all kinds of problems. One has to look only as
far as the Thames Gateway to see the kind of mess, confusion and delay
that can occur when the lines of authority are not clear.
Perhaps the Minister could explain those two points. One is
about who the &#147;other persons&#148; are in Government amendment
No. 23 and the other is about Government amendment No. 27, which seems
to set up conflict. Is that a deliberate move? Is that the intention or
is it intended that the HCA take on additional powers and ride over the
responsibilities of the local
authorities?</div>
					<a name="08011632000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note
that in Sir Simon Milton&#146;s evidence to the sitting on 11
December he
says:</div>
					<a name="08011632000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
a suspicion on the part of some councils that the view will be that if
you do not deliver what the Government tell you to deliver on housing
numbers your planning powers will be removed and given to the HCA. That
would be completely unacceptable to local government as a
whole.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Housing and

					<a name="08011632000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition to that point,
Government amendment No. 27 also raises the question over the

how they will

&#214;pik:
						</b> Although I do not expect the Minister to
repeat the comments that he made in the previous debate, he can surely
see that this clause, the previous clause and the associated amendments
are connected. It seems to me that Government amendment No. 23 serves
to do exactly what the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield just highlighted
by creating a potential conflict and an opportunity to sidestep the
existing processes. I know the Minister&#146;s argument because he
made it in the previous discussion. I do not expect him to repeat it,
but I put on record my considerable concern that a malicious Minister
could easily use this power, with the amendments, to sidestep a local
authority and exert the will of Government on it, regardless of the
wishes of local
people.</div>

							<a name="08011632000422"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale. We now have the
HCA as a local planning authority. There will
presumably be a local planning committee to undertake that role. Who
will be appointed to that planning committee? I am interested to know
where the HCA will find its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>members. There will evidently be local councillors elected within a
designated area. Would they be used or people from outside? I would
like some indication of who will carry out the functions of the HCA
under the clause. When there is a planning committee, I presume that it
would be not the main board members who are appointed, but people at a
lower level. Under which standards body would they come if they had an
interest to declare or if there was the perception of something going
wrong? Would it be the local government standards body? I would like
more
detail.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000423"></a>Mr.

						</b> I hope that I can clarify things for the hon.
Gentleman. With regard to the points made by the hon. Member for Welwyn
Hatfield on Government amendments Nos. 23 and 27, my strong feeling is
that they work together, are complementary and not in conflict. The
persons referred to in Government amendment No. 23 are the bodies
listed under the relevant functions within Government amendment No. 27.
I hope that that is clear. I do not think that it raises conflict,
because Planning Acts impose functions on the local planning authority
and other bodies, which are listed in Government amendment No. 27. I
have mentioned the importance of the whole planning framework with
regard to what the agency does. The intention of the amendment is to
clarify which other persons those will be.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000424"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I want to ensure that we are absolutely clear.
Does that mean that Government amendment No. 23 refers to Government
amendment No. 27 and the persons are, specifically, the London
Development Agency, the Mayor of London and London
Councils?</div>
					<a name="08011632000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011632000425"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Yes, that is certainly my impression of the
Government amendments and I am more than happy to look to the skies to
seek inspiration. If there is anything on which I have misled the
Committee, I will certainly let them know in this afternoon&#146;s
session. I am looking to the skies, but they are very cloudy today and
I cannot see much when I look outside, so I shall come back to that if
I may.</div>
					<a name="08011632000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Poole asked some interesting questions about governance and
raised an incredibly important point about who would sit on the
relevant planning committees. My strong understanding is that board
members of the HCA would do so, along with co-opted outside members.
They are likely to be local councillors from the relevant areas. We
would expect the HCA board to establish suitable arrangements so that
the committees can accommodate such instances and address matters such
as good governance, good practice and the avoidance of conflict of
interest.</div>
					<a name="08011632000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 9
of schedule 1 provides for instances when employees or members of the
committee must disclose the nature of their involvement. The agency
will also have the ability to appoint people who are not employees or
members and to co-opt such bodies to such committees as they consider
appropriate. However, it is important to point out to the hon.
Gentleman that they must gain the Secretary of State&#146;s consent
in those circumstances, which will help to maintain integrity in all
external appointments. I think 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>that it shows the difficulty in this whole issue of planning designation
and how extremely rare that will be, and it goes back to the point that
I made earlier about opportunity costs and the resources of the
agency.</div>
					<a name="08011632000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is still
cloudy outside, so I suggest that I need to go and have a look, perhaps
in St. James&#146;s park, but I hope to be able to provide

						</b> The amendment is very much along the lines of some
of the issues that were raised this morning, particularly in relation
to clause 13, and relates to the extent to which the HCA will have to
consult with local authorities. We have heard what could be described
as a lot of warm words from the Minister about how the HCA, under the

of matters.</div>

The amendment

consultation must take place before the HCA acts. Again, that must be
seen in the context of a powerful new agency that has functions right
across the piece. Not only is it the planner, it can now effectively
