						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000304"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (John Healey):
						</b> I beg to
move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="08020686000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you back to the Chair, Sir John, for our latest, and perhaps
last, sitting. The purpose of the new clause is to allow regional
assemblies to work with regional development agencies on regional
planning issues during the period of transition towards a new set of
arrangements at a regional level, which we set out in July in the
sub-national review of economic development and regeneration. The
arrangements proposed in that plan will require separate, new primary
legislation, and we propose to consult as a step towards that before
long.</div>
					<a name="08020686000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause might be the subject of some misapprehension, so I shall start
in the negative by explaining what it will not do and what it is not
for. First, it will not allow regional planning powers to be
transferred to the regional development agency. If Parliament agrees to
such a transfer, it would be under the new legislation we propose and
certainly would not be until at least 2010. Secondly, it does not allow
the regional development agency to grab those powers because the
initiative remains with the national assembly as the regional planning
body. Thirdly, it does not undermine the regional assembly, which
remains responsible as the regional planning body for the regional
spatial strategy. Finally, it does not change the
exceptional&#151;some might say extreme&#151;circumstances in which
the Secretary of State may take regional planning functions back from a
regional assembly as the regional planning body, as was set out in the
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act
2004.</div>
					<a name="08020686000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it is important that the work that regional assemblies undertake as
regional planning bodies in their area is not undermined by a reduction
of capacity or a growing uncertainty over their future. That is
particularly relevant in trying to maintain the commitment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column683" />Column number: 683</div>that we set out in the housing Green Paper to earlier revisions of the
housing provisions in the regional spatial strategies.</div>
					<a name="08020686000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is designed to encourage what in some regions is already close
working between the regional assembly, the regional development agency,
local authorities and some of the other agencies and interests in the
region, and we want to allow regional development agencies to carry out
some of the regional assembly functions on their behalf where that is
wanted by the assembly and agreed by the agency.</div>
					<a name="08020686000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
there are limits on what regional development agencies can do in
relation to planning, and that is where the barrier that the new clause
is designed to overcome lies. For example, they cannot employ staff to
carry out or be involved in functions that are currently assigned to
regional assemblies. In some regions, such as the west midlands, the
regional assembly and the regional development agency are keen to
pursue early staff exchanges and do more on a joint basis. Therefore,
the new clause is designed to try to remove the problems and barriers
that are present in this period of temporary transition.</div>
					<a name="08020686000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
propose to transfer regional planning powers to the regional
development agencies in this new clause. We will not propose to
transfer those powers until we bring further, more comprehensive
legislation that we plan following consultation
shortly.</div>
					<a name="08020686000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that is helpful and I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

					<a name="08020686000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has made as good a fist as he can on this new clause 28, given that
Conservative Members are against this transfer of planning powers to
the RDAs. The parallel, I suppose, is our attempt to repeal the
Planning-gain Supplement (Preparations) Act 2007, because this paves
the way towards this transfer of powers to the
RDAs.</div>
					<a name="08020686000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is kind of the Minister to indicate that some of the RDAs are very keen
to take on the regional assemblies&#146; planning powers. As far as I
am aware local authorities would much prefer to take on these planning
powers and get rid of the RDAs, quite apart from getting rid of the
regional assemblies. I do not wish to advise my hon. Friends to support
this new
clause&#151;</div>

						</b> I am about to tell the hon. Lady, who does not
need reinforcing in any aspects of ignorance she might possess, that
the Conservatives would appear to be making a considerable U-turn. She
may have forgotten that they set up urban development corporations and
under the last Labour Government they were given planning powers. I
remember it very well because, although we had a Conservative Secretary
of State he agreed not to pass those on to urban development
corporations but to keep them with local government. It seems there is
a bit of a conversion going on here&#151;in
England.</div>

							<a name="08020686000312"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> Sir John, you are spoiling a jolly good
argument.</div>
					<a name="08020686000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition have been against the regional assemblies from their
inception and we believe that local authorities can carry out many of
the RDAs&#146; functions, certainly on planning and housing. We
should be moving towards that format for the transfer of powers not
giving further powers to the undemocratic RDAs. We are against their
housing powers, we are against their planning powers and we are against
the transfer of resources. In fact, one of our concerns is the lack of
reassurance that we have had from the Minister that the community
infrastructure levy will not be levied by RDAs, thereby reinforcing
their undemocratic and yet tax-raising nature. This may indeed be the
first
step&#151;</div>
					<a name="08020686000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000313"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> The hon. Lady seems to be making Conservative
policy up as she goes along this afternoon. I understand her position
to be that the Conservative party is not in favour of the regional
assemblies, is quite happy to see them go and does not believe that
their power should be transferred to the regional development agencies.
I think that her words were that some of what they do could be done by
local councils, which seems to imply that some of what they do would
not be done at local level. There would not be any regional bodies, so
presumably she is going to transfer the power up to national
government.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000314"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is having a jolly good try at
diverting attention from the purpose of this new clause brought forward
by his own Government which, of course, presages the end of regional
assemblies. Given that he was elected at several elections on the
retention of regional assemblies, the ground is shifting under his feet
as well.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000315"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> As we are into our 14th session of scrutiny on
this Bill, will the hon. Lady not accept that what she said a little
earlier was mistaken? There is no power in this Bill for an RDA to
raise the community infrastructure
levy.</div>
					<a name="08020686000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000316"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. It is time that we dealt with the new
clause rather than being lured into discussions about what may or may
not be the Conservative party&#146;s policies towards either regional
assemblies or RDAs.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column685" />Column number: 685</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000317"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I accept your guidance, Sir John. Perhaps we can
have some discussions in the corridors outside afterwards, or in other
forums. However, we come back to the fact that this new clause paves
the way for the RDAs to have planning powers that we do not believe the
RDAs should have. Moreover, the Minister mentioned that the Government
were expecting to have discussions on the transfer of those powers, but
the Local Government Association, in particular, is exceedingly
affronted about their taking place before discussion on the
consultation document has been completed. We are back to the lack of
consultation on the community infrastructure
levy.</div>
					<a name="08020686000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is inappropriate for this House to agree to the potential for
discussions between the regional assemblies and the RDAs under a
legislative framework before the final structure has been worked out
between the Local Government Association and the Government and indeed
others who have an interest in this area. I seem to remember that not
very long ago there was a bit of excitement when the Secretary of State
for Communities and Local Government signed a concordat with the leader
of the Local Government Association indicating that local government
initiatives should go forward only after consultation. The Local
Government Association does not believe that the new clause complies
with that concordat. We want to ensure that local government and the
local authorities are not excluded from their rightful place in
deciding where planning powers should go and what is appropriate for
the regional development authorities, which, in my view, with regard to
planning, is very little. As I understand it, many of the regional
development agencies would much prefer not to be involved in the
Government&#146;s top-down direction of planning and housing. These
powers should in fact be transferred to the local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08020686000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will draw my remarks to a close by saying that we are very unhappy
about the new clause. There has been insufficient time to think these
matters through in great detail as it has come forward so late, and we
will consider returning to it at a later
stage.</div>

Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): I welcome you back to the
Chair for this final session, Sir John, as others have already done. I
agree with much of what the hon. Member for Beckenham has just said,
but there is certainly a difference of opinion between our parties on
the potential for doing things at a regional level. I am sure we would
agree, however, that the Government&#146;s policy over the past 10
years has been a bit of a mess, and that any positives that might have
come from it have been lost and we are left flailing around, trying to
determine what the future should

way forward, at which point all sorts of organisations will express an
opinion, not least the local authorities, who lost a lot of their
planning influence when these matters were last addressed. Therefore,
to bring forward this new clause now is a little premature. Just
because an RDA is willing to work towards taking over some planning
responsibility, and just because a regional assembly has a very limited
life span anyway, does not necessarily mean that the policy is in line
with what the people of the region would like to see. Neither the RDAs
nor the regional assemblies as constituted are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column686" />Column number: 686</div>the most democratic of bodies, so for them to stitch up a deal between
them in a particular region is not necessarily putting an especially
good gloss on the way forward.</div>
					<a name="08020686000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
will have heard from organisations such as the wildlife trusts, who
have great concerns about what the RDAs are set up to do. They are set
up to deal with economic development matters, but planning is a much
wider issue. Sustainable development and environmental concerns come a
long way down their list of responsibilities and core functions. So to
transfer powers from a body that at least, while not democratically
elected in its current form, has a view to all sorts of policy issues,
and hand them over to a body that has an important but fairly limited
focus is not necessarily the right thing to
do.</div>
					<a name="08020686000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned that we could be moving into the territory that we
discussed earlier on with regard to the planning gains supplement when
we paved the way for something that might never happen. If it is not
likely to happen and we were later to have
legislation&#151;</div>

							<b class="B">Chris
Mole</b> (Ipswich) (Lab): Has the hon. Gentleman ever spoken
to a Liberal Democrat member of a regional assembly or a regional
development agency? I ask that because, having been a member of an RDA
and having now been joined in this House by an hon. Member for one of
the Croydon seats who is on the London Development Agency, I have
spoken to plenty of people who welcome the opportunity to be
accountable for their decisions. We must remember that a large
proportion of the regional assemblies are elected councillors
themselves and are designed to bring in other interests as well. So if
there is to be strategic planning, the hon. Gentleman needs to tell us
how he would do that if not in the way in which it is currently
done.</div>

							<a name="08020686000320"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> The Liberal Democrats believe that there is
scope for regions, where those regions are bottom-up, and where there
is agreement on what those regions should be. I am a somewhat parochial
Member of Parliament representing Cornwall, and there has never been
any consensus within the south-west region that it represents a natural
region. In an e-mail conversation with Councillor Chris White, with
whom the Committee is familiar, he said that he was concerned about
regional assembly staff and their future, which is a very touchy issue.
However, I fear that I am getting away from the issue at
hand.</div>
					<a name="08020686000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a paving measure for something that might not be needed. If we are
to have a proper consultation on the way forward, hopefully the ideas
that that will generate will lead to something that is more accountable
and fitting for the needs of sub-regional areas. Let us wait for that
and not add this clause to the
Bill.</div>
				
					<a name="08020686000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08020686000321"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): Having been told by
the Minister this morning that, unlike Sampson, I had actually gained
power by having my locks shorn, I would like to say my
pennyworth.</div>
					<a name="08020686000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The RDAs are
hugely variable. Some are known to be pretty grim. Yorkshire
Forward&#151;the one I have to deal with&#151;started off very
well. It had a very strong strategic focus, but a lot of that has been
dissipated in too many micro-actions as it has been asked to do too
many 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column687" />Column number: 687</div>things. That may be a general criticism. If I could make one
recommendation it would be for it to stop coming down to the House of
Commons to give enormously expensive tea parties at which three MPs and
sundry Peers from the House of Lords with nothing better to do turn up,
accompanied by a large number of their own staff. The RDA can much
better do it in Leeds, where it is based.</div>
					<a name="08020686000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister clarify what is going to happen? He said that new legislation
will ensure the formal transfer of planning powers to the RDAs. Fair
enough; that is clean. He said that the RDAs cannot
&#147;grab&#148; the powers. That is understood. However, where
does the boundary lie between the powers that the regional assembly may
decide to invite the RDA to take, and the formal powers with which they
will be endowed under the new legislation? That is not clear to me. To
what extent could the incremental transfer of competence amount to
something very close to a full exercise of powers in anticipation of
the legislation that will make that formal transfer? I do not like
messy legislation; we have got to ensure that we know where the
boundary lies.</div>
					<a name="08020686000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The RDAs are
not accountable. When the Government unveiled the sub-regional strategy
before the summer break, they said that with the regional assemblies
disappearing, mechanisms of accountability would have to be introduced
for the RDAs. However, we still do not know what those mechanisms of
accountability are going to be. At the moment, there is a vacuum. I
have asked the Minister on a number of occasions over the course of
these deliberations whether the Government are still intending to
establish regional Select Committees. Each time he has studiously
avoided referring to the question in his response, so I ask him again:
are the Government still intending to institute regional Select
Committees?</div>
					<a name="08020686000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
when the Government unveiled their sub-regional strategy, I was rather
enthusiastic about it. City regions have a great deal of potential. The
Leeds city region, in my part of the world, would incorporate what used
to be the old west riding part of the north riding and that would make
a great deal of sense. However, I would like the other instrument
engineered to that geometry. In other words, the regional development
agency would conform to the Leeds city region, just as if the south
Yorkshire cities&#151;and the Minister represents one of
them&#151;were to form their own city region, there would be a case
for them having the development agency functions. I would not wish to
create too much of a monolith in the RDAs if it makes sense later to
try to re-engineer the situation, if the idea of a city region takes
off.</div>
					<a name="08020686000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to do
some thinking about what the constitution of a city region might
be&#151;how would it actually work? The European Union, if I dare say
so, gives some good indication of how big countries and small countries
can get by with voting systems with which they can all live. However,
there is a lot of work to be done before we get to that stage.
Meanwhile, we should be a little cautious before we introduce what may
well be seen as pragmatic measures that would leave very untidy edges.
I would prefer to wait for the Minister to come forward with his formal
consultations and legislation to complete the transfer, whether or not
we think it is a good idea. If it is going to be carried out, I would
like it to be done cleanly so that I can see what is happening. We are
left with a very murky period in the middle of ill-defined 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column688" />Column number: 688</div>boundaries. I would like to have as many landing lights as possible on
the runway so that I know where I am
going.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000322"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Let me try to deal with the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s questions, because they were precise and direct,
although he did more generally welcome the direction of the
sub-national review, which goes well beyond the bounds of the new
clause. I welcome that, but will not dwell on it.</div>
					<a name="08020686000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s desire for clean-cut legislation.
That is why I am at pains to draw a distinction between what is
proposed in the new clause and what may follow in consultation to put
into practice the plan in the sub-national review, which will then be
legislated for. I shall try to answer his questions as directly and
clearly as I can. There is a distinction between what we want to see in
practice during the interim period and what the arrangements might be
after subsequent legislation. The first distinction concerns the
functions relating to planning which a regional assembly can choose to
delegate to a regional development agency. Future legislation might
assume or bestow planning powers on a regional development agency. The
sort of planning functions that the right hon. Gentleman and other hon.
Members are thinking about might include monitoring developments
against a particular plan, producing analytical reports to help develop
a plan and managing events as part of a planning process, such as
consultation events. Those functions are part of the planning
responsibility. However, the responsibility will remain with the
regional
assembly.</div>
					<a name="08020686000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question of assuming or bestowing planning powers on a regional
development agency would change the nature and the location of the
regional planning body by changing who or what it is. Under the new
clause, the regional planning body is and will remain the regional
assembly. In other words, responsibility for planning will remain with
the regional planning body, which is the regional assembly.
Responsibility for the regional spatial strategy, even though some
contributory functions may be delegated to the RDA, will remain with
the regional planning body, which is the regional assembly.
Responsibility for submitting the regional spatial strategy to the
Secretary of State for final approval will remain with the regional
planning body, which is the regional
assembly.</div>
					<a name="08020686000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause will promote a relatively modest change. I hope that it will
be regarded by members of the Committee as a pragmatic one.
Essentially, it will give RDAs the scope to play a part in the planning
activities and functions of their region. They will be able to benefit
the region in a way that they cannot at the moment because they are not
allowed to do so. For instance, they might be able to employ officers
related to functions that are not currently within their statute. That
is what the new clause is designed to do. It is not a Trojan horse that
will somehow subvert the proper process of consultation which we will
go through before making significant and separate subsequent
legislation. I hope that that explanation gives the cleanliness that
the right hon. Gentleman talked about. On that basis, I hope that hon.
Members accept the new
clause.</div>

another attempt to tidy up the statute book in relation to planning
issues. The new clause would remove from planning control the exemption
to repair war damage caused in the second world war and the completion
of basement works that were begun before 5 December 1968. I understand
why there was an exemption for war damaged buildings when the Town and
Country Planning Act was first introduced in 1947. We were keen to
repair the infrastructure, provide people with houses and buildings in
which they could work, and to generally repair the economy. However, as
I said when we discussed a similar issue, it is now more than 60 years
on. Have there been any planning applications to repair war damage in
the past 10 or 15 years under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990?
After 60 years, should there still be an exemption for second world war
damage? The only possibility of such an exemption being needed is that
in the process of developing a new building in or around 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column691" />Column number: 691</div>London or other big cities such as Coventry, an unexploded bomb is found

the state of the building above the basement. If the Minister can
explain why the provision is still on the statute book, I would have

to basements and whether they need development consent post-1968, I
must resist it, first, because it would not do what the hon. Lady hopes
it will and, secondly, because, as she rightly says, it will be better
to have clarity across the board in respect of developments and
basements. We will consult on the matter per se during the summer and
thus be able to provide more clarity about what is a permitted

						<a name="08020686000350"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): I will take just 30
seconds. I mentioned this earlier. My local authority calculates that
the cost of giving publicity to applications is around &#163;63,000
on an annual basis. Multiplied across England and Wales, the change
would save &#163;10 million in public money. It would be welcomed by
many small local authorities which are strapped for cash at the
moment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000351"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> New clause 14 would amend section 67 of the
Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 relating to
the publicity requirements for planning applications affecting the
setting of a listed building. The intention of the clause is to allow
local planning authorities to advertise such applications on the
internet rather than in local newspapers.</div>
					<a name="08020686000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 67(1)
of that Act provides that the Secretary of State may prescribe
publicity requirements for applications for planning permission in
cases where the local planning authority considers that the development
would affect the setting of a listed building. Regulation 5A of the
Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Regulations 1990 sets
out the specific publicity requirements for applications affecting the
setting of a listed building.</div>
					<a name="08020686000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The local
planning authority is required to publish in a local newspaper and on
site a notice indicating the nature of the development and naming a
place where the application and related documents can be inspected.
Where the local planning authority maintains a website for the purpose
of advertisement of applications, the notices must also state the
address of a website where the application and related documents may be
inspected. More and more authorities have these websites,  and
that is making and will continue to make a 
difference.</div>
					<a name="08020686000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
therefore no need to change the primary legislation in the way proposed
as the publicity requirements for applications affecting the setting of
listed buildings could be changed by amending the planning regulations
of 1990. We appreciate that, as the hon. Gentleman described, local
planning authorities incur costs from advertising planning applications
in local newspapers rather than on line. We will consider this issue as
part of the review and simplification of the General Development
Procedure Order 1995 referred to in the planning White Paper. I hope
that the hon. Lady will therefore withdraw the

time.</div>
					<a name="08020686000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause is fundamental and asks how far we are prepared to take
risks with public health resulting from new developments. My name sits
in solitary splendour on the new clause and I hope that I can persuade
hon. Members on both sides of the Committee to support it. It would
impose a duty on planners to consider health risks arising from
extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields. I am sure that all
members of the Committee know what those are, but if they would like
some help, the cross-party inquiry into childhood leukaemia provided a
very good definition in its paper published in July 2007. It
states:</div>
					<a name="08020686000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Both
electric fields and magnetic fields are created by the generation and
transmission of electricity. The term EMF is used to describe the
mixture of these fields to which people are exposed. Major sources of
EMF in our environment include High Voltage Overhead Transmission
Lines... electricity
substations&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020686000274"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08020686000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is growing evidence of an association&#151;I use that word
carefully&#151;between increased risks of childhood leukaemia and the
location of homes and schools. Childhood leukaemia is the most common
of all childhood cancers. There are 500 diagnoses a year and, while
survival rates are improving, its incidence has doubled since the
1970s. I would be the first to concede that there could be many factors
behind that, but there are certain milestones in the evidence that the
Committee should consider, and the Bill provides a good vehicle for
making radical changes.</div>
					<a name="08020686000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005, the
Draper report, which was a ground-breaking piece of research funded by
the Department of Health, found that children living within 200 m of
high-voltage power lines from birth had a 69 per cent. increased risk
of developing childhood leukaemia. That is nearly 70 per cent., which
is a very high number indeed. In 2005, in response to that report, the
Health Protection Agency set up the stakeholder advisory group on
extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields, which made
recommendations to the Government on practical, precautionary
measures.</div>
					<a name="08020686000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">My new clause
seeks, as a precautionary measure, to reduce the public&#146;s
exposure to EMF from sources such as high-voltage power lines. In April
last year, SAGE reported that a ban on building new homes or schools
within a specified distance of high-voltage lines was &#147;the best
available option&#148; for obtaining a significant reduction in
exposure to EMF from power lines. The cross-party group also defined
extremely low frequency EMFs as having a frequency of between 30 and
300 hertz, and that is in the new clause. The Health Protection 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column694" />Column number: 694</div>Agency has since recommended that the attention of local planning
departments should be drawn to that
evidence.</div>
					<a name="08020686000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
assisted by a report from the World Health Organisation, which reported
on the issue last year and made a number of recommendations. The first
of two main recommendations
stated:</div>
					<a name="08020686000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
changes to existing ELF sources are contemplated, ELF field reduction
should be considered alongside safety, reliability and economic
aspects.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020686000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
recommendation
suggested:</div>
					<a name="08020686000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Local
authorities should improve planning of ELF EMF-emitting facilities,
including better consultation between industry, local government, and
citizens when siting major ELF EMF-emitting
sources.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020686000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry to
burden the Committee with jargon, but we have a situation where the
Government are rightly shaping their opinion on the growing body of
evidence. It would be a mistake to have to revisit the issue at a later
stage when the Government will have to respond further to that growing
body of
opinion.</div>
					<a name="08020686000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of us in the room are parents, and some of us have become parents
recently. It is an extremely sensitive issue. It is hard to contemplate
the experience of a family when a child is diagnosed with childhood
leukaemia&#151;there is not only the suffering of the child, but the
fear and misery for the family. I do not want to play on the heart
strings of the Committee, but want to look in a completely
straightforward and scientific way at the direction in which the
science is moving. Concern is felt across the House, and early-day
motions 403 and 1784, which address the issue, have received 233 and
146 signatures respectively.</div>
					<a name="08020686000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I finish by
making two key points. First, the Government want to set national
policy statements that the infrastructure planning commission will have
to use when making decisions. There is an opportunity to include a
recognition of the association between electromagnetic fields and
childhood leukaemia, and to make applicants and the IPC recognise those
factors in national policy statements. Secondly, it is extremely
expensive to re-route a power line, and all relevant stakeholders in
the application, including the Government, should address that key
issue at the planning
stage.</div>

							<a name="08020686000354"></a>Chris
Mole:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman took great pains to assert that
he was going to use the term &#147;association&#148; and yet the
usual basis on which we make judgments is cause and effect. Cleary
there is no evidence of cause and effect that is demonstrable in
statistical terms because there can be relationships between two
measurable factors that are not necessarily causally linked but exist
in the same location for different reasons. That is why there has to be
a science that does not move; new evidence might be gained but there
has to be evidence of cause and effect before a decision to legislate
is
taken.</div>
					<a name="08020686000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000355"></a>Mr.
Benyon:
						</b> I refer the hon. Gentleman to the words of the
Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for
Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo). She is responsible for dealing with
that matter. She wrote to the charity Children with Leukaemia,
saying:</div>
					<a name="08020686000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
issue obviously needs serious thought and we will be in touch with you
once we have shaped our thinking in the light of all the advice that
has now emerged.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Housing
and Regeneration Public Bill Committee, </i>17 January 2008; c.
353.]</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column695" />Column number: 695</div>
					<a name="08020686000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear from that that the Government
recognise that there is a huge shift in the evidential basis for the
assertion that there may be an association. It ill behoves us to say
that there is no risk and that we should therefore just forget about
it. It is of fundamental importance and massive concern to families up
and down the country. The point is that if it can be included in the
national policy statements and be dealt with at the planning stage, it
does not have to be revisited later, when looking at re-routing,
burying power lines or moving an electricity sub-station. There is an
entirely practical cost element and an element based on emerging
evidence. In addition, the Government are rightly thinking in that
direction as well, all of which point towards including the new clause
in the
Bill.</div>

						<a name="08020686000356"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): I support the
new clause. The hon. Gentleman ought to be congratulated on tabling it
and on his arguments in favour of it. It is all very well talking about
cause and effect, but surely where public health is concerned
precautionary principles should take precedence over such balancing
acts. There is a body of scientific opinion in favour of that kind of
clause and he is right. If we take a precautionary line, we can avoid
further health risks and/or
costs.</div>
					<a name="08020686000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a perfectly proper new clause and should have been in the Bill all
along because we all know from our postbags how big a concern it is
whenever one of those power lines is proposed anywhere near a school,
for example. We are very busy bees at that time dealing with various
complaints and so on, all of which could be avoided. I fully support
the hon. Gentleman and I hope that the Minister will give the matter
further thought and perhaps come back with something that might
accommodate people&#146;s
concerns.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000357"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Newbury on both
his interest and his ingenuity in tabling the new clause. It is similar
to one that was floated in the Bill on the Homes and Communities Agency
just over 10 days ago. The serious point&#151;and I am sincere in
this&#151;is that he is part of a significant all-party push behind a
concern to have a more firm science base, which as my hon. Friend the
Member for Ipswich says needs to be more clearly established, and to
see a suitably stronger Government policy response. He has given that
process a significant shove.</div>
					<a name="08020686000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman talks about the risk from extremely low frequency electric
and magnetic fields. I am advised, for ease of reference, to call those
fields ELF EMFs, which I will. The hon. Gentleman is right that the
main sources of those fields is power lines, but ELF EMFs are also
emitted by electricity sub-stations, household wiring and electrical
appliances around the house. They are by no means confined to the
situation that concerns him.</div>
					<a name="08020686000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman touched on this, but guidelines are in place. The Health
Protection Agency has, with additional advice, looked at how those
should be beefed up. It has provided that advice to Government, and, as
he said, we are rightly shaping our opinion on that at the moment. We
need to do that, but legislating in advance of coming to a conclusion
about understanding the extent of the risk and, therefore, what is
necessary is a little premature.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column696" />Column number: 696</div>
					<a name="08020686000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">One point of
comfort to the hon. Gentleman is that we are clear, and ministerial
colleagues have made clear, that any precautionary measures that we
conclude are going to be required as a result of the concern and the
potential risk of ELF EMFs will be implemented at the national level.
Therefore, the specific duty that he wants to put on the infrastructure
planning commission is probably not the right way to proceed and is
probably jumping the gun. However, as I said, he has given the debate
an important shove and helped to raise its profile.
</div>
					<a name="08020686000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the response that the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool
(Mr. Wright), gave on the Housing and Regeneration Bill
about 10 days ago when the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood
(Mr. Hurd) moved a similar new clause, as the junior
Minister with responsibility for housing and planning, he agreed to
meet the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. I do not believe that that
meeting has taken place yet and the hon. Member for Newbury may wish to
join it. That seems a sensible way of bringing those two interests
together. He may also wish to know that my right hon. Friend the
Minister of State, Department of Health, whom he quoted, is due also to
see my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate), who chaired
the all-party parliamentary inquiry into these things, which also gave
significant support to the impetus. On that basis, I hope that he does
not feel that he needs to press his new clause to a Division. Again, I
pay tribute to the way in which he raised the issue in
Committee.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks.
Right from the outset, however, I should say that I should not be
congratulated. The wonderful organisation Children with Leukaemia is
excellent at bringing to the attention of hon. Members on both sides of
the House the devastating affects of that illness, the science that
relates to it and the experts&#146; direction of travel. I take the
Minister&#146;s point that there may be other opportunities to raise
the subject. My co-conspirator, to whom he referred, is my hon. Friend
the Member for Ruislip-Northwood. He was on that cross-party inquiry,
chaired by the hon. Member for Dartford. If I can tag along with him to
meet the Minister, I will.</div>

which we can make progress on this and continue the path of travel

new clause deals with third-party right of appeal. This is by no means
the first time that it has been raised. It was raised by a few Members
on Second Reading, not least the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr.

also referred to it.</div>
					<a name="08020686000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
a source of mystification and some frustration to constituents who come
to us following the granting of planning permission on a particular

the Member can overrule the local planning authority and change the
judgment, and they are unhappy to discover that that is not the case.

judicial review is the only course that could overturn a planning

that a planning committee may have got it wrong and may have overlooked
a factor is the same in both circumstances. There is a difference of
opportunity, therefore, between those who are seeking to pursue a
scheme and those who are seeking to object to it. We have already
discussed the fact that the infrastructure planning commission will
take away bigger schemes from local authorities, albeit many that would
have gone to the Secretary of State anyway through the planning
inspectorate. It would be a good message to those who feel that local
democracy is being undermined that there is the opportunity for their
voice to be strengthened through the planning process by way of a
third-party right of appeal.</div>
					<a name="08020686000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
expecting the Minister to jump on this straight away and say,
&#147;Yes, of course I accept it,&#148; but it would be interesting
to hear the Government&#146;s current thinking on this and whether
there are any limited circumstances within which they think this might
be re-examined. There are many groups who have been consulting with all
Members of the Committee over this Bill and who will be submitting
evidence who feel that there is scope for some form of third-party
right of appeal. It must not be designed to gum up the planning
process. It should be seen as an attempt to ensure that there is a
level playing field, so that those people who have legitimate
objections to a scheme are not forced to consider judicial review as
the only means of addressing their concerns. I hope that the Minister
will say something about what might be done for people in that
position.</div>

							<a name="08020686000360"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I support the new clause. As the hon. Gentleman
says, it is not the first time that the issue has been discussed here.
Of course, in any planning application, more often than not there is a
disappointed person who might wish to object. There is a class of
professional objectors&#151;let us not forget about those dear
people. However, if somebody, a neighbour for example, is badly
affected by a planning decision, it is entirely reasonable for there to
be a third-party right of appeal where there is a prima facie case for
that.</div>
					<a name="08020686000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is right. We all have all met people in our surgeries who
say, &#147;They have big-gun lawyers from various places to do this,
that and the next thing for them. I was listened to, but I am not sure
whether they followed my argument, and anyway it was dismissed. Now, I
have this potential bad property being built next door to me. It has
devalued my property and made my life miserable. Why can I not
appeal?&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020686000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not a far-fetched notion, since the new clause contains a sort of
gateway for sorting out the wheat from the chaff. I should also flag up
that in several other jurisdictions not too far from here, it works
very happily. Think of the model in Ireland, where they have a
third-party right of appeal. It is not overused or misused, but it is
there if necessary. To say, as we heard earlier, that the only route
for challenge for a neighbour or an aggrieved person must be through a
judicial review, is no comfort at all. I speak as a
barrister&#151;judicial review is an expensive process. It must be
undertaken within a defined period by specialist counsel, who do not
come cheap. Importantly, the decision must come within what are called
the Wednesbury principles: the planning board or authority must have
acted unreasonably, and to prove that is a very narrow
gateway.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column699" />Column number: 699</div>
					<a name="08020686000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be blunt,
for most people there is no redress at all, and the new clause is
designed to put in the Bill a form of redress for people who are
genuinely aggrieved and affected. It is highly reasonable, and looking
at other jurisdictions&#151;I know a little about the Irish
system&#151;it is not overused but is there when necessary. I fully
support the new clause, and will listen with interest to what the
Minister has to say.</div>
					<a name="08020686000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000361"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> The hon. Members for North Cornwall and for
Meirionnydd Nant Conwy make the counter-argument as well as the
argument, by pointing out that there is no clear way of doing this in
terms of third parties. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy
mentioned professional objectors, and how to get around them. It is
true that we have a different role and different rights for applicants
and third parties. The hon. Gentlemen have hit the nail on head in
terms of the dangers and problems relating to third parties that get in
the way and block very good and positive developments that could make a
difference in local communities.</div>
					<a name="08020686000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to remember the discussion that we had on part 9, when we
talked about the democratic accountability of the system through
elected councillors. Those councillors represent their communities.
They must take into account the views of local people on planning
matters before decisions are made, and justify those decisions
subsequently to their electorate. I do not think we should
underestimate the importance of that. Although the hon. Member for
North Cornwall says it would be nice to have this third-party right of
appeal, he himself gets across the fact that it would be very difficult
to do it without having issues with professional objectors and people
who will delay a process for a significant
period.</div>
					<a name="08020686000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000362"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> The Minister spoke a moment or two ago about the
role of councillors. There is a problem with that, as well. If, for
example, a development was seen to be for the greater good, and
Mr. A came along and said, &#147;Well, it might be for the
greater good, but it will ruin my property,&#148; it would be
difficult for a councillor to represent the views of that individual.
More importantly, there should be a process at arm&#146;s length from
the councillor and the procedure where a person can legitimately take
their claim if it qualifies. Regarding vexatious appeals, there is in
the new clause a procedure for separating the wheat from the
chaff.</div>
					<a name="08020686000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000363"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> This goes back to a point about the role of
councillors made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South
and Penarth at an earlier stage in Committee. The hon. Member for
Meirionnydd Nant Conwy himself was quite right when he said that in
this process there will always be people who are aggrieved and people
who are not aggrieved. However warm our words and our minds are now, I
cannot change that. There are other important aspects. Anyone who is
concerned about the handling of a planning matter can always go to a
local authority&#146;s monitoring officer. There is also the
ombudsman process, which they can use without having to have expensive
barristers. While taking on board the concerns raised by the hon.
Member for North Cornwall, I am afraid I must disagree with him, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column700" />Column number: 700</div>and I hope, for the reasons that both he and I have outlined, that he
will consider withdrawing the
motion.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000364"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> It is, in a way, unfortunate that we are talking
about &#147;third-party&#148; rights of appeal, which implies
someone wandering past, somewhat removed from the decision. Actually,
we are dealing with people whose lives could be very much affected by
what goes on. I have listened very carefully to the Minister, but we
need to make the distinction between a third-party right of
appeal&#151;I am using the phrase myself&#151;and a third-party
right of veto, which is not what we are talking about.</div>
					<a name="08020686000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
seemed to imply that this would be a process where objectors could halt
development. In fact, it would simply be a way for them to delay
development, although, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy
said, there is provision in the new clause for the Secretary of State
to dismiss appeals made with the sole intention of delaying. It would
in no way give objectors a right of veto. It would merely level the
playing field in terms of developers&#146; rights, although in saying
that I am at risk of straying into a later new clause about playing
fields. If it is the case, with regard to accountability, that
councillors should have the final say and that there should not be a
right of appeal, why is there a right of appeal for developers over the
heads of local councillors? That is, in a way, a circular
argument.</div>
					<a name="08020686000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister also talks about appeals to the ombudsman. The ombudsman can
look into something and say that the council was perhaps a little bit
naughty, or behaved poorly, and say, &#147;Yes, you have been treated
badly, here is &#163;50 or &#163;100 or an apology from the
council,&#148; but that will not change the planning application at
all. People may feel vindicated, but that does not change the problem
they had in the first place. The ombudsman will not be able to overturn
the decisions; only judicial review can do
that.</div>

					<a name="08020686000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not convinced by the Minister&#146;s arguments. I appreciate that
this is a contentious and difficult issue, but as we heard from the
hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, other countries have looked at
it and come up with systems that work. I will not press the new clause
to a vote, but I hope that the Government have listened to the
arguments. I know that there are feelings across the House about this,
and whether we return to it at a later stage of the Bill remains to be
seen. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div>

interesting part of our deliberations, in that all hon. Members now
have the opportunity to look at other aspects of planning that were not
at the heart of the earlier areas of the Bill. This could be our only
opportunity to debate them for several years to come, so there are a
number of issues that we want to raise.</div>
					<a name="08020686000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause provides the opportunity to get the Government&#146;s stated
policy into the Bill. The Government have a long-standing commitment to
look at these issues and protect playing fields. There are two problems
with the current regulations. First, there is a five-year limit, so if
somewhere has not been used as a playing field for five years it is not
covered. Secondly, there is a premium with regard to size of 0.4, which
the new clause would change to 0.2. I understand that Sport England has
made this point, and the Government have said that it will be
addressed.</div>
					<a name="08020686000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) has been quite
assiduous in pursuing Ministers on this over some time. In response to
his parliamentary question last July, the Under-Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Hartlepool
(Mr. Wright)
said:</div>
					<a name="08020686000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this will be
reflected in the consultation paper on the review of statutory

					<a name="08020686000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nothing had come by the
time we approached the end of the year, so there was a further question
from my hon. Friend in January, and this time the same

confidence.</div>
					<a name="08020686000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have up to 850 cases of development occurring on playing fields each
year, so this is a matter of some urgency. The Government have already
said that they wish to protect playing fields. By accepting the new
clause, which would increase the period to 20 years and address the
issue of the size of the fields, they would be able to solve this
problem. I hope that the Minister will be feeling generous on this
occasion.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000366"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing
the issue of playing fields to our attention. He mentioned some cases,
but we have no clear evidence of this being a widespread
problem&#151;I will talk a little more about that in a moment. The
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington is, I hope, aware of our
position on this, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool wrote to
him as recently as 15 January.</div>
					<a name="08020686000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the first element of new clause 24 is entirely unnecessary, as PPG
17 in its entirety already provides the necessary protection. Even if
the land is no longer a playing field&#151;in other words, the
five-year period that is currently set has expired&#151;the land will
still receive protection as open space under PPG 17, which is
important. Ministerial colleagues have agreed that officials should
meet Sport England to discuss this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column702" />Column number: 702</div>matter further, which they will. If change is needed, it can be achieved
by amending secondary legislation, rather than the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08020686000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the second element that he raised, the hon. Gentleman will be aware of
the parliamentary answer that my hon. Friend gave the hon. Member for
Bath on 15 January. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman mentioned
this part of his answer, but I will quote from it. My hon. Friend
said:</div>
					<a name="08020686000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are committed to reducing the threshold for statutory consultation on
the sale of playing fields from 0.4 hectares to 0.2
hectares&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 15 January 2008; Vol.
470, c. 1168W.]</div>
					<a name="08020686000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">It sounds like a
reduction in this case is a good thing. This topic will be included in
the consultation paper in the review of statutory consultees to be
published in due course. We hope to introduce amendments to the Town
and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995
following the
consultation.</div>
					<a name="08020686000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured that we are actively pursuing
both topics that he raised. I invite him to withdraw the motion and
will undertake to write to him about the Sport England
process.</div>
					<a name="08020686000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000367"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> The Minister made it clear that the Government
are considering this issue very closely. However, there are Government
figures that show how many applications are made each year. As I have
said, there are 850 based on the latest Government figures. Sport
England said that about 50 of those constituted a significant threat to
playing fields. While I am grateful to hear that the Government are
continuing to pursue action on this matter, the longer they delay, the
fewer playing fields there will be to protect. It is therefore
important that action is taken as soon as
possible.</div>
					<a name="08020686000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
I was trying to illustrate with the changing answers that my hon.
Friend the Member for Bath received to his questions between July last
year and January this year was that at one point the Government were
talking about introducing something by the end of last year, and now
they are talking about its happening &#147;in due course&#148;. I
am glad that it will happen, but when it will happen is the
question.</div>
					<a name="08020686000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not seek to press the motion, but I would like to add one other
point. As I understand it, the protection is quite closely drafted to
cover sports pitches and specifies a number of particular sports. There
may well be pressure on play areas used by younger children. For some
reason, the local authority might have decided to withdraw or not to
maintain the play equipment. Those are not sports pitches as such, but
they are important amenities for young children and their parents. As
part of the consultation, I would like the Government to look at that
issue as well, to see whether the provision can include those important
play areas. It is very common in new developments to have a play area
as the area of green space, under section 106 agreements. It is very
important to protect those areas. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div>

						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="08020686000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause deals with a subject very close to my heart, and I know that
it is close the hearts of a number of hon. Members across the House who
are experiencing problems with the unsustainable increase in second
homes in their constituencies. The issue that most applies to me, as a
local Member of Parliament, in terms of use class orders, is that of
second homes. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and
Lonsdale (Tim Farron) would say the same. There are also related issues
that the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) has raised
with regard to &#147;studentification&#148;. A number of other hon.
Members are working with her on that issue in urban areas where there
is great pressure on local housing stock from the growing student
population.</div>
					<a name="08020686000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would give local authorities the power not to create use
class orders of their own accord, but to work with the Secretary of
State to see whether they could be used as part of a solution to a
particular local problem. As the hon. Member for Beckenham has said in
the past, the drafting of Opposition proposals may not be entirely
watertight, so I am looking for anything that the Government can offer
in terms of an intention to re-examine this
issue.</div>
					<a name="08020686000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
matter has been raised in a number of reports. My hon. Friend the
Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor) is working with the
Government at the moment on affordable rural housing. Elinor Goodman's
commission, which reported a while ago, mentioned the potential for
using planning powers to restrict the growth in the number of second
homes. I have debated this issue in the past when speaking on housing
for the Liberal Democrats. At that point, the Member for Beckenham
raised concerns about seeking to control the market through use class
orders and said that people had a right to own second homes. I am not
seeking to restrict people's rights in that regard, but we have to take
account of the fact that there are areas where a particular class of
property, which is not currently defined within a use class order, is
distorting the local housing market or the local environment in some
way.</div>
					<a name="08020686000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall illustrate my point by mentioning the population statistics on
Cornwall, which has seen a lot of development over the past few
decades. The population of Cornwall 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column704" />Column number: 704</div>has grown a great deal, which is recognised among other things by its
getting six Members of Parliament, not five, at the next general
election. However, closer examination shows that the population in some
parishes is declining. Housing is being built in those areas&#151;for
example, Padstow, which has become famous because of a certain resident
and his culinary expertise, has had development&#151;but the overall
population statistics show a decline. That is because there is a
growing number of second homes. At the moment, although there may be
tax issues to consider in respect of increasing the burden on a second
home owner, that is not a disincentive to someone who has the financial
wherewithal to have one. So the historic centres of towns and villages
are increasingly deserted in terms of local residents. That situation
is not sustainable. It has a knock-on effect on local schools and local
services, particularly out of the holiday season. A number of coastal
communities in Cornwall&#151;and, increasingly, inland
communities&#151;are being affected in this
way.</div>
					<a name="08020686000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elinor
Goodman's report talks about examining use class orders as a way of
distinguishing between a second home and a home that is being used as a
full-time residence. There is great merit in pursuing that. I therefore
seek some assurance from the Minister that that suggestion is not being
entirely discounted and that it will be examined for the future. I do
not believe that just looking at tax alternatives will solve this
problem. We can continue building affordable housing and increasing
development, but if the housing market continues to be distorted by the
bias towards second homes in some areas, we will not save those
communities for the  future. I hope that the Minister has some
good news for
me.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000369"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I support the new clause. This is another matter
that has exercised hon. Members in the House for some time. I
introduced a ten-minute Bill 10 years ago, proposing exactly the same
thing. The Government are now concentrating on affordable homes. I am
afraid that second homes pose a great difficulty, because where there
is a preponderance of them we find that villages are dying, local
amenities are being cut and basic services, such as local schools, post
offices, village shops and garages, for example, are fast disappearing.
I fully support what the hon. Member  for North Cornwall is
trying to do with the new 
clause.</div>
					<a name="08020686000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem of rural depopulation was recognised by the House not so long
ago, when we legislated to allow rate relief for rural retailers. That
was welcome, but it is not enough, because the second homes factor
exacerbates existing problems. They are socially divisive, as they are
empty for most of the year and are therefore of little benefit to the
community. They do not assist the viability of village retailers,
because their occupants are only there for a few weeks or months of the
year. They also bring with them social problems. The usual scenario is
that second homes are purchased by those who can afford them&#151;the
owners often earn salaries that are many times more than the average
salary of those in the local community, and they are able to pay the
asking price without quibble&#151;while locals are left in the wake,
wondering when, if ever, they will be able to enter the property market
and buy a house in their own community, very often in an area in which
they were born and brought up.</div>

					<a name="08020686000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is evident in villages in Kent, the Cotswolds, Somerset,
Cumbria, Cornwall and throughout the UK. In Wales, the problem has an
added dimension, because it directly dilutes the indigenous culture and
language, which is of great concern to all those who hold them dear. My
answer is that there should be a use class order for a property that is
not occupied throughout the year. The local planning authority could
decide, for example, what percentage of such homes is viable in any
given community. It would be unwise, if not silly, to legislate for a
certain figure throughout Britain, because that clearly would make no
sense. There are some seaside towns that, for the past century, have
had a huge number of second homes, which they have been coping with
reasonably well. However, some rural villages are dying because of the
preponderance of second homes. That is not just the view of the hon.
Member for North Cornwall and myself. Many hon. Members throughout the
House are coming to that view now.</div>
					<a name="08020686000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Select
Committee on Welsh Affairs reported back in 1994 that redefining the
use class order is one tool that could be used to assist in delivering
affordable housing in rural areas. It is tragic to see villages dying
on their feet and, worse still, youngsters being unable to live in the
villages in which they were born and brought up. Such an order is not
the absolute answer&#151;I am not saying that if such a move was
accepted by Government, all affordable home problems would disappear;
that is absolute nonsense&#151;but it would be a great step forward.
I remember when the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon was a
Minister in the Department of the Environment. He was persuaded of the
efficacy of such an order in helping to create more affordable homes.
Unfortunately, there was further deliberation in Cabinet and the
measure did not go forward. Therefore, the suggestion is not an
eccentricity of the hon. Member for North Cornwall and his fellow Celt
from Wales. It is a real problem, and this is a real answer. It is not
the ultimate single answer, but it would assist the Government in their
stated intention of providing affordable homes for
all.</div>

Dhanda:
						</b> I can promise the hon. Gentleman that it was long
before I became an MP. I am very sympathetic to the arguments of both
hon. Gentlemen, but I disagree with the use of use class orders,
because they are not the right vehicle or tool to achieve what they are
talking about for their communities. The principal issue in
categorising land for use class orders is whether there is a material
change in the use of land between one use and another, which we do not
get in the same way with second homes. There is nothing to distinguish
a first home and a second home in that
respect.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000373"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> The point has been made to me before. However, I
believe that there is a clear distinction between a house that is being
used as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column706" />Column number: 706</div>home and a house that is being used as a temporary luxury for people to
stay in. In fact, it has been regular practice for local authorities in
some areas to grant permission for a building to be occupied only for
holiday use, and not as a residence. This is just turning that round. I
am focusing on second homes here, but there may be wider applications
in other circumstances for local areas where a use class order could be
part of the solution. Second homes are just the example I am
giving.</div>
					<a name="08020686000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000374"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> That is useful, but use class orders are about
what distinguishes properties in planning terms. That is the
difference. Local authorities may well keep registers, and there may be
differences between first homes and second homes&#151;the question of
where people pay tax, and so on. In planning terms, however, they are
not distinguishable. For example, a Woolworths and a WH Smith are in
the same class in planning terms, whereas fast food restaurants are in
a different class. That is a fundamental difference.</div>
					<a name="08020686000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do look at
use class orders, consult with local authorities and make changes.
Although I am sympathetic to what the hon. Members are saying about
their communities, with regard to planning&#151;which is what the new
clause, the clause and indeed the Bill are about&#151;first homes and
second homes are indistinguishable. That is why I must say to the hon.
Gentleman that the new clause is not
relevant.</div>

							<a name="08020686000375"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I am disappointed by that response, though not
entirely surprised, as I have heard it before. I was, however, present
at a debate in Westminster Hall in which the Secretary of State for
Innovation, Universities and Skills spoke about the issue of
studentification, to which I referred
earlier.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000376"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> As I understand it, in planning terms, my right
hon. Friend is right, because there is a definition of houses in
multiple occupation. We are going to do more work later in the year
around defining use class orders to do with houses in multiple
occupation. That will not, however, remedy the problem with
distinguishing between first homes and second homes, by which I assume
he means wealthy people who live in one part of the country and have a
holiday home
elsewhere.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000377"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> During the debate to which I referred, we
discussed the issue of different uses within the residential category.
I am intrigued by the idea that there is a bigger difference between an
HMO and a house being used for full-time residency&#151;which may
both be used full-time&#151;than between those and a home that is not
being used as a residence but as a place where people can stay from
time to time. This requires further examination.</div>
					<a name="08020686000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy made an excellent contribution
describing in some detail the soul-destroying effects of second homes
on local communities. There may be other categories of which I am
unaware, in commercial application and so on, where planning
regulations and use class orders have not kept up with the way society
has changed. I believe there is potential for local application, in
consultation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column707" />Column number: 707</div>with the Secretary of State, by piloting these sorts of things, which
can solve local problems, in local areas. As this is something I
believe in very passionately, I seek to test the Committee&#146;s

					<a name="08020686000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I feel that I
might be making myself unpopular with hon. Members who have pressing
business elsewhere. However, there is an important aspect that we have
not addressed thoroughly enough, and it is the second issue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column708" />Column number: 708</div>about which constituents often come to us: enforcement. We go through a
lengthy process of planning applications and negotiation to confirm
what a developer must do to stay within the boundaries of what the
local authority wants to impose. Again, we find that some of those
aspects are not complied with. It is brave of a local authority to
proceed with enforcement, because all too often enforcement does not
take place.</div>
					<a name="08020686000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
delay the Committee a great deal, but this measure would provide an
opportunity to hold local authorities to account for the conditions
that they impose. If enforcement is genuine, it gives more value to the
planning process. If we are to have any faith in the system, we must
take account not only of what happens in the run-up to the approval of
a planning application, but also of what happens afterwards in ensuring
that those who make the development do so within the boundaries that
have been set.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020686000390"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> Local planning authorities are already advised to
have an enforcement policy statement. The details are set out in
chapter 1 of the Department&#146;s publication, &#147;Enforcing
Planning Control: Good Practice Guide for Local Planning
Authorities&#148;. The enforcement policy statement includes almost
all the requirements of the proposed enforcement charter in new clause
26. The policy statement sets out the authority&#146;s policy for
taking enforcement action. It gives details of the procedures for
dealing with any complaints about enforcement action and it will be
reviewed and published every year.</div>
					<a name="08020686000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State gives guidance to local planning authorities in the good
practice guide and in enforcement circular 10/97. That is being
revised, and we expect to consult on a new draft circular later in the
year&#151;I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will look out for it and
may want to have some input. What is not covered in the enforcement
policy statement, but would be in the enforcement charter, is an
obligation on members of the public to inform the authority about a
breach of planning control or to make a complaint about enforcement
action, in a specified manner. That is the weakness of the new clause.
We consider it less bureaucratic to allow members of the public to
bring any breaches of planning control to the attention of their local
planning authority by whatever means they happen to choose. We also
consider that they should be able to complain to the local planning
authority in their own way. Therefore, the new clause is unnecessary.
Enforcement policy statements are the best means of publishing local
planning authorities&#146; enforcement procedures and
practices.</div>

Rogerson:
						</b> A continuing theme among constituents who come
to me with enforcement problems is that they feel that they are doing
the council&#146;s job for them, in checking whether something is
being built within legal bounds. Local authority resources are part of
the problem. Constituents think that local authorities should have
greater resources to check whether laws are being followed, rather than
relying on people who are not technical experts. When those people
examine a development, they may spot that a window, for example, was
not quite where it was meant to be, or that a wall was slightly higher
or went out further than originally stated.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column709" />Column number: 709</div>

pleased to hear that the Government continue to look at that matter and
are introducing further guidelines to encourage local authorities to
take it seriously. The problem is that often local authorities do take
it seriously, but risk a cost in taking an enforcement action against
someone, which is, therefore, a disincentive for them to do so. Some
matters certainly bear further consideration and I am glad to hear that
the Government are doing that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

Healey:
						</b> On a point of order, Sir John. I thank you and
your co-Chair, Mr. Illsley, for keeping us on the straight
and narrow during these proceedings,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column711" />Column number: 711</div>and for setting the tone for our deliberations, which  has been
productive, efficient and generally
good-humoured.</div>
					<a name="08020686000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also thank the Clerks, who have provided great advice to you, Sir John,
and to all hon. Members. I would like to thank the <i class="I">Hansard</i>
reporters, who are part of the essential underpinning of the work that
we do. I thank the Doorkeepers too, for keeping the keys
turning&#151;but not too often&#151;during Divisions. I thank the
officials who have given such good support to me and my fellow
Ministers. I particularly appreciate their work and the extent to which
they have allowed me to honour my commitment to the Committee, at the
outset, to ensure that new clauses and amendments would be tabled in
good time. I pay tribute to the interest groups that have followed our
proceedings, including those that gave
evidence.</div>
					<a name="08020686000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is true that this Committee was not the hottest ticket in town, and
that the Whips and the other Departments suddenly found it much easier
to recruit to other Committees. They sidled up to people and said,
&#147;If you do not do this for me, you&#146;ll be on the Planning
Bill.&#148; Attendance has been strong on both sides of the Committee
and the active involvement in our proceedings has been good. It has
improved our deliberations, including in the evidence session, which I,
like you, Sir John, and the hon. Member for Beckenham experienced for
the first time. We got there in the end, although I have to say that
the procedural points that came before we started taking evidence in
that first sitting were akin to a ward Labour party meeting in their
extent and complexity.</div>
					<a name="08020686000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also pay
tribute to and thank my colleagues as part of the ministerial team.
They have done a great job. I greatly value their support and think
that our deliberations were much the better for having Ministers from
more than one Department.</div>
					<a name="08020686000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
Opposition, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy speaks from his
Front Bench and his Back Bench simultaneously, but I guess he is used
to that, and he has done a good job. The hon. Member for North Cornwall
has had to do the same; he was largely on his own during the course of
the Bill. He took us all aback when he talked about the fun that he
used to have in planning inquiries. That gave us all a fresh
perspective on the subject, and perhaps a fresh perspective on him as
well.</div>
					<a name="08020686000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the team of three on the Conservative Front Bench, I am sorry that
the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is not in his place, but we
enjoyed the teamwork. Sometimes they divided the clauses up between
them, sometimes two had a go, and sometimes the third weighed in as
well. My best moment was when the hon. Gentleman was on his feet, just
getting into his stride on applications to the infrastructure planning
commission under part 5, and the hon. Member for Beckenham kept
intervening on him, not to say actually cross-examining him. He was
just getting going when she jumped up and said, &#147;What is the
definition of a project?&#148; and sat down again. Had she done that
to me, I would have been flummoxed, but he handled it with the great
aplomb one would expect from a
lawyer.</div>
					<a name="08020686000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
the best Committees, in my experience, develop a language or a
leitmotif of their own, and we were privileged when the Under-Secretary
of State for Transport talked about modelling in one of our sessions
and then promptly returned to the Committee, slightly chastened, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column712" />Column number: 712</div>having been privy to the precise world of the traffic engineers and what
&#147;modelling&#148; really meant and had to correct our
understanding.</div>
					<a name="08020686000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth introduced
the word &#147;traffication&#148;, which even those precise traffic
engineers in the Department for Transport have probably never dreamed
of, but I dare say we will find it appearing in the Department for
Transport&#146;s next Bill. I give the Committee my undertaking that
it will not appear in this Bill while I am in charge of
it.</div>
					<a name="08020686000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Committee for its work on this stage of the Bill and look forward to
our deliberations continuing in such a productive, constructive and
good-humoured
way.</div>

							<a name="08020686000393"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Sir John. May I add
my thanks on behalf of my team to you and your co-Chairman for allowing
us a fairly lenient ride on many occasions? I will not be critical at
this stage about how the Bill is constructed, but we were grateful to
you that we could put our comments and amendments into context. That
was much appreciated. I am grateful also to the Clerks, who went above
and beyond the call of duty. We were greatly helped by their skill and
ability.</div>
					<a name="08020686000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also add my
thanks to <i class="I">Hansard</i>. I had an interesting exchange involving
<i class="I">Hansard</i>
						<i class="I">. </i>The right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth and myself came to the conclusion it was a score draw, and the
accuracy of the reporting led us to that conclusion. Thank goodness for
the Doorkeepers. I have lost count of how many litres of water I have
drunk, and I am hugely grateful for their help.</div>
					<a name="08020686000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
also to the team, who contributed nobly. It is because I knew that my
hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst could cope that I
gave him such a hard task. I would not do it to many others. I am
grateful to everybody for the part that they played in ensuring that,
as far as possible, we made as many comments, amendments and points as
we could to improve the Bill. We tried to make it a Bill that we could
support, but it is somewhat like the curate&#146;s egg at the moment,
good in parts.</div>
					<a name="08020686000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
also to hon. Members from the other parties. I am sorry that we could
not always vote with the hon. Member for North Cornwall, but then,
without playing tit-for-tat, there was also a time when he could not
support us. We appreciate the part they played, contributing to the
general good humour and co-operation that, as an Opposition
collectively, we were able to put forward.</div>
					<a name="08020686000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
interesting to work opposite the Government team. It is quite difficult
when there are so few of us against massive numbers. We look forward to
reversing the situation in due course, probably sooner than they may
like. However, it was good that we had helpful contributions from so
many Labour Members. In fact, we often came up with similar ideas, few
of which got us very far, but we tried.</div>
					<a name="08020686000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">It just
remains for me to thank everybody for such a good-humoured Committee,
which, with a bit of luck, we will be able to finish in time so that
the Whips, who were so agitated to begin with about whether we would
deliver the Bill on time, can be reassured that when we say we can
deliver a Bill on time, we will deliver it.</div>

Rogerson:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Further to that point of order, Sir John.
I would like to thank you and Mr. Illsley for keeping us
under control and steering us back in the direction of the Bill on
occasions when we might have been ranging off it. That is indicative of
the subject matter: planning touches on so many other fields.</div>
					<a name="08020686000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Clerk and his colleagues in the Public Bill Office for their late-night
advice when I was seeking to table amendments. Although I have sat on
other Public Bill Committees, this is the first time I have led for my
party, so it was a bit of a learning curve. Having been appointed over
Christmas to be shadow spokesman on the Department of Communities and
Local Government, it was quite a quick arrival into dealing with the
subject matter.</div>
					<a name="08020686000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
an enjoyable experience. I thank <i class="I">Hansard</i>
						<i class="I">,</i>
						<i class="I"> </i>the
Doorkeepers and officials, some of whom I met in the run-up to the Bill
while trying to clarify some points. That was particularly useful. It
may not have led me to agree with the Government, but at least I knew
what they were saying. It was interesting to see that the ministerial
team had a different style each time a different set of clauses was
reached, and the collective involvement made the whole process more
enjoyable.</div>
					<a name="08020686000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has also
been a pleasure to work with other Opposition Members. Sometimes we
agreed and sometimes we did not, but if we agreed all the time it would
be worrying to our colleagues elsewhere. It was probably reassuring
that we did disagree on some key areas. I agree with the hon. Lady that
parts of the Bill still give cause for concern, and I look forward to
addressing those at a later stage.</div>

							<a name="08020686000395"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Sir John. It would
be churlish of me not to take part in this holy alliance&#151;these
valedictories. It has been a genuinely interesting Bill. I nearly said
&#147;a great pleasure,&#148; but I do not want to exaggerate. We
have engaged fully with the subject, and Ministers have done their best
to answer questions. Although there was a bit of a falling out earlier,
generally speaking it was a well-mannered Committee. I thank you, Sir
John, and Mr Illsley, and the other Front-Bench spokesmen.</div>
					<a name="08020686000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
probably in the same condition as when we started, but we have had
lengthy debates where necessary, which has to be a good thing. I think
we have examined as much as we can. It might be that these matters will
be returned to in another place; I know not. It has been an interesting
experience and I thank everyone involved.</div>

							<a name="08020686000396"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I will pass on hon. Members&#146; kind words
to my co-Chairman, Mr. Illsley. I did not need any
persuasion to act as Chairman for this Bill, since it relates to my own
past professional career, although I am not still in practice. As far
as I am concerned, it is a very interesting Bill and there were
occasions when I had to restrain myself from intervening, but I am
pleased that I managed to avoid doing that.</div>
					<a name="08020686000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been a
very good natured Committee and the innovation in taking evidence was
beneficial. It worked very well&#151;indeed, much better than I had
expected. Having said all that, I thank hon. Members for their kind
words.</div>
