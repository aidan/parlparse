(this day) again proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061028000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061028000429"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): I am grateful to the
Minister for giving way over such an extended period. We were talking
about the different dates: 1 July and 1 January. The Minister had
linked the two issues of the treatment of dividends and the debt cap. I
wondered why the dates had not been coterminous. The subsequent point
about 1 July is that this will come into effect before the Bill is
enacted. If we get past that date and the Government call a general
election, where does that leave people? Is it law or
not?</div><a name="09061028000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000430"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> Welcome back, Mr. Hood. I can reassure
the hon. Gentleman that I do not expect that that will happen. But the
Bill will not become law until it secures Royal Assent. He asked why we
do not have the same date for the implementation of dividend exemption
and the new debt cap requirement. It was the original intention, but in
our discussions with businesses there was a strong sense that it would
be helpful if there was a period between the two. They will undoubtedly
want to make some changes and introducing the six months between the
two gives a period of grace that enables them to do that. That has been
widely welcomed. It is one of the improvements that we have made as a
result of the consultation over the last few
months.</div><a name="09061028000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was answering a number of questions raised by the hon. Member for
Fareham about the thinking behind the changes that we have made. As he
said, there would have been a number of ways to tackle the issue that
we are dealing with in the schedule. In terms of moving towards a
territorial tax system, one view would be that as a matter of
principle, interest to fund foreign equity investment should not be
relieved when the dividends from those investments are exempt. Taking
that view would suggest that dividend exemption should be accompanied
by strict interest allocation or a limitation of interest for outward
investment.</div>
<a name="09061028000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Either of
those would have a very big impact on multinational companies,
particularly on UK-headed groups. We discussed them both with
businesses. Both  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>were disliked, particularly interest allocation and the associated
complexity and administrative burden that accompanies it, as has been
found in the operation of that arrangement in the United States.
Companies were very keen that we should not go down that road. So the
debt cap measure is a less far-reaching but principled measure to
accompany dividend
exemption.</div><a name="09061028000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman suggested that another way might have been to tighten
the thin capitalisation rules. That is where, typically, a UK
subsidiary of a foreign multinational is funded with too little share
capital and too much debt, thereby attracting a higher tax allowance
than would otherwise be the case. That is countered at the moment using
the UK transfer pricing rules which adjust the profits of a company
that is thinly capitalised to reflect the profits it would have made if
it had been capitalised in accordance with the arm&#146;s length
principle. A tightening of the UK rules to counter cases where there is
excessive debt in the UK would mean abandoning the arm&#146;s length
principle. Instead we could have looked to counter thin capitalisation
using different rules, but the alternative methods would have an impact
on many more cases than the debt cap measure does.</div>
<a name="09061028000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the end,
we concluded that this is a principled and effective approach that
deals with the problem. It is a clear principle. It is readily
understood. In December, following the pre-Budget report, we issued
draft legislation on the foreign profits package, so that people could
see our intentions. There were concerns and lots of discussions
arose.</div><a name="09061028000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the beginning of April, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs
published a technical note setting out current thinking on the debt cap
with high level design changes, which have been welcomed. When the
Finance Bill was published at the end of April, large parts of the debt
cap legislation had been revised, but there were areas that required
more time to ensure that the proposals were appropriate, so they were
not in the Bill. There have been further discussions with interested
parties since then. That is the background to the Government amendments
to schedule 15.</div>
<a name="09061028000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham&#146;s final question was about the gateways for
outbound investors for UK-headed groups. He is right; we had hoped to
have more than one gateway to keep administrative burdens on business
as small and as light as possible. He anticipated part of my answer:
throughout the package, as I have mentioned, we have had to take
European Union legal requirements into account, and consequently we
could only make one gateway available. However, the improvements to the
debt cap design, particularly the switch from net debt to gross debt,
exclude more groups from the debt cap anyway. Other changes reduce the
administrative burden on any group that has to comply with the
rules.</div>
<a name="09061028000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061028000431"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): Is there a workaround that
HMRC could introduce? As I said in my remarks, a purely UK company
would still have to work out whether it passed the gateway test even
though it had no overseas parent or overseas
external debt. Is there guidance? I hate asking for HMRC
guidance and I argued against it last year. Is there a
pragmatic solution that would say that a UK-only group need not go
through the calculations set out in the gateway
test?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div><a name="09061028000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000432"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We have taken steps to reduce to a minimum the
administrative burden that any group will have to assume to meet the
requirements. Certainly, we are open to doing what we can to help. I do
not want to give the impression that there will not be an
administrative burden; there clearly will be, but we have taken the
steps that we can to keep it to a
minimum.</div><a name="09061028000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000433"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> To be clear, is the Minister saying that if it were
not for EU regulations, things would be better, more efficient and less
bureaucratic for British companies?</div>
<a name="09061028000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000434"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> No, that is not what I was saying. I am aware that
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party is heading rapidly to the outer
extremes of the European Parliament. That is not a sensible or wise
view. It is important that the arrangements are safe from challenge
under European law, which these are. We have designed them carefully
with that in mind.</div>
<a name="09061028000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000435"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I do not want to extend the debate unnecessarily,
but a philosophical point arises from the discussion that we have had
on the previous clause and schedule and from other aspects of Finance
Bills in recent years. The Marks and Spencer case, for example, was
another case in which EU law about freedom of movement and freedom of
establishment principles came into play. Have the Government looked
more broadly at how aspects of UK tax law need to be reformed to take
into account the growing trend of businesses to consider opportunities
to arbitrage UK tax and the broader principles underpinning EU laws
generally?</div><a name="09061028000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000436"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> No, there is no general review going on, although
we increasingly have to take account of issues that might be raised by
European law when we design our legislation, as we have in this
case.</div><a name="09061028000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going
back to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about a light touch for UK
companies, there could be a danger of that kind because it appeared
that UK companies and EU companies were treated differently. We might
have run into difficulties on that and we need to ensure that we do
not. As he may have been suggesting, from time to time, issues that are
raised by court decisions require us to look again at features of the
legislation.</div><a name="09061028000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have satisfied the Committee that the clause is an
appropriate measure to sit alongside the dividend exemption that we
debated before lunch and I commend it to the Committee.</div>

<a name="09061028000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000439"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> In my remarks a few moments ago, I indicated the
background to this series of Government amendments. I apologise to you,
Mr. Hood, and to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>Committee, because I will need to take a little time to explain what is
happening and the reasons for the
measures.</div><a name="09061028000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debt cap principle is simple in concept, as we discussed. It requires
comparison of the interest and other finance expense payable in the UK
by a group&#146;s net interest-paying companies, which is referred to
as the tested expense, with the consolidated gross finance expense
payable by the worldwide group, which is referred to as the available
amount. When the tested expense amount exceeds the available amount,
the excess is disallowed for tax purposes. If other UK group companies
have net interest receipts, the equivalent amount of those receipts
becomes non-taxable, to prevent, effectively, double
taxation.</div><a name="09061028000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation is targeted at abuse of generous UK rules on deductibility
of interest by multinational businesses. For that reason, it applies
only to large businesses and companies for which the net interest
expense exceeds &#163;500,000, so many companies will not need to
consider the debt cap legislation at all.</div>
<a name="09061028000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debt cap
can apply to both inbound and outbound investors, but it can also count
as exploitation of the interest relief rules when upstream loans are
made to the UK parent by its subsidiaries. Not all upstream loans are
offensive, as we were saying before lunch, but some are tax-driven,
with the interest payment removing profits from the scope of UK
taxation and with the interest receipt arising in a company where it is
effectively either not taxed or taxed at a low rate.</div>
<a name="09061028000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation contains a number of exclusions which, taken with the other
changes that we have made, ensure that the debt cap is carefully
targeted. I will go into some of those in more detail, but I shall
first list them. First, the financial services exclusion recognises
that the different role of debt in financial groups is being introduced
by amending the Bill. Secondly, there is a group treasury exclusion,
which applies where group companies lend money to a UK group treasury
company and that company then lends on the money at profit. Thirdly,
there is a short-term debt exclusion, which recognises that short-term
upstream loans are not likely to be tax-driven but are made to enable
groups to manage their short-term cash position better, for example by
allowing a group to operate a cash pooling arrangement to reduce
banking costs.</div>
<a name="09061028000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly,
there are exclusions for companies within the ring-fenced oil regime,
the shipping tonnage tax regime and the real estate investment trust
regime, as the regimes already address the taxation of those
activities. Finally, there are exclusions to deal with payments of
finance expense by trading subsidiaries to their UK parent where that
is a charity or some other exempt
body.</div><a name="09061028000380"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="09061028000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
of the exclusions deserve a bit more explanation. The financial
services exclusion applies when substantially all of a group&#146;s
income or the income of UK members of the group derives from a
particular financial services activity. Banks, for example, borrow at
interest so they can lend to their customers, and it would be
inappropriate to apply the debt cap to them. As I said in my letter of
30 April, the financial services exclusion was not included in the Bill
at publication, as we wanted more time to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div>ensure that our proposals were effective and discuss them with those
affected. The exclusion is now being introduced by way of Government
amendments.</div><a name="09061028000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
group treasury exclusion is appropriate because in cases where group
companies provide internal lending facilities for other members of the
group and manage cash pooling arrangements on behalf of the group, the
facilities provided by the group treasury company generate UK-taxable
profits rather than removing profits from the scope of UK taxation. The
exclusion is therefore
appropriate.</div><a name="09061028000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
15, as we were discussing, includes a gateway test. If it is satisfied,
a group need not consider the application of the debt cap rules any
further for the accounting period concerned. I should mention in
passing that the legislation requires anti-avoidance rules to deter
companies from entering into or being party to schemes that seek to
prevent the operation of the debt cap. The rules were not included in
the Bill on publication, again so that we could have more time for
discussion. They, too, are now being introduced by way of Government
amendments.</div><a name="09061028000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier,
we discussed the implementation date for the debt cap. As I said, after
discussions with business, the debt cap legislation will apply to
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010. I should make
that point clear: it applies to accounting periods starting on or after
that date. That means that we have removed the need for companies to
apportion the results of an accounting period, as would be required if
the debt cap legislation simply applied with effect from a particular
date. If it applied from 1 January 2010, any accounting period
straddling that date would require apportionment, which would be
complicated. We have avoided that difficulty. The implementation date
also provides an interval following the introduction of dividend
exemption that enables groups to pay up dividends and then unwind
upstream loans, and it allows businesses time to become familiar with
the
legislation.</div><a name="09061028000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendments to the design of the debt cap, which I am about to explain
in more detail, will result in a simpler regime with greater scope for
business to avoid the impact of the debt cap. Without anti-avoidance
rules, groups that would pay additional corporation tax as a result of
the debt cap might rearrange their borrowings to avoid the rules.
Although the same borrowings might remain in substance, the form of the
borrowing and other arrangements could reduce the UK net finance
expense amounts or increase the worldwide figure of gross finance
expense.</div><a name="09061028000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
anti-avoidance rules are split into three parts. The first part
counters schemes intended to arrange for the group to satisfy the
gateway test. The second part counters schemes intended to secure that
the available amount, the worldwide group gross finance expense, is
greater than it otherwise would be; or that the tested expense amount
is less than it would otherwise be; or that the amount of financing
income exempted for UK group companies is greater than it would
otherwise be. It also counters schemes where a UK company is a
beneficiary of the scheme but is not actually a party that has
transactions that make up the scheme. Again to ensure that the debt
rules are compliant with EU law, the debt cap allows UK companies to
exempt financing income received from another group company resident in
another part of the European economic area, where 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>that company is subject to a disallowance or that payment in its own
country of residence. The third part of the anti-avoidance rules
ensures that the amount of financing income that can be exempted by a
UK company cannot be increased as a result of an avoidance
scheme.</div>
<a name="09061028000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Each of these
anti-avoidance rules incorporates a purpose test, providing that the
rules apply only where the main purpose, or one of the main purposes,
of the scheme is to secure a result that frustrates the intention of
the debt cap rules. The scope of the schemes potentially caught by the
rules is necessarily wide. The alternative would be to attempt to
define the schemes that might be put in place to frustrate the debt cap
rules, but it would be very difficult to anticipate all the potential
avoidance schemes. The approach we have taken is the right one, but we
recognise that some schemes will feature arrangements that are not
designed to frustrate the debt cap rules. We have addressed that by
providing that if the profits of the UK members of the group are
greater or the losses lower than they would be if the arrangements were
not in place, the anti-avoidance rules will not apply.</div>
<a name="09061028000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC will be
available to define, by regulation, schemes that consist of particular
types of arrangements or schemes bearing particular hallmarks that will
not be subject to the anti-avoidance rules. HMRC expects to develop
those in discussion with companies. The new targeted anti-avoidance
rules for the debt cap are inserted by way of a new part to schedule
15, requiring Government amendment 105 to update the overview in part 1
and Government amendment 116 to insert the new part.</div>
<a name="09061028000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions as published already contain a targeted anti-avoidance rule,
at paragraph 68(7) and (9), to prevent a UK group company from being
artificially removed from the scope of the debt cap. I have mentioned
that such a scheme will be caught by rules introduced through
Government amendment 116<b class="B">. </b>That allows for the existing rule to
be removed, and Government amendments 138 and 139 achieve
that.</div>
<a name="09061028000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to calls from business, the debt cap now applies to a group for its
first accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2010. We would
expect a group with an accounting period due to end on 31 December 2009
to apply the debt cap measures with effect from 1 January
2010. However, such a group could shorten its accounting period by one
day to 30 December 2009 and the debt cap would not apply till the
following accounting period, which starts on 31 December 2009. We want
to stop such forestalling activity. The change to the commencement date
made to accommodate businesses therefore requires us to introduce
Government amendments 152 and 153 to counter such activity. The
amendments move the commencement day for the debt cap rules forward
where a group changes its accounting period and the main purpose, or
one of the main purposes, of doing so is to delay the application of
the debt cap.</div>
<a name="09061028000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Government
amendment 157, consequential changes are required to prevent double
taxation. The debt cap disallows some finance expense where the net
finance expense of the UK members of a group exceeds the group&#146;s
gross external finance expense. In some cases, the finance expense
disallowed may be interest payable to an overseas subsidiary of a UK
group company that is taxable on the UK parent company under the
controlled foreign company rules. To prevent effective double taxation,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>Government amendment 157 adds new rules to the CFC legislation that will
allow a group to apply for otherwise taxable CFC profits that are
apportioned to a UK group company to be consequentially
reduced.</div>
<a name="09061028000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 151, on UK transfer pricing rules, applies the
arm&#146;s-length principle so that finance expense payable by a UK
group company to another group company can be claimed as a deduction
only if it is the amount that would have been payable to a third party.
Equally, financing income receivable by a UK group company from another
group company must reflect the amount that would have been receivable
if it had come from a third party.</div>
<a name="09061028000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debt cap
can result in finance expense being disallowed and financing income
exempted. It is possible in some cases that the transfer pricing rules
could reinstate such adjustments. To address that problem, we need to
make clear that the debt cap rules operate after any necessary
adjustments under the transfer pricing rules have been made. Government
amendment 151 makes a change to the transfer pricing rules that makes
the primacy of the debt cap rules explicit.</div>
<a name="09061028000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologise
to the Committee for having taken up so much time with that
explanation, but I hope that I have made clear our reasons for tabling
the new anti-avoidance provisions at this stage. They have been widely
discussed and considered, and I hope that the Committee will be happy
to accept the Government amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000440"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation
of the amendments and the general background. I wish to put one point
on record at the start. It is a complaint widely voiced by professional
advisers, who are concerned about the raft of amendments being tabled
at this stage. I understand that some were circulated in draft form in
the middle of last week, but they were tabled formally only on
Thursday. A number of people to whom I have spoken over the past few
days expressed concern that they have not necessarily got to the bottom
of the changes, and that further issues may need to be resolved. It is
a pity that we have to discuss the amendments so soon after their
publication. I suspect that we may see further amendments being made on
Report, or even that the matter will have to be revisited in next
year&#146;s Finance Bill, as people work their way through some of
the changes.</div>
<a name="09061028000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall speak
first about the anti-avoidance measures. The Minister says that they
are targeted measures, but there is some concern they are not
targeted&#151;that they are instead quite broad in their approach.
The Minister said that the Treasury wanted to avoid being too specific,
so that people did not try to get around detailed provisions, but I
wonder whether we have gone to the other extreme. What sort of
activities can businesses undertake to reduce their tax charge that
will be deemed reasonable by HMRC? One expects taxpayers, when
confronted with a higher tax bill as a consequence of such provisions,
to take steps to reduce their tax bill. It is something that most of us
would do, and I believe that companies will look to restructure their
external debt to reflect the provisions.</div>
<a name="09061028000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
issues create the backdrop to the change. The fact that the gateway
test is much narrower than anticipated is a problem, as is the fact
that the net receivables of a company cannot be offset against net debt
in other group companies. I believe that people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>would try to structure their activities so that they could be netted off
in the same company if no exemption were available to match those
amounts in the group as a whole. Would HMRC expect to see and be happy
with that level of restructuring in the run-up to commencement, with
tidying up going on to get net receivables under the maximum debt in
the same company in order to enable that
offset?</div>
<a name="09061028000381"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="09061028000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other aspect is the exemptions referred to by the Minister in the
anti-avoidance clause to be inserted under Government amendment 116.
New paragraphs 38B to 38E will prevent groups from
structuring their financing so as to minimise any disallowance that
they could suffer as a result of applying the debt cap legislation,
unless the arrangement meets the definition of an excluded scheme. In
trying to get to that point, however, some of the decisions that
businesses need to review require a group to look at some hypothetical
comparator transactions and deduce which of them it would be more
likely to undertake in the absence of the debt cap rules and then
calculate the test of debt expense, the available amount, the test of
income amount and the group&#146;s profits chargeable to tax that
would arise if the hypothetical transaction had taken place. That is
covered in new paragraph 38D(2)(b), which
says:</div><a name="09061028000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;instead,
anything that is more likely than not would have been done or not done
had this Schedule not had effect in relation to the relevant period of
account, was done or not
done.&#148;</div><a name="09061028000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
may be perfect drafting from a parliamentary draftsman&#146;s point
of view, but I am not entirely sure what would be required unless
someone explained it to me. However, there appears to be a test of
looking at how a company might have acted if the rules had not been in
place. I question whether the anti-avoidance measures are sufficiently
opaque&#151;sorry, I mean sufficiently transparent, although they are
certainly opaque&#151;to enable businesses to take reasonable
decisions on how to restructure their affairs legitimately to take the
new rules into account. There may be a raft of potential comparative
transactions that a business could undertake, so how can a business
prove to HMRC that it can satisfy the provisions outlined in new
paragraph 38D(2)(b)? I think that the measure will cause some problems
to business.</div>
<a name="09061028000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
think about quite carefully the breadth of the measure, including what
sort of transactions it might inadvertently capture. For example, there
might be a scheme whereby an inbound investor is debt financing a
machinery replacement programme in its UK subsidiary to increase
production and thereby increase UK profits. However, if an investor
decides to reduce the amount of financing that is to be provided so
that the cost of capital is not increased by a disallowance under the
debt cap, conditions A and B of new paragraph 38B might well have been
met, because one of the investor&#146;s main purposes was to ensure
that there was no disallowance under the debt cap, and UK profits would
be lower than they would otherwise have been because less machinery is
in place and consequently production and profits are not as high as
they would have been if the full replacement programme had been
implemented.</div>
<a name="09061028000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We assume
that such a transaction is not the target of the anti-avoidance
provisions. It is not an unreasonable transaction to undertake, but it
would appear to satisfy conditions A and B of new paragraph 38B, so one

<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>would assume that it would fall within the definition of an excluded
scheme. Again, the breadth of the measures is causing part of the
problem. The definition of an excluded scheme is actually quite
important in establishing what is intended to be targeted by the
anti-avoidance provisions and what is not intended to be
targeted.</div>
<a name="09061028000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We understand
that the excluded schemes will appear in secondary legislation.
However, until we have a chance to look properly at that secondary
legislation, which is being consulted upon, it is very hard to know
what schemes will fall inside or outside the anti-avoidance provisions
of the Bill. This is an important issue, because a number of groups
will seek to use the period between now and the commencement of the
regime to look at the nature of their activities, to decide what their
financial arrangements should be and to see whether they may be caught
by what appears to be quite a broad-brush anti-avoidance
rule.</div>
<a name="09061028000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000441"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> There has been a great deal of discussion with
businesses over the past couple of years about everything that we are
considering this afternoon, including how anti-avoidance should be
handled. I do not want the Committee to get the impression that this
measure has come out of nowhere, hence my statement that there has been
a lot of discussion leading up to this point in the
process.</div><a name="09061028000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
anti-avoidance rules have indeed been designed with a wide scope. That
is to ensure that all schemes designed to frustrate the intention of
the debt cap rules are caught. I made the point earlier that the
alternative would have been to identify specific schemes that would be
caught by the rules, but that would have run the risk of not catching
schemes that nobody had thought of, or because specified schemes were
changed before being used. However, the anti-avoidance rules contain
filters that will ensure that they apply only to those schemes that are
intended to frustrate the debt cap
rules.</div><a name="09061028000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham asked how a company is supposed to establish
the most likely outcome if the anti-avoidance rules apply, and what its
profits ought to be. In many cases it will be straightforward to work
out the most likely outcome. For example, when the avoidance is
targeted at increasing the gross consolidated finance expense of the
group while leaving the borrowing costs associated with that scheme
more or less unchanged, the most likely alternative outcome will be to
ignore the increase in those expenses. I do not know whether the hon.
Gentleman will find this reassuring, but HMRC will in due course
publish guidance to help to explain the factors that need to be taken
into account and assessed when establishing the most likely alternative
outcome. As it develops the guidance, HMRC will certainly talk to
businesses about that, and in cases of real difficulty, which I think
will be rare, it will be happy to discuss the most likely outcome with
the
group.</div><a name="09061028000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
cannot allow set-off between group companies because that would not be
EU-law compliant. However, putting receipts of interest into the
company with expense is not offensive, because the company then does
not have so much interest expense to claim as a
deduction.</div><a name="09061028000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, we will publish detailed draft guidance before the Bill
receives Royal Assent, and will discuss it with businesses. That will
help us to come up with specific examples that should not be caught,
which might be helpful in some of the situations that the hon.
Gentleman has in mind.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div><a name="09061028000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000442"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not hugely reassured by the statement that
HMRC will produce guidance. There were various attempts during last
year&#146;s Finance Bill to get HMRC to produce guidance, which
effectively would have enabled people to be taxed by legislation but
untaxed by guidance. There is a lot of concern about that approach
among tax professionals more broadly. They are concerned that guidance
does not have statutory force, does not necessarily have to go through
a proper consultation process, and offers less security to taxpayers
than primary or even secondary
legislation.</div><a name="09061028000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister should not be in any doubt that people will be content if
guidance is published, but it is better to get primary and secondary
legislation right than to tax people by guidance. Will he reassure the
Committee that regulations will be introduced to define excluded
schemes and that the guidance will give the context of what schemes are
deemed to be excluded? It might give a bit more certainty to taxpayers
if the guidance is simply an elaboration of what is in secondary
legislation, rather than something that exists independent of
it.</div><a name="09061028000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000443"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We will publish the detailed draft guidance before
Royal Assent and discuss the content with business. HMRC will consult
with business to consider particular schemes that are not intended to
frustrate the debt cap rules. It will then consider whether such a
scheme can be defined by, for example, particular hallmarks that
characterise a scheme, which we can set out up front by outcome or by
other criteria, and then publish draft regulations for comment. The
intention is to achieve a progressive process with excluded schemes
added over a
period.</div><a name="09061028000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000444"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> On the general principle of specifically outlawing
schemes rather than having a wider catch-all, is it not better to have
specifically outlawed schemes, so that taxpayers know where they stand?
Is it not the role of Government to outwit the accountants each year?
What will happen is that accountants will look at the provision and try
and get round it, and we will be back here again next year outlawing
schemes in the next Finance Bill. By specifying schemes, one can at
least argue with some certainty, rather than going off to tribunals or
court
cases.</div><a name="09061028000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000445"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I think the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument
actually supports the approach that we have taken. He is absolutely
right: some very ingenious people will no doubt try to find a way round
some of the provisions. However, if the approach we took was to try to
work out what kind of schemes might be dreamt up and then list them all
or set them all out in the legislation, that would be an invitation to
someone to think of a slightly different version, or to come up with
something new. It is therefore better to design the anti-avoidance
rules as we have done, with a wide scope, so that all schemes that are
designed to frustrate the intention of the debt cap rules are caught.
He is right about the ingenuity that will be applied, but I think that
the conclusion he draws is not correct. It is better to have the wide
scope that allows us to deal with whatever is
invented.</div><a name="09061028000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000448"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I can be a bit briefer with this group of
amendments, as I have already set out the aim of the debt cap
legislation. I mentioned that some businesses cannot operate without
the use of debt&#151;for example, banks borrow from their depositors
to lend on to customers&#151;and the debt cap has never been intended
to apply to businesses for which debt is integral to what they do. The
draft clauses published in December contained exclusions for financial
business where debt was an integral part of that business, but
subsequent discussions established that those rules, as set out at that
time, would have been very difficult to operate in
practice.</div>
<a name="09061028000382"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
<a name="09061028000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my 30
April letter, we explained to the financial services industry why the
Bill would not exclude this exclusion on publication. We have been
working with business to develop workable solutions since then. The new
financial services exclusion rules work by excluding a group as a whole
from being subject to the debt cap where substantially all of the
group&#146;s income, or the income of UK members of the group taken
together as a mini consolidated group, is derived from qualifying
activities. In that context, &#147;substantially all&#148; will be
taken to mean around 90 per cent. Qualifying activities are lending
business, insurance businesses and trading in financial instruments.
The rules recognise the need for flexibility so that they can be
applied by financial services groups in a straightforward way. The
rules allow groups to take account of other types of income generated
by way of the qualifying activities and deal with cases in which some
of those activities might produce losses. The amendments introduce the
financial services exclusion in a form that delivers the intended
policy, while rightly excluding financial services businesses. It is
also practical for the
industry.</div><a name="09061028000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000449"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister is right that these are important
amendments. Last year, when I discussed the debt cap with those in the
banking sector, this was identified as being an important issue to get
right, because of the nature of their financing. I want to raise some
issues that have been brought to my attention in the relatively short
time since these clauses were published. Some of them have been
discussed with the Treasury already.</div>
<a name="09061028000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
issue relates to qualifying activities. To qualify for the exemption,
all or a substantial amount of a group&#146;s income must be aimed at
qualifying activities. The Minister said that that means 90 per cent.
of the group&#146;s income must be in a qualifying activity&#151;a
proportion used elsewhere, I think. However, that means that groups
with a combination of qualifying and non-qualifying activities might
have a problem. Let us consider how some businesses in the financial
services sector are currently developing. For example, retailers are
increasingly moving into financial services. The financial services
income might constitute a relatively small proportion of a
group&#146;s total income, which means that it would not qualify
under this exemption because neither all nor a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>substantial part of its income will derive from a qualifying activity.
The vast majority will come from retailing, selling petrol or whatever.
This provision might place an extra burden on groups seeking to
diversify into financial services and act as a barrier, or a further
disincentive, to them doing
so.</div><a name="09061028000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understood that, at one stage, the Treasury or HMRC were considering an
exemption that would enable them to ring-fence sub-groups
wholly engaged in qualifying activities as a means of getting around
this particular issue. I would be grateful if the Minister could
explain why that route has not been pursued and why the level has been
set at such a high level of 90 per cent. I hope that this does not, as
has been suggested, take us back to our old friend &#147;EU
rules&#148;. My first concern, therefore, is about what happens with
hybrid groups. Can the rules be amended to reflect the diversity of
some groups involved in some financial services and other
activities?</div><a name="09061028000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second concern relates to the treatment of insurance premiums. The
Minister will be aware that premiums on investment contracts will be
accounted for in a group&#146;s balance sheet, rather than its income
statement. Will those premiums be included in the gross income test
under proposed new paragraph 6G(3)(B)? My understanding is that that
point has been made and accepted by HMRC but is not reflected in the
drafting of the
amendment.</div><a name="09061028000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point on insurance premiums relates to the way in which they are
disclosed in sets of accounts. Looking at the gross income for the debt
cap test, will the Treasury expect insurers to report their premiums
gross of reinsurance premiums, as that would be the appropriate measure
for discerning the gross income test? As I understand it, as a matter
of presentation several insurers show their turnover net of reinsurance
premiums but disclose by way of note the gross premium. Could the
Minister clarify how insurance companies will be able to calculate
their gross income? The substantive point that concerns me at present
is the question of how the exemption for financial services will take
into account those groups whose financial services activity is perhaps
a significant element but nowhere near the 90 per cent. test the
Government have set out in the schedule and in the
amendments.</div><a name="09061028000094"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000450"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I will deal first with the 90 per cent. limit and
the substantial requirement. As the hon. Gentleman has said, that
proportion is referred to elsewhere. It is needed is ensure that the
exclusion is not treated as a state aid under EU rules. Some groups
could well be in the position he described by essentially having a
retailing business, but also an identifiable finance arm. When groups
are in that position, it is possible that the whole group will be
excluded through the application of the gateway test. Therefore, we
took the view that introducing rules to deal with such cases in the
legislation would be pretty complicated if we were to ensure that those
rules were not then used for avoidance purposes. It is likely that no
such groups will have to apply the main rules, so we do not think that
there is a need to introduce additional rules.</div>
<a name="09061028000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard

any reinsurance or net after reinsurance, for the purposes of
calculating the trading income and income from qualifying activities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>the income is taken as gross, before any premiums ceded in respect of
reinsurance. On the question of what happens if income is not normally
reported as income in the income statement profit and loss account but
is taken to the balance sheet, for example with premiums from
investment contracts, the rules refer to income that is accounted for
as such under accounting practice or principles where amounts
receivable have the nature of income but for particular insurance
accounting purposes are taken to the balance sheet. Those amounts will
be treated as income for the purposes of applying the financial

rules.</div><a name="09061028000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going
back to the hybrid point, and the question of whether we could

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000453"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The gateway test we mentioned is a comparison of
specific amounts of debt and cash and loan receivables from balance
sheets of the UK members of a group and of the group itself. Each
figure is the average of the opening and closing balance sheet figures.
If the measure of total net debt of the UK members of the group that
themselves have net debt is less than 75 per cent. of the
gross debt of the group, the group does not have to apply the rest of
the debt count rules for that accounting period. If a UK company has
net debt of less than &#163;3 million, it is not included in the
calculation of UK net debt
either.</div><a name="09061028000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
making the comparison, the terms that define liabilities and
receivables in respect of finance leases do not work as intended.
Amendments 107 to 109 put that right.</div>
<a name="09061028000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some
circumstances groups prepare accounts in a currency other than
sterling, so the gateway test can be applied by reference to a
group&#146;s functional currency rather than sterling. Amendments 111
to 113 in the grouping address how, in that case, the &#163;3 million
de minimis is translated to the functional currency.</div>
<a name="09061028000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments ensure that the gateway test works as intended in those
cases in which a group is involved in financial leasing businesses and
where a group has adopted a functional currency other than
sterling.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000457"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Before I move on to my amendments, I want to raise
a question that has been put to me about the group treasury exemption.
The Minister will doubtless be aware that in a number of groups,
trading companies will participate in a cash pooling arrangement
whereby balances are swept from that company into a central account
overnight and transferred back. Such arrangements are considered
necessary to undertake treasury activities. The income would then be
allocated to that company. One of the concerns expressed to me is that,
in such a situation, the trading income is likely to swamp the treasury
income and probably would also swamp the income of the pure treasury
company within a group in such a way that no group company would be
able to qualify as a group treasury
company.</div><a name="09061028000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been suggested that paragraph 42(6) should be amended so that
whereas at present it includes any company that undertakes treasury
activities for the worldwide group, whether or not it also undertakes
other activities, that should be replaced with the exclusion</div>
<a name="09061028000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;except where
the main activity of that company is conducting
trade.&#148;</div>
<a name="09061028000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would reflect the
fact that people may be undertaking cash pooling operations as an
adjunct to the trading activity, and might be a way of ensuring that
the very valuable exemption for group treasury companies is capable of
being taken advantage of in those companies in which there are cash
pooling
arrangements.</div><a name="09061028000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come now to my own amendments. Amendments 52 and 53 are quite simple. I
shall explain the issue that I am trying to address. Paragraph 39 of
schedule 15 defines &#147;financing expense amounts&#148; to
include loan relationship debits&#151;condition A&#151;finance
lease rentals, which is condition B, and costs payable on debt
factoring, which is condition C. The definition of finance income
amounts of the company includes income arising from similar
transactions.</div><a name="09061028000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
companies engaged in oil extraction activities, finance expense takes
into account amounts that are limited to loan relationship debits, and
financing income takes into account only loan relationship credits. Is
there a reason why companies involved in oil extraction should not be
able to bring into account expenses and income relating to finance
lease rentals&#151;condition B? I should be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s comments on
that.</div><a name="09061028000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to amendment 54, sub-paragraph (6) of paragraph 47 on page 170
provides for the conditions in the provision to apply to elections
relating to finance expenses. It relates to carrying forward
non-trading deficits &#147;from the finance arrangement&#148;. My
understanding 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>is that that is technically incorrect and should be amended. Deficits
under the loan relationship regime are not specific to a relationship;
they are part of a general
calculation.</div><a name="09061028000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
55 is another fairly technical amendment. The rules that applied to the
expenses of management of investment companies in part IV of the Income
and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 were amended in 2004 to apply to
companies with investment business as opposed to just
&#147;investment companies&#148;. My amendment would insert the
more up-to-date
language.</div><a name="09061028000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
56 and 57 are drafting amendments. The references are to the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988. That has now been rewritten through the
Corporation Tax Act 2009 and my amendments would make the
cross-reference to the 2009 Act rather than the 1988 Act. The draft
legislation that was published in December last year did not take into
account the fact that there needs to be a proper cross-reference to the
new
Act.</div><a name="09061028000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
58 and 60 relate to the definitions in paragraphs 52 and 53 of the
tested expense amount and the tested income amount of relevant group
companies. The amounts covered by the definitions are not supposed to
refer to periods when a company is not a member of the group. However,
the relevant provisions refer to transactions that take place when a
company is not a member of the relevant group and do not take account
of the fact that either the income or the expense amount are calculated
with reference to entries in the accounts which would normally be
determined on an accruals basis. The amendments are designed to ensure
that the accrued amounts are taken into account or excluded from the
two definitions of tested income amount and tested expense amount, as
appropriate.</div><a name="09061028000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
59 is another drafting amendment. The suggestion is that the
definitions should refer to the whole of the schedule rather than
simply to part 7. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
clarification of whether the drafting in the Bill is correct, or
whether it should refer to the schedule rather than the
part.</div><a name="09061028000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000458"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for several of
the amendments that he has proposed, and I would be happy to accept
some of them. It always was our intention, as I mentioned earlier, to
exclude companies undertaking oil exploration activities that are
subject to specific rules from the scope of the debt cap. There was a
drafting oversight, and so the provisions do not exclude finance lease
charges from the operation of the debt cap. Amendments 52 and 53 put
that right. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for them and am happy
to accept
them.</div><a name="09061028000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
54 is also helpful. It removes an erroneous limitation on identifying
the deficits that can be used to determine the amount of finance
expense that can be excluded from the calculation under the debt cap. I
tabled an amendment that was identical in form but that was not
selected. Therefore, I am delighted to accept amendment 54 and again am
grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling
it.</div><a name="09061028000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendments 55 and 56, other rules in the current clauses deal similarly
with excluding financing expense amounts that are payable to group
companies with excess management expenses. The rules incorrectly refer
to legislation in ICTA rather than CTA 2009, as is now appropriate
following consolidation. I am grateful to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>Opposition Members for picking up on that point and for tabling
amendment 57. However, as it does not include the whole of the
cross-reference required, I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman did
not press it. Amendments 55 and 56 do insert the correct
cross-references.</div><a name="09061028000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham spoke to amendments 58 and 60, which
relate to Government amendments 135 to 137. Some groups have interests
in companies that are not controlled by the group, but the group is
nevertheless entitled to more than 75 per cent. of the profits of those
companies. Such a company will not form part of the group for
accounting purposes, so its results will not be included in the
group&#146;s consolidated financial statements. At the moment, such a
company would be treated as a member of the group for the purposes of
calculating the UK measure of net finance expenses. Government
amendment 137 ensures that such a company will be included in the UK
measure of net finance expenses only if it is a member of the group for
accounting purposes.</div>
<a name="09061028000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft
clauses as published also contain a rule in paragraph 62(2) that was
intended to deal with a particular consequence affecting the general
partner of a partnership that owns UK companies. That rule is now
redundant due to amendment 137 and could provide avoidance planning
opportunities if not removed, so amendments 135 and 136 will
remove the measures.</div>
<a name="09061028000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 58
and 60 are intended to deal with a concern about the finance expense
amounts payable and financing income amounts receivable by a UK group
company that relates to a period before or after that company is a
member of the group. The concern is, for example, that where an amount
of financing income relating to a loan made by a UK company before it
joined a group continues to be received by the company when it is a
member of the group, financing income would not be taken into account
in applying the debt cap rules.</div>
<a name="09061028000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
agree that the current rules provide for that outcome. Although
different statutory language might achieve the same result, I do not
think that the amendments are successful. However, it might be helpful
for me to put on record a reassurance that the rules in
paragraphs 52(3) and 53(3) are intended to work so that only
finance expense amounts and financing income amounts that accrue to a
UK company while it is a member of the group under consideration are
taken into account when calculating any disallowance of finance
expenses and any exemption of financing income for the purposes of the
debt cap. I hope that on the basis of that reassurance, the hon.
Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendments. Amendment 59 was
dealt with under schedule 14 and accepted this
morning.</div><a name="09061028000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the hon. Gentleman expressed a concern at the beginning of his remarks
that there was a danger of trading income swamping treasury income in
group treasury companies. I do not think that there is a problem,
because the amendments proposed ensure that activities traditionally
undertaken by treasury companies can be excluded. That includes
receiving deposits, making loans, managing cash management schemes and
investing surplus funds. In that way, the danger about which he was
concerned has been dealt
with.</div><a name="09061028000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

to the Bill.</div>
<a name="09061028000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000464"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Not wishing anyone to think that I had exhausted
schedule 15&#151;I have been overwhelmed by the Minister&#146;s
generosity in accepting some of the amendments that I tabled&#151;I
want to explore one or two points that I think are important. The
Minister probably addressed one of them when we debated the last but
one group of
amendments.</div><a name="09061028000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
issue about the construction of the measure is the use of the
&#147;available amount&#148; that is defined in part 8
and the &#147;tested expense amount&#148; or &#147;tested income
amount&#148; that is defined in part 7. Calculations of the former
are based on financial statements, whereas calculations of the latter
are based on tax computations. That would not be a problem if there
were a perfect alignment between UK generally accepted accounting
practice and international financial reporting standards and the basis
on which tax computations are prepared. Life would be fantastic if it
were that simple, but it is not, and there are gaps. That creates a
tension when those differences are important in the calculation of
either the tested amount or the available amount.</div>
<a name="09061028000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">One issue
that the Minister referred to when we debated the penultimate group of
amendments was deadlocked joint venture companies. One party may have
75 per cent. of the ordinary share capital but 51 per cent.
of the income, but because of the arrangements between the two owners,
there is deadlock, so it does not count towards control when it comes
to the consolidated results of either partner in the venture.</div>
<a name="09061028000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The tested
expense amount is defined as</div>
<a name="09061028000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the sum of net
financing deduction of each relevant group
company&#148;</div><a name="09061028000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
paragraph 52(1), but according to paragraph 68(6), a relevant group
company would be a &#147;75% subsidiary&#148;. The situation is
that the tested amount would include the expenses of a relevant group
company, but the available amount would not take that into account
because of the deadlock arrangements between two shareholders in a
joint venture such as the one I described. I should be grateful if the
Minister could tell us whether that anomaly was resolved by the last
but one group of amendments or whether further work needs to be done to
get the two calculations into
line.</div><a name="09061028000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue arises on the same point in connection with financial instruments
by virtue of paragraph 39(2). Where a company has borrowed in dollars
and then swapped the loan into sterling, if the contract rate accounts
for the arrangement of the UK GAAP there would be a sympathetic
sterling interest which would be a finance expense account. However,
where the accounts and the arrangements are under FRS 26 or IFRS, the
US dollar interest would be included with the swap being ignored. Is
this the result that is intended
here?</div>
<a name="09061028000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
paragraph 39(3), where a company accounts for a loan on a fair value
basis, fair value movements are included within the finance expense
account and therefore the tested amount. However, the equivalent
amounts are not included in the available amounts. So a gap&#151;that
is perhaps the wrong word to use in this context&#151;is opening up.
Another issue may arise on partnerships because of the way they are
dealt with and the question 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>whether they are transparent for tax purposes. It is difficult to assess
how significant these issues are, but I should be grateful if the
Minister could share his thoughts with the Committee on how the
differences between accounting and tax treatment
work.</div><a name="09061028000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000465"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I think that some of the amendments that we have
been debating will address some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concerns. Amendment 137, which ensures that a UK company must be a
member of the group for accounting purposes, would deal with the
problem of deadlocked joint ventures. On his concern about available
versus total calculations, several potential mismatches created by the
different treatment of more complex financial arrangements have been
raised with us. The draft clauses published in December included a
wider definition of finance expenses and finance income which would
have prevented some of those mismatches, but there was a strong view
from businesses that we should remove the impact of foreign currency
adjustments and payments and receipts from derivative contracts from
the debt rules.</div>
<a name="09061028000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
narrowing the definitions might raise some problems, but I am cautious
about introducing a quick solution to reintroduce other complexities
that we wanted to eliminate. We will continue to look at these,
consulting with interested parties. If we can find suitable solutions,
we can announce additional rules at the time of the PBR which could
take effect from 1 January 2010, although the legislation would follow
shortly
afterwards.</div><a name="09061028000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000470"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am, again, grateful for your
clarification.</div>
<a name="09061028000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 16
makes consequential changes arising from what we have just agreed to
the controlled foreign company rules designed to stop UK groups from
artificially diverting profits to low-tax territories in order to avoid
paying UK tax on those profits. The controlled foreign company rules
counter this by charging UK tax on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>diverted profits. The controlled foreign company legislation is subject
to a series of exemptions, two of which are the subject of this
schedule. Those are, first, the acceptable distribution policy and,
secondly, exemptions for holding companies. Following the introduction
of an exemption regime for foreign dividends, these exemptions are no
longer appropriate and are
removed.</div><a name="09061028000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
155 is tabled to repeal clause 57(6) of this Bill with effect for
accounting periods of controlled foreign companies beginning on or
after 1 July 2009. This clause contains double taxation provisions that
come into effect for dividends paid on or after 1 April 2008, but
subsection (6) will no longer be needed from 1 July 2009 as
the ADP exemption is repealed on that day as a consequence of the
introduction of dividend
exemption.</div><a name="09061028000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
156 is tabled to remove a mismatch between the controlled foreign
company and double taxation rules to ensure that there is consistent
treatment of profits arising before and after commencement. Although
scope for abuse does exist, this mismatch is more likely to produce the
wrong result and therefore needs to be corrected. It reflects an
omission that unfortunately did not come to light during earlier
consultation. On that basis, I hope that the Committee will accept the
amendments.</div><a name="09061028000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061028000471"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I do not have a problem with
the amendments, but I want to probe the Minister on one point.
Controlled foreign companies, being controlled foreign holding
companies, are obviously a good thing and international commerce
creates sundry types and forms, and various structures will exist
internationally, and that is all to the good. There is a natural moral
distinction between legitimate companies as part of ordinary business
development and illegitimate companies that are set up expressly for
the purpose of tax avoidance. There seems to be a parallel distinction
in schedule 16 between local holding companies, which enjoy exemptions,
and non-local holding companies, which have their exemptions
withdrawn&#151;as is also the case with superior holding companies. I
support that; I support all the changes in corporate taxation that have
been identified by the Minister. The acid test, and it seems a fair
test, is always identifying the ultimate corporate parent or
beneficiary.</div><a name="09061028000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
admit that it is slightly tangential, but I would like to ask the
Financial Secretary about the Tesco case. I am not familiar with its
exact techniques, but the Minister will be aware that it set up a
controlled foreign company in Liechtenstein. This was not to avoid
corporation tax, which it was accused of by <i class="I">The Guardian </i>and
which it exonerated<i class="I"> </i>itself from, but in order to avoid stamp
duty. Do the provisions in schedule 16 have any implications for such
tax
loopholes?</div><a name="09061028000017"></a><h4 class="hs_76fChair">[<span class="SmallCaps">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000474"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am happy to speak more generally about the
schedule, if that would be helpful to the Committee, having moved the
Government amendments as
well.</div><a name="09061028000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
16 amends the controlled foreign company rules. The rules work by
apportioning the profits of the foreign subsidiary back to the UK,
therefore subjecting those profits to a UK tax charge. The impact of
the present legislation is limited by a series of exemptions, which are
designed to exclude from charge those foreign subsidiaries that can
reasonably be assumed to exist for reasons other than to divert profits
artificially from the UK. Two of those exemptions are subject to the
provisions of the clause and schedule; they are the acceptable
distribution policy&#151;the ADP exemption&#151;and holding company
exemptions. Following the introduction of an exemption regime for
foreign dividends, those two exemptions from the rules are no longer
appropriate and are therefore
removed.</div><a name="09061028000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
acceptable distribution policy exemption applies when 90 per cent. or
more of the foreign subsidiary&#146;s profits are paid back to the UK
as dividends. The premise underlying the ADP exemption was that, as
dividends were taxable in the UK, there was no significant UK tax
avoidance. However, introducing an exemption regime means that most
dividend payments from foreign subsidiaries will no longer be taxable,
so the exemption becomes redundant. The ADP rules are therefore
repealed on 1 July 2009, the same day that the dividend exemption is to
be introduced. Schedule 16 makes provisions for accounting periods
straddling that date to be split into two. That will ensure that
profits accruing prior to the introduction of the dividend exemption
can still qualify for the ADP exemption.</div>
<a name="09061028000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000475"></a>Mr.

on earth do those two brackets mean?</div>
<a name="09061028000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000476"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I imagine that those two brackets refer to a
continuation of the numbering system, but I may come back to that
point.</div>
<a name="09061028000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
explaining the ADP exemption. I shall now move on to the holding
company exemption. The other exemption that we are reforming is that
for foreign subsidiaries that qualify as holding companies. Generally,
the exemptions allow companies that receive mainly the specified types
of income, and little other income, to be exempt from the CFC rules.
There are different categories of holding companies, depending on the
specified types of income. Schedule 16 removes the superior and
non-local holding company exemptions, as most foreign dividends will
now be exempt. Retaining those exemptions in such circumstances
represents an unacceptable risk to the Exchequer. Groups could abuse
the exemptions by recycling dividends within the group, resulting in
increased amounts of profit and tax on those profits being diverted
from the UK.</div>
<a name="09061028000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">To allow
companies time to adapt to the rules, we are introducing a two-year
transitional period. During that time, the exemptions will be available
only in a restricted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>form to mitigate Exchequer risk. The transition period will also overlap
with the longer term CFC review, allowing business to consider the
outcome of this change alongside the removal of the holding company
exemptions.</div><a name="09061028000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000477"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister referred to a transitional period, but
one of the issues that I see being flagged up is that some exemptions
will continue through the transitional period so long as the company
continues to be held within the group and there is no change of
ownership. I can understand the Government wishing to prevent a change
of ownership arising as part of a tax planning device, but in some
cases the change of control will be for legitimate commercial reasons.
Why, in such cases, should legitimate commercial transactions lose the
benefit of the transitional
relief?</div><a name="09061028000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000478"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right that the exemption will
be available only in the restricted form to mitigate Exchequer risk
during that two-year period. If I may, I shall reflect on the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s precise question, and come back to him before
finishing.</div><a name="09061028000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
local holding companies exemption will be retained, as it is typically
required for commercial reasons and retaining the rules does not pose a
significant risk to the Exchequer.</div>
<a name="09061028000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
I am now in a position to answer the question that the hon. Member for
Fareham asked about whether condition A is too stringent, if I
understood it correctly. The condition means that groups cannot sell
companies defined as qualifying holding companies to another group and
take advantage of the transitional rules. That prevents groups from
buying qualifying holding companies to shelter income from the UK. The
definition of &#147;control&#148; allows groups to move those
companies intra-group so that they can restructure if they
wish.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000479"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister gets the point exactly. I understand
that the restriction is to prevent that sort of tax structure to
shelter profits, but there may be a sensible commercial reason why a
group decides to sell a holding company and the activities that sit
beneath it. It may decide that it wants to sell its tobacco interests
in Spain, for example, and sell that group of companies to another
business. The acquirer will lose the exemption where there is a
legitimate commercial reason for the sale. It is not a transaction to
avoid or reduce the tax bill; it is a legitimate commercial transaction
with solid commercial substance to it, but the benefit of the
transitional relief is lost as a consequence of the
sale.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000480"></a>Mr.

<a name="09061028000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two other
points were made in the debate. The hon. Member for Southport asked
about implications for stamp duty. It is difficult for me to comment on
a particular company. Although I was interested by <i class="I">The
Guardian</i><i class="I"> </i>series, I do not recall the case that he referred
to. The purpose of the controlled foreign company rules is to protect
against corporate tax avoidance of the kind that the series discussed.
The changes have no implications for stamp duty, as far as I am aware.
That may answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, but he will
appreciate that I cannot comment on the particular
case.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000487"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr.
Atkinson, for the graveyard slot&#151;well, I hope it is the
graveyard slot&#151;of today&#146;s sitting.</div>
<a name="09061028000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 37
cropped up in the Chamber, earlier today, during Treasury questions,
when the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)
raised a concern about whether the clause would make it easier for
businesses to participate in tax avoidance schemes by being able to
engage in transactions that move businesses offshore without letting
the Treasury know. He asked whether we were in danger of making it
easier for people to engage in the sort of transactions about which the
hon. Member for Southport seemed to be concerned during the previous
debate. In a sense, the arguments of the hon. Member for North-West
Leicestershire have been lent some support. Tax advisers have told me
that they welcome clause 37 and schedule 17, which must
instantly cause those considering such matters from the other side of
the debate to think, &#147;There must be something here to think
about. Will this be a charter for encouraging such
activity?&#148;</div>
<a name="09061028000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that the existing regime for Treasury consent will be
swept away. However, one issue that comes up in the correspondence and
debate on this matter is whether the regime that the Treasury is
considering will be effective in helping businesses to comply and in
helping to promote certainty for taxpayers. The existing regime had a
set of general consents&#151;document  M03/88&#151;and if
someone is taking part in one of those transactions, there is no
requirement to notify the Treasury or to gain its consent. Clause 37
paves the way for the repeal of that legislation. We now have a new set
of reporting requirements for certain transactions exceeding
&#163;110 million. On one level, the Government are saying that they
will remove the Treasury consent regime and that there will be no
replacement for the general consents. However, HMRC has a regulatory
power under the Bill to designate excluded transactions, augmenting the
list of excluded transactions in paragraph 9 of schedule 17. Until HMRC
exercises its powers though, taxpayers will have to report more
transactions than at
present.</div><a name="09061028000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
list of transactions in paragraph 9 is not as broad as that in the
current general consents, and there is a concern that many common
commercial situations will need to be reported, resulting in a greater
compliance burden. That runs counter to the Government&#146;s aim and
to the expectation of the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire and
others.</div><a name="09061028000386"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="09061028000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a short list&#151;you will be pleased to note, Mr.
Atkinson&#151;of those existing consents that people have said they
would like to see under the new regime. They include the issue of
shares by a non-UK company to a UK company, the issue of shares by
non-UK companies to a third party, rights issues, the issue of
debentures and the issue of shares by Commonwealth countries. I would
be grateful for the Minister&#146;s thoughts as to where the excluded
transactions regime will get to.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div><a name="09061028000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
an issue relating to private equity funds and limited liability
partnerships. The new rules, in paragraph 5 of schedule 17, require
reporting by UK bodies corporate that control non-UK companies.
However, in certain situations a UK body corporate might be considered
to control non-UK companies, but reporting might be considered
inappropriate. For example, many private equity structures include a UK
body corporate such as a limited company or a limited liability
partnership as the fund&#146;s general partner. If that fund holds UK
investments, the general partner might be required to report
transactions over which it has little or no influence. There could be
an amendment to the effect that bodies corporate that are general
partners of collective investment schemes, as defined by the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, could be exempted. That would avoid
inappropriate reporting
requirements.</div><a name="09061028000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would help if the Minister gave a bit more background to the proposals
in clause 37 and schedule 17, to provide a clearer understanding of how
he expects the new regime to work. How can he reassure his hon. Friends
that this is not a tax avoidance charter and at the same time give
comfort to businesses that it will not lead to a much more onerous
regime?</div><a name="09061028000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000488"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Clause 37 introduces schedule 17, which removes the
existing Treasury consents legislation&#151;dating from
1951&#151;and replaces it with a modernised post-transaction
reporting requirement. The existing rules are out of date and are not
in line with current business practice. We are committed to having
information available for the detection and countering of tax
avoidance. There is absolutely no weakening of our resolve on that
front, which is reflected here, and which I will set out perhaps in
more detail when we debate the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for
Southport.</div><a name="09061028000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to maintain a corporate tax regime that keeps pace with how
businesses operate today, so the new reporting requirement will apply
only to material from transactions that pose a significant risk of tax
avoidance, with a value in excess of &#163;100 million. That will
give HMRC the information that it needs to detect tax avoidance, and,
as we will discuss when we come to those amendments, by targeting the
report the administrative burden for businesses is
reduced.</div><a name="09061028000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new rules remove the need to apply to the Treasury before entering into
commercial transactions. That decision will be left to businesses,
making it easier for them to operate. The administrative burdens will
be significantly reduced by introducing the &#163;100 million
threshold, reducing the number of reportable transactions and reducing
the amount of information that needs to be
reported.</div><a name="09061028000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also removing the rather outdated criminal penalty that was
attached to the Treasury consents rules. In response to
representations, we have extended the exclusions to include a number of
the general consents that are available in the Treasury consents rules.
The draft legislation published in December included a number of
exclusions from the new reporting requirement in addition to the de
minimis limit of &#163;100 million and in the consultation it became
clear that without additional exclusions, the rules could generate
reports that were of little value to HMRC. We have added a number of
further exclusions to the draft regulations, which are essentially a
replication of the existing general consents&#151;although we have
removed some of the more dated elements.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div><a name="09061028000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">In drafting
the regulations, we have deliberately copied the language because it is
already familiar to businesses and, together with a new exclusion for
cash pooling arrangements, these measures will address the concerns
expressed about recurring transactions. The draft regulations will be
published on the HMRC website. In that way, we have both provided the
safeguards against avoidance, which were rightly of concern to my hon.
Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire, the hon. Member for
Southport and, I imagine, to Conservative Members, while significantly
easing the regulatory burden on businesses in a helpful way. We have
got that balance right, and I hope that the Committee as a whole will
work on
that.</div><a name="09061028000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

&#145;&#163;1&#146;.</div><a name="09061028000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000490"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss:
amendment 42, in schedule 17, page 190, line 34, leave out
paragraphs (a) and
(b).</div><a name="09061028000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000491"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I have supported the legislation up to now, but I
cannot help thinking that, having done some sterling work, the Minister
has with this schedule snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. I
would like to put that in some context.</div>
<a name="09061028000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">In clause 37
schedule 17, we are repealing section 765 of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988. The provision, which has existed in various forms for
58 years, demands that companies enacting schemes whereby
they move funds out of the EU&#151;and, obviously, the UK before
that&#151;receive consent to do so from the Revenue. As the Minister
undoubtedly explained, that is a hangover from the days of exchange
control, when people worried about sterling leaving the country and so
on. The provision is very broadly drafted and it encourages firms to
notify the Treasury of anything that is to its detriment. As the
Minister said, the provision has some old-fashioned, but
severe&#151;and, I suppose, effective&#151;criminal sanctions
attached.</div><a name="09061028000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reality is that the retention of section 765 over the years has been
fairly useful. It has forced companies to disclose schemes to the
Revenue before undertaking them. The fact that the measure is backed up
by draconian measures, even though they are unlikely to be used, adds
to its force. It gives UK revenue authorities some real-time
information about the activities of multinational companies. That is a
good thing because state revenue authorities normally play a constant
game of catch-up&#151;corporations undertake schemes and then the
revenue body finds out about them. Section 765 is virtually unique in
tax law because it allows the Revenue to know what companies plan to do
before they do it. It has been a major anti-avoidance measure because
it forces  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>multinationals to receive Government consent and, presumably, as a
result many tax avoidance schemes are stopped before they are
started.</div>
<a name="09061028000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
we cannot quantify the benefits of section 765, but they
have been real. Do not take my word for it: four years ago, the former
Paymaster General, now the Minister for Children, the right hon. Member
for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), said: &#147;the section was
introduced&#148;&#151;and presumably
kept&#151;</div><a name="09061028000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
counter tax avoidance; it has done that successfully and should not be
repealed, as it protects a great deal of
revenue.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee B,
</i>30 June 2005; c.
319.]</div><a name="09061028000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
modern business terms, I accept that there is a case for pensioning off
section 765 and replacing it with something better. However, the
provisions in the Bill do not inspire confidence that we have something
better. There are a couple of reasons for that. First, at
&#163;100 million, the threshold is high. Companies, such
as multinationals, that wish to avoid breaching that threshold can
simply parcel transactions into smaller units of &#163;10
million or whatever, which is within their wit to do. Secondly, the
penalties for companies that do not comply with the legislation are
feeble. If a company gets away with a major bit of tax evasion or tax
avoidance, they face a fine of &#163;300 if they have not reported
after six months. I cannot see that frightening anyone who is serious
about tax avoidance. The penalty for every further day of non-reportage
is &#163;60. I suggest that the new set of provisions does not have
the teeth that it should have.</div>
<a name="09061028000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 41
considers the requirement for reporting transactions of &#163;100
million or more and suggests that it is absurd as it stands. I cannot
see any reason why we should choose that figure, which seems
unreasonably high. My amendment&#151;it is a probing
amendment&#151;reduces the limit drastically to &#163;1 million for
the purposes of the schedule. That is the point about the
threshold.</div>
<a name="09061028000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we look at
exemptions&#151;the Minister has talked about exemptions and about
how they oil the wheels of commerce, how they are a good thing and how
they avoid undue compliance costs and so on&#151;we see that they are
extraordinarily generous when they are read in the literal sense. For
example, if someone is in difficulties and the Revenue comes after them
and there is a suggestion of tax avoidance, they can plead that the
transaction</div><a name="09061028000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
carried out in the ordinary course of a
trade&#148;.</div><a name="09061028000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
strikes me as an extraordinarily vague provision&#151;almost a
licence for abuse. One can almost see tax planning advisers preparing
the excuse well in advance. I am not at all comfortable with retaining
that provision, because it is broad, colloquial and it seems a
catch-all excuse that almost anyone can use when challenged by the
Revenue. As far as I am concerned, it can only help tax avoidance and
it does not really have a significantly beneficial purpose for the
schedule as a
whole.</div><a name="09061028000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second exemption is, if anything, worse. It says that the transaction
is exempt if</div>
<a name="09061028000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all the parties
to the transaction are, at the time the transaction is carried out,
resident in the same territory&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061028000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, if all
transactions are carried out in the Cayman Islands, they would be
exempt from reporting. That is an open invitation to use secrecy
jurisdictions&#151;a licence and an invitation to go in for tax
avoidance. Therefore, although I support almost everything that the
Minister has done hitherto, I think that we have here a schedule that
opens the door to a new wave of tax 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>avoidance. The Minister should seriously address the weaknesses in
schedule 17. The fact that many people who are involved in tax law
welcome it adds to the
concern.</div><a name="09061028000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000492"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>Amendment proposed in schedule 17, page

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000493"></a>Dr.

yes.</div><a name="09061028000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000496"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am grateful for the support that the hon. Member
for Southport has given to the changes that we have made so far today
to foreign profits taxation, and I will endeavour to persuade him that
he should support this element of the Bill as well.</div>
<a name="09061028000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 17
repeals the existing Treasury consents rules, which are at sections 765
to 767 of the Income and Corporation Tax Act 1988, and replaces them
with a targeted reporting requirement. At the moment, the rules require
companies to seek advance consent from the Treasury before undertaking
certain transactions involving foreign subsidiaries, and they include a
criminal penalty of imprisonment for non-compliance, although that has
never been used, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, in the 58 years
during which the rules have been in
place.</div><a name="09061028000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
1951, the rules were aimed mainly at controlling company migrations at
a time of foreign exchange control. Over the decades, in response to
changes in UK tax law and changing business practice, the situations to
which the rules apply have changed. Their aim is to prevent groups from
entering into transactions that could result in a loss of tax to the
Exchequer.</div>
<a name="09061028000387"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="09061028000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might reassure the hon. Gentleman to know that as far as I am aware, no
other country has such a regime in place. He is right to refer to what
the then Paymaster General, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Bristol, South&#151;she is much missed from this Committee&#146;s
debates&#151;said during debate on the Finance Act 2005 about the
Treasury consent rules protecting a great deal of revenue, but she went
on to say that we would consider section 765, the relevant
section,</div>
<a name="09061028000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the context
of work on the wider international context of the corporation tax
system&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing
Committee B, </i>30 June 2005; c.
320.]</div><a name="09061028000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
culmination of that work is what we are debating today.</div>
<a name="09061028000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consent is
very rarely refused these days, but the rules impose a significant
administrative burden, which is why we think that the time has come to
repeal them. However, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: we need
to ensure that HMRC gets the information that it needs to detect and
prevent tax avoidance. HMRC monitors tax avoidance closely using a
range of different tools. We have been taking steps consistently to
tackle avoidance by reforming the tax system, closing loopholes and
introducing the disclosure regime that he mentioned. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>Anti-avoidance measures introduced in recent years have closed more than
&#163;11 billion in avoidance opportunities.</div>
<a name="09061028000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
certainly need to stay energetically on the case, as the pressure from
would-be avoiders does not diminish. Continuous action is needed to
mitigate the effects of tax avoidance, particularly at a time of global
economic difficulties. The hon. Gentleman will know that some of the
discussions that we had at the G20 summit on that topic
reflected concerns about tax avoidance outside the UK, not least on the
part of President Barack
Obama.</div><a name="09061028000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are therefore putting in place a modernised post-transaction reporting
requirement targeted at changes in the capital structure of
multinational groups. It will provide an early warning if multinational
groups enter into large cross-border capital reorganisations that could
give rise to tax avoidance and ensure that, having been alerted early,
we can monitor what happens closely.</div>
<a name="09061028000293"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061028000497"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): I am listening
intently to the Minister. We have here a measure that is designed to
give forewarning of sizeable transactions that the Department needs to
look at more closely. Will he touch on the business of people who might
wish to avoid paying sizeable amounts of tax being fined &#163;300?
That worried me, too. I just do not see the connection. Can he explain
the thinking behind that level of fine?</div>
<a name="09061028000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000498"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I will certainly address the points raised
specifically about the amendments, including that one.</div>
<a name="09061028000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Southport is right: the new reporting requirement applies to
transactions involving foreign investments with a value in excess of
&#163;100 million. Transactions above that are reportable,
so we are targeting the transactions about which HMRC most needs
information. The rules are targeted in that way as a result of
HMRC&#146;s experience with high-value cross-border transactions, to
ensure that it can concentrate its time and effort most
productively.</div>
<a name="09061028000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 41
and 42 both seek to widen the scope of the new rules. Amendment 41, as
we have heard, proposes reducing the de minimis limit from &#163;100
million to &#163;1 million. The difficulty is that that would result
in a large number of relatively low-value transactions that are not the
target of the provision coming within its scope. That would
significantly increase the administrative burden without generating the
kind of really useful information that HMRC needs. The new reporting
requirement focuses on changes to the capital structure of
multinational groups. Those are the kind of changes featured, for
example, in <i class="I">T</i><i class="I">he Guardian</i> series referred to earlier by
the hon. Member for Southport, where large amounts of tax are at stake
and where we need to concentrate our efforts. As can be seen from the
FTSE 100, the net market capitalisation of such businesses runs into
many billions of pounds. We need to target material changes or
restructurings and not divert HMRC energy away from those high-risk
areas of potential tax avoidance to low-risk areas.</div>
<a name="09061028000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that the Government have a lot of tools available for
detecting and countering tax avoidance, such as the disclosure regime,
risk assessments and annual fining requirements. The &#163;100
million limit does not mean that we are giving up on avoidance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div>activity below that level. The other measures at our disposal that I
have mentioned can target other types of avoidance activity as well,
but the new requirement will complement existing measures that are
compliant with how businesses work these days and provide the necessary
information to monitor the potential substantial avoidance
activity.</div>
<a name="09061028000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 42
proposes to remove the exclusion for transactions carried out in the
ordinary course of trade and those between parties resident in the same
territory. We have included those exclusions because, as I have already
said, the focus of the schedule is on cross-border restructurings
undertaken by multinational groups where the biggest avoidance risks
arise. Trading and same-country transactions are relatively low risk
and are not the target of the provision. We should not be focusing our
avoidance efforts on them, so I think that exclusion is appropriate.
The same argument applies to transactions in the same territory, which
are, of course, not cross-border and pose a lower risk of
avoidance.</div>
<a name="09061028000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
with the amendments is that they would result in a very big increase in
the administrative burden in return for very little benefit in
countering avoidance. We want to focus the rules on large-value,
cross-border transactions. Other avoidance measures, particularly the
disclosure regime, are available to target other types of
avoidance.</div>
<a name="09061028000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope I have
given the hon. Member for Southport some reassurance. I should add that
when we talk about transactions between parties in the same territory,
the CFC rules that we debated would tackle the problem of profits being
moved offshore to the Cayman Islands in the way that he, perfectly
properly, expressed concern
about.</div><a name="09061028000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000499"></a>John
Howell:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09061028000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000500"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I will just respond to the point made by the hon.
Member for Northampton, South regarding the penalty. A monetary penalty
to up to &#163;300 would apply for the initial sum and up to
&#163;60 per day thereafter for each day that the report is late.
That is in line with the wider penalty regime currently applicable. We
have done a lot of thinking about where the penalties from different
parts of the tax system should be applied and the level at which they
should be applied, and that is a value that is consistent with the
wider arrangements. Of course, the penalty attached to the Treasury
consent rules was, in theory at least, imprisonment. However, as I said
earlier, in 58 years that has never been used. So I think that this is
going to be an effective measure. It is going to be simpler to operate
and will provide the information that we
need.</div><a name="09061028000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000501"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> One assumes that a fine is a deterrent: the whole
concept of fining someone for not doing something is to ensure that
they do what you wish them to do. I need to understand how much of a
deterrent a fine of &#163;300 will be to international financiers,
because I do not get it. Perhaps the Minister could explain how that
will act as a deterrent to stop someone failing to report what the
Government want them to report.</div>
<a name="09061028000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000502"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> That is an obligation in law with which companies
must comply. The hon. Gentleman will know that the various reporting
obligations we have imposed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>to tackle avoidance have been effective and, I am glad to say, people
have complied with the rules. Of course, there is a pretty big
incentive for the kind of companies we are talking about to comply with
rules clearly set out in statute, not least because of the
embarrassment for major organisations when they do not comply with
rules of that kind. He will know that we propose to name and shame in
some circumstances where tax is underpaid. That will be a powerful
inventive not only for individuals, but for companies.</div>
<a name="09061028000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">If someone
avoids tax, they are at risk of a tax-geared penalty for tax not paid
as a result of the underlying transaction, and that can be up to 100
per cent. of the tax avoided. With regard to the level of &#163;300,
it is appropriate that that penalty should be consistent with the rest
of the penalty system that is in place. I would not want the hon.
Gentleman to think, however, that that is the only downside of not
meeting the obligation being
imposed.</div><a name="09061028000306"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000503"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I thank the Minister for that thoughtful response. I
totally accept that we have to move away from a consent system to a
reporting system in an age when millions of pounds can be transacted at
the touch of a computer button. I also accept that modern business
needs a different system and agree with him that it needs to be a
robust and stringent system that ensures that everyone pays due tax and
that, none the less, business functions as efficiently as it
can.</div>
<a name="09061028000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
pathetic nature of the fine, we explored the possibility of tabling an
amendment on that. I understand that there are some technical reasons
why that might be difficult, but it is still a preposterous penalty.
Although we were unable to table an amendment, we might need to take
another look at what we can do to beef up the penalties for people who
flagrantly disregard the legislation as the Minister wishes it to work.
I do not think he really responded to my point that the reporting
regime is lax, and nor did he really respond to my point that in
paragraph 9 we are not so much closing loopholes as drilling more. We
will have to revisit that topic on Report.</div>
<a name="09061028000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has made some interesting points that are pertinent to my amendments.
He discussed how HMRC is best to conduct itself when investigating tax
avoidance and what is the most efficient use of the Revenue. That is
certainly an issue that has cropped up in the Public Accounts
Committee. I am aware that HMRC wants to target those areas where it
will get the best results, although it remains the case that tax
avoidance, at any level, should be prevented, and big companies should
certainly be prevented from parcelling up their businesses into smaller
units to avoid the reporting restrictions.</div>
<a name="09061028000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Underlying
that is the other question of how business and the taxation system can
best exist in the modern world, and the Minister, reasonably, is trying
to suggest that he has the recipe right, but I am not completely
convinced. He has pointed out that some of the evils to which I am
drawing attention and that appear to be omitted by schedule 17 are
addressed in some way and in other parts of Bill. I will have to go
away and investigate that and consider whether that claim is fairly or
adequately made. For the moment, however, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000506"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> These are relatively small amendments, so I will
not spend a huge amount of time talking about them. The objective of
the group of amendments is to try to tighten the rules for reporting
transactions and to be clear about the circumstances in which
transactions will be
reported.</div><a name="09061028000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
161 would simply insert the word &#147;or&#148; between
sub-paragraph (2)(c) and (d) in paragraph 8 on page 190. Sub-paragraph
(2)(c) and (d) refer to a transfer of an economic interest. It would be
one type of transfer or another, rather than (c) and (d) applying
sequentially.</div><a name="09061028000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
160 would create some certainty that commissioners will not seek to
expand the event or transaction set out in paragraph 8(2)(a) to (d)
unless they do so through primary legislation. This is a probing
amendment. I am interested in understanding a bit more from the
Minister as to why he feels that the power in sub-paragraph (2)(e) is
necessary.</div><a name="09061028000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
162 is a drafting amendment. Paragraph 4(2) refers to an
&#147;event or transaction&#148;, whereas paragraph 9 on
page 190 refers to a transaction. Should it refer to an &#147;event
or transaction&#148;? This is very much a drafting
amendment.</div><a name="09061028000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
163 would provide some clarity that there is no obligation to report
the creation of a legal or equitable mortgage over the shares of a
foreign subsidiary or the giving of a guarantee to a foreign
subsidiary. If they were specifically excluded, it might reduce the
number of transactions that could be reported. The Minister may suggest
that such an exemption might give rise to some tax-paying
opportunities. I would like to hear his thoughts on the
matter.</div><a name="09061028000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
164 and 165 relate to the transitional provision in paragraph 14. I
would like to hear from the Minister how he expects it to work in
practice. On amendment 164, the problem is that companies have six
months from the day on which transactions took place to report them.
Regulations may be introduced that lead to that reporting period being
eroded. It may be less than six months&#151;in effect, a kind of
technical retrospection. I am not sure whether that is the
Government&#146;s intention in paragraph 14(1).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div><a name="09061028000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 165
seeks to tighten up reporting on the transition, again in respect of
regulations that are made under the schedule. In part, these are
probing amendments, to see if we can focus on the schedule to try to
reduce the volume of transactions that can be reported and to ensure
that companies are not caught out having to report transactions in less
than a six-month period because of regulations that may be
made.</div><a name="09061028000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000507"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I shall be brief. Amendments 160 to 162 concern the
regulation-making powers in the schedule. The first two would remove
HMRC&#146;s power to widen the scope of the reporting requirement in
the light of commercial or legal developments. The new post-transaction
reporting requirement is targeted at areas that pose a significant risk
of tax avoidance in order to ensure that HMRC receives the information
that it needs to deal with tax avoidance, but amendments 160 and 161
would remove the ability to ensure that those provisions track
commercial or legal changes. That could give rise to new tax avoidance
opportunities and undermine the purpose of the requirement. We want to
be sure that the schedule can target areas of significant avoidance
risk, and that it can be used for future avoidance opportunities as
they arise.</div>
<a name="09061028000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 162
would give HMRC additional powers to narrow the scope of the reporting
requirement by extending the excluding power in paragraph 9 to cover
events as well as transactions, but the only event reportable under
schedule 17 is a foreign subsidiary entering into a partnership. For
the provision to be effective, HMRC would first have to introduce new
reportable events using the regulatory power in paragraph 8(2)(e). In
effect, the amendment would give a circular result, which makes it
unnecessary.</div>
<a name="09061028000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 163
seeks to insert two additional definitions in the schedule that would
exclude guarantees and transfers by way of security from the reporting
transactions. The schedule already contains exclusions for giving
securities to financial institutions, including guarantees and
transfers of securities in that context, so the additional definitions
are not necessary.</div>
<a name="09061028000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Fareham explained, amendments 164 and 165 are about the
transitional provisions in paragraph 14 of schedule 17.
Amendment 164 would ensure that companies have at least six
months to make a report under the new rules in the event that
regulations are not in force by 1 July. I reassure the hon. Gentleman
that the amendment is not necessary. The regulations have been drafted
and were sent to the House last Thursday, after the amendment was
tabled. We can therefore be confident that the regulations will come
into force on 1 July, when the schedule&#146;s provisions commence.
The transitional provision also allows for regulations made under the
schedule within one year of the Bill&#146;s enactment to have effect
from 1 July 2009. Amendment 165 would prevent that from applying to
additional categories of reportable transactions specified by the
regulations. However, it is appropriate for the transitional provision
to apply evenly to all the regulation-making powers in the event that a
new avoidance opportunity was detected by HMRC in the next year, which
is quite
possible.</div><a name="09061028000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
will the retrospection interact with the deadlines for reports if HMRC
included a new reportable transaction? We would be happy to abide by
the six-month time 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>limit. For example, if the regulations were amended on 1 June 2010 to
include a new reportable transaction, it would apply only to
transactions undertaken after 1 December 2009. That might be of
some reassurance. In practice, I would not expect new reportable
transactions to be added in the next 12 months, but we need to be sure
that we can address tax avoidance and protect the Exchequer if the need
arises.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000511"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I will give some background before dealing with the
individual amendments. Clause 39 deals with a technical aspect of the
rules and is meant to tackle the issue that certain distributions from
offshore funds are economically similar to payments of interest. It is
intended to ensure that distributions of that type are taxed as if they
are payments of
interest.</div><a name="09061028000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue arises because of the differential in the tax rates for UK
residents and domiciled individuals between dividends, which are taxed
at 32.5 per cent., and other forms of income, which are taxed at 40 per
cent. Until now, offshore funds, particularly those formed as
corporates, were able to pay out a dividend to UK investors that would
be taxed at 32.5 per cent. That was the case even when the offshore
fund was invested primarily in debt assets that in substance paid out
an interest return. In contrast, UK funds are required to distinguish
between dividend distributions and interest distributions, with
interest distributions being taxed at 40 per
cent.</div><a name="09061028000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
39 seeks to address that disparity by introducing a bond fund test for
offshore funds. Individual UK investors will be required to distinguish
between distributions received from bond funds and from non-bond funds
for any distributions paid on or after 22 April 2009. The bond fund
test is derived from the test that UK corporates are required to apply
to their investments. Broadly, an offshore fund that at any point
during an accounting period has more than 60 per cent. of its assets
invested in interest-bearing securities will be deemed a bond fund. The
impact of that is that any decision made by a bond fund in relation to
the profits of that period will be deemed an interest distribution.
That will help the UK investment management industry by reducing the
disparities in the taxation of distributions from onshore and offshore
funds.</div><a name="09061028000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Budget
notes 21 and 22, which underpin this measure, state that the intentions
behind these changes are to enable individuals with holdings of 10 per
cent. or more in non-UK resident companies to become entitled to a
non-payable tax credit on dividends from such holdings, and to restore
the non-payable dividend tax credit for offshore funds that are largely
invested in equities, subject to certain conditions. However, as the
clause is drafted, it is not clear whether the tax credit is available
in respect of a distribution from an offshore fund that fails to meet a
non-qualifying investments test where a distribution is made to a
minority shareholder in an offshore fund with authorised share
capital&#151;that is condition A&#151;or an offshore fund in a
qualifying territory&#151;that is condition C. Amendment 171 would
make clear the application of
that.</div><a name="09061028000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
174 addresses the problem that requirements to measure whether an
offshore fund fails to meet the qualifying investments test at any time
during an accounting period are over-burdensome. It is likely to prove
impossible for funds to comply with those requirements in practice. It
is the &#147;at any time&#148; point that I am trying to address
with the amendment. It is quite a lengthy amendment because it would
introduce new subsections (3), (3A) and (3B) to try to make the process
smoother.</div><a name="09061028000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
section 378A will introduce to the Income Tax (Trading and Other
Income) Act 2005 a tax credit for dividends paid by offshore funds.
However, as I said, the tax rate is not available if the offshore fund
fails the qualifying investments test at any time during the accounting
period. If the test is failed, the dividend will be taxed at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>the income tax rates applicable to interest. As I said earlier, the
offshore fund will fail the qualifying assets test if, at any time
during its accounting period, the market value of the qualifying
investments exceeds 60 per cent. of the market value of all
its investments.</div>
<a name="09061028000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Qualifying
investments&#148; means interest-bearing instruments and instruments
such as derivatives that relate to the performance of interest-bearing
investments. The definition of qualifying investment also includes
interest on funds that could fail the qualifying investments test. When
paying a dividend, an offshore fund will need to let its shareholders
know whether the test has been failed so that it can file proper tax
returns and pay the appropriate rate of
tax.</div><a name="09061028000389"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="09061028000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
offshore fund may hold a complex, extensive and constantly changing
portfolio of assets. To ensure that the qualified investment test is
met at any time, the fund will have to ascertain daily the market value
of each underlying asset, which is over-burdensome. For a fund of
funds, such a level of monitoring would prove impossible. It will not
have the information on the underlying funds.</div>
<a name="09061028000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">A similar
test exists in relation to offshore funds held by UK companies. In
practice, that may be invoked relatively infrequently, because a UK
company is not a common vehicle through which investments in offshore
funds are made. Extending a test to apply to all shareholders in an
offshore fund will require many more funds to operate those
requirements. The amendment would impose a workable monitoring
requirement that remains sufficiently rigorous to leave little or no
scope for
abuse.</div><a name="09061028000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
175 asks whether a requirement to measure whether an offshore fund
fails to meet the qualifying investments test during a relevant
accounting period is over-complicated. In this case, the problem stems
from the definition of a relevant period of accounting, which is either
the accounting period ending prior to the payment of the dividend if
there are undistributed profits available to that period or, otherwise,
the accounting period in which the dividend is paid. That is quite a
complex definition because it will require significant record keeping
on the part of the offshore fund. It may result, in relation to the
second limb of the test, in a mismatch between the data on which the
fund is able to inform its shareholder that the qualifying test has
been met or failed, and the data on which an investor must file a tax
return.</div><a name="09061028000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
use 2009 as an example, if a fund had a calendar-based accounting
period and paid a dividend in January 2009, it will not know until some
time after 31 December 2009 whether the qualifying investments test was
met for the period. However, the dividend must be included in the tax
return for the year ending 5 April 2009. That could give rise to a
situation in which a fund is not given enough time in which to carry
out its calculations and report to investors before the tax return is
due.</div>
<a name="09061028000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 175
would alter the Bill so that an offshore fund could measure whether it
has satisfied the qualifying investment test by reference to its
investment strategy in the accounting period immediately prior to the
payment of the dividend. We are trying, with the amendments, to
simplify things for investors in the funds while maintaining the spirit
and purpose of the clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000512"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> Briefly,
by way of background, during the process of extending the dividend tax
credit to portfolio investments last year, it became apparent that some
funds were seeking to exploit the measure by locating their cash or
bond fund ranges offshore to gain a tax advantage for their UK
investors. The Government amended last year&#146;s Bill to prevent
investors in offshore funds from receiving the dividend tax credit and
said that we would continue to examine the issue in the context of
reform of personal dividend taxation and modernisation of the offshore
funds regime.</div>
<a name="09061028000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
further work, the Government are making further changes to the
treatment of distributions from offshore funds as part of the personal
dividends tax reform package. Clause 39 addresses distributions made by
offshore funds when more than 60 per cent. is invested in
interest-bearing assets. Distributed income from such funds will be
taxed at the same rate as income from interest-bearing assets held
directly, and income from interest-bearing assets held through a UK
fund.</div>
<a name="09061028000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
respond to the group of amendments to which the hon. Gentleman spoke in
a few moments. Government amendment 89 has been tabled to ensure that
clause 39 operates as intended. That does not represent a change in
Government policy. However, after the Bill was published last month,
technical questions were raised about whether the clause fully achieved
its purpose.</div>
<a name="09061028000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 89
is to ensure that dividends received from an offshore fund that holds
more than 60 per cent. of its assets in interest-bearing assets, are
taxed as interests and not as dividends which would be eligible for the
dividend tax credit. Specifically, doubt was raised as to whether the
charged tax as interest took priority over the charged tax as a
dividend, and whether the tax credit had been disapplied. The amendment
puts the matter beyond doubt. It introduces a technical, consequential
subsection to a section that determines the priority of various taxing
provisions, and ensures that the clause operates as intended.</div>
<a name="09061028000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
that the amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman seek to address
potential ambiguities in the current text of the clause. In relation to
amendment 171, the Government agree that the dividend tax
credit should not be available to income from offshore funds that are
mainly invested in interest-bearing assets. In practice, however, the
Government believe that the amendment required is a little broader,
ensuring that the treatment of dividends paid by the funds as interest
for tax purposes must displace any treatment as a dividend that would
otherwise apply. That is achieved by the Government&#146;s amendment,
as I have
explained.</div><a name="09061028000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attempt to clarify
the legislation in schedule 19, with the signposting suggested in
amendment 172. However, that amendment is unnecessary, we believe,
because Government amendment 89 should provide the clarity
that it seeks to effect.</div>
<a name="09061028000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 174
seeks to dilute the test for offshore funds not being treated as paying
interest to UK investors. However, the amendment would mean that the
test, in relation to qualifying investments for investors liable to
income tax, would be out of line with the test applying to corporate
investors in both offshore and onshore funds. That would add to
complexity, rather than reduce it. The Government are willing to
consider changes that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>would be beneficial, but any change must be consistent and we do not
believe that that change is. We would be happy to receive
representations on how the test could be further improved, provided
that the improvements would apply the principles equally to individual
and corporate holders, as well as onshore and offshore holdings. Those
that follow these deliberations closely will, I am sure, want to make
representations to us on the
matter.</div><a name="09061028000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
amendment 175 attempts to simplify subsection (5), we do not believe
that it works. If accepted, the amendment would mean that an interim
dividend paid out of current period income would have to be related to
an earlier period of account even though the income distributed arose
in the current period. That makes the targeting of the legislation
ineffective.</div>
<a name="09061028000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to amendment 174, the hon. Gentleman raised a point about the
&#147;any time&#148; requirement, saying that it was too strict.
The requirement is built in to ensure that funds cannot spend some or
most of the relevant period invested in interest-bearing assets, and
then exploit the rules for their investors by switching their
investments. It is closely modelled on the existing test applying to
corporate investors in a fund, whether onshore or offshore, so we do
not believe that it will present any difficulty.</div>
<a name="09061028000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman raised the point that a fund would not know until after 31
December 2009 whether it applied, but that the information would need
to be in the tax return and there was not enough time to check. Tax
returns for individuals for the tax year 2009-10 do not have to be
submitted until 31 January 2011, if they are sent online, so there is
sufficient time for investors to get the right amount on their tax
returns.</div><a name="09061028000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman suggested that the test for onshore might be unworkable.
The onshore test is slightly different, but it does have an &#147;at
any time&#148; provision, which we believe will work well. Funds
generally value their investments on a regular basis, so that investors
know the value of their investments. Therefore, I do not believe that
there is any additional significant administrative burden as a result
of the measures that we are
introducing.</div><a name="09061028000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000513"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister makes an important point about the
regular valuation of funds. Clearly, any investor wishing to sell their
holding in a fund would look for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>valuation at the point of sale. Let us say that a fund is valued on a
weekly basis for the purpose of enabling investors to sell their
holding or to acquire further units in a fund. So long as it was
measured at the point at which there was a valuation, would that be
sufficiently often to cover the &#147;at any time&#148; basis?
There may be funds that are valued on a daily basis, a weekly basis or
a monthly basis. I imagine that so long as the fund was in compliance
at the date at which it did its valuation for normal commercial
practice, that would satisfy the &#147;at any time&#148;
point.</div><a name="09061028000363"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000514"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My understanding is that that is indeed the case.
However, if I have any further information, I will be happy to supply
it. I hope that I have explained why the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments, although well intentioned, are not required. I am happy to
confirm that the answer to his question is yes, so my officials advise
me, unless evidence showed that that did not reflect the truth. I
therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061028000364"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061028000515"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That was a helpful explanation from the Minister
about the flaws in the drafting of my amendments. It is important that
there is consistency between corporate and personal investors where
possible and between on and offshore funds. He has reassured me that
