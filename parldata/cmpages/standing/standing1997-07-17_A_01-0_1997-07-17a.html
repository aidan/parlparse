<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we begin consideration of the Bill, we need first to consider the resolution of the Business Sub-Committee, which met last night. The text of the Sub-Committee's resolution appears at the back of the amendment paper for today's sitting on pages 45 and 46. I am told that the resolution should have been printed on the front of the amendment paper but, notwithstanding its position, it is our first business today.
<P>
Before I call the Minister formally to move the appropriate resolution, I should remind colleagues that, in accordance with Standing Order No. 120(5), there can be no debate on the resolution of the Business Sub-Committee, which is as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, except so far as may be otherwise provided by a Resolution of this Sub-Committee as agreed to by the Standing Committee and subject to the Order of the House [14 July]--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 sittings in all shall be allotted to the consideration of the Finance Bill by the Standing Committee;
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Standing Committee shall meet--

<P>
Motion made, and Question put forthwith, pursuant to the Order [14th July]:
<P>
That the Committee do agree with the Business Sub-Committee in its resolution--[Ms D. Primarolo.]
<P>
Question agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have several announcements to make to the Committee. Copies of the Ways and Means resolution on which the Bill is founded are in the Room. There is also a money resolution in connection with the Bill, which is set out at the end of the same document. As a general rule, I do not propose to call amendments of which proper notice has not been given. In general, that means that neither I nor my co-Chairman will call starred amendments. However, as the order in which the Bill is to be taken was not known to members of the Committee generally until this morning, I and my co-Chairman will apply that ruling flexibly. Members of the Committee will notice that one starred amendment has been selected for consideration today. Nonetheless, I urge colleagues not to impose too far on my generosity.
<P>
Finally, in accordance with the very long-standing tradition, right hon. and hon. Members will wish to know that green boxes are available in which to store their papers. The filing cabinet behind me on my right that contains those boxes will be locked between sittings, so that members of the Committee can leave their papers in the Committee Room and not have to cart around masses of documents.
<P>
<H5>10.31 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Perhaps it is now appropriate, on behalf of the Committee, for me to welcome you, Mr. McWilliam, to the Chair, and, in due course, your co-Chairman, Mrs. Winterton. We regret the speed with which the Committee will have to deal with the Bill but, given that that was decided by the House, there is no prospect of re-opening the matter.
<P>
We note that the Government have already tabled amendments to the Bill; we feel that that is the result of the haste in which it was drafted and because it is having to proceed so swiftly through its stages. In the spirit of openness and goodwill, however, I wish to say that Conservative Members look forward to having a constructive debate in Committee. There are not as many of us as there used to be in Finance Bill Committees, a fact that we shall rectify in the years ahead. For now, however, we want to engage with the Government in giving the Bill appropriate scrutiny. It is not an insignificant Bill; it is a major tax-raising measure and we hope that, in the short time that is available to us, we can subject each clause and schedule to close examination. I reiterate my particular welcome to you, Mr. McWilliam. I know that you will guide us throughout our proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Dawn Primarolo): Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. May I welcome you to the Committee; I should also like to welcome Mrs. Winterton, who will be assisting you. You are an experienced Chair and you will keep us in order. I wish to welcome the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) to the Committee. I also welcome the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and other hon. Gentlemen, who will bring their experience to bear in our deliberations. I am sure that it will assist our scrutiny of the Bill. I also welcome to the Committee my hon. Friends, many of whom were first elected to Parliament in 1997. The Bill will be scrutinised thoroughly, and the Government will give the Opposition what information we can to ensure that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Spurious points of order are always to be deplored. Nevertheless, I thank the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady for their kind remarks. I may tell the right hon. Gentleman that I see today as many Members in the Finance Bill Committee as I have ever seen--of whatever variety.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Companies Benefitting from Windfalls</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 2, line 11, leave out `in the United Kingdom'.
<P>
By way of preface, Mr. McWilliam, I add my congratulations--or, perhaps, my commiserations--to you on your assuming the chairmanship of the Committee with your co-Chairman, Mrs. Winterton.
<P>
We want constructive debates, and the Member for Wells as my right hon. Friend said, we regret that some of our debates have been attenuated. However, we will not compound that problem by undue prolixity. Our particular objection is to the lack of time. My experience since the general election is distinctly different from that before it as I have had to write my own speeches either very early in the morning or late at night. I make no complaint about that, except to apologise for any lack of felicity--or even of detailed research on a narrow point--because the resources of the Treasury or other Departments are not available to me. Subject to those constraints, however, it is important that we should be able to make our point.
<P>
I can tell the Financial Secretary to the Treasury that there has been at least a small improvement in Government behaviour since my first experience of a Finance Bill. Some hon. Members may remember that I said in the Budget debate that no one could have had greater or longer experience than me of a Finance Bill Committee stage. It was in 1968--I suspect in this Room--that a Finance Bill first came to a Standing Committee. The Labour Government of the day guillotined the whole Bill--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Would all hon. Members please ensure that pagers, bleepers and so on are either in silent mode or switched off. Madam Speaker has ruled very strongly on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That interruption may have been a protest, Mr. McWilliam--rather retrospective, but appropriate--at the conduct of the then Labour Government. I remind the Committee that in 1968, albeit after much debate, the Bill was guillotined in Committee and the special charge then applied to certain taxpayers was passed without any debate. That was regrettable, but it was in the past; today we have to deal with the Bill before us.
<P>
I would like to say, not least because I had a slight and uncharacteristic flurry with the Financial Secretary when considering the Bill in the Committee of the whole House, that I regard our amendments as being essentially of three kinds, although any one amendment may embody all three factors. Those who have been in opposition will be familiar with the first; such amendments are a platform for a general debate on the Government's intentions. We would wish, particularly on a major matter such as this, which so concerns companies and their shareholders, to look at the reasons for the windfall tax and whether the Government are aware of some of its damaging consequences.
<P>
The second kind of amendment is the probing amendment, which seeks to winkle out from the Government what is happening; if our lay eyes observe something rather odd, we can ask what it is.
<P>
The third kind of amendment--I defer to those of my hon. Friends who are greater professionals or technicians in these matters than me--enables us to raise specific problems which are put to us by professional associations or institutes and which require a specific and detailed answer.
<P>
I flag up those factors so that all members of the Committee are aware of the ground rules--subject of course, always, Mr. McWilliam, to the requirements of the Chair. For instance, some of the specific points made yesterday--on verbal contracts and health insurance--were not fully answered.
<P>
We debated the principle behind clause 1 in the Committee of the whole House; amendment No. 11 now enables us to consider the companies that are affected by the windfall tax. Conservative Members do not see an absolute distinction between a company and its shareholders--a view that is shared by Professor John Kay, who is close to the governing party. We realise that there is, if not an identity, a strong association between a company and its shareholders--a tax that is imposed on a company will somehow have to be paid out of the shareholders' pockets. That is an important consideration for us to bear in mind during the debates on the clause.
<P>
The amendment, which would remove the words ``in the United Kingdom'', is our attempt to introduce a number of concepts. As we are at the beginning of our discussions on the clause, it is important to set out the background to it, and I have two points to make about that. The first concerns the huge internationalisation of the securities industry over recent years. Exchange controls have been progressively abolished within the European Union and widely relaxed in other parts of the world as the damage that they do is beginning to be understood. I seem to recall that about one third of the turnover of German securities occurs not in Frankfurt but in London--I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) will either confirm or qualify that assertion.
<P>
Equally, portfolio holdings are not confined merely to this country. As was said on the Floor of the House, not only do a large proportion of pension funds--the major institutional investors--have overseas securities, but individual private investors have them either directly or through institutions. It is hardly germane formally to declare an interest, but I have a small collection of overseas securities, including one that has gone through successive tranches of privatisation.
<P>
That is a general point about the fact that we can no longer do things in the United Kingdom without reference to what goes on in the rest of the world. My second point is that the programme of privatisation--the concept and even the word--derives from the previous Governments initiatives in the early 1980s, of which the most epoch-making was the sale of British Telecom in 1984. Thirteen years down the track, that process is now subject to some retrospective imposition. Nevertheless, the idea of selling publicly owned assets to the private sector, paying off debts, relieving pressure on the Treasury--especially in relation to competition for capital from other public priorities--regulating output and controlling prices where appropriate has spread from the large seed that was the BT privatisation, not merely within the United Kingdom, but throughout the world.
<P>
I have closely followed the affairs of central and eastern Europe since the collapse of the communist system. In those countries, privatisation has happened either by voucher, by negotiation or, not to put it too delicately, by preferred allocation--``I think I'll have that one, if you don't mind.''
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In western Europe, where securities markets and public compliance are better accepted, a driving factor has been the need for Governments to adjust their public finances to comply with, for example, the conditions of the Maastricht treaty. One way of doing that has been to sell off public assets--to privatise them. However, the matter goes much wider than that and includes, for example, offers for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation. I was in Indonesia last year. Privatisation is now a worldwide concept, but it was made in Britain and exported to the whole world. Of course, privatisation is not simply a matter of financial adjustment; it also introduces private sector management techniques and competitive skills.
<P>
I attended the east midlands rail forum which was recently held in Northampton. Indeed, I was the only Member of Parliament to attend it--presumably I was not the only one asked, but I was the only one who chose to turn up. Given the political opposition that we faced on the process and the relatively short time that has elapsed since its initiation, I was genuinely interested to hear about the way in which rail privatisation was beginning to work. From the operators of the midland mainline and from other operators, we heard of the promise of improved train services--more trains, faster trains, better and more comfortable trains. We also heard about the beginnings of the re-enlivenment of the rail freight sector, which is a personal interest of mine.
<P>
We were hearing good news, and I say that not with triumphalism, but because the new Labour Government seem to have embraced the concept of privatisation. They were slow learners, but they have learnt, and we are grateful for that. They are prepared to take privatisation forward in certain cases. That is germane to another amendment on the date of operation of any windfall tax. I regret the fact that, with the introduction of the windfall tax in the very cradle of privatisation--the place that gave the concept to the world--we are now seeking to foul our own nest with a series of retrospective changes. Those changes send a bad signal to the world and prejudice future privatisation in this country.
<P>
I do not want to belabour the matter, but I shall make some specific points on the amendment. I draw Treasury Ministers' attention to the fact that clause 2 refers to ``an offer of shares''. Clause 5--the definitions clause--states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```share' includes any right to require the issue of a share''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a rights issue to claim a share. However, in other parts of the Bill reference is made to partial disposal of shares. That is not a problem, but I assume that the definition of shares in the Bill is the same as that given in the Companies Act because companies can have a range of share capital--I hardly dare say it, but even the Chinese have A and B shares. British companies may have A, B, and preference shares, or any range of them, all of which may carry various rights. In certain cases, those rights to shares, or their format, will be bundled up--one such example involves American depository receipts.
<P>
I am concerned about whether a single offering of shares, however defined, will trigger the windfall procedure. I should like the Government to explain that and give us assurances. There could be cases--I am not sure that there have been--in which not all the shares would be offered in a particular class. For example, would an offering of preference shares without an offering of the equity trigger the windfall procedure and, if so, what would happen?
<P>
The fact that some offers may have been made outside the United Kingdom is also germane to the amendment; they were not made exclusively outside the United Kingdom, but we are pleased that we involved foreign shareholders. In some cases, a particular class of share might have been offered only abroad. Although I am not a lawyer--I think that that will be apparent to the Committee--I am concerned about references in the Bill to offers made to the public in the United Kingdom because I have a horrible, non-lawyerly feeling that if one specifies something, one excludes something else. Can we be sure of the ground rules about whether that specification applies to offers for shares, whatever they are and however they are defined, only in the United Kingdom? Will shares that were sold in the United Kingdom and other countries also be covered? I shall deal later with the subject of the equity of taxing the UK shareholder when a foreign shareholder of the same security may escape taxation.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gigg) and for Grantham and Stamford made the point about double-tax treaties in an earlier debate. Given that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee welcome American and world-wide inward investment into the United Kingdom, will the Government now address more satisfactorily than they did in the earlier debate the fact that the windfall tax is treated as a levy on capital, so will not be rebatable to individual investors or to corporate overseas investors, despite the existence of tax treaties? It is remarkable that Britain has the best portfolio of double-tax treaties in the world. My right hon. Friend the Member of Fylde (Mr. Jack), as the then Financial Secretary, stated in a press release on 12 February this year that we were the first country to have reached a century of double-tax agreements. Today's Order Paper contains four further motions, in the name of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to approve double-tax treaties in respect of Malaysia and Singapore, the Falkland Islands and Lesotho. However, notwithstanding the existence of those double-tax treaties which attempt to shield the overseas investor from the depredations of the UK Treasury, there is no relief for them under the Bill.
<P>
The Bill is drafted for United Kingdom investors, who will be paying the tax. Some of my hon. Friends, now that they know the basis for the operation of the windfall tax, may want to draw the Committee's attention to its impact on particular companies, utilities and others that operate in their own area. We did not have that information before the election; it was studiously denied us. However it is now possible to derive it, more or less, from the Red Book, the Budget statement and the Bill. One reason we tabled the amendment is that United Kingdom investors investing in United Kingdom companies will, as the proprietors of those companies, pay tax through the company; yet United Kingdom investors who chose to take out shares in overseas companies that have been privatised--a procedure they learnt from Britain--will not pay tax. That may apply to United Kingdom residents and taxpayers who are also directors of overseas privatised companies and who may have benefited directly from the privatisation process abroad--I have a particular individual in mind. So unless the poor old United Kingdom investor has taken the money and run--as the Paymaster General and other members of the Committee will know, there is a sharp turnover in such securities--he will pay an element of windfall tax. People such as one or two members of my family, who have loyally subscribed to past privatisation issues and who, being rather passive investors, have stuck with the shares, now find that they will pay an element of windfall tax.
<P>
If they had been really smart and had invested in an overseas privatisation, or had been a director of a company overseas, they could be as fat a cat as they liked, but they would not pay a penny in UK windfall tax. They would have gone outside the jurisdiction and escaped the tax. It is likely to be the more sophisticated investor who has done that. So there is the apparent inequity that the home-grown investor, loyally subscribing to a privatisation issue, will suffer, while the person who has the ability to invest abroad may make greater uncovenanted profits--windfalls, as the Government would describe them--but will not suffer at all.
<P>
Despite some appearance to the contrary--which is why I will listen to the Government's response before seeking to press the amendment--I would not want the Committee to think that I want to extend the privilege of paying the windfall tax to United Kingdom investors in overseas securities. My point is that investment is worldwide. An attempt to tax UK windfalls--because it is the only cudgel in the Government's locker to finance their welfare-to-work programme, and because it is the only kind of windfall that they can capture,--is inequitable.
<P>
That is merely a subset of the continuing anomalies and difficulties of the windfall tax. The Government believe that a one-off tax--fair or unfair--will somehow fund a continuing programme. According to the Red Book, that programme will run for four years at more or less an even rate, and then it appears to stop abruptly. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells may well want to say something later about what will happen when the proceeds of the windfall tax run out, and to seek assurances from the Government.
<P>
I referred earlier to the incoherence of the distinction between companies and their shareholders. I know that it is never easy to hammer out a perfect system that completely mirrors everybody's rights and responsibilities, takes account of the different tax rates of different taxpayers and aligns that with corporate taxation--that is difficult to achieve. However, the windfall tax, together with the advance corporation tax changes, represents a major grab on the corporate sector and--the final anomaly--will hit the individual shareholder very hard.
<P>
People in Britain can choose whether they invest in Britain or abroad. The windfall tax--imposed because it is the only bit of proceeds that the Government can grab--sends a bad signal to British investors to invest abroad. It also sends a bad signal to overseas investors about the probity and consistency of the Government's conduct of tax affairs. It is not a sensible way to proceed: it would be far better to recognise the reality, which is that investment is international. That is recognised by our acceptance of the concept of double tax agreements. The Government should withdraw the tax, or find an equitable basis on which to impose it.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> There are a large number of members of the Committee for whom it must be their first Standing Committee. If they have any concerns about procedure, or want to know how to do anything, perhaps they would have a word with me or the Clerk, because we would be delighted to help.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I point out that if the hon. Members do not rise in their places, I cannot call them to speak.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that we have just witnessed an extraordinary procedure.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Nobody was standing in his or her place. The procedure is that if no one stands, no one wants to speak and I should therefore put the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam. In my amazement, I made a slip of the tongue. There was certainly no problem of procedure, but those on the Treasury Bench are going about this Bill in an extraordinary way. Ministers do not appear to be able to answer my questions, although that is consistent with what has happened before. I wish to be charitable to them, and therefore suggest that they have not quite got their act together yet but will prepare an answer that, subject to the rules of order, they can give during the clause stand part debate.
<P>
I have no wish to rehearse again the points I have just made. However, I want to make two more points, which are quite different--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is appropriate in Standing Committee to give whoever is speaking some quiet so that I can hear what is going on even if no one else can.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My two points are different in nature, one administrative and the other substantive. First, I expect the words in a Bill to be spelt correctly. It would be unbelievably tedious of me to put down a pompous amendment suggesting that the Government's spelling needed to be corrected, although I recall that I did so once on a water Bill when the genitive of ``it'' appeared of ``it''. I pointed out that that was the Shakespearean genitive of ``it'', as in the line, ``it had it head'' bit off by young, in ``King Lear''. I shall not continue in that vein today.
<P>
My problem is that I expect Bills to have the right spelling. If I see something that I think is wrong, I have to go and check it. There appears to be something of a theological difficulty over the spelling of benefiting. This may be into the territory of Big-Endians and the Little-Endians but my immediate instinct is that to spell it benefiting or benefited is the English version. I appear to have powerful allies, even among the House authorities, but it would probably be out of order for me to refer to them.
<P>
The Treasury, however, seems to prefer ``benefitting''--with a double ``t''. I do not think that that is right. Word processors have--thank goodness--become universal during the past few years, and spellcheckers equally so, but a lot of them operate on the American model. The Americans spell benefiting with two ts, and I do not like it. I do not like American authority, and sometimes I do not like American syntax. I hate ``meet up with'' when ``meet'' would do. American syntax nearly always leads to greater length, as it does in ``benefitting''. No doubt one could put down a parliamentary question about the cost to the Exchequer of printing the redundant letter.
<P>
Sometimes, of course, the Americans get it right--and cost efficient--as with ``harbor'' and ``honor''. Of course, there is no ``honour'' in the Bill, and ``dishonour'' does not appear either, so I cannot test whether they would have been spelt correctly. Not to belabour the point further, I merely do not like ``benefitting'' and should be grateful if, with the aid of the Clerk and parliamentary counsel, it could be gently investigated.
<P>
Turning to the substantive point, Mr. McWilliam, you, in your wisdom, saw fit not to select amendment No. 12. One of our concerns about clause 2 is that, however hard the Government have tried--and I appreciate that they have tried, for the good reason that they know about judicial review and Pepper v. Hart; and they seem to have taken the fifth amendment on my amendment so as not to say too much and get themselves into difficulties--they have not actually listed the companies that will be affected by the clause.
<P>
The Committee will remember that the Labour party issued a statement on the flotation of Railtrack. Some of my hon. Friends have already pointed out that the Labour party made no comment at the time on the impact of the windfall tax on that company. So a company has been privatised on the basis of assurances given by the Labour party as to its policy but no central assurance was given. I maintain, therefore, that there is a material breach of trust. The legitimate expectations of subscribers to shares in Railtrack--of which, as a then Minister, I should make clear I was not one--have been frustrated. Those subscribers were sold shares on a false or incomplete prospectus and now face a windfall levy that was not specified when the opportunity so to specify, even in general terms, was open to the Labour party. That is extraordinary. It is legally disturbing to my lay mind, it is bad in principle and I find it necessary to press the Government for an explanation.
<P>
Any such measure is bound to throw up anomalies. I have mentioned some of those anomalies in my remarks so far but I believe that other anomalies will emerge during the course of our debates--for example, in relation to the first schedule to the Bill. I believe that the practice of not levelling with the country--by admitting that there would be a windfall tax but saying that no details would be given until later--has compounded the uncertainty. Above all, the problem for the individual elector or shareholder is that, in aiming to hit with hindsight a target of some years ago--many years ago, in some cases--when that target is no longer in the frame, the Government will inevitably inflict collateral damage on other persons who happened to hold shares when the music stopped on 2 July.
<P>
As most of those shares will have been held by pension funds at the operative date, most of the shares' beneficiaries will be actual or prospective pensioners who will end up being branded by the Government as fat cats. The chain of causation by which that takes place is comparatively restricted but unless the Government convince me to the contrary, it is clear that, in one way or another, those shareholders will end up paying
<P>
One possible way in which they may not is at the expense of their investment programmes. We have seen the estimated impact on those companies and, over and above the requirements of the regulator, their investment programmes will simply be unsustainable. The Paymaster General will be aware of the serious criticism of the concept of the tax in journals such as The Economist. I suppose the Government take more notice of such sources than they do of the opposition in Committee. It is a bad, unfair tax but we want it to work as fairly as it reasonably can, as I am sure the Government wish, if only to avoid continuing legal problems.
<P>
I have highlighted some of the problems that we continue to envisage. I hope that--perhaps for the first time in the rather attenuated consideration of the Bill--Ministers will give us some of the answers to which we believe we are entitled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): When I spoke on the windfall tax in our debate on clause 1 on the Floor of the House, I made it clear that the very essence of the tax was discriminatory, arbitrary and retrospective--which was not in any way denied by the Labour party--and, as a result, extremely obnoxious. Clause 2 sets out the rules defining who shall pay the tax, and it does nothing other than justify my criticisms.
<P>
It is a fundamentally dishonest clause. The Labour party has decided to target a certain number of companies to raise a certain amount of money. Instead of saying, as it should have done, that it was simply targeting British Telecom, the electricity companies, the water companies and so forth, it has devised a set of extraordinary complicated and discriminatory rules framed to define a given list of companies. That is the purpose in subsection (5) of the elaborate listing of the different regulatory regimes according to which a company will be subject to the windfall tax.
<P>
That is clearly also the reason for the other peculiar aspects of the clause. Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (1) have been designed to hit British Gas which, since privatisation, has demergered a number of its subsidiaries. Why were the Government not straightforward and honest enough to list the companies that they wanted to hit? They would have saved us from all this paper and arcane language. It would have been quite simple--the clause could have been four or five lines long and simply contained a list of companies.
<P>
The Labour party pretends that there is an objectivity behind the principle of the tax. But because that pretence is so transparent--which is obvious from the clause--it is abundantly clear to the public how dishonest the Labour party is being. The tax is discriminatory, and the Labour party's attempt to hide that in the clause will not work.
<P>
When Labour Ministers respond I ask that they do not ignore--as they did when we debated amendment No. 11--the pertinent question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry: why is it that people who invested in British privatised companies will be penalised with a discriminatory levy, while those who made money investing in non-British privatisations will not be hit with a discriminatory levy, or any other special tax? What is the logic and equity of telling someone that because you supported a British industry by buying shares in British Telecom, a British utility company, a British energy company or a British water company that you will pay this discriminatory levy? I hope that the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and the Paymaster General are listening because we want answers. If a British investor or anyone else who made a greater capital gain from investing in a foreign privatisation--such as Elf-Aquitaine, Telefonica, Viag or Gazprom, or any of the myriad successful flotations of previously nationalised companies which followed the successful example of British privatisations in the 1980s--[Interruption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There are too many conversations going on, although I can hear the hon. Gentleman clearly. Incidentally, while I am on my feet, I should say that I am not paying any levy--I have no shares in any of the companies that he mentioned. When the word ``you'' is used, it refers to the Chair.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am well aware, Mr. McWilliam, that ``you'' refers to the Chair, but I use the word in the normal, impersonal sense. If you prefer, I could use the phrase ``when one invests''. I had this argument with you the other day. I am afraid that I continue to adhere to the perfectly normal convention in the British language that ``you'' can be used in an impersonal sense. It seems extraordinarily arched to say ``one'' the whole time. I know that certain grand people of this country--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman should not challenge my ruling, which is a long-standing ruling of Madam Speaker's. The Standing Orders of the House state that Members address the Chair, which makes it impossible for them to use the word ``you'' in an impersonal sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I hope that your intervention, Mr. McWilliam, will not deflect the Committee's attention from the important question that I am trying to put to the Government--they totally avoided it a few moments ago when it was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. They cannot be allowed to finish the clause stand part debate without answering the question. What in logic or in equity is the reason for penalising an investor who makes a profit--windfall or otherwise--from a British privatisation and for not penalising an investor who makes a profit from a foreign privatisation? Do the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and the Paymaster General contend that all foreign privatisations were so perfectly priced that investors made no profit? If so, I shall give the Committee a list of the capital gains that have been made by people investing in some of the foreign privatisations, several of which I mentioned earlier. I shall, if necessary, do so on a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Members of the Committee may not be aware that my hon. Friend is a proficient Russian speaker. Does he agree that the privatisations that were conducted in the former Soviet Union were of a very tacky nature and that they were in no sense subject to the safeguards and regulatory procedures that were established in the United Kingdom? It is more than likely that he who invested in those securities--I am sure that my hon. Friend did not do so--would be a very fat cat indeed, if he had survived the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. In my list of successful foreign privatisations, which I earlier delivered to the Committee, I mentioned Gazprom, which is the best of the Russian examples. As my hon. Friend knows, anyone who invested in that company would have made a vastly greater sum of money in terms of total returns after privatisation than anyone who invested in what might be called the British equivalent--British Gas. That company has not performed very well; since becoming a private company it has certainly performed less well than the stock market as a whole.
<P>
My hon. Friend emphasises my point. Why penalise those investors who made money from British privatisations but not British investors or other British taxpayers who made gains from foreign privatisations? Perhaps the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) can answer my very simple question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Given that Britain is leading the world and the hon. Gentleman's admission that a retrospective tax will be involved, other Governments--in France and elsewhere--may follow our lead and introduce windfall taxes to bring about the equity that he so much desires.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not answer my point at all. I should have thought that the Labour Government are concerned above all with British citizens' interests and British tax revenues--although that may not, on second thoughts, be correct. If a foreign Government imposed such a levy the tax revenue would be for the benefit of foreign taxpayers, which is hardly in Britain's interests. However, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, some British shareholders may have to pay that tax. As a result, I can see no possible benefit for anyone in this country if the Government proceed along those lines. Those on the Government Front Bench were discourteous to the traditions of the House when they evaded the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry.
<P>
With all the excitement and your intervention in my speech, Mr. McWilliam, I forgot to do something that I should have done at the beginning of my speech and perhaps I could rectify that now without being hauled before the Bar of the House. I should have reminded the Committee of my interests as set out in the Register of Members' Interests and drawn attention to the fact that I am an adviser of NatWest Markets, an investment banking operation which is a fully owned subsidiary of NatWest bank. I am also parliamentary adviser to the Chartered Institute of Taxation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Paymaster General, I thank the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) for declaring his interest and remind all hon. Members to be careful about declaring interests.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Robinson): I am not surprised that no Labour Members rose to speak to the amendment--although the hon. Member for Daventry managed to speak to it for some 25 minutes--because there is nothing to say about it. It shows again the technical incompetence of Conservative Members in tabling amendments in which they can see no sense and neither I nor those I consulted can see any sense. I am not sure of the purpose of the amendment. Flotation of all the relevant companies involved the offer of shares to the public in the United Kingdom. Shares were also offered to other investors in the United Kingdom and overseas. Omitting ``in the United Kingdom'' would not make a substantive change in the legislation or be of any positive benefit to anyone. It would simply make the definition in clause 2(2) less precise. The clause already defines those companies on which we intend to levy the windfall tax and I see no reason to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for the Paymaster General for giving way and leaving his brief for a moment. Reference is made to the United Kingdom in subsection 2(a) and to the official list of the London stock exchange in subsection 2(d). I am not sure that both are necessary. Why is it necessary to specify that the offer was made in the United Kingdom? That might give rise to legal doubt about whether it was made only and exclusively or in respect of one class of shares or another exclusively and only in the United Kingdom, or was made both in the United Kingdom or abroad. Surely the ``Official List of the Stock Exchange'' test would be enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to redraft the legislation he should try to improve it in some way, but none of his points arise in the Bill as drafted and the amendment is redundant and otiose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Paymaster General says that the amendment is redundant and otiose, so why did the Government include the redundant and otiose clause? Why do they not simply list the companies on which they wish arbitrarily to levy the tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Very simply because that would have made the Bill hybrid and that is the last thing we would have wanted, although the hon. Gentleman might have had an interest in that. He rightly and appropriately raised the matter on clause stand part, perhaps because he wanted the Bill to be hybrid. I had experience of hybridity in a former debate and we were well advised to avoid that, just as the hon. Gentleman was well advised to suggest that we go down that route. I compliment him on his strategy, but we will not go down it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): How, in reality, does subsection 2(5) differ in its listing of companies? The Government have listed various Acts--the Telecommunications Act 1984, the Airports Act 1986, the Gas Act 1986, the Water Act 1989, the Electricity Act 1989, the Railways Act 1993 and so on. How does that differ in any real sense from listing and companies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Had we listed the companies, we would have created a hybrid Bill, which was the last thing we wanted.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I help the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)? Had the Bill been hybrid, Madam Speaker would have so ruled. It is not hybrid because she has not so ruled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We consulted on the matter. It was ruled that, had the Bill contained such provisions, it would have been hybrid. That is why it contains a precise definition, which has stood up to all aspects of scrutiny--not by the Committee, which has got nowhere on it, but previously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm my understanding that it is open to any individual aggrieved party to take this matter into the courts, and that it would be for the courts finally to determine whether the Bill, if enacted as worded, would give rise to any partiality between individual shareholders? There is a matter of order here--I appreciate that Mr. McWilliam has already commented on that--but would anyone under United Kingdom or European statutes be able to take that action? That may also depend on whether companies took a prudential and commercial judgment on whether it was appropriate further to risk their shareholders' assets in pursuit of rectifying what I believe to be a potential unfairness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman may believe that but, as far as we are aware, no legal challenges are being mounted by any of the companies. There is general acceptance of the rightness and balance of the tax among those companies, and we look forward to receiving the cheques on 1 December, if not before. We are confident, as the hon. Gentleman knows, of the proposal's legality. In Opposition we went to great lengths to consult on the matter at great cost with the most eminent counsels we could find. We are convinced--that there is no legal challenge on the matter bears this out--that the proposal is robust against any challenge under the British legal system or under European jurisdiction.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Could the Paymaster General tell the Committee--perhaps he could take advice if he is unable to do so immediately--whether the words United Kingdom include share offerings in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands? If not, what will the tax treatment of the windfall be to those offerings?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I cannot give an immediate response. Although I see some indications that the answer is probably no, it would be appropriate for me to reserve my position and come back to the hon. Gentleman on that matter.
<P>
There have been few points of substance made--certainly none of relevance to the amendment or to the clause. On the Government Benches, we are going to have to get used to hearing the rehashing of speeches made on so many occasions. That applies even to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford who, without notes, has spoken with great eloquence and at great length. I shall have to modify my admiration for him in all those respects, however, if he cannot find anything new to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I have a simple, direct question. I refer the Paymaster General to subsection 2(d), which provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shares in that company were first admitted to listing on the Official List of the Stock Exchange in pursuance of an application made in connection with the offer.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>As the hon. Gentleman will immediately understand, the implication of that subsection is that, had those flotations been of unlisted shares--had they been offered to the public on an unlisted basis, as they could have been--or had the listing not been on the London stock exchange but on New York's or Frankfurt's, the companies concerned would not have been hit by the windfall tax. What rhyme or reason is there for that? What is the hon. Gentlemen's purpose in retrospectively penalising companies that are listed on the London Stock Exchange when, had they chosen another Stock Exchange, they would not have been penalised by the discriminatory levy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> It might have been necessary to change the definitions in the clause. We cannot allow a definitional change--such as the locational change suggested by the hon. Gentleman--to deflect us from our primary purpose, which is to impose a windfall tax on various companies privatised by flotation and subject to economic regulation. We made clear our position on this issue as early as 1992; we have repeated it consistently in our years in Opposition; it was in our manifesto, and nobody can be under any doubt as to how we shall proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Why was it not in the Railtrack prospectus, in which the Labour party was able to make its position clear?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Railtrack would have to prove some harm to proceed against the Government or the Labour party, but it is hard to see how it could, given that the value of its shares has increased by 100 per cent. and its dividends and profits are doing so well.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): On that basis, would not the Paymaster General agree that the Railtrack share price was considerably lower than his colleagues would have liked--they believe that it was sold at an undervalued rate--because of the Labour party's scare tactics, which meant that the City would accept the flotation of Railtrack only at a greatly reduced price? It should therefore be no surprise that there was such a rapid rise in the price of shares, as they had to be sold cheaply. What is the logic behind what the Paymaster General is saying?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> There is no logic that I am aware of in share price movements. I do not seek to predict them other than to say that the general, sustained rise in the FT-SE index and the all-share index in the Financial Times shows growing confidence in the Government and their policies and in the medium and long-term success for which we are working.
<P>
As to Railtrack, its share price has risen by a further 15 per cent. and its profits and dividends are up--it is a great success. We are imposing a tax on it that it, I understand, will pay and finds fair in the circumstances: the tax is defined in the Bill and calculated according to the criteria established in the Bill. It is not an issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Perhaps I could comment in passing that I am interested to hear that the Paymaster General now accepts that the Railtrack flotation was a great success--that is common ground between us. He said, however, that there is no logic in share price movement, but almost immediately prayed in aid the recent advances in share prices. Those advances may relate to other aspects of economic policy. The Committee should remember what the hon. Gentleman said if the appparently illogical trend in share prices reverses itself--we shall then want to say to him that that represents a Government failure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I made it clear that we shall take credit for anything for which we can take credit--perhaps we should make that an election promise. Railtrack has done well; it will be taxed. As for the prospectus, the issue does not arise. Everyone knew what Labour party policy was--it was published in every newspaper and stated loud and clear so that there could be no misunderstanding.
<P>
We were promised a searing attack on the technical detail and competence of the Bill, but we have not heard anything so far. The nearest we came to it was a question of orthography and whether the past participle of ``benefit'' should have one or two t's. We dealt quite adequately with that earlier.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford mentioned double taxation treaties; they normally cover only existing taxes and taxes that are similar to each other, so the matter does not apply to the windfall tax. We have also dealt with whether there should be tax credits in the United States for American parent companies--that is a matter for the American authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Given the seriousness of the issue and the real threat that the United States may impose a retaliatory tax on United Kingdom investors in America, as has happened in the past, is the Paymaster General saying that the Government have had no advance discussions with the United States Government and the Internal Revenue Service to ensure that the consequences of the Bill will not be damaging to UK interests overseas? Britain is the second largest overseas investor in the United States, and such a retaliatory measure would be enormously damaging to British interests. I would find it remarkable if the Paymaster General were to say that there had been no advance discussions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is new to the House of Commons, I gave him a little leeway, but the clause deals specifically with those companies to which the windfall tax applies and not with what the United States may or may not do in the face of the windfall tax in general.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Your great latitude, Mr. McWilliam, has been greatly appreciated during the course of our debate, which has already lasted one hour with so little having been said about the clause. Sadly, that betokens the vacuity of the opposition to the clause, which we have witnessed yet again today.
<P>
In answer to the question raised by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), the answer is that the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are not in the United Kingdom. No significance attaches to that fact in this regard, but I thought that the hon. Gentleman would like to know that.
<P>
There is only one other matter with which I have to deal--again, it is not relevant, but Opposition Members have shown much concern about it and have raised it continually, so I must deal with it. That is the question of the enormous damage that the clause will allegedly do to our relations with the United States. I am pleased to tell the Committee that we have held discussions at official level, and we see no sign of any retaliatory action from the United States--it is quite right that there should not be such action. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will be delighted that he needs to pursue that point no further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Paymaster General is probably much more familiar than I with tax problems with the United States.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have already ruled on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Mr. McWilliam, I assure you that my question arises directly from the comments just made by the Paymaster General. I believe it to be right and in the interests of the Committee that I ask him to elucidate that point. Surely, the threat arises not from any administrative action on the part of the Internal Revenue Service but from a move in Congress to impose a retaliatory tax. The Paymaster General will be well aware of the history of Congress imposing retaliatory taxes--the problem of Super 301, and so forth. Is not there a danger that some Congressman or Senator will say that if the British Government are retrospectively to hit American investment in the UK, they should retaliate? What will the Paymaster General do if that happens, and what guarantee can he give the Committee that British interests at large will not suffer, in addition to the suffering imposed on the economy by the tax?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not in order on this clause; it was in order on clause 1.
<P>
On another matter, it is incorrect for members of the Committee to pass between the Chair and a member of the Committee who is speaking. Will any Labour Member who walks out please go around my back?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful once again for your guidance, Mr. McWilliam. Perhaps I may pursue that point outside the Room; I would hate the hon. Gentleman to think that I have denied him an answer, and I will certainly give him a firm answer in due course.
<P>
We have already thrashed to pieces the few tiny points that have been raised by the Opposition which are relevant. Why are Conservative Members so seriously concerned about American confidence in the British market and British stocks when the huge, &#163;3.6 billion offer is on the table from American PacifiCorp for Eastern Group plc, which includes Eastern Electricity? That company is anxious to come in--a further sign that it is not only the British stock market, institutions and investors that have great confidence, it is also the Americans. On that basis, I commend the clause to the Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to have elicited even a limping and one-legged response from the Paymaster General, which was rather better than he achieved in respect of the amendment. He has an interesting technique. He has now decided that the right way to deal with the Opposition is to say that whatever we say has been considered by the wise lawyers and is perfectly all right; that the Government have taken the best possible advice at ruinous expense--as that took place before the election, I am sure that that was not at the expense of the taxpayer--and that there will be no further problems, let alone any legal challenges.
<P>
The Paymaster General will be aware that the Government have puffed loud enough and long enough to succeed in depressing a few share prices, and have then said that instead of huffing at hurricane force they will puff only at force 10. They now say, ``Aren't you lucky? You should be grateful.'' The Financial Secretary wants all taxpayers to be grateful for Labour's depredations. Perhaps that is why some companies are not suing. We shall wait and see what happens. I shall not speculate on what might happen in the British courts or the European Court--nor, indeed, in the American Congress. It is not quite as simple as that, but there is some immediate relevance to his remarks about the recent proposed takeover of the Energy Group.
<P>
I doubt whether it is necessary for me to declare an interest, but my mother is a shareholder in the Energy Group--it is a very small holding. I dealt with it only the other day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Is my hon. Friend's mother here?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My mother is not here.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> What a shame.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Sedentary interventions should be avoided at all costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Having heard the Paymaster General's response, I am inclined to think that my mother should be drafted in as a special and exceptional, but non-supporting, member of the Government team.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I wonder whether, for the benefit of the Committee and the House, you would rule, or, if necessary, obtain a ruling from Madam Speaker, on what class of relative an interest should be declared. I have no idea what investments are held by my mother or my grandmother, or by my aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, or great uncles. I should be most grateful if you would clarify how far such a declaration of interest should go.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Daventry's mother is not mentioned in the Bill and she is not present in the Room. She is therefore not an appropriate subject for debate, particularly as we are debating the companies to which the windfall tax will apply. The hon. Member for Cotswold's mother is equally exempt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful and relieved, Mr. McWilliam, for that ruling. I was anxious to proceed with what insurance companies call utmost faith and not to mislead the Committee by failing to declare an interest.
<P>
If one succeeds in imposing a windfall tax and, as a result, depressing share prices, one will ipso facto make it more attractive for overseas investors to buy up a company whose capitalisation has been disabled. However, that is a matter of judgment.
<P>
Although the Paymaster General at least tried to respond to the points we have made, he revealed a certain technical weakness in that he had to seek advice. I am glad, however, that he sought advice on the point so perceptively made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold on whether or not a United Kingdom tax would apply in the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, which, as the Paymaster General knows, are important financial centres. I was surprised that he had not done his homework, but I am glad that the matter has been clarified. That answer also makes it clear to the Committee that not merely is it all right to be a fat cat stagging Gazprom or others, but if one happens to live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man one can escape the windfall tax as well as others. It is an arbitrary tax.
<P>
I accept that the Government have, under threat of legal challenge, drafted their disposition to minimise its arbitrariness, but that does not take away its substance. Nor does it do away with the message that United Kingdom investors in United Kingdom companies are disadvantaged in comparison with UK investors in foreign companies or investors abroad. Even if it does not directly challenge the double tax agreements of which we are so proud, it creates some difficulty. It is not the right way to deal with shareholder relations and company taxation.
<P>
The Government claim to be the friend of business, but in the light of the Minister's reply, I must advise my hon. Friends--
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the Bill takes no account of the arbitrary differences between the various classes of shareholder? You mentioned the stagging of the utilities; many investors who made a lot of money out of utilities that have long since been bought and sold will not be affected by the windfall levy, but long-term investors--people who are of real benefit to the pension funds and the insurance companies--will be hit. They are precisely the people who should be involved in the companies in the long term, benefiting not only the companies but their customers.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend makes the precise point that I was going to make. It is a bad signal to foreign countries about Britain as a place to do business and a very bad signal to savers in this country, whom the Paymaster General's right hon. Friend the Chancellor seeks to woo with new ideas for a review of pension policies that will require the active involvement of the private sector and cannot take place without it. For all those reasons, I invite my hon. Friends to join me in resisting the clause.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For the benefit of the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy) and other hon. Members who might be curious, a Division is announced up and down the Corridor so that Members who are simultaneously Members of other Committees or are elsewhere on the Corridor can return in time for the Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. It may seem strange that I want to draw attention to this, but I have a terrible feeling that my vote may have been counted twice. I have no objection to being given two votes but I think it ought to be done openly and with the knowledge of colleagues.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. I have checked and the hon. Gentleman's vote was not counted twice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I think that when Mr. Touhig was called I mistook his name for Twigg.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. The Ayes should have been 19, not 20.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Murphy </B>(Eastwood): Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I freely admit that I was expecting to hear a Division Bell and see 600 or so hon. Members come through the door. That shows inexperience and immaturity on my part but, given that we do not have the eight minutes or so that applies in the Chamber, how long do we have to vote when a Division is called in Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is a fair question. Members of the Committee have a shade over a minute in which to respond in a Division. For the benefit of all right hon. and hon. Members, I will look to the Whips to give me a nod when they think that they have as many of their flock as they are about to gather in the Room.
<P>
Let us clear up the matter of the Division. Will the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) clarify the position? He responded to his own vote, but did he answer for Mr. Davey too?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I thought that I heard the name ``Mr. Davies'' being called, to which I responded accordingly. However, the Clerk might have called Mr. Davey and I could have misheard him given that the Room is crowded.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In that case, the Ayes were 19 and the Noes were 9, which is how the vote will be recorded.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Quantification of a Privatisation Windfall</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in Schedule 1, page 49, line 30, leave out `9' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the average price-to-earnings ratio for other utilities quoted on the London and New York Stock Exchanges'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 The amendment is a probing amendment to elucidate why the Government chose a price-to-earnings ratio of nine. The notes on clauses refer to that choice as approximating.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to the lower average sectoral price-to-earnings ratio of the companies liable to the tax.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I am sure that the Committee would be grateful if the Minister could say a little more about that. I am aware that a higher or lower PE ratio would not necessarily lead to a higher or lower yield for tax, because it would be balanced against the rate at which the tax was levied. Therefore, the figure of 23 per cent. could be altered to compensate--a matter which I made allowance for when drafting the amendment. The lowest average sectoral PE ratio needs explanation.
<P>
Last night, we were entertained by one or two speeches in the House, one of which referred to the fact that most pension companies do worse than average. It was not made absolutely clear how that can happen--unless the hon. Member concerned was referring to a particularly complex modal, medial or arithmetical average whereby that could be the case. There probably is, however, a simple explanation to the notes on clauses.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> We would expect most companies to be either more or less than average, unless there was a normal distribution of returns. That is a basic statistical point, which anyone with a GCSE would understand. I asserted the fact that there is a skewed distribution, which meant that more pension funds did worse than average, rather than better than average.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> At the time, that was asserted without explanation and, as a result, such a statement was confusing.
<P>
The selection of a price-to-earnings ratio may be significant in that it may be sending a message to the markets or the outside world that it is appropriate or that the Government may return to the whole issue of profitability and capital values in the utilities market to try to influence such valuations in a direction of such a PE ratio. For all those reasons, it would be useful if the Government were to tell us a little more about the apparently arbitrary selection of this PE ratio.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The figure of nine is not arbitrary; it is meant to be as fair as possible to the companies involved. We analysed the relevant PEs for the companies in the relevant period in which windfall profits will be taxed, and the lowest we could find was--if my memory serves me right--9.2 for water companies. Therefore, it seemed fair to take a figure below that to show that we were not seeking to introduce a tax that would penalise them. We are trying to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
<P>
In other circumstances, one might be tempted to accept the amendment, but the result would be a tax charge of more than &#163;17 million on the companies. If we did what the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) suggests, we would impose a PE of more than 17 because of the present FT index of utilities. As the right hon. Gentleman rightly said, a balance was struck between the rate at which the tax should be charged on one hand and the PE ratio on the other. We decided to fix the PE at a fair point--I think that, on reflection, the right hon. Gentleman will agree about that--and to fix the rate of tax at a point at which we felt the companies could bear that reasonably corresponded to the windfall that they had generated.
<P>
The result is that the total yield is &#163;5.2 billion, which is in line with what the market was expecting. We imagine that the market came to that conclusion by using the same sort of rational criteria that we used, although some people chose different terms by which to measure the windfall tax. The widespread acceptance of the tax by the companies affected shows that we got it about right.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the Committee moves on to debate amendment No. 30--please do not all rush out--I should say that there is a ruling that the consumption of anything other than water or medicinal products is not allowed in Commmittee. Since I know of no medical use for things that are white with a hole in the middle, would Members please desist from eating them. As the Clerk said, ``They'll be eating sticky buns next.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 50, line 19, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, providing always that such profits arise only from activities subject to economic regulation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am grateful for that ruling, Mr. McWilliam. Any alcohol spotted on this Front Bench will be strictly medicinal.
<P>
Amendment No. 30 deals with an important part of the windfall tax--that is, on which activities it is designed to bear. The history of the privatisation programme is reasonably familiar to hon. Members. We all know that, having been released from the dead hand of the state, many of the companies which will be taxed under the Bill have diversified considerably from their original aims and objectives. Indeed, such diversifications have frequently been successful and have brought benefits to the employees, shareholders and customers of those companies. The Opposition think that, if there is to be a windfall tax, it should tax only the core activities of the companies involved that are directly subject to economic regulation.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Before the Conservative Government of 1979-83 implemented the main privatisation programme, many of the companies that will be taxed were stuck in a state groove and were prevented from diversifying, or at least certainly not encouraged to diversify.
<P>
One of the best examples of that is British Telecom which, before that date, was part of the Post Office. Its investment programme was subject to political direction. One of my first jobs after qualifying as an accountant was working for a commercial company in London, and I remember trying to obtain a switchboard for the company in which I worked. I was made to feel as if I was doing the predecessor to British Telecom a favour by trying to get it to supply a switchboard. In fact, the eventual device was installed informally one weekend and it was never clear--and I never dared ask--exactly where the money paid ended up. But the culture of the time was one of shortages, lack of investment and considerable management inefficiencies caused at least in part by the fact that the Government directed the investment programme.
<P>
Going back even further, the Postmaster General of the day was responsible for the telephone network, as well as for the Post Office. Like the present Paymaster General, I suspect, I was confused with the Postmaster General when I held that honourable office. I often pointed out that the last Postmaster General was John Stonehouse--[Interruption.]--and that I was holder of a much more ancient and honourable office--and a more profitable one in those days--that had its origins in the previous century. At the start of the last century, a Paymaster General left office a good deal richer than he was when he took it up. Sadly, that is no longer the case.
<P>
In the years after the war, the Postmaster General was, extraordinarily, responsible for a good deal of the operations and investment of the Post Office, as well as for the telephone network. Even after the two were split and the telephone organisation became separate, it was prevented by regulation and bureaucratic inertia from spreading its wings. Since privatisation, British Telecom has become a global telecommunications company, and most other countries in the world have a programme of privatising state utitlities and telephone networks in particular.
<P>
Exactly the same was true of the railways. I recall my noble Friend Lord Walker--Peter Walker, as he was then--describing how, when he took over one of the first super-Ministries in the 1970-74 Conservative Administration, one of the first decisions he had to take as Secretary of State for the Environment was whether to permit the British Railways Board to invest in a certain station on a certain branch line. He realised how absurd it was that commercial decisions were being taken by civil servants and Ministers and not by those trained to take such decisions and manage the railways.
<P>
Another example is the water utilities. Before privatisation, we witnessed a decaying Victorian structure that was starved of investment because every time successive Governments got into difficulties, they declared a moratorium on capital expenditure, and it is always easier to cut investment on things like water pipes and sewerage plants.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I realise that the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) is probably reading the stock exchange pages, but he is not permitted to read newspapers in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heatcoat-Amory:</B> I was explaining how the water sector is perhaps the most dramatic example of how privatisation released companies from state control and permitted them to undertake energetic investment in their core activities and to diversify. For the first time, the companies could fund programmes through access to private capital markets. At about the time of privatisation, higher environmental standards were imposed on the companies, partly by the European Union. There is continuing dispute about the relevance of many of the standards that companies are required to attain, but it is clear that they would have had no chance of meeting those higher standards had they not been given access to private capital markets.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons </B>(Rochdale): I would be interested to know whether the right hon. Gentleman can identify any privatised water companies that actually met their retail prices index settlements with the regulator. Under the existing formula, the regulator makes an assessment of capital investment. Does the right hon. Gentleman know which of the companies achieved the settlements? My understanding is that not many did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The enormous investment programme that was carried out subsequent to privatisation has enabled the water companies to meet almost all the standards required by regulation--[Interruption.] My constituency is covered by Wessex Water Services Ltd., which is proud of meeting the required environmental standards for the required number of incidents--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady should not heckle.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I can assure the hon. Lady that Wessex Water is meeting standards and that it would have been impossible for it to do so if it had been able to resort only to the taxpayer or the Ministers of the day for funds.
<P>
Many water companies have diversified successfully into such things as waste management and disposal and energy generation. They did not do those things before privatisation. Companies have, to varying extents, diversified successfully into non-core activities in areas in which they face competition. The force of competition is the best form of regulation.
<P>
In the electricity sector, there have been huge efficiency gains since privatisation, which have led to substantial price cuts. Even after the imposition of VAT at 8 per cent. during the last Parliament, domestic customers still received lower electricity prices at the end of that Parliament than at its start because efficiency gains were flowing through to domestic and industrial customers.
<P>
We contend that the non-core activities into which those companies diversified should not be subject to the windfall tax. That is true both absolutely and in terms of the relative incidence of the tax between companies. In the electricity sector, East Midlands Electricity made several unsuccessful diversifications and made losses that have reduced their published profit figures, which will in turn reduce the windfall tax that they will pay. On the other hand, other companies, such as Yorkshire Electricity Group, which have successfully diversified into other activities and other companies--[Interruption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will all Committee members ensure that their bleepers remain silent or remove the batteries?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Yorkshire Electricity Group successfully diversified into other activities and other countries. Most notably, it made a profit of &#163;17 million from an investment in Sweden. It is most unfair that that profit--on which it will pay corporation tax--will feed through into its profit figures, on which it will be assessed for the windfall tax. The incidence of the tax is unfair to that extent.
<P>
The Government have clearly worked back from the--
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I am interested that you referred to East Midlands Electricity and to the Yorkshire Electricity Group. East Midlands Electricity, as you said, made a significant loss and the Yorkshire Electricity Group made a significant gain. Will you comment on the fact that the increase in annual board pay is significantly greater in East Midlands Electricity than in the Yorkshire Electricity Group? The highest individual remuneration in East Midlands Electricity is something like &#163;350,000 compared with significantly lower sums in the Yorkshire Electricity Group. Does not that disprove your contention that in the competitive market higher remuneration goes with successful managers and players? The situation that I have described is a clear contradiction of that principle.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the right hon. Gentleman replies, I should inform the hon. Member for Croydon, Central that he has accused me of doing all sorts of things that I have not done--he used the word ``you''. I may appear unduly harsh, but if hon. Members get into bad habits to start with, they may get into a lot of trouble later on when they will not have the leeway that they enjoy as new Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> To answer the hon. Gentleman, he may not know--in which case I am happy to inform him--that East Midlands Electricity changed its chairman and other members of the board as a result of the losses. It may have been the shareholders' judgment that the company needed to pay the new management more in order to improve its results. That involves doing a favour to its shareholders and to the Government. The Government will assess the windfall tax on posted profits, and the extent to which the company's improved performance and results will benefit shareholders and the Government. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the tax should be levied not in accordance with published profits but in accordance with boardroom pay. In that case, he should discuss the matter with the Paymaster General.
<P>
The extent to which the companies have successfully diversified into other activities in the competitive sector should not affect the extent to which they will pay the windfall tax. I hope that the Paymaster General will respond to those matters.
<P>
<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): Would it be possible to make a contribution to the debate? I am a new Member and I am not totally familiar with the procedures of Standing Committees.
<P>
I was a little bewildered by the length of time that we spent discussing an earlier amendment, but this amendment raises a substantial matter that needs airing--a major issue of principle is involved.
<P>
The amendment goes to the heart of the Bill. I have tried to think through the Government's view of the matter. In so far as there is a moral and intellectual case for the windfall tax, it rests almost exclusively on the inequities that were produced by the regulatory system of the 1980s. Extraordinarily large profits were made in several cases because the regulators did not properly understand the mechanics of the industry that they were regulating. The system associated with Oftel and BT, for example, was distorted in its early years because the regulators did not understand the vast technical detail about the interconnectivity of network systems. One can appreciate that that aspect of the regulated business would be reviewed--again, thinking through the Government's view--if one saw a past injustice in the regulatory system and one wanted to correct it. It is quite wrong, however, to confuse that with BT's subsequent activities, especially on the international scene, and to attempt to penalise its increasingly global activities--its competition with Cable and Wireless and AT and T.
<P>
It is important for the foundations of the tax that matters of regulation are kept distinct from unregulated aspects. That distinction also applies to the often-cited precedent of Conservative legislation on banking. Although that precedent can only be used as a partial analogy, there is some justification for retrospective legislation. The precedent specifically arose from the fact that a regulatory regime was in place. Banks were unable to charge interest on current account income. The spread of interests was regulated and a retrospective tax was introduced to deal with that. If there is a basis for the tax, it is in relation to regulated income rather than company profits as a whole.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My second point echoes that made by the right hon. Member for Wells. The Government are sending unwise signals to the private sector because of the way in which the tax will be calculated. He cited various analogies, and I shall quote one or two others. Thames Water is one of the worst examples of a privatised utility. It was extremely profligate in the way that it dealt with executive pay and dividend pay-outs, and it lost a great deal of money as a result of ill-considered diversification. The people at Thames Water got a rush of blood to the head when it was privatised and imagined that they were global business men. They made complete fools of themselves. As a result, Thames Water's net profits in early years were relatively subdued. Those people are now being rewarded for their imprudence. They will be taxed less heavily than those water utilities that operated a more conservative system of management, which sends quite the wrong signals.
<P>
My final point is that it is important good practice to establish a distinction between regulated and unregulated income. I hope that the Government will not simply take their cut from privatised companies and leave it at that. There is an urgent need for a complete overhaul of the regulatory system governing the utility companies. One anomaly that must be addressed is the pooling of regulated and unregulated income. I live close to an airport and the regulation of the British Airports Authority is important to me. An absurd system of regulation is in operation. Income from unregulated shops is pooled with landing charges. That has created artificially low landing charges and has seriously distorted the aviation market, adding to the demand for flights.
<P>
The Government need to address the problem by keeping regulated and unregulated business distinct for regulatory and taxation purposes. I hope that they will consider the amendment on its merits. I recognise that many amendments are designed to slow up business or to throw sand in the works, but the amendment addresses a matter of substance which does not necessarily affect the integrity of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call another hon. Member to speak, the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) made a fair point. For the benefit of new Members I should make it clear that anyone who rises and catches my eye can speak. It is not like the Chamber--hon. Members can speak more than once.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I should like to add to the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. There are many other examples of diversification into non-core activities, with the same repercussions that were challenged by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies). A Welsh utility company made a most disastrous diversification into the hotel industry, the upshot of which was that many in management rightly lost their jobs and the share price suffered greatly, much to the annoyance of shareholders. However, that company was able to make write-offs against its profits in the earlier years which deflated the profit figure on which this arbitrary windfall tax is to be based.
<P>
That is a classic example of rewarding incompetence and inefficiency. The amendment highlights the fact that the remit of the windfall tax is far too broad. Labour Members should examine the heart of the case for the windfall tax--that the utility companies were undersold and, therefore, the British public were short changed. The British public had no interest in Welsh hotels or in waste disposal companies that were bought by companies such as Severn Trent Water. We should consider the distinction that the hon. Member for Twickenham made between regulated and non-regulated income. The broad-brush approach, however, makes no allowance for a utility company which has been environmentally friendly. For example, my local utility company, Southern Water, has the lowest leak rate of any of the privatised water utility companies. It has concentrated its spending on core activities and yet it will be penalised more than companies such as the Welsh water companies, which have been somewhat less efficient.
<P>
In the case of electricity utilities, Seeboard, my local electricity utility company, will see its gearing level rise in excess of 140 per cent.--yet it has concentrated on core activities and on reducing the cost to the consumer. That company will complain about the arbitrariness of the measure, which will mean that a company such as Eastern Electricity, which is half as big again as Seeboard, will pay only a couple of million pounds more in windfall tax than it will. I challenge the Paymaster General's assumption that all utility companies should be subject to such a broad-based PE ratio, which affects the profits of all their activities--non-core and core. Does that ratio pay any regard to what happens in future? Utility companies have been encouraged to make long-term investment in infrastructure. For example, there is a five-year &#163;30 billion programme for the water companies. Does the windfall tax measure take into account any difference in future investment requirements between electricity companies, water companies and telephone companies? Does it pay attention to the fact that, in 1998, all regional electricity companies will be subject to the opening up of competition and that, in the year 2000, there will be a distribution review? Those factors will not affect some other formerly nationalised utility companies.
<P>
The remit of the measure is too broad. It is unfair both in terms of how companies are regarded in relation to their peers and in relation to other utility groups. It is strategic to that issue that we should strip out non-core activities. Did detailed discussion on that issue take place with utility companies before the Government produced this unspecific and flawed legislation?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I should like to speak very much in favour of what was said by the hon. Member for Twickenham.
<P>
The amendment is of one of substance because it exposes a central incoherence in the idea of the windfall tax: that it is to be applied across the board to a large class of utilities, regardless of their performance, investment needs and which sector they are in. If one accepts that some industries which provide some services are likely to be natural monopolies, it is entirely acceptable that they will continue to need to be regulated. In an ideal world all products and services will be provided in competitive industries and, therefore, normal laws of competition will apply and companies will be regulated by them. If that general condition does not apply, separate and specific regulation will be needed for those industries, including many of the utilities. That would be generally accepted, but the Government appear not to accept it for the particular purpose of the windfall tax.
<P>
The Government are deliberately and consciously confusing economic activities which take place within a competitive environment with those that take place within a regulated environment. Applying the same rate of tax on the arbitrary basis of a PE ratio plucked from the air and applied to sectors with widely different histories and future prospects is a slap-dash approach to taxation. It is not only bad for the tax system but, more important in the short term, very bad for the industries concerned. Other hon. Members have referred to individual utilities on which the effects of the tax will be perverse; some utilities will be rewarded for past incompetence and penalised for good behaviour.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I are painfully aware that no one on the Conservative Benches can stand up specifically to speak for the interests of Wales because we returned no Members of Parliament for Wales, so it falls to me, as an exiled Welshman, to speak on behalf of Hyder, the Welsh utility. It will be particularly hard hit by the perverse way in which the tax will fall, but I dare say that we will not hear anything from those on the Government Benches, who include many hon. Members who represent Wales, about how unfair and perverse the tax is.
<P>
Because of the way in which the tax is structured and does not distinguish between regulated and unregulated activities, its financial effect on Hyder, which covers both water and electricity in south Wales, will be &#163;282 million. That represents 25 per cent. of the market value of the company. Compared with the percentage of market value that the tax represents for many other water companies, that is spectacularly out of line. For example, for Anglian Water the percentage of market value is only 7 per cent. For Thames Water, to which the hon. Member for Twickenham referred and which has had a chequered history in its unregulated businesses--it has now improved no end--the figure is just 8 per cent. of market value. For Yorkshire Water, which is perhaps the most controversial water company in the country, it is just 9 per cent. For Severn Trent Water and South West Water it is 10 per cent. and for United Utilities and Wessex Water it is 11 per cent. For Hyder to have 25 per cent. of its market value hit by the windfall tax cannot be fair and cannot be the aim of the tax. As the hon. Member for Twickenham said, one of the constituent parts of that company has had its problems, but it is now better managed than a few years ago. Again, we see the perverse effect of the tax being applied with a broad brush across the board to all activities of the utilities--the successful are being penalised.
<P>
That is unfair not only on the companies and, therefore, their shareholders, but on customers. Ian Byatt, Director General of Water Services, stated specifically that Hyder
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``conducts its operations in the interests of customers and I continue to applaud such behaviour.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will be much more difficult for it to carry on conducting its operations in the interests of its customers if it has to pay such an unfair amount of tax.
<P>
From all points of view, we can see why the amendment is so important. If the Government are to introduce new taxation, specifically, new retrospective taxation, which is unfair in itself, the least they can do in the interests of both equity and the technical competence of the tax, is to ensure that it falls fairly on the companies and therefore on their customers and that it does not discourage future investment and good, profitable behaviour by those companies.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are not just talking about retrospection; the tax may fall retrospectively but it will clearly cast a shadow for many years ahead on the behaviour of the various utilities. Indeed, if I were sitting in the board room of a utility company I would by no means be confident that a Labour Government would not return to this particular well in future and impose another windfall tax on some equally arbitrary basis, and possibly on some equally arbitrary date.
<P>
The message that this tax sends to those companies is that you should be careful of doing anything too efficient and too profitable because if that pushes your profits up you will again become more vulnerable to the Government's taxation proposals. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will see the ridiculous and perverse effect that that will have on future investment plans. If there is any danger of a company believing that it will merely be exposed to more taxation, over and above the corporation tax that it will pay if it is more profitable, simply because it makes profitable diversifications away from its core regulated businesses, many such companies will refuse to make those investments. The normal market forces will not apply; those companies may not be able to seize the existing market opportunities and the country as a whole will suffer. Many successful diversifications have involved providing services around the world and enabling British utilities to provide utility services in other countries. There is intense international competition. The Companies generate wealth for this country not only by providing foreign exchange but by obtaining expertise in international competition and feeding that expertise back to this country, which improves their service to customers in this country.
<P>
For all sorts of reasons, the way in which the tax is drafted and the fact that it does not distinguish between regulated and unregulated services means that not only is it a bad tax in terms of tax theory, it is a perverse tax because of how the companies on which it falls will be encouraged to operate in future. I urge the Government to consider the amendment seriously and to adopt it.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the next member of the Committee, may I again caution the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green). I know that he is a new Member, but I have not put anyone's profit up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The problem with the amendment is that it is not precise. Conservative Members rightly spoke about diversification and said that some diversification has been successful and some absolutely disastrous. I, for one, am very pleased that the directors in the latter case have, in some respects, been given the order of the boot.
<H4><center>[Mr. Ivor Caplin in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
There are two difficulties about the amendment. First, what do we mean by activities subject to economic regulation? There is a definition in clause 2(5) about undertakings whose privatisation involved the imposition of economic regulation, but that is not relevant.
<P>
Secondly, what do we mean by profits arising from activities subject to economic regulation? I am sure that the right hon. Member for Wells would come up with one figure and the hon. Member for Daventry's mother with another. If paid enough, I am sure that other Conservative Members would come up with different figures. This measure is not bad for the tax system; it is important in tax law to have simplicity. This is a one-off tax: it will not be repeated. It is important to have a simple identification of profits and that is why I object to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The amendment should not be supported because it appears from what Conservative Members have said that we should move away from the general idea of taxing on the ability to pay to a situation where those companies that have diversified and failed will be penalised for their failure, rather than being taxed on their success. We always tax on success, whether through personal or corporate tax. It would be wrong to support the amendment.
<P>
The windfall tax was heralded well in advance so that everyone knew it was coming; companies and the City could discount against it in terms of share values and companies could get their finances in order and have some prospect of paying what is, after all and against expectations, a modest level of tax. If we took the line suggested by Conservative Members, we would considerably distort the long-term prospects for individual companies which, through their own fault, diversified early on when they found that they had enormous surpluses of money because of the inadequacy of the initial selling-off process. Companies such as Welsh Water ended up with enormous amounts of money and an incompetent management who ran off, spent it on Welsh hotels and burned their fingers. Whose fault is that? It is the fault of the Opposition. Companies no longer have that money because they lost it and now we are being told that they should be penalised because they have been incompetent. But the Opposition gave responsibility for enormous amounts of money to people who clearly did not have a background in those markets.
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
If we think of the directors of a nationalised water board suddenly being given opportunities to venture into other competitive markets that they have no knowledge of, it is no surprise that some mistakes were made. That was a complete disgrace in its abuse of public money. People have made mistakes and those mistakes have been corrected. We were told that we had to pay more and more money to the people who ran those companies.
<P>
If we agreed to the amendment, those companies that have failed would find that their long-term prospects for existence were undermined. The issue is that of gathering tax on the basis of ability to pay. The Government have been given a mandate by the British public to do that with the intention that afterwards not only do we invest in welfare to work and other schemes, but we ensure that the companies involved are able to continue profitably to invest in the interests of the public, rather than being destroyed by the process being advocated by Conservative Members.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I ask all hon. Members to speak up? The Committee Sub-Editor is merely switching on microphones--Hansard is being produced elsewhere by transcription from a tape. If the Transcribers cannot hear what is being said, it makes things awkward for the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The hon. Gentleman keeps on returning to the subject of directors' pay. I urge him to read the Finance Bill: the tax has nothing to do with directors' pay; it is a tax on the profits of companies, so the point that he has repeatedly made is completely irrelevant.
<P>
I invite the hon. Gentleman to consider the point that if any company should be suffering under taxation because of the incompetent way in which it was run in the early years after privatisation, it is extremely unlikely--I think that in no case is it true--that that is due to the present directors, whose business will be punished by this tax. Not only is his point irrelevant to the Finance Bill, it is irrelevant to the people he is trying to criticise. I would invite him to consider the point that the incidence of the tax will make profitable investment less, not more likely in the future, which will be bad news for the customers of all those utilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> We all know that the Bill is not about penalising company directors. It is, however, relevant to say that many directors, particularly in the early years, were paid enormous amounts for an incompetent performance. That is a sad comment on the process by which we got into that situation. People who happened to find themselves as directors of water companies suddenly jacked up their money because they were able to do so. That was not the function of a competitive market--those characters would not be given a similar job in a similarly sized organisation. Such events were far too common. I mention that because we are talking about whether we should penalise the shareholders of companies that have historically had incompetent managers.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's second point, which concerns the signals that the measure sends for profitable investment, is the substantial point of our discussion. It has always been the case in every economy that the more profit people make, the more they are taxed--that is a natural principle of progressivity. I know that Mrs. Thatcher and others wanted to introduce a poll tax and would, no doubt, want a similar measure extended across corporate taxation at some point in the future. Thereafter, they would perhaps move towards taxing the poor more than the rich. Such views are, however, not general outside certain groupings of the Conservative party. In principle, we are talking about moving forward as a one-off on the basis of the ability to pay a tax that everyone agrees is fair and just.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and Chelmsford, East): As the Opposition Whip on the Committee, I had not anticipated making many contributions and I shall probably not do so. A new liberal regime is, however, prevailing on the Opposition Benches--
<P>
<B>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mr. Alistair Darling): It is called short staffing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> It has nothing to do with that. I am, however, permitted to make one or two observations on the amendment. I want to do so because my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) has drawn attention to an extremely important point.
<P>
I want to say a few words about the effect of the tax on one company, National Power. I should tell members of the Committee that, during the previous Parliament, I spent four years on an Industry and Parliament Trust fellowship with National Power. I am aware that the vast majority of members of the Committee are new to the House of Commons and may, therefore, not be familiar with the trust. If you will permit me, Mr. McWilliam, it would be worth telling new Members about the scheme's advantages and about how the experience that it gives can help one to contribute to debates such as that which we are having this morning.
<P>
The scheme was set up by the House of Commons to allow Members and, indeed, Officers of the House to be attached to a company for two or more years and to learn about its detailed operation and about the problems that management faces in British industry. For those who did not have enormous experience of business before entering the House, the scheme is extremely valuable. It allows one to contribute to debates of this sort with a little more authority than one might otherwise have been able to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain what that has to do with the Opposition amendment?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I will decide what is in order and what is not. I was letting the hon. Member for Maldon and Chelmsford, East (Mr. Whittingdale) go on a bit because I have let everyone else go on a bit this morning. If the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) wants me to tighten up, I promise him that I can be extremely tight, as members of the Committee will know.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct that, strictly speaking, my introduction was not directly relevant. I nevertheless thought that it would benefit new Members. In all sincerity, new Members on the Government Benches may find that they have an enormous amount--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): Did the private sector stretch to Tory central office?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Even though the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin) had done me a couple of favours, he is still not allowed to heckle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> New Labour Members may find that their time is occupied in the next couple of years and should know that it is an extremely good scheme from which they might benefit.
<P>
Returning to the main issue, I spent about four years with National Power. In that time, I visited all aspects of its operations, in this country and abroad. National Power is in an unusual position. It was privatised by the previous Government. When it became a private sector company, it had to accept that it was likely to face a continuing reduction in its market share in this country--whatever strategy it adopted. The regulator made it clear that he would require the company to pursue a policy of further disposals of power stations, as a result of which National Power recently announced that it was selling a 2,000 MW plant at West Burton, a 1,000 MW plant at Ironbridge and another 1,000 MW plant at Rugeley. They were sold to one of National Power's competitors in the generating market--Eastern Electricity.
<P>
On top of the requirement to dispose of some of its assets to competitors, National Power also had to face the fact that some of its competitors were building new plants. Because they were building brand-new plants, they could also take advantage of the latest technology--combined cycle gas turbine electricity-generating plants, which are extremely efficient and generally cheaper than old-style coal-generating plants. As environmental requirements are tightened and mission controls become stricter on coal-generated electricity, further investment will be required. That will push up the price of generating electricity fuelled by coal.
<P>
The National Power management thus had to come to terms with the fact that it was likely to face a steadily declining market in the UK. Most of its business remains in the UK and it maintains an investment programme that includes CCGT generation. Yet National Power also had to look elsewhere to expand its business and it came to the conclusion that the best way to develop the company in the private sector was to embark upon a strategy of expanding operations overseas.
<P>
I sat in on some of the management meetings in which strategy was discussed. One of the advantages of the IPT scheme is that one can see the sorts of problems and decisions facing management at the top level. One is made privy to confidential discussions, and although I obviously cannot refer to what was told in confidence, the management was open about its difficult position. It was decided, as I said, to expand operations overseas.
<P>
That strategy was pursued almost from the day on which National Power entered the private sector. I have a press release issued by the company in July 1993--shortly after privatisation. It announced that National Power had reached agreement to buy a United States power generation subsidiary of Transco Energy Company--a Texan-based gas pipeline company. National Power paid &#163;105 million for Transco Energy Ventures Company, which has interests in seven power plants, the main ones being a 356 MW CCGT plant in Virginia, another coal-fired plant in Mecklenburg, Virginia, and two which are under construction, in Georgia and in Texas. As a result of that move, it created a separate subsidiary company, National Power America. That strategy has continued throughout the time that the company has been in the private sector.
<P>
In 1994, as part of the IPT scheme, I visited a 600 MW coal-fired generating station at Pego in Portugal which is being built by National Power in co-operation with the Portuguese and the Spanish generating companies. Last year, National Power announced that it had been selected as the preferred bidder to invest $250 million in a 1,600 MW power station in Pakistan. That contract was won against fierce competition. Many companies which operate across the globe are competing fiercely to win contracts in developing countries--National Power was awarded lead bidder status despite competition from Southern Electric International of the United States--so in no way can the sector be termed one in which monopolies exist.
<P>
As a result of the company's adoption of that strategy, National Power's overseas investments total about &#163;900 million. There are investments in about 7,500 MW of plant in Australia, Pakistan, America, Portugal, China, Spain and Turkey. The company is also seeking orders in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, the middle east and South America.
<P>
The lesson that I hope hon. Members will draw from my remarks is that there is an industry out there--the business--to build and operate power stations, particularly in developing countries. There is an enormous amount of money at stake and British companies could earn enormous profits. National Power has built itself into an enormously successful company which is winning orders for this country across the globe. Other British generating companies, particularly PowerGen, are also involved in that business. They, too, are winning contracts--it is a great British success story.
<P>
One of the great benefits that has flowed from privatisation is that the companies which we have created are not only providing services in this country of a higher quality and at cheaper cost than they ever did when they were nationalised, but are taking on the competition across the globe and are beating it. As a result of the measure, however, they will be penalised for that very success.
<P>
I do not accept the principle of the windfall tax, but I acknowledge that it is possible to argue that in areas of business which are monopolistic--which are subject to regulation--there must be special provision. I do not think that the windfall tax is the answer--it is unfair and discriminatory. Why should companies that are competing across the world and beating the competition be taxed on the profits that they make from their success? The Amendment of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells addresses that very point. I ask the Paymaster General to think again because it would be enormously unfair if the Government were to tax the success of some of our best companies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): Much has been made of the importance of fairness. Labour Members have spoken about gathering tax, the ability to pay, and the importance of companies not being destroyed by that process. Indeed, the Chancellor said on 2 July:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I am satisfied that no company faces as unduly heavy tax burden.''--[Official Report, 2 July 1997; Vol. 297, c. 313.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could not help but be struck, as I am sure were all members of the Committee, by the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford. Hyder seems to have been put in an extraordinarily different position from that of some of the other water companies. I hope that it might be appropriate for the Paymaster General to explain what has gone wrong in the case of Hyder.
<P>
I know that Hyder made representations in the pre-Budget period up to 30 May in which it stated--of course--that it was against the windfall tax in principle. I hope that it has not been penalised because of the strength with which it may have made those representations. It must be said, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford pointed out, that the situation is not fair or equitable on any terms, if one works out in financial terms the comparisons to which my hon. Friend drew our attention, the Hyder group has been overcharged by a minimum of &#163;160 million as compared with other, analogous, water companies. Will the Paymaster General explain to the Committee why that decision was made for Hyder and say whether he considers it to be fair and equitable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friends have already said that the tax does not in any way reward companies that have been efficient. I am particularly keen to see companies encouraged to have higher environmental standards.
<P>
The hon. Member for Twickenham commented on the lack of regulatory understanding in the earlier stages of how the companies worked. That was due, not to a total lack of regulatory understanding, however, but to the way in which the regulators were set up in statute. For example, the electricity regulator was allowed to take into account environmental problems, whereas the gas regulator was not. That led to the inconsistency of the Electricity Energy Efficiency Office being set up, when a similar office could not be set up in the gas industry. As a result, the electricity companies' profits have been reduced, whereas the gas companies are allowed to keep that money.
<P>
The windfall tax is therefore inconsistent in two respects. First, it does not encourage efficiency in companies. The Chancellor made it one of his prime aspirations that we should meet our environmental targets in the future, but the windfall tax does nothing in that respect. Secondly, the tax is wrong in principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned Hyder. Is he aware of a public statement in which Hyder said that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``discretionary environmental improvements announced will remain in place''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
despite the windfall tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Individual companies--including Thames Water plc--have said that they will borrow the money and that they expect to be able to charge their customers the same amount without having to increase charges. Ultimately, however, you cannot tax a company by some &#163;283 million--which I think is the charge on Hyder--without it having some effect.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has been here long enough to know that I am not taxing anyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam. I know that perfectly well, and I am grateful for your guidance.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues cannot expect to take out a charge of &#163;283 million--I am subject to correction on that figure--without it having some eventual effect, either on the company's ability to reinvest or on customers' bills. I have no doubt that hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies will be complaining to the Government in two or three years' time, when Hyder and other Welsh utility companies have to put up their charges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman also aware that Hyder has publicly stated that customer rebates will also remain in place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Labour Members will have to explain, to their own Government and to their constituents, how one can levy a charge of &#163;283 million on a company without it having an effect on that company.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I adjourn the Committee, I remind hon. Members that the Room will be locked this afternoon, and papers can be left in their place. The green files in the cupboard are available for hon. Members to leave their documents in over night, so they do not have to cart them around if they do not want to.
<P>
