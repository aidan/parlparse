<h4><center>[Continuation from column 492]</center></h4>
<h5>11.25 am</h5>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Further to your helpful statement before our commercial break, can it be confirmed that starred amendments submitted after the close of the Committee at 1 pm will not be eligible for consideration on Thursday? That is important for logistical reasons and a clarification would be helpful.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The decision to take starred amendments is a matter for the Chair. The Chair will look sympathetically on amendments entered before 1 pm but may take a different view after that. I hope that the informal paper will be available in the Vote Office at about 1.30 pm to give the Minister an opportunity to see the starred amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I associate myself with the Minister in thanking you for the sensible arrangements that you have made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Had the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire finished before the break?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> We have had a good debate, if relatively truncated, on clause 15. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has raised legitimate anxieties and, to use his own terms, I shall not dilate at length, although I want to highlight a couple of points on monetary remuneration and benefits in kind.
<P>
It seems clear that someone who has been underpaid in a particular pay reference period will be able to recoup the specific sum of which he or she has been deprived. It does not appear--though I am willing to be corrected if wrong; I am not a lawyer, and proud of it--that there is any provision for an additional increment to reflect the period of delay between the non-payment and its discovery. That means that there is no acceptance of a need to provide some compensation for the period of deprivation.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry is looking duly interested in this point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am metaphorically wagging my tail at my hon. Friend's comments. Will he put to the Minister the point that as this is a private arrangement, albeit one regulated by statute, it might involve a statutory right to interest, for which the Government are regulating?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes a sensible point.
<P>
I hope that there will be no disagreement about the significance of the clause's wording. It refers to ``additional remuneration'' for the period of deprivation during which the employee did not get what he or she was entitled to. That additional remuneration is calculated, in clause 15(2), as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``the difference between--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the relevant remuneration received by the worker for the pay reference period''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>in other words, what he or she got--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the relevant remuneration which the worker would have received for that period had he been remunerated by the employer at a rate equal to the national minimum wage.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>It is unusual for me to attack the Government from the left, but I have to do so on this occasion--[Interruption.] I hear some sedentary chuntering from the Government Whip; we always welcome his remarks as they enliven our proceedings, even if their enlivening effect is greater than their enlightenment.
<P>
I want to relate a personal experience that moves me to make my argument with particular force. A number of people well known to me who are all pleasant individuals whom I do not wish to name--[Interruption.] This is an extremely serious point and I hope that the Minister will not miss it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Get on with it.
<P>
<B>Mr Bercow:</B> If the Minister would stop chuntering from his sedentary position, I could make speedier progress.
<P>
I want to relate the experience of a former colleague at a company for which I worked for several years. The individual concerned was entitled to a bonus for managing to attract a new client. She and a colleague were responsible for that and their contracts entitled them to a bonus payment of, I think, 2 per cent. of the contract fee from the client.
<P>
The employer argued the toss for ever and a day and refused to cough up the relevant sum. That was a most unsatisfactory state of affairs and they argued with him and harangued him and sought to persuade him that that sum was due. After a long period, the two of them were deemed to be entitled to the payment, but they received it a year or 18 months after they should have had it.
<P>
In the role of friendly counsellor, I asked whether they had requested an additional sum in interest, as one would hope for statutory interest on any sum of which one had been deprived. They felt so relieved to be getting the payment at all that they did not bother to seek any interest or additional sum to cover the inflation that had occurred--modest inflation, of course, as this happened under a Conservative Government.
<P>
Is there to be any consideration of the possibility of interest on top? That would surely be appropriate in circumstances in which--and I do not suggest that this happened in the case I have mentioned--the failure to pay the sum was deliberate.
<P>
The Minister referred earlier to different circumstances in which a sum was accidentally not paid and the failure to adhere to the duty of an employer was inadvertent. In my case, the failure was not only manifest and indisputable, but wilful. I am sure that we all agree that that is a lamentable state of affairs. I argue with an appropriate compassion and tender heart--as you, Mr. Atkinson, knowing me, would expect me to display--that in such circumstances, people who feel aggrieved should be entitled to some compensation.
<P>
The Minister prides himself on his compassion and on his track record of siding with the underdog and of the employee who is discriminated against, rather than the employer doing the discriminating. I would therefore be saddened if he failed to agree with me. I merely ask him to consider--I do not put it any more strongly than that--the possibility that the clause be amended. That is so manifestly reasonable that only an extraordinarily unreasonable person would fail to see the good sense of the argument that the clause might be amended to allow better treatment of the discriminated-against, and in some cases, long-suffering, employee.
<P>
The second example to which I should like to refer is that of someone who has been deprived of a benefit in kind. Should anyone accuse me of diverting from the main subject, the minimum wage--the question is still unanswered whether benefits in kind will feature as part of the national minimum wage. The matter has been effectively privatised: it has been subcontracted for policy advice to the Low Pay Commission on the ground that Ministers and, certainly, Labour Back Benchers are not willing to offer the Committee an authoritative view. Therefore, in clause 15 as it stands, there is a clear reference to ``relevant remuneration'', meaning
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``remuneration which falls to be brought into account for the purposes of regulations under section 2 above.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Benefits in kind might therefore apply under the national minimum wage in future.
<P>
Let us consider the example of an employee who is deprived, in whole or in part, of a benefit in kind to which he or she should contractually be entitled. Let us suppose for the sake of argument that the denial of that benefit is not an accident, or an innocent oversight, but a deliberate decision by an employer to deprive the employee of that to which he or she is entitled in the form of a benefit in kind.
<P>
Will the Minister consider whether the compensation that such an employee in due course receives for that denied benefit in kind is compensation at a level that would have applied in respect of the pay reference period if the benefit in kind had been awarded then? Or is he prepared to take a more generous attitude and consider whether it should be paid at the rate of which it would apply later? That question is not answered by clause 15 as it stands.
<P>
If the employee is to receive compensation for the benefit in kind only at the rate that would have applied if he or she had received it--which he or she did not--at the appropriate time, that is not much compensation if, in the intervening period, there has been a substantial increase in the retail prices index or a substantial rise in the cost, and therefore also in the value, of the benefit in kind. If the benefit in kind at the time of the discovery of the denied benefit is rather more expensive to purchase than it would have been if it had been paid on time, surely the loss should not be suffered by the employee? In such circumstances, it can be cogently argued that the responsibility for making good the difference, uprating the value and ensuring that there is no loss to the employee, is that of the employer.
<P>
The argument has been sufficiently made; I cited one example from my experience, which still sticks in my mind because I thought that those two employees were badly treated. In the end, they received something approximating--I do not consider it more than that--to justice.
<P>
These are important, serious points; I hope that the Minister will treat them as such. I should be delighted if he could accommodate my requests and those of my hon. Friends. If he is unable to give a commitment now--[Interruption.] This is an extremely serious matter. I hope that the hon. Member for Dumfries will not treat it with levity and that he and the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion accept that it is a matter of the utmost seriousness to the individuals who are discriminated against. At least the Minister has behaved as if he takes the point seriously. I hope that he will return to the matter at a later stage with an alternative proposal or reflect on it and discuss it seriously with his officials, who offer the wisdom of Solomon.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Opposition Members made one or two points that I did not cover earlier. The hon. Member for Buckingham raised an interesting point that is worthy of consideration. The worker is intended to recover repayments at the minimum wage rate that applies at the time. I shall consider the matter, and I shall ensure that a copy of Hansard containing this morning's debate goes to the Low Pay Commission. Okay?
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire made a general point about the Bill and he asked whether clause 15 relates to other clauses. Indeed it does. The hon. Gentleman rightly picked up on the fact that the Bill includes categories of worker that were not included in previous legislation or that were in a grey area because of their employment status.
<P>
To ensure that the Bill applies universally, it is vital that home workers and agency workers, for example, are covered and that bogus self-employment arrangements and other contractual arrangements are not used to prevent them from receiving the national minimum wage. The hon. Gentleman's point is well taken. We have taken steps to relate clause 15(1) to other clauses. We must ensure that those categories of worker qualify for the national minimum wage. That is the purpose of those clauses.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked whether the mechanisms in the Employment Rights Act 1996 were sufficiently robust. Yes, they are. They have been tested and they have worked well since their introduction. He also asked about national insurance contributions. Technical issues are always involved when an employer fails to meet his obligations under contractual arrangements. The relevant authorities are well-accustomed to dealing with those problems, and appropriate procedures are in place. I hope that the Opposition accept the clause and that we can make progress.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I said earlier that I rather enjoy serving on Standing Committees--never more so than at present. That may give rise to some mirth, but one of the benefits of such a long sitting is that one can educate oneself and correct the deficiencies in one's education--and there are considerable deficiencies in my case.
<P>
I hope that no member of the Committee feels that I have brought these books before me as protection from the Minister's brickbats--he gave an extremely reasonable response during our debate on clause 15. During our brief adjournments I have discovered ``Harvey on Industrial Relations and Employment Law'', which is a superb book. It puts me in mind of the young Keats and his famous sonnet, ``On First Looking into Chapman's Homer''. Having been introduced to the book, I am now hooked on it. Assuming that I can lift it at the end of our sitting, it may well follow me home and be my bedside reading for the indefinite future.
<P>
I say that in a slightly jocular way, but important issues are involved, including civil liberties and the need to ensure that provisions are acceptable to businesses and are practical. During our debates on enforcement and validating clauses for the national minimum wage the Minister responded to our questions in the appropriate spirit.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire gave us a dress rehearsal for our debate on the clause in his comments on the previous clause. I shall steer carefully and try not to reproduce his remarks. The clause deals with those cases in which there is not the typical employee-employer contract of service, which is the normal industrial relation: it deals with the exceptions.
<P>
In that context, it is clear--and it is all the clearer for my hon. Friend's research; he elucidated it with his characteristic lucidity--that in order to accommodate the concept of the national minimum wage and to provide a legal base for prosecuting failure to pay it back, the Government have erected a legal concept that I shall, in shorthand, call a quasi contact. In those cases there is not an employment contract, but it is deemed to exist to cover the many people who are workers--to use the term of art--and who will be entitled to the national minimum wage. That stretches the concept of employment contract a long way, and signs of strain arise. However, I am not prepared to offer the Government an alternative approach. Their intentions are clear, and we need to examine the potential consequences and to establish whether any of them are difficult and need revisiting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend will correct me if I am wrong, but there is no need to impute the contract. It would be possible to deal with payment of the minimum wage in a worker-employer relationship without bringing in the civil matter of a contract and allowing action to be taken for civil recovery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I understand my hon. Friend's point. It had occurred to me that it would be possible to define when a group of workers did not have a contract of employment and to have a separate recovery procedure for those workers that would be carried out directly by the enforcement officer as a stakeholder on the workers' behalf. It falls to the Minister to answer my hon. Friend as she will have taken the best advice on that complex and technial matter.
<P>
My concern is that clause 16 should not have any unintended consequences. The clause enables a worker to enforce the national minimum wage even if he or she is not a worker in the generally accepted legal sense. As I have said already to my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, who is coming around the Chair, it is a matter of record that the Employment Rights Act 1996 takes a restricted view of who is a worker. Clause 16 will widen that to embrace other categories.
<P>
Rights will be acquired by those who have a lawful contractual relationship but the Bill will also require the courts to examine the relationship before giving a remedy. If the courts considered only what is set out in the 1996 Act, the extra cases would not be covered, so the concept has to be widened.
<P>
Several difficulties have arisen over what is or is not a contract of employment in judgments over the years. I promise not to expand on all of them, but they are enshrined in a fascinating book. It is worth pausing for a moment or two to appreciate the range and complexity of quasi-employment cases and deemed contracts. An interesting issue arises over trainees, which has never been finally resolved, about whether or not there is an automatic contract. I suspect that the hon. Member for Wentworth knows more about this than I do.
<P>
Given the evolution from the youth opportunities programme through the youth training scheme to the new deal, it seems as if the Government have privatised training rather more comprehensively than we did since they are paying subsidies to employers rather than meeting the costs of training from the public purse.
<P>
Agricultural gangmasters are another interesting issue and may concern the Committee later. The whole question of agencies for which there is no contract but where people are employed is also of interest.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull, who is a lawyer and has no need to consult weighty tomes as I do, knows that there is a potential problem affecting ministers of religion. I could recite a litany of settled cases: the President of the Methodist Conference v, Parfitt, Davies v. the Presbyterian church of Wales, the diocese of Southwark v. Coker, for example. All those cases suggested that ministers of religion were not employees but a special category because of the primarily spiritual nature of their profession. As my hon. Friend said, with his customary ability to cut to the heart of a matter, God is their employer.
<P>
There are contentious matters in a number of other cases. In all those cases I suspect that it would attract sympathy from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee if such persons were caught by the deemed contract situation in the clause. I have no conceptual problem with that, but I have a conceptual problem on which the Minister of State needs to pause for a moment.
<P>
The Minister of State will remember that I had a rather sharp exchange with him--almost a peppery one, which is not characteristic of our exchanges--when he implied, I thought rather unworthily, that the Opposition Members were on the side of rogue employers. That remark was nearly as distressing to me as the occasion--only the one--when he slipped a little and seemed to suggest that I was a friend of Arthur Daley. I can assure the Committee that I am not, and we have no brief from him. I replied by implying that the business of deemed contracts might get the Minister of State's moral high horse into deep water, if I may mix my metaphors, because there is an interesting issue in law about illegal contracts, what are rather charmingly called by Harvey ``tainted contracts''. Harvey says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where the contract is tainted with illegality the employee will lose the protection of this Act since the courts will have no truck with someone who seeks to assert an illegal contract''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I notice the Under-Secretary shaking her head. I hope that that is a precursor to a satisfactory assurance on the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It occurs to me that, apart from ministers of religion, whose employment is primarily spiritual in nature, there is another significant group for whom it may be necessary to imply a contract--workers who are working in this country but whose contract of employment is with an employer outside the United Kingdom. My understanding of the Bill is that those workers would be subject to the minimum wage if they normally work here, but if their contract of employment is with an employer outside the United Kingdom and is expressed to be subject to the law of another jurisdiction, would it not be necessary to impute to them a contract under United Kingdom law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is an extraordinarily perceptive point. These are issues that we should debate.
<P>
I return to the point that I was developing about illegal contracts. There would be plenty of precedent for rejecting such contracts and not encouraging them. They would be regarded as contrary to public policy and should not receive the protection of the national minimum wage. An employee could, for example, be conniving with his employer to defraud the Inland Revenue by arranging payment in cash and nobody declaring it, a person could be involved in a long-term fraud, or there could be an employment contract for an illegal purpose. I suppose the most colourful and distasteful example of that would be a hit man's contract to take somebody out. We need not speculate on the nature of the contract, but if there is a contract of employment, or a deemed contract under the clause, no member of the Committee would want to run any risk of it being enforceable in terms of the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered the further and more complex situation where one party to an employment contract may regard it as a perfectly legitimate and legal contract but the other party knows that it is an illegal contract? Such situations could fall under the aegis of the Bill and would cause further complications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He carries on the examination in detail of the implications of the clause. I am giving a legal opinion that I have no right to give, but my gut feeling is that the courts would ultimately have to determine whether there was a contract. His remarks bear on the issue of the burden of proof, which we will discuss later. Can the worker assert rights? Is the normal burden of proof reversed vis-a-vis the employee?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The law of employment contract is fairly straightforward: most of us understand situations in which people are employed by employers under contracts of service. However, in order to preserve equity, against which we do not argue, the Government seek to import a large number of different types of arrangement, vest them with a contract--I hope that the Minister will explain why it is necessary to use that private law route--or deem that they have a contract. The Government say that the contract will expressly contain the right. That strains many legal concepts. As we have found so many times in the Bill, it also reflects the variety of economic life and the difficulty of ramming it all into any single, universal mould.
<P>
I do not seek to overturn what the Government are about, but I invite them to consider my points and those of my hon. Friends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend will correct me if I am mistaken; he has far greater knowledge and experience of examining legislation than I have. However, it occurs to me that it is common practice when a contract is implied or imputed for a form of that contract to be included as a schedule in legislation. The old employment protection legislation had as annexe (a) a standardised form of contract that was implied or imputed as the contract for any worker who did not have another contract.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. On this occasion, I shall defer to the Minister's legal knowledge, and invite her to comment. I have a feeling that that may have been superseded by events.
<P>
This is a complex matter; it will do the national minimum wage no good to get it wrong, or to create further anomalies. I hope and confidently expect that Ministers will address those points.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I have listened carefully to the points that have been made and to the hon. Member for Daventry. I understand that the hon. Gentleman is genuinely trying to be helpful and to tease this out. However, I do not share his perplexity.
<P>
A number of errors have, understandably, been made in the approach that has been taken. Our approach is simple. The purpose of clause 16 is to ensure that people such as home workers or agency workers, who are not formally workers under an employment contract, can still slot into existing mechanisms for the recovery of unlawful deductions under the Employment Rights Act 1996.
<P>
There has been much discussion in the Committee--quite rightly--about home workers and about the different forms of work and employment status that exist. It is fair to say that there has been general agreement that home workers, one of the most vulnerable groups of worker, should receive the minimum wage. The clause is a device--to pay tribute to the parliamentary draftsmen, it is rather a neat device--to enable them to do so.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked why we wanted to do this. We want to ensure that the worker can enforce his or her right to the minimum wage before an industrial tribunal or an ordinary court. It is not unusual under employment law, as the hon. Member for Solihull will know, for people to have a choice of remedy for enforcing such a right.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, who always develops her arguments cogently. I know that she is very fair-minded, and would not want anyone to be characterised or typecast. We both acknowledge that some home workers are very poorly paid, but will she also acknowledge that some home workers are very comfortably off?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Absolutely. A very interesting discussion took place earlier on that point. Some home workers in many of our newer industries such as high-technology industry and teleworking--which all Committee members would like to see enhanced--are very highly skilled and highly paid. I hope that the record will show that although some home workers are among the most vulnerable people, they are not by any means a homogenous group. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. I hope that he too--as a fair-minded man--would agree with me that great numbers of home workers are in dire straits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> There are difficult lines to be drawn between who counts as a home worker, who counts as an agency worker, and who counts as self-employed. With regard to self-employed status, there are people who regard themselves as self-employed but who, for the purposes of the national minimum wage, would be brought within the ambit of clause 16. Will the Minister assure the Committee that nobody who is regarded as self-employed for tax purposes will be defined as a worker for the purposes of the national minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The question of who is employed and who is self-employed is not a new one. There is a well-established body of law on the subject and a number of tests to decide whether someone is employed or self-employed. I cannot see how clause 16 creates any difficulties in this respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I have been over the nursery slopes, but I am no expert on the difference between a contract of service and a contract for services. Will the Minister confirm whether or not the Bill alters that classical set of distinctions? Does it break new ground in the difference between a contract of employment and a contract for services?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</b> No, I assure the hon. Gentleman that it does not. We are trying to do a simple thing, although I accept that we have a device for the right to be enforced. We are saying that where people are clearly workers but, perhaps, their circumstances do not conform to the usual employer-employee relationship, they should be entitled to the universality of the provision. They should therefore be able to enforce the right.
<P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry quoted from Harvey, which is a worthy tome, and I wish him many hours of enjoyment with it; I have to say that such enjoyment has so far escaped me. I hope that he will take this in the spirit in which it is meant--the remarks that he made about illegal contracts are something of a red herring. The intention behind clause 16 is to give the same entitlement to some of the groups of workers that we have spoken about. The clause is extremely well drafted, it will be helpful and it will deal with some of the issues raised by hon. Members, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I must be the most ignorant member of the Committee--[Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.'']. I thank Government Members for that one mark of approbation. It always seems to fall to me to ensure that we understand what is going on here. Perhaps the Minister will bear with me if I ascertain whether I am right in believing that the structure is as follows.
<P>
Clause 51 defines ``worker''. My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull specifically referred to contracts for services, and the notes on clauses for clause 51 make it clear that contracts for services would be brought into account to give a wider definition of worker. How wide is that definition? I do not wish to debate clause 51, but whatever the subsequent conclusion on that clause, a person who is a worker under the definition in it is brought back into clause 15 and qualifies for the national minimum wage, and is therefore qualified to have his remuneration and so on. Then, by virtue of being in clause 15, he becomes somebody who, under clause 16, can secure remuneration for a relevant pay period, including, if necessary, construing a contract so as to give a basis for civil proceedings in pursuance of the civil right established under clause 15.
<P>
If that step-by-step summary is right, the definition in clause 51 of who is a worker bears directly on clause 16, and a worker under clause 51 becomes a person who can use clause 16 and the contract right that it creates to secure his rights under the national minimum wage.
<P>
That brings me simply to my point. I understand that Ministers intend, as expressed in the notes on clauses under clause 16, to bring in as wide as possible a definition of employee and employer and to define worker and employer widely enough to include home workers and agency workers wherever possible. My fear is that it will include self-employed people more than is intended. I freely admit, and here I confess my ignorance for the second time, that I do not know where the boundaries lie in this difficult question of what constitutes contractor service and in what circumstances the definitions will construe somebody to be working exclusively for an employer. Will the same definition be used in the national minimum wage as is used by the Government for other purposes? If so, would it help the Committee to have that definition, so that we can see one definition delineated with another.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I take it that in his interesting remarks my hon. Friend seeks to draw a distinction between what might loosely be called in lay terms genuine self-employment and contrived self-employment, which is a means of evading both this obligation and a number of other obligations under employment law. Is that what he is driving at?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> It is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> And that is what the Minister must answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. That is exactly what I am driving at. Once again, he helps me to make my point clearer. I have two reasons for seeking to draw that distinction. In the Ministers' intention--from their point of view admirable--of trying to make sure that the national minimum wage is as universal as they can make it, they may bring into its ambit those who are self employed where it was not their intention to do so. Secondly, if, however--
<P>
<B>Mr. John Taylor:</B> Before my hon. Friend leaves the subject of self-employment, will he agree that we have an authority in our society, and a formidable one at that, that takes a keen interest in bogus self-employment, and that is the Inland Revenue? To be taxed under schedule D is an advantage compared with being taxed under schedule E. One of the tests that the Inland Revenue applies is that if the so-called self-employed person contracts with only one other person, he may not be self employed.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. In the past few months I have had a flurry of constituency cases involving people in the building industry who were previously regarded as self employed and who are now considered to be employed. People who drive their own taxis find themselves in a similar position.
<P>
The boundaries are moving. Whether or not people want to be self employed depends on whether they prefer the liberating free-market opportunity outside the national minimum wage or the protection of being within the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I give way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that that is another reason for harmonising the way people are treated for tax and for the national minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The Minister should assure the Committee that the definitions will be harmonised for those purposes.
<P>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne is not present, as I recall that she has a family relationship with the hairdressing industry. I have been in touch with the Hairdressing Employers Association and the National Hairdressers Federation. They made some important comments, and one anecdote is relevant and may indicate a trend.
<P>
I was told that the industry is worried that some employers may be taking measures to anticipate the rate of the minimum wage. The most notable step is that stylists are being made self employed and are being charged rent for the use of a chair.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Bogus self employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Such manoeuvring may be evidence that employers are trying to escape their obligations, or that people think that it may be in their interests to be outside the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Did my hon. Friend hear the Minister's sedentary comment that he was describing a form of bogus self employment? I fear that the matter may not be so simple. The key test to determine whether people are genuinely self employed devolves upon the amount of business risk that they face. The rent of a hairdresser's chair on, say, a 10-year lease could be structured so that the lessee was genuinely taking a business risk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I do not know enough about the subject to judge whether my hon. Friend is right.
<P>
Clause 16 depends on definitions to which we could return when we come to clause 51. Will Ministers add to the notes on clauses to amplify the definition of self employment that the Government use, and to make clear how a worker is defined for the purposes of the national minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall not try your patience, Mr. Atkinson--I shall be brief. I sought to explain that the measure is intended to cover contrived, not genuine, self-employment. There is not one but several well-known tests of self employment. The example was given of employers suddenly making people self employed because of the national minimum wage, but that is nothing new in the labour market. It has been--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I must draw my remarks to a close. As I was saying, that has been done before.
<P>
The Bill is in no way intended to catch the genuinely self employed. Clause 16 provides a way for workers as defined by the Bill who are in unusual working relationships to have the minimum wage enforced. I assure the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire that the courts are well used to defining ``self employed''. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
</FONT>Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> There are one or two points raised by the clause which fall outside the Government amendments on which we have just voted. Our concern on a number of clauses has been that although we respect the good faith of Ministers who genuinely intend not to oppress people, nevertheless the effect of what is before us might in certain circumstances give rise to oppression. I do not believe that Ministers want that; I am quite sure that neither my hon. Friends nor I want it. It is our duty to the Committee not to rush through the clauses to this Bill but to give them proper consideration and see whether they can be improved in the interests of the citizen.
<P>
In anticipating the rebuttal that we will no doubt receive, either via Excalibur or direct from the Government Front Bench, I do not wish to take from those sources the canard that Opposition Members are interested simply in giving shelter or sustenance to indifferent employers. That is not an adult way in which to discuss very important matters, most of which have a legal basis--the Opposition can return to their legal mode at any time--when the right balance of rights and responsibilities has to be struck.
<P>
Before I come to my specific anxieties about the clause, I should like to flag up another matter to Ministers. Ministers err by seeking to present the issues under discussion as a zero sum gain. Anything that the Opposition say that might by chance seem to favour an employer--I hope that that occurs only in defensible circumstances--is also construed as being at employees' expense. Although I did not comment on it, I noted with interest the Government's astonishment when my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham spoke of amendments that, it is fair to say, came from his wing of the party. They could be described as collectivist, as warm, caring and even as touchy-feely amendments. My hon. Friend was right. Some hon. Members are interested in the rights of employees, in civil liberties, and in achieving the right balance.
<P>
That is enough to preface. I suspect that some of my hon. Friends might also wish to comment on the clause. I shall draw two specific points to the Committee's attention.
<P>
The first line of clause 17 invites consideration of a hypothetical situation. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If an officer acting for the purposes of this Act''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is a good start, because it is tied to the national minimum wage, not to a general fishing expedition. The sentence deteriorates. It goes on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is of the opinion that a worker who qualifies for the national minimum wage has not been remunerated''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on. The Committee should pause on the concept of being ``of the opinion''. Anyone can have a huge range of opinions on a variety of subjects, as most members of the Committee do. Those subjects can range from the worthiness--or otherwise--of the national minimum wage to the question of who will win the cup this year.
<P>
Opinions derive from a variety of sources. Some members of the Committee may well receive them from tabloid newspapers. Others think them out for themselves, from first principles. Some Committee members seek for the evolution of a minimum wage about which they do not wholly know. Simply having an opinion does not mean that it is correct. It may be wrong. We all make mistakes from time to time. I invite the Committee to consider whether a legal term would qualify the opinion in question.
<P>
At the moment, the clause relies on self certification. An officer who is subject to legal action because of misconduct, for example, would no doubt be able to say in court ``Well, your honour, that is what I thought and it was my opinion.'', and that would be the end of the matter. No one else could look into my brain and tell me what my opinion was. The insertion into the clause of an adjective to qualify that variant noun, ``opinion'', would impart a test that might be transmuted through a judge or through the chairman of an employment tribunal. Potential words could be ``genuine'' or ``reasonable'', or the opinion could even be described as being ``based on proper grounds''.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend has given examples of alternative and superior wordings that could have been deployed. Another alternative would be for the line to read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If an officer acting for the purposes of this Act has reason to believe.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that wording were deployed, objectivity would replace the unsatisfactory subjectivity with which the clause saddles us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am listening carefully. I have the advantage of having had a good night's sleep--I am shamefaced--so my faculties, such as they are, are in reasonable trim. I am not entirely certain where this line of debate is going or whether it is particularly relevant to the clause. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman returned to discussing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I will indeed. Perhaps I was tempted from the paths of righteousness by my hon. Friend. Before he takes offence, I should say that there is a cornucopia of riches on these Benches; to change the metaphor, one can strike the rock and water gushes out. His alternative wording is worth considering.
<P>
I shall comply with your strictures, Mr. Atkinson. An officer must act reasonably. I invite the Committee to consider whether the bare noun ``opinion'' provides sufficient safeguard. An officer could self-certify that he had acted because he held an opinion. There is a wider danger--it is germane to this and previous debates--that would be difficult to overcome: an officer who might be biased or have a down on the individual concerned could act oppressively, but claim that he held an opinion.
<P>
I find another point somewhat objectionable. Subsection (6) indicates that a tribunal has a straightforward choice. An appeal must fail unless there are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no grounds for the service of the enforcement notice'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which might be a problem if an officer holds the opinion that there are such grounds, or if there is an arithmetical error--the sums are wrong. That is unduly restrictive. There might be objective grounds for service of the enforcement notice, but an officer might genuinely believe them not to be valid. They could be, to use a legal term, unreasonable or--a procedural point--not based on a proper analysis. An officer could have rushed in, jumped to conclusions and treated a citizen unfairly.
<P>
My hon. Friends may want to contribute on this important point of civil liberties. By way of providing a modest trailer to the legal profession, we need to incorporate the concept of reasonableness at subsection (6)(a) and, implicitly, in subsection (1). The phrases ``no reasonable grounds'' or ``the officer's genuine belief'' could be packaged up by deleting the words ``is of the opinion''. The words ``genuinely believes on reasonable grounds'' come close to the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham.
<P>
This is not an attempt to subvert the clause. We want to ensure that opinions are subject to an objective test and are not exercised or certified unreasonably or oppressively.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I call Mr. Hammond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I do not know by what process you reached your conclusion, but I am delighted with it.
<P>
I have often heard horse racing commentators use the expression, ``They enter the final furlong.'' Before today, I never had a sense of what that felt like, but the clock shows that we are there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will my hon. Friend speculate about who is ahead by a length?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am afraid that my knowledge of racing is too limited.
<P>
Clause 17 outlines the procedure when an authorised officer decides that a worker who qualifies for the minimum wage is not receiving it. The officer then serves a notice requiring the employer to pay the wage as stated in that notice. The employer may also be required to pay any arrears that the officer decides are due.
<P>
An employer served such a notice can appeal to an industrial tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The first problem with the procedure is that the clause does not specify what the officer has to do before arriving at a decision. Does my hon. Friend agree that that procedure needs to be reasonably lengthy and secure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I assure my hon. Friend that I was about to return to the procedure. To continue the equine analogy, I was cantering through the structure of the clause simply to make sure that I had it right in my own mind.
<P>
My hon. Friend is right to ask what an officer has to do to be reasonably certain that a worker qualified for the national minimum wage has not been paid it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The test of reasonableness under the clause might come down to the officer being ``of the opinion'', but does it become a test of evidence if it is a question of the officer having reason to believe? That might be rather subjective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am neither a lawyer nor a semanticist. I would prefer not to speculate on the difference between having an opinion and having reason to believe. I suspect that they are rather similar.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Reasonableness depends on which side of the argument one is on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I always thought that that was subjectivity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister was being jocular, but a reasonable opinion requires evidence, written or spoken, from a reliable source. We want to avoid an employer being threatened with enforcement action as a result of a scurrilous rumour possibly propagated by a business rival.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The problem is that there is no question of threat: enforcement action will follow if the officer forms that opinion and issues a notice. There is no requirement in the Bill for that opinion to be reasonably formed.
<P>
It is relevant to the way in which the officer forms his opinion to consider the cases in which he is likely to be involved. For obvious reasons, it is highly unlikely that he will go to a large factory because someone has tipped him off that all the workers who clock in every morning and clock off every evening are being paid 50p an hour less than the minimum wage. It is much more likely that he will be called in when there is a dispute or doubt about the value of a benefit in kind. We are at something of a disadvantage because we do not yet know the form that the definition of remuneration will take in the regulations that will be promulgated under the Act.
<P>
We might also speculate that the officer will be called in when there are disputes between employers and employees about the amount of gratuities that have been earned and which are to be taken into account. There could also be disputes about the calculation of an hourly rate on the basis of data such as piece work performed and hours of work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> At this point in his argument, will my hon. Friend comment on procedure? He said--and this seems to be the case from the notes on clauses--that there is no procedural requirement on an officer to consult both employer and employee before serving a notice. I do not want to prejudge the question of whether an appeal could succeed in the face of procedural flaws, but should there not be a procedural requirement to take a view on both sides?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I shall accelerate to my next-but-one point, which concerns precisely that. Given the complexity of the issues that an officer is likely to face, there is a strong case for arbitration or conciliation before he takes precipitate action, such as issuing a notice. As my hon. Friends have noted, such action could seriously damage an employer's reputation. Because of the peculiar operation of the burden of proof, the Bill assumes the employer's guilt at the moment the notice is issued and requires him to establish his innocence.
<P>
That is the first of the four points that I want to put to the Minister for consideration. Ought there not to be provision for arbitration or, at least, conciliation at the earliest stage of the procedure? The explanatory and financial memorandum refers to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I beg my hon. Friend's pardon, but he will find that a conciliation procedure is available under clause 27. As far as I can see, however, it is not available in respect of the serving of an enforcement notice on an employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend may be further ahead in his homework than me, but my understanding is that that procedure would not be applicable at an early stage, before a notice was served. Conservative Members are concerned that the notice should not be served until it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that there is a case to answer. Serving the notice implies certain things about the employer. Because of the unusual structuring of the burden of proof, the notice implies that he is guilty and he is then put on notice to demonstrate his innocence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way before he leaves this most interesting point. Has he considered the fact that, even if most enforcement officers behaved sensitively, the fact that there is no apparent procedure through which they need to go before serving an enforcement notice on the basis of some ill-defined belief will serve to poison relations between enforcement officers and business? Businesses will expect to be treated badly and unfairly unless a proper procedure is instituted. If it is not, the Bill's implementation will feed a slow poison into relations between the enforcement officers and those parts of the business world that they are meant to supervise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right. We referred earlier to the potential of this part of the Bill for generating unnecessary conflict in the workplace. I want to make another related point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but as we are approaching the Adjournment, I want to say two things. First, the prediction that the additional amendments would be in the Vote Office from about 1.30 pm turned out to be optimistic. It will be early afternoon before the informal paper is ready.
<P>
Secondly, this has been a long sitting. I should like to thank the shorthand writers, the police and the officials who are ``never here'' but who have been with us through the night--[Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear''.]

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Our sitting has lasted for 26 and a half hours. That is probably the longest Committee sitting ever. When we came in at 10.30 am yesterday, we had spent a fortnight on a single clause but as we prepare to leave at 1 o'clock, we have reached clause 17. That is a sign of the seriousness with which Labour Members treat the aim of eradicating low pay in Britain.

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> On behalf of all members of the Committee I echo Mr. Atkinson's acknowledgement of all the staff who over the 26 and a half hours provided physical and moral assistance as well as other types of assistance, which it is too embarrassing to mention but which were received in the early hours of the morning. Labour Members have enjoyed the debate with Opposition Members--
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Not as much as we have.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> As my old finishing school motto went, ``Au revoir, my lovelies, till next time.''
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That was not a point of order for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I should like to echo, on behalf of Conservative Members, what has been said in respect of the staff. If I may say so without invidiousness, I should also like to express our thanks to the two Chairmen, to Ministers and all members of the Committee. We have endured a test--though there may be others to come--in a good spirit and with moderation and courtesy, which I hope will continue to characterise our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Good morning--[Interruption.] Time passes exceedingly quickly in this place. I add my sentiments to those of the previous speakers. It has been an informative and enjoyable occasion. The cameraderie that we managed to generate might not be repeated for some time, but I trust that it will not be too long.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
<P>
