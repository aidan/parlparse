Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment </B>(Mr. Michael Wills): Thank you, Mr. Benton. I welcome you back again, slightly unexpectedly, to the Committee this afternoon. I hesitate to say whether this will be our last sitting, but I am delighted to be back.
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee for long, but I want to address the important question of selection. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) was concerned about this issue and it is important that we should remind ourselves why the Government have taken the approach that they have. The matter was discussed exhaustively during deliberations on the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, which, as hon. Members will recall, provided for the admission authorities of schools with a specialism, not limited to special schools designated by the Secretary of State, to select up to 10 per cent. of their pupils on the basis of aptitude for a prescribed subject. City academies will be specialist schools and their funding agreements will be entirely consistent with the Government's policies for maintained schools. We intend to make it possible for those schools to select 10 per cent. of their year seven intake each year on the basis of aptitude for the specialism.
<P>
The reasons for that are simple. I have explained them already but they are important and I want to try to allay the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East. Specialist schools must emphasise one particular curriculum area. In those circumstances, it makes sense to give them the opportunity to select a small proportion of pupils on the basis of aptitude for that specialism. If a specialist school exists in an area, pupils with an aptitude for the subject may have a particular interest in attending the school, but we deliberately decided that the percentage should be small so as not to have a major impact on the composition of overall pupil intake. Having said that, we believe that allowing for a proportion of pupils to be selected on the basis of their aptitude for a particular specialism will have an impact on the development of that specialism in that school. It will help the school to perfect its experience and expertise, raise standards of teaching and learning and, therefore, benefit every pupil in the school. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East is very concerned about the impact on all pupils, and rightly so. We are all concerned about the impact on all pupils, but we believe that the measure will benefit every pupil. There is no question of there being second-class pupils in any schools for which we are responsible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall give way in a moment but I want to make one final point. It will be for the city academy itself to decide whether to select 10 per cent. of its pupils, just as it is for the admission authorities in specialist schools to decide. It will be an option, not a requirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> It is germane to the argument that I ask the Minister to put on record an answer to this question, for the sake of the Committee and, especially, for the sake of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East. Since the introduction of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, in which the selection of 10 per cent. of pupils by aptitude was introduced in specialist schools, how many schools have been granted specialist status and, of those, how many have employed the 10 per cent. selection process? The Minister will know that it is less than 5 per cent.—it will be interesting to find out the exact figure—which shows that there is no evidence on which to base his argument that the measure is either wanted or will have the desired result.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As always, the hon. Gentleman brings a wealth of experience to the subject. We do not have the exact figures with us, but I shall write to him with the exact details. [Interruption.] I have just been informed that we do not have the figures [Laughter.] When I said we, I meant we. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with a precise answer.
 On his question about whether the proposal is wanted, the selection process will be an option. We shall not impose the idea on schools, but if they think it is appropriate, they can implement it. There is a logical basis for the belief that I have set out. The hon. Gentleman is rightly concerned about evidence, but sometimes we must proceed on the basis that there is the potential to do good. That is why we are giving schools the option.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): As a point of information, will the Minister tell the Committee whether it would be possible for a city academy to interview all applicants to the school as part of the process of deciding who should fit into the 10 per cent. for selection on the specialist criterion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills: </B>Yes, it would be possible, although whether a school chose to do that would be a matter for the school. To conclude my brief remarks on this subject, unless any other hon. Members want to intervene—<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): The Minister, while making his case valiantly, ignores the fact that many people in the Labour party have campaigned for 35 years against extending selection, so my hon. Friend does not persuade me that there is any merit in the selection process. If he wanted to argue the question from a practical viewpoint, he would ask what the effect of selection has been during the past couple of years, and the answer is nil. He need not bother to tell us the precise figures because, within the context of secondary education, the proposal will be completely insignificant. Having campaigned for 35 years to end selection, I remind him that it took 20 years, from 1944–45, for the Labour party to arrive at its policy on comprehensive secondary education, and I do not believe that it acquits itself well now to introduce an extension of selection at the age of 11. Again, I ask: what about the other 90 per cent.? Is it not sufficient for people to express a view that they want to go to a particular school? Why impose selection?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that reminder, but I remind him that the Labour party has campaigned for 100 years to extend opportunity to everybody and we must take appropriate measures to further that where there is a clear need to do so. I accept that I will not persuade him, but I urge him not to get hung up on means rather than ends. I share his ideological passion for the outcome that we all want to see, and I urge him to focus his formidable energies and passions on that, rather than on this one prescriptive measure that we are including in the Bill. It is an option, not a requirement, and if it will work, why should we rule it out?
<P>
I leave my hon. Friend with that question because I believe that we have troubled you enough with this issue, Mr. Benton.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 331, in page 82, line 23, leave out subparagraph 3.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 385 and 386.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I first say how pleased I am that you are back in the Chair, Mr. Benton? I hope that we will discharge our remaining proceedings crisply and to the point. I shall not belabour the amendment but, despite the excitement of our exemplary debate, there are other important matters to consider.
<P>
The Government have recognised the problem in their amendments, which appear primarily or substantially to meet our concerns. I do, however, have a couple of points to make. The Minister will be familiar from visits to further education colleges that they promote activities other than the strict delivery of education, such as a catering activity or a partnership activity with local business, which is all well and good. The original proposal was to regularise or put on a fair basis the conduct of such businesses by establishing companies as a supplementary function of further education. I have no objection to that. However, I am slightly worried about the structure that will be secured by the Government's arrangements.
<P>
Further education colleges are being given the power to form companies as a supplementary activity, but only if no public money is involved and they are not for the purposes of education. If public moneys are committed to that process or put at risk by the formation of the company, the colleges will have to apply to the Learning and Skills Council to validate the proceedings. That is a clumsy procedure. However, the Government's structure is probably the only option.
<P>
I have one or two specific concerns. I am worried about the de minimis aspect. I can imagine a situation, which I have often seen in further education colleges, in which a non-educational activity is used sensibly for a subordinate role in education. For example, a college might have a catering activity. It might find a way in which it could introduce one or two students to that activity—either as tuition, as full members of the college, or as work experience—thereby enabling them to participate in it as part of an education experience.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not considering a college tuition catering department—many of us have had excellent meals at training restaurants—but a contingent use of a college support facility for the purposes of education. No member of the Committee would suggest that it would be wrong to have such an activity if it was properly conceived and properly protected.
<P>
The converse situation might be one in which public money was used for a primarily educational purpose and the activity was extended or was associated with another activity, meaning that it linked across the boundary into the company activities of the college. I am concerned about both possibilities—a redefinition of what constitutes education or a possible migration of money to the company activity from the college activity. A breach of the conditions or a forensic investigation by the Learning and Skills Council might be triggered.
<P>
The Under-Secretary might want to say that the situation can be dealt with only through sensible give and take and that he would not seek to discourage de minimis understandings. The wording appears to be restrictive, with the suggestion that it would be impossible for the college to proceed, unless it had specific permission to do so, if there was a whiff of public money intended for education.
<P>
I am concerned about what we might call prior clearance. I do not want to refer too much to the Inland Revenue because I know that that upsets the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, who has had enough upsets today already. Companies will be familiar with being able to approach the Inland Revenue to talk about what they intend to do and possibly to get clearance. A college might form a company or make a sensible business proposition, possibly involving the private sector as well as a little learning and skills money. I would hope that, so long as the intentions of the activity were not distorted, such a college could go to the Learning and Skills Council to say what it proposed to do and state the ball-park expenditure, explaining how it intended to finance the project and showing its business plan. I hope that such a plan would be accepted unless or until the college materially changed it.
<P>
The issues might work out in practice through common sense, to use the favourite phrase of the Minister—the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks). We are prescribing in statute, the provision has been felt to be over-restrictive and the Government are seeking to relax it. I am anxious that they relax it sensibly so that colleges do not feel constrained in undertaking sensible activities as part of, although not necessarily in the same legal form as, their main education activities.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Hayes </B>(South Holland and The Deepings): I intend to be uncontroversial. It would be entirely inappropriate for me to be controversial given the earlier proceedings. I want to amplify and to endorse a couple of my hon. Friend's points. The first concerns difference between curricular and extra-curricular activities in colleges and the impact on extra-curricular activities of what might loosely be called entrepreneurial or commercial activities. The second concerns the investment of public funds in respect of both capital and revenue spending.
<P>
My thoughts on the first point stem from my experience in education, which I obtained largely during my time in the IT industry, when I dealt with both colleges and schools. It was common for colleges to develop extra-curricular activities that had a commercial flavour or character. For example, colleges that had extensive IT facilities sometimes developed entrepreneurial activities that did not form a core part of their educational activities or of their mission, but were a peripheral aspect of them. Examples of such activities include maintaining computers, giving advice as a consultancy or providing training. Students could become involved in the work outside the course of their study and it had some use and value.
<P>
I do not think that any of the provisions that we have considered today would prevent such activities, but will the Minister confirm that they will not make it more difficult to engage in them? Will he also confirm that colleges will not be effectively dissuaded from undertaking such activities, which are peripheral to their overall purpose and are neither great income generators nor enormously profitable, but which can provide useful and valuable experience outside the normal curriculum for students and staff?
<P>
The second issue with which I should like to deal concerns public money and funds. In the light of the examples to which I referred, we should bear it in mind that substantial public investment could have been made in the capital—the kit and equipment used for the commercial activity. However peripheral the activity is, it may be founded as a result of such investment. Setting up a business from scratch will obviously mean investing money to build up the capital and stock of equipment. Is there any bar that stops colleges from engaging in commercial activities by using goods and equipment that are not taken out of educational use but were purchased by investment made for other purposes? The classic example is extracurricular use of IT equipment whose place in normal study is not obviated but whose purchase implicitly involved an investment of public money. Having seen such activities during my time in business, I believe that it would be undesirable to reduce them by imposing a bar.
<P>
I have made two simple points, about which I do not think that there will be any contention. I may find common ground with the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, as I do not think that there is much between us on this subject.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment </B>(Mr. Malcolm Wicks): As has been implied, we are now in calmer waters, although I am happy to speak for two and half hours on this matter if there is any demand for me to do so.
<P>
In the past, there has been some doubt about whether further education corporations can form or to take part in companies. That is why the Government amended the current legislation by drafting paragraph 5 of schedule 8, in an attempt to provide clarification. As Lord Bach recognised when the matter was discussed in another place, we may not have got this one quite right. He promised that the Government would table amendments to increase the flexibility of the provision while ensuring the retention of safeguards to public funds and to the provision of publicly funded education. We are fulfilling that commitment with Government amendments No. 385 and 386. Given the lateness of the hour, at least in terms of the Committee's life, it may be helpful if I speak to these amendments now. We have some technical concerns about amendment No. 331, and I hope that my remarks will provide some reassurance.
<P>
Government amendment No. 385 will allow colleges to form a company for the purposes of providing self-financing education or training. Government amendment No. 386 will prevent colleges from using subsidiary companies to provide publicly funded education, unless the council supplying the funds—that is, the Learning and Skills Council or the Welsh equivalent—consents to their use in that manner. The general principles underlying the circumstances in which LSC funds might be used to support employer-based educational training were set out in recently published technical consultation documents.
<P>
In the main, we would expect the public funds that are allocated to an FE college to be used for the purposes of that college and not for other activities, just as the money that an LEA allocates to a school should be used for the purposes of that school. However, a college company might be well placed to deliver educational training that should be supported by public funds, which will be permitted with the consent of the Learning and Skills Council. It will not, however, be necessary for the corporation to seek approval for every occasion or student. The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and others pressed me on that.
<P>
The LSC will have the power to make general conditions of grant and may use that to avoid excessive bureaucratic control. I accept the common sense of the college being able to discuss that with the LSC at a preliminary stage. I am pleased that we have been able to deliver on our promise to clarify the powers of corporations in this respect, and I am grateful to the Association of Colleges for its input into getting this matter right.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured hon. Members. I shall look carefully at the record to ensure that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) has received a full answer to his questions. I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw his amendment and support our amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We set down a marker that the LSC should be as flexible and unbureaucratic as possible when it handles approaches by colleges and that it should not pursue colleges over minor differences of opinion on the origin of funding. I am conscious that we have made progress and that there is a consensus that the arrangement should work. In the light of those caveats and the Minister's readiness to re-examine the record, I give a fair wind to the Government. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 364 to 366.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> This is essentially a technical amendment. It corrects deficiencies in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. Section 44 provides that sixth form colleges in the further education sector should provide an act of collective worship at least once a week. Section 44(3) ensures that collective worship at institutions of voluntary origin should comply with any trust deed and reflect the religious traditions and practices of the institution before it entered the sector. Section 45 of the 1992 Act makes a similar provision for religious education.
<P>
Unfortunately, those sections are defective and do not work as intended. We have no difficulty with the basic content of the provisions, which we supported when we were in opposition. However, we have taken the opportunity to amend them so that they work properly. In particular, amended sections 44 and 45 will apply to any institutions for 16 to 19-year-olds that might enter the FE sector. The Secretary of State will be able to designate an institution for the purposes of sections 44 and 45. The amended sections will also apply to institutions that are created through the merger of existing institutions that fall within the definitions in new subsections (2)(a) to (c). I can confirm that the amendments have the support of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England, which are the two denominations with colleges in the further education sector.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 364. Section 89 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 provides for all orders and regulations made by the Secretary of State under provisions in that Act to be made by statutory instrument, subject to the negative resolution procedure. Section 89(2) provides for certain exceptions, so that, in appropriate cases, orders may be made that are not subject to parliamentary procedure. That is normally the case when an order relates to a single institution, or class of institution, and is therefore very detailed, and when those affected have been consulted.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 364 will add to the list of provisions that are exempt from parliamentary procedure, the new order-making powers that will be inserted by the Bill into the 1992 Act at sections 30(2)(b) and 44(2)(c). Section 30(2)(b) provides for the Secretary of State to designate an institution, or class of institution, to which section 30 may apply. As amended by the Bill, section 30 will enable the protection of the established character of institutions by providing for the appointment of governors for that purpose, and the incorporation of the governing bodies of designated institutions.
<P>
Section 44 requires all sixth form colleges to provide an act of collective worship at least once a week. In the case of what are described as institutions of voluntary origin, the section imposes a further requirement that acts of collective worship must be in accordance with the provisions of any trust deed, and with the religious traditions and established practices of the institution. Subsection (2)(c) allows the Secretary of State to designate appropriate institutions as institutions of voluntary origin, so that these additional requirements will apply. In both cases, the power is likely to be used rarely and is itself quite minor, so it is entirely appropriate that these provisions should be exempt from parliamentary procedure.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 365 and 366 are minor and technical. They will repeal spent provisions in sections 44 and 45 of the 1992 Act that are no longer meaningful.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 381 and 400.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Amendments Nos. 380, 381 and 400 are needed to provide a short-lived, but vital, transitional arrangement for the adult learning inspectorate. Under clause 50, the inspectorate will consist of nine members. We envisage that the chairman and chief inspector will be appointed soon after Royal Assent, which I hope will be in the summer. All nine members of the new inspectorate may not be appointed until later in the year, and meanwhile certain key tasks will have to be carried out. Let me make it clear, however, that we intend that all nine members will be appointed by the end of this year.
<P>
The common inspection framework will need to be agreed with Ofsted before it is put out to consultation for three months. The inspectorate will have to secure premises in September and to start recruiting and training staff. Furthermore, significant planning arrangements will require executive decisions in September—for example, agreeing with Ofsted a programme of area and joint inspections, although the inspections will not begin until April 2001.
<P>
Amendment No. 400 will allow the adult learning inspectorate to function with as few as two members—in practice, the chairman and chief inspector—during the transitional period. Once all the other members have been appointed, the provision will expire automatically.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will recognise the transitional nature of the arrangement, and regard it as sensible.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may consider Government amendment No. 401.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The whole of the Education (Student Loans) Act 1990 was repealed by section 44(2) and schedule 4 of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. The Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 (Commencement No. 2 and Transitional Provisions) Order 1998, made in exercise of powers contained in section 42(6) and 46(4) of the 1998 Act, contains savings which ensure that the relevant provisions are preserved in relation to existing student loans, or for those students whose circumstances mean that they are still eligible for old-style loans. Amendments Nos. 382 and 401 provide that those savings apply in respect of institutions that receive funding from the LSC or the National Council for Education and Training for Wales under clauses 5 or 34 of the Bill.
<P>
In practice, that will be needed only up to the end of the academic year 2002–03, when arrangements for students on particularly long courses—for example, those who choose to do a higher national diploma leading on to a degree course, to whom the old-style loans still apply—will come to an end.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Ninth schedule to the Bill
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> There is no essential problem with the transitional provisions, which are clearly necessary, and I did not seek to intervene on the Minister on clause 119.
<P>
However, I want to raise two points about litigation in relation to schedule 9(3)(2). To set the scene, the appointed day has not yet arrived; the Further Education Training Council is in position, and will be so until April next year—or, more accurately, until the Minister introduces an order to extinguish it. Therefore, we cannot set the scene, and I will not ask the Minister to say what litigation or liabilities will accrue to the FEFC and may transfer to its successor.
<P>
The first point that concerns me is that if someone were to litigate against the FEFC, but did not introduce a writ before the appointed day, even if the alleged tort had taken place before that, we might not hear anything about it for a number of years. If someone decided in 2003 that they wanted to sue the FEFC—I am not speculating on the rightness or otherwise of the case—could they do so, and would the Learning and Skills Council take on responsibility for fighting the case, even if the writ had been moved after the appointed day?
<P>
My second, more immediate concern is implicit in new clause 25. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) is concerned about the liability of college governors. My concern is that FEFC members and staff might be liable after the appointed day. They might be sued as individuals for their conduct. We have only recently met the needs of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) in relation to the discharge of duties by making protective arrangements. It is important that the Minister tidy up the matter, without prejudging the merits of such a case, so that the transition will be as smooth as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The transition from the FEFCs to the new councils will be a complex process. The schedule ensures that the current funding councils should do their best to discharge the relevant functions, until the day on which they are dissolved and the new councils take on their full functions. It also enables the Learning and Skills Council and its Welsh equivalent to take responsibility for a number of the FEFCs' remaining functions after their dissolution, such as the completion of accounts, any current legal proceedings and their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to report on their provision for disabled people in completion of accounts, any current legal proceedings and their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to report on their provision for disabled people in the previous year. The schedule also allows the establishment of the councils as statutory bodies, once the first two members—in practice, the chairman and the chief executive—have been appointed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised some important questions about whether it would be possible to sue the FEFC after the event. The answer is that liability would be transferred, as is appropriate.

Question put and agreed to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 367, in page 92, line 28, column 3, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`In section 22(2)(h) and (7) the words ``attendance on''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government new clause 26—Financial support for students.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I think that we can deal with this matter quickly, although it relates to an important issue.
<P>
The main purpose of new clause 26 is to enable the Secretary of State to provide financial support to students on open learning courses that do not have attendance requirements. It simply amends provisions in the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998, which are couched in terms of ``attendance'' or ``attending'' and which therefore exclude, for example, Open university students.
<P>
In 2000–01 that support will be provided in the form of a loan to part-time students on low incomes and disabled students allowances to part-time students with disabilities. That is part of the Government's commitment to encourage greater participation in higher education and will provide a helping hand to part-time students who, until the Government came to power, received little support from public finds for their pursuit of higher education.
<P>
I have said before that we want to see as many people as possible participating in learning. Part-time higher and further education courses are an invaluable source of learning opportunities for people with work, family or other commitments who might not otherwise take up higher education.
<P>
A significant number of part-time higher education students—about one third—undertake their courses through open learning. That reflects the increased flexibility and delivery of higher education courses as universities respond to the needs of prospective students. The Open university in particular has long demonstrated that flexible delivery of learning is successful in encouraging people who otherwise might not do so to take up higher education. Open learning courses play an important role in the continuing growth in participation in higher education. It is vital, therefore, that the Government have the power to provide financial support to students on those courses, as we do to students who take courses through more traditional routes.
<P>
These important amendments to the Bill are necessary to ensure that we can meet our requirements to widen participation in learning in a way that reflects the increasingly diverse delivery of courses for non-traditional students.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am pleased that the Minister has tabled the amendments. We do not want at this stage to have a silly competition to see who feels more enthusiastic about the Open university or open learning. I think that we all share the enthusiasms and sensitivity that the Minister has already expressed. I know from my own contacts with the Open university that it was worried that it might be left out because of the formal definition rather than the intention of Ministers. The Minister has now covered that point and I readily give the amendments and the concept a fair wind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): I add my support and want to declare an interest in the clause. Before coming into the House I spent, as some colleagues know, nearly 20 years as a tutor with the Open university. It is right that the Government should proceed down this route. The anomaly whereby not just Open university students but part-time students have not had the same access to loans and assistance as other students has long been noted as unfair. One of the few lacunae in the Dearing report was that sufficient attention was not paid to this issue. Indeed, one of the first letters that I wrote on coming into the House was to Baroness Blackstone, urging changes in that direction. Therefore, I am absolutely delighted by this move, as I know the Open university and other institutions with a large number of part-time students are, and I am pleased to support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I rise to ask the Minister a straightforward question. When we were debating the Teaching and Higher Education Bill, the Government inserted in it a provision for part-time students to receive access to loans for level 4 courses. Does what the Minister has said mean that part-time students doing level 4 degree courses will now have the same access to loans as students on full-time courses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We have had a useful debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) has much expertise with the Open university—I believe that he said that he had been associated with it for 20 years. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough asked what the amount would be—in the situation that he described, it will be £500 per annum, which I hope will encourage those students.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In order to clarify the situation, the Minister's earlier comments and his letter to me suggest that that amount will be means-tested or means-related—it will not be unconditional, although the mainstream student loan will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Full-time students will get £1,050 for tuition fees; other rates will vary. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is yes, that amount will be means tested. If we can give further details, we shall write to him and send a copy of the letter to other Committee members.

Clauses 84 to 87 and the provisions in schedule 9 are intended to provide the necessary legal framework for a smooth transition to the new arrangements. We previously debated at some length the complex series of property transfers that might arise after the dissolution of the FEFC and the return of assets from TECs and the Training Standards Council to the Secretary of State, and his transfer of assets to the LSC, Ofsted and the adult learning inspectorate. New clause 18 is a further component in that regard—it will ensure that the transfer is smooth and effective.
<P>
The new clause will ensure that stamp duty does not need to be paid on any transfer that arises in relation to clauses 84 to 87. Committee members will recognise that that is a standard provision in legislation that provides for the transfer of assets involving, or between, public bodies. Comparable provisions were made, for example, in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 for property to be transferred to further education corporations or those that arise from the dissolution of the Universities Funding Council and the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council. I could give many more examples.
<P>
This is a standard provision and a standard new clause, which I commend to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> After our exchanges earlier today, I hesitate to refer to city academies. However, if the Government's policy is agreed to and land transactions are introduced in the areas that the Minister described, will he consider in due course whether a similar facility could be made available for city academies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall of course consider the proposal, and I believe that we can safely say yes to it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>New clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Contracts of employment</center></H4>

(b) a scheme under section 85 or 87.
<P>
(2) Anything done by or in relation to the transferor in respect of the employee before the day on which the transfer takes effect is to be treated on and after that day as done by or in relation to the transferee.

(4) For the purposes of that Act the employee's period of employment with the transferor is to count as a period of employment with the transferee, and the change of employment is not to break the continuity of the period of employment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Before I introduce the new clause, I shall make a brief comment about those people who served the Opposition parties, in particular, during the preparation of materials for the Bill. The Association of Colleges has been a tremendous source of inspiration to the Government and to us. We recognise its contribution, and in particular the work of John Brennan, who does an immense amount of financial work behind the scenes for the Association of Colleges and provides us with excellent briefing notes. It is as a result of his work that I am moving this new clause, which is probably why it is so well prepared and well written. I am sure that the Government, in their wisdom, will accept it. In fact, I was surprised that we did not move it formally and nod it through, as we were doing so well.
<P>
The new clause is important, especially for lay governors. It concerns the personal liability of college governors, an issue that has been fought over for many years by members of all political parties. It is not a party political issue. Indeed, the issue was raised with the previous Government, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Daventry was aware of some of the concerns put forward at the time. It has certainly been raised with the present Minister and the Government.
<P>
The issue was raised in the House of Lords by Baroness Sharp and Lord Tope. I shall return to that in a moment. I should add that, in moving the new clause, I am not in any way trying to shield governors who transgress or break the law. We accept that they exist. However, things sometimes go wrong, and we have seen examples of colleges in which there have been real problems in terms of financial irregularities which could have brought governors to the point of criminal proceedings. The new clause would protect them against that. All that the clause requires is that governors should face no greater personal risk than company directors or charitable trustees face in similar circumstances.
<P>
When a similar provision was introduced in another place, Lord Bach said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have much sympathy with the amendment. We do not resist it. We ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment so that we can consider what he and the noble Baroness have said. I do not think that he can expect very much more than that.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 17 February 2000; Vol. 609, c. 1412.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We understood that, if the amendment was withdrawn, the Government would table an amendment of their own to introduce such a provision when the Bill reached the House of Commons. No such provision has been proposed. We are certain that that is an error by the Government rather than company directors. That is the only difference between that section and the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> Under the Companies Act directors have an obligation to take advice on whether they are transgressing. If the hon. Gentleman is seeking pari passu, it should be incumbent on governors also to take legal advice. It used to be done by the town clerk, who sat on all governing bodies at school and college level. Now we are in a different position. I would like further information, but it would be wrong to say that we are balancing the position of directors and governors, if there is not an equal obligation on governors to take proper and legal advice before they take further action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I am not pleading for that: governors must act in a reasonable way. That is what is expected of them. Indeed, the previous legislation made it clear that governors must act responsibly, and their responsibilities are clearly laid down in the act of incorporation of 1993.
<P>
I am not saying that governors should be treated with largesse and be allowed to go away and do whatever they want. Of course they must seek proper advice before they take action, and I think that, on the whole, they do so, as governors do in schools. We expect governors to take proper advice before they take decisions, particularly when they sign contracts for hiring equipment or whatever it may be, which might make the school liable to significant penalties in the future.
<P>
If the new clause is unacceptable to the Government, we hope that they will table amendments on Report that give governors statutory support in carrying out their responsibilities. That is not too much to ask, given that the Learning and Skills Council will operate a £6 billion budget, of which well over half will be spent in the college system. That is a huge budget. I therefore ask the Minister, in the light of the recommendations of the Neill committee—on which the amendment is based—and the advice that I have received, to respond in his usual supportive way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> At this hour, I rise only to endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough—specifically in respect of the assistance that we have received from the Association of Colleges and its staff members, including Dr. Brennan. There is widespread sympathy for the hon. Gentleman's approach to governors' liability. People who ask to do a job for no remuneration should be treated fairly, not put in a situation in which they act in good faith and then find themselves caught in a legal tangle. I hope that the Minister will respond sympathetically.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important issue. I am happy to associate the Government with the remarks that he and the hon. Member for Daventry made. We gave a clear commitment in another place that we would make proposals to address the issue. I appreciate that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough is, rightly, chasing us on that to ensure that we are as good as our word.
<P>
However, as the debate has illustrated, this is a complex and difficult matter. I assure the Committee that we have examined the issues extremely carefully and thoroughly, and explored a number of different approaches to resolving them. As the hon. Gentleman is aware, the Committee on Standards in Public Life made several recommendations based on the legal study that it commissioned, which was published in 1998. We have consulted a range of experts who have an interest, such as lawyers and insurance brokers for FE colleges, in addition to the Association of Colleges. The clear consensus of their views was that the Government should adopt a legislative approach, as recommended by the Neill committee.
<P>
Following consultation, we have considered advice on the best way forward in respect of personal liability. I can confirm that we intend to introduce statutory provision as part of the Bill, but we need to get it right. I am happy to give an undertaking that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough will see a Government amendment on Report, and hope that he therefore feels able to withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am delighted by the Minister's response, which shows what a splendid chap he is. We look forward to supporting the amendment on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<H4><center>Direct provision of education and training</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.­In discharging their duties under this Act, the Learning and Skills Council (in matters relating to England) and the National Council for Education and Training for Wales (in matters relating to Wales) shall not themselves make direct provision for education and training unless—
<P>
(a) it seems to them that no other provider is available; and;
<P>
(b) it is with the express consent of the Secretary of State (or, as appropriate, the National Assembly for Wales).'.<P>

<P>
<B>Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Boswell.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I am sorry for pausing; at this late hour, I confused the procedure a little, it was T. S. Eliot who said,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in my end is my beginning.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This final group of amendments brings the Committee back to debates that we had some considerable time ago—as it now seems—on the general duties of the council and clauses 2 and 3. I do so because, on reflection, it occurred to me that we had not debated the following issue.
<P>
I hope that I shall not inflame Government Back Benchers by saying that the Bill follows the broad philosophy of the previous Government by retaining a degree of what might loosely be called a purchaser–provider split between the funding body, the Learning and Skills Council, and the individual undertakings, the further education corporations, training providers and others, which will be financed under the Bill and will deliver the general duties set out in clauses 2 and 3. Ministers do not—I think—intend that there will be much direct provision by the Learning and Skills Council. On the other hand, I would not be deeply shocked, or even surprised, if Ministers were to say that, if there is a duty on the council and nobody comes forward to meet that duty, the council would have to consider its position and might want to do the job itself.
<P>
I recall one or two cases of further education colleges feeling uneasy about direct provision by TECs of services that they felt that they could have carried out themselves. I would not wish to signal that that was good general practice. Our new clause does not prevent direct provision, but requires the test that it should be necessary because no other provider is available, and that it should be approved by the Secretary of State or, in Wales, by the National Assembly. It therefore imposes further safeguards against over-ready recourse to direct provision.
<P>
Although I would be happy if the Minister did not give a long reply and chose to deal with the matter in writing, we are anxious to read Ministers' minds.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall detain the Committee a little while, to put some points on record.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that at this late hour he was confused by the procedure. I am disappointed by that, because I have found myself confused by the procedure at every hour; he is clearly a better man than me.
<P>
This is the last issue that we shall debate in Committee, but it would be wrong not to give it careful consideration. As ever, the hon. Gentleman has raised an important issue, and I am grateful for the opportunity to set out the Government's position, albeit briefly.
<P>
As we have made clear in the White Paper and the prospectus, the LSC will be responsible for strategic development, planning, funding, management and the quality assurance of post-16 education and training. We do not intend the LSC to act as a provider of education and training provision. There must be a purchaser-provider split if there is to be effective planning and quality control in the new arrangements.
<P>
Where there is a gap in the market for the supply of education and training in a certain field, it will be the LSC's job to ensure that provision is made available to fill the gap by using its planning and funding powers effectively. That is an example of the circumstances in which we envisage that local LSCs will have the ability to vary national prices.
<P>
The LSC must avoid the temptation to become the provider of last resort. Some TECs have become providers, which has sometimes caused problems where other local providers have felt that they have been placed at a competitive disadvantage. However, as part of an orderly transition from the current arrangements, some local LSCs may need temporarily to take responsibility—for example, for a direct training operation managed by a TEC—before the activity can be taken on by an independent operator. I want that to be avoided as much as possible. I envisage it happening only in the difficult phase of the transfer of liabilities between the current system and the new. However, I would not rule out the prospect if it helped to secure a smooth transition.
<P>
I agree with the spirit of the new clause, but I am worried that, if we agreed legislative provision along those lines, we might put unnecessary obstacles in the way of the handling of the transitional phase. However, I am happy to make a commitment to the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that we will reflect on such issues, with which we agree, in the LSC's management statement, thus ensuring a clear control mechanism that will prevent the LSC from drifting into becoming its own provider.
<P>
I hope that, with that commitment and the assurances that I have given, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the motion, I thank him for the opportunity to put the Government's position on the record.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I support the proposal to report the Bill. I will not detain Committee members for too long, but may I take this opportunity to say a few words of thanks?
<P>
I thank you, Mr. Benton, for the extremely able way in which you have managed this Committee on a number of occasions. In doing so, I also sincerely thank your co-Chairmen: Mr. Hancock, Mr. Butterfill and Mr. Maxton. I should like to thank others, not least our Clerk, who has helped us with our proceedings. I thank the staff of Hansard for their diligence and accuracy, and the House of Commons officials and attendants. I thank the police officers, who have made us feel secure. They have not needed to engage in much crowd control, although for one moment this morning, I did wonder. I thank warmly, but briefly so that they do not blush, our team of officials at the Department, who have undertaken their task with great diligence and, on occasion, necessary good humour.
<P>
Before I get carried away and start thanking the returning officer—I have a note of the date in my pocket; I shall not reveal it to Committee members, but it could be next year—I must not forget to thank members on both sides of the Committee, who are the other key personnel. The Bill has been scrutinised effectively by an efficient and loyal official Opposition, equally loyal Liberal Democrats, and, I am pleased to say—and as has been noted—loyal Government Members. The best Standing Committees are those in which, like ours, Government Members can participate effectively. In particular, I thank our Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), although I shall not put that to the vote among Government Members, and my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead), who has helped me and my ministerial colleagues get matters right. I also thank anyone whom I may have forgotten—I hope that I have not—who helped the Committee to run smoothly.
<P>
Whatever our disagreements, we have been concerned with the serious purpose of improving the learning and skills of our people. From time to time, we may have disagreed on issues of structure, but we were all of a common purpose. The Government believe that the establishment of a Learning and Skills Council and 47 local councils constitutes a major step forward.
<P>
I should like to use this occasion to announce that Bryan Sanderson has been appointed as national chair designate of the Learning and Skills Council for England. He is currently group managing director of BP Amoco, and chief executive of BP Amoco Chemicals. He is an outstanding and successful business leader, with high credibility in the business community. We have no doubt that he will make a major contribution to the success of the Learning and Skills Council.
<P>
Today, I read in a national newspaper—one that used to be published in Manchester, and which was unfairly described as a paper written by Trotskyites for the benefit of liberals—that Ministers have had an easy time in Committee. I am not sure that that is true, and my ministerial colleague, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, is writing to The Guardian to set the record straight. I have never felt that we have had an easy time, especially when we have been discussing the nitty-gritty, the important minutiae of the Bill. I remember showing my own fallibility, when I was reassuring the hon. Member for Daventry that the answer to his question—pertinent, as ever—was, almost certainly, yes. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see a subtle, almost invisible but rather vigorous shaking of heads, indicating that I was giving the wrong answer. I hope that I have put my mistake on record.
<P>
We have all benefited in terms of our lifelong learning. We have brushed up on our Latin, thanks to the erudition shown, mainly, on the Opposition Benches. Some of us have learned more about cricket than we may have wanted to. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) had to leave early, so, unfortunately, we were unable to hear more about F. R. Brown, Alec Bedser and J. J. Warr, who have become folk heroes for many of us.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman compared the three Tory Members present at that stage—it was a pretty thin, if impressive, turnout on the Opposition Benches—to the three famous cricketers. We were told a number of things, including the fact that J. J. Warr, to whom the right hon. Gentleman likened himself, took only one test wicket for 281 in his career. The right hon. Gentleman said that they could not, therefore, be regarded as formidable opponents. Nevertheless, they have been formidable opponents. It is also interesting that the three Tory Members then present had, because of a remarkable statistical coincidence, of an order similar to winning the National Lottery, remarkably all gone to the same university. I cannot recall the name of the university, but I do recall that there are two universities in the city concerned and I would not like to get them confused. The odds against the three hon. Members going to the same university are extraordinary, and it is a great credit to the state schools—or whatever—to which they went. In another remarkable coincidence, two of the three hon. Gentlemen went to the same school—I have not checked up on its status—in the same, rather fine town. We should thank all of those who taught them for the erudition that they have brought to the Committee.
<P>
It has been a pleasure, at times, to be here, and the Committee has been very helpful. I thank you, Mr. Benton, and all our colleagues for the way in which business has been dispatched—usually, as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I, too, would like to record how much we have appreciated the Committee, beginning with your services, Mr. Benton, and those of the other three Chairmen who have presided over our affairs. I thank the Hansard reporters, the police and the Ministers, who have, with occasional exceptions, sought to be helpful to hon. Members. I am also conscious of the huge input of officials, who had to meet our often detailed and pernickety requirements. It has been a major and, in Whitehall terms, rather courageous project to bring the various funding streams and organisations together.
<P>
Like the Minister, I have enjoyed the witness and concern of Government Back Benchers, and I feel that the Committee has benefited from that. They were sometimes critical of their own Government, but sometimes they made straightforward educational points of considerable value that struck a chord on this side of the Committee. In the same way, the two contributors from the Liberal Democrat Benches have given as good as they have got. They have sided with us perhaps slightly more than they have done in the Chamber, and we are grateful for that.
<P>
In a sense there has been, as there is in the best kind of Standing Committee, a degree of consensuality and a common purpose in moving the agenda forward. We still have concerns and I am sure that the Government—Ministers being the modest people they are—would be prepared to concede, with hindsight, that they might not have got it perfect, just as I would not say that the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 was perfect. We have embellished and improved the measure where defects have merged. It has clearly been important to go through these processes, just as it will be important to review the way in which measure works and ensure as far as possible that it works as well as they can.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have not mentioned, as the Committee will have noticed, the support that I have received from Conservative Members, for which I am most directly grateful. Contributions have been made today by my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings, the quality of which leads the Committee to regret that he could not open his innings earlier. There have also been a number of contributions from my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), which have been characterised by his mixture of acuity and charm. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster has already been referred to by the Minister. He shows a remarkable ability to master anecdote and historic incidence and, at the same time, draw on his huge and authoritative experience of Government and of serving as an education Minister to illuminate our affairs with great charm. It took us some way further forward.
<P>
I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), who has borne the heat and burden of the day and even participated directly in one or two fighting patrols and skirmishes that have taken place recently in the Committee. No Committee would be complete without such events, but my hon. Friend has done so with his characteristic blend of measured charm and perceptiveness, and a lawyer's mind.
<P>
For all of us on the Opposition Benches, the Committee has been a thoroughly agreeable experience. We have, I hope, contributed to the Bill; we have contributed to the understanding of it, and we might, on occasion, have given Ministers cause to think. I often think that a Committee is rather like an iceberg, with most of it below the surface. Ministerial dealings with officials, for example, are part of the process that we do not always see and do not even put on the record, just as our own deliberations are not always seen or understood outside this Room. It is all part of a process, which I still believe is important, of ensuring that legislation is made better and ministerial wishes are converted into something that is more or less workmanlike.
<P>
In conclusion, I thank all those persons and any persons unknown or otherwise unacknowledged in the Committee. In a world where all political wickets from the first ball are seen to take spin, we have done our best to keep our eye on the ball, and might even modestly be able to claim that we have scored a few runs of our own.

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I rise even more briefly to thank you, Mr. Benton, and Mr. Hancock and the other two co-Chairs, for your work in the Committee. On the Terrace at lunchtime today, I met a group of people from one of my schools, who had received prizes elsewhere in the City for an educational matter. When I told them that I had spent two and a half hours this morning in the Committee and was likely to do the same this afternoon, they asked whether that was for the whole Bill. I said ``No, that's just to deal with a few minor amendments at the end of it.''
<P>
Working on a Bill is always an interesting job, and I have enjoyed it enormously. Again, I thank very much indeed the Committee Clerks, the Hansard reporters, the Officers, the police and the Ministers' officials for their support. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) for dealing with large parts of the Bill when I was away on other duties.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster has not been here today—I wonder whether that is because he is feeling terribly down after yesterday's cricket result against Zimbabwe. I thank the hon. Members for Daventry and for Hertsmere for the diligent way in which they have gone through the Bill. Liberal Democrat Members are grateful to them for highlighting many important issues. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East showed that old Labour lives on: it is good to know that that cause is still fought for.
<P>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), who is not present—[Interruption.] It is nice to see the hon. Gentleman. He has been running between Committees admirably, and has lost at least two and a half stone. This morning, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for North Swindon, stood up to a pasting superbly, in typical public schoolboy fashion. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Croydon, North has been, as always, the perfect gentleman.
<P>
There is a battle raging outside the Houses of Parliament today. The Prime Minister is fighting the forces of conservatism, while the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) is fighting the liberal elite. While various members of the Committee were speaking today, I wondered on which side they would appear, and concluded that it would have been difficult to place many of us on either side. I hope that that farcical argument between mythical forces of conservatism and a mythical liberal elite will soon be in the past. The Bill, which will have a profound effect on generations of young and older people, should be typical of the real substance of what goes on in the Houses of Parliament. We should be remembered for this, not for an ephemeral argument about what did or did not happen in the past.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I take the opportunity to say a heartfelt thank you, on behalf of my co-Chairman and myself, to Ministers, Front-Bench spokesmen and other members of the Committee for the courtesy that they have extended to the Chair at all times? I have genuinely enjoyed the proceedings—indeed, I have enjoyed them so much that I have sometimes wished that I was on the Floor describing my experience of 20-odd years in a college of further education.
<P>
The debate has been full of erudition and there have been excellent contributions all round. I have found it most pleasurable, and wish the Bill every success. I shall ensure that the kind comments that have been made will be passed on to my co-Chairman. Finally, I thank the learned Clerk and all the other staff who have helped to make our proceedings run so smoothly.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
