167</h4><a name="08102859000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Overview</div><a name="08102859000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

am</div><a name="08102859000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000369"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for this part of the Bill,
Mr. Hood. Clause 167 provides an overview of part 5, which
enables the Bank of England to oversee certain systems for payments
between financial institutions. It might be convenient for the
Committee if I outlined what the clause
does.</div><a name="08102859000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Payment
systems are networks for the electronic transfer of money or credit
between participating members, linking key financial firms to each
other. A typical payment system comprises a scheme company or an
incorporated association, members that are mainly, but not exclusively,
financial institutions, rules established by the scheme operator
covering such matters as settling claims&#151;payment instructions,
for example&#151;between members, a system in which members input
instructions to transfer payments and, in some cases, a separate,
related or unrelated, company providing infrastructure, such as
supporting IT
systems.</div><a name="08102859000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
vast majority of economic transactions involve some form of electronic
payment; for example, payment systems include those for the payment of
financial contracts, such as derivatives; automated payments, such as
direct debits; the system for clearing cheques; and systems used by the
Government for benefit payments. In some cases, payment systems are
embedded in clearing and settlement systems for transferring securities
and other financial products. Payment systems are, therefore, vital to
the functioning of financial services, markets and the wider
economy.</div><a name="08102859000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
interlinkages between payment systems, banks and other financial
intermediaries mean that any problems with payment systems have the
potential to spread quickly through the financial system, ultimately
affecting business and consumers. For example, problems in large
wholesale systems have the potential to lead to liquidity difficulties
for banks and to contagion in the markets. Problems in retail systems
may result in much inconvenience and hardship for considerable numbers
of people&#151;for example, if benefit or salary payments cannot be
credited to people&#146;s accounts. As such, robust and effective
systems for payments are essential to the proper functioning of the
financial markets and the economy.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div><a name="08102859000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently, the
Bank of England undertakes oversight of payment systems on a
non-statutory basis, focusing on promoting the robustness and
resilience of key UK payment systems. The Financial Services Authority
has a statutory responsibility under the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 for the regulation of recognised clearing houses that contain
embedded payment systems. The Bank of England&#146;s responsibilities
and its operational role as a central bank naturally mean that it is
involved in the design, management and operation of high-value
inter-bank payment systems, which helps to ensure that those systems
are operated in a prudent and effective manner. However, the lack of
formal powers, including mechanisms for enforcement, limits the Bank of
England&#146;s ability to ensure that payment systems are robust and
resilient. For example, the Bank of England&#146;s ability to
regulate the operation of systems is largely dependent on what can be
achieved through dialogue with the management of payment systems and
its assessment of systems&#146; compliance with international
standards, published in the Bank of England&#146;s annual payment
systems oversight
report.</div><a name="08102859000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are therefore legislating to formalise the Bank of
England&#146;s role in the oversight of payment systems, to ensure
that the Bank has the tools necessary to ensure that payment systems
are operated in a manner that minimises risks to financial stability
and disruptions to business and consumer interests. The provisions will
provide, in addition to an important tool for the maintenance of
financial stability, an important new statutory lever for the Bank of
England to use in fulfilling its new statutory objective for financial
stability, as provided for in part 7 of the
Bill.</div><a name="08102859000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102859000370"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): The Minister did not
explain whether there has at any time been a problem with the systems.
Has current regulation ever failed? Has there ever been a problem with
the
system?</div><a name="08102859000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000371"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We consulted on whether there should be a
statutory power for the Bank of England in those areas. The overall
response from the consultation exercise was that it was a good idea,
which is why we are proceeding with it in the
Bill.</div><a name="08102859000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clauses we are to debate follow a logical structure. I hope that hon.
Members appreciate the recognition systems and the principles of
regulation, and how they will be enforced, if necessary. Clause 167
provides an overview of what we are trying to achieve with bank payment
systems by giving the Bank of England a statutory role. I commend the
clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="08102859000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102859000372"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): It is a
great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood.
As this is my first contribution in the main part of the Committee
stage, I declare an interest as a non-executive director of a
deposit-taking institution&#151;although for clarity&#146;s sake I
point out that it is not a payment system or a member of a payment
system.</div>
<a name="08102859000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the Minister for setting out a brief introductory overview of the
part of the Bill relating to inter-bank payment systems. He is right to
highlight their importance. Figures produced by the Bank of England for
2003&#151;there may be more up-to-date figures&#151;state that the
value passing through UK payment systems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>that year was &#163;130 trillion, which is about 20 times the UK
annual gross domestic product. That is the equivalent of almost 50 per
cent. of GDP flowing through UK payment systems every business day. It
is clearly an important system, consisting of high-value transfers
between financial institutions but also more numerous, smaller
transfers between individuals and/or companies. The Minister set out
some of the circumstances, such as the payment and receipt of wages and
salaries, Government benefits, direct debits and cheques and debit and
credit card payments.</div>
<a name="08102859000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
the potential for systemic risk. The Bank of England and the
Government, too, have long recognised the potential for systemic risk
from failure within the payment systems. If there is a problem with one
there is likely to be a direct and rapid effect on other members. Even
if there is no systemic risk, a failure in a payment system may cause
considerable disruption to individuals. No politician would want to be
responsible for the failure to pay wages and salaries on
time.</div>
<a name="08102859000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are broadly supportive of the provisions but it might be helpful for
the Committee if I outlined some of the themes that we want to address
during this part of the Bill. As the Minister says, the Bill is
presented clearly and logically, which will be helpful to the
Committee. We will raise specific questions as we go through each
clause, but at this stage it might be helpful to highlight some of the
key issues.</div>
<a name="08102859000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
issue touches on the intervention made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Wellingborough. What assessment have the Government made of the
existing arrangements? As the Minister explained, the Bank of England
has performed an oversight role on a non-statutory basis for some time.
As the helpful Library note made
clear:</div><a name="08102859000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
should be stressed that, to date, there has been no evidence that
existing systems have failed or are threats to future
stability.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, that is not to say that we should not look to make
improvements. I note the points about enforcement and so on. This may
be one of those cases where the roof is being fixed while the sun is
shining, to coin a phrase.</div>
<a name="08102859000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102859000373"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): A tired
one.</div><a name="08102859000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000374"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Well, the sun is shining over this particular roof,
even if not over most of the roofs nearby.</div>
<a name="08102859000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful if we had a sense of how effective non-statutory regulation has
been&#151;for example, in the dialogue between some payment systems
and the Bank of England. The Bank has given examples of situations in
which, through dialogue, it persuaded some payment systems to make
particular changes. The settlement finality regulations are part of the
existing regulatory regime, even though it is on a non-statutory basis,
and we will discuss them with regard to our proposed amendments to
clause 171. The regulations provide payment systems with some
protection from insolvency law, which could disrupt them, but we will
discuss those issues later this morning.</div>
<a name="08102859000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
broad theme is the objective of the oversight. The Bank of
England&#146;s payment systems oversight report for 2004
states:</div><a name="08102859000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
main objective of the Bank&#146;s payment systems oversight is to
assess and, if necessary, seek to ensure mitigation of risks to the
wider economy&#151;&#145;systemic risk&#146;.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div><a name="08102859000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that the
Minister will say that one difference is that the Bank states that it
will &#147;seek to ensure mitigation&#148;&#151;although of
course it could take a stronger line as a consequence of the
provisions. However, is the focus on addressing systemic risk? What is
the purpose of the regulations?</div>
<a name="08102859000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bank of
England&#146;s 2004 report further states
that</div><a name="08102859000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;efficiency
considerations also need to be
weighed&#148;,</div><a name="08102859000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
leads me to a further theme&#151;there can be conflict between safety
and efficiency. The Bank put it very
well:</div><a name="08102859000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bank also recognises that designing and operating a payment system to
minimise systemic risk would be counterproductive if the system thereby
became so expensive or impractical to use that payment traffic migrated
to less safe
alternatives.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will be aware of that danger. We will be seeking reassurance
in the debate that the operation of the measures will not result in a
less safe system because banks go elsewhere.</div>
<a name="08102859000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is notable
that the Bank of England has previously expressed, perhaps rather
modestly, the limits of its oversight, noting
that</div><a name="08102859000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Bank as overseer, cannot guarantee that there will never be operational
failures of payment
systems&#148;.</div><a name="08102859000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the Minister accept that the point applies equally to the new
arrangements&#151;it is not about a guarantee, but about doing
everything that we can to eliminate risk&#151;or would he go further
and say that payment systems will now be 100 per cent. safe?</div>
<a name="08102859000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
balance between safety and efficiency, concerns have been raised that
some of the enforcement provisions, which we will come to later this
morning, may be so draconian as to dissuade businesses or individuals
from being involved in payment systems. Are the costs for payment
systems likely to increase substantially? I want to stress that by
raising these questions we are not arguing against the provisions, but
we think that these are legitimate questions to put to the
Government.</div>
<a name="08102859000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next
theme is the scope of the recognition regime. It focuses on payment
systems, but I hope that this morning it will become clearer whether
the clause will apply to all payment systems or only to the largest.
Will there be a differential application of the principles and codes of
practice, depending on the nature of the system? Until now the Bank of
England has adopted different approaches depending on the type, number
and value of payments made, the design of the system, and the potential
substitute means of making payments. It is notable that it has
particularly focused on CHAPS and CREST, then at the next level BACS,
CLS and LCH.Clearnet Ltd, followed by the Cheque and Credit Clearing
Company and LINK and finally debit and credit card systems. Will there
still be that differential approach and that flexibility? We will
probably debate those matters when we look at the principles and code
of
practice.</div><a name="08102859000339"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="08102859000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
the provision does not do is focus on payment system members, so it is
worth highlighting the role played by some major banks, which settle
payments for a large number of other banks. Not all banks are members
of payment systems and relatively few of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>them are settlement banks. As the Bank of England has said, in some
respects the largest of the settlement member banks have the
characteristics of payment
systems.</div><a name="08102859000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
some other jurisdictions there is close supervision of payment members;
for example, system participants are obliged to provide information to
central banks. In the UK, the payment system is required to do that,
but in jurisdictions such as the US, Australia, Austria, Hong Kong and
Singapore the obligation to provide information applies to
participants. Central banks can also set membership conditions in
Australia, France, Hong Kong, Norway and Singapore. Will the Minister
say a little about
that?</div><a name="08102859000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
area of potential risk relates to the infrastructure providers. It is
interesting that the Bank of England has highlighted the dependence of
all the network participants on a single supplier as the second
potential source of risk&#151;the first being the systemic risk of a
problem in one payment system migrating to another. In particular,
SWIFT, which provides messaging services in support of CHAPS, is used
heavily in those circumstances. How will the provisions help us to
address that potential risk? I think the Minister will be able to
answer that
question.</div><a name="08102859000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
next theme&#151;familiar to our debates on the Bill&#151;is how the
tripartite arrangements will work in this area. Banks, principally
regulated by the FSA, are payment system members and play an important
role in those systems. The likes of CREST and
LCH.Clearnet&#151;recognised clearing houses and investment
exchanges&#151;are principally regulated by the FSA rather than the
Bank of England. How will the Bank work and co-operate with the FSA?
The Treasury will make the recognition orders&#151;we will come to
that issue&#151;but how will the relationship between those three
entities work? The question that we keep coming back to is, &#147;Who
is in charge?&#148; The greater the clarity about that, the
better.</div><a name="08102859000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
next related theme is the general role of the Bank of England. The Bank
has a role as an operator of real-time gross settlement
systems&#151;at the heart of the CHAPS system&#151;yet it is also
the regulatory body that will presumably supervise CHAPS. How do we
avoid a conflict of interest? We support the Bank of England&#146;s
performing that role. There are good historical reasons why it should,
and the role is central to financial stability. Perhaps in dealing with
those points, the Minister will explain why the Government continued to
allow the Bank of England to play such a major role in the oversight of
payment systems, at a time when, generally, everything was handed over
to the
FSA.</div><a name="08102859000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final theme touches on the international perspective. It is all very
well looking at payments within the UK, but we all know that there will
be a huge number of cross-border payments. In those circumstances, how
would the provisions that we are debating this morning play a role, and
how are the Government working with other central banks and financial
institutions to ensure that there is no systemic risk from a breakdown
in cross-border payment systems? We must not forget that
aspect.</div>
<a name="08102859000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope I have
been helpful to the Committee in outlining some broad concerns before
we turn to each of the provisions in detail. I do not necessarily
expect the Minister to respond to each and every one of those concerns
now, but I hope they provide a useful summary of some of the points
that we hope to raise over the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>course of the morning. I reiterate that we are supportive of the
provisions but, as always, it is appropriate that they have proper
scrutiny, and that those who are studying the debate have a better
understanding of the intention and practicality of some of the measures
that we are debating.</div>
<a name="08102859000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102859000375"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): Like my hon. Friend the
Member for South-West Hertfordshire, I shall put down a few markers on
some issues that have come to light&#151;not simply from listening to
the Minister, but from reading the explanatory notes and listening to
my hon. Friend.</div>
<a name="08102859000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 167
imposes a statutory regime on inter-bank bank systems when currently
the Bank of England, as I understand it, oversees payment systems on a
non-statutory basis. The Government&#146;s position seems to be
formalising the Bank of England&#146;s role in creating stability,
which has to be a good thing. We have seen the huge systemic risk out
there, following the current crisis. The build-up we have before us
addresses many of the issues which have been raised, and highlighted,
by the current crisis, but it has also sought to address issues that
have been raised over a long time. It is therefore a good thing, as is
the ability of the Bank of England and the Government to make a quick
response to problems in the banking systems.</div>
<a name="08102859000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will
enable the Bank of England to retain power of informal oversight when
it considers it appropriate. It is that sort of language that I am
trying better to understand: what is &#147;informal oversight&#148;
and what does &#147;appropriate&#148; mean? I appreciate that is
not the language used in the explanatory notes or the Bill, but it is
the language I have heard people use when addressing the
clause.</div>
<a name="08102859000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
party&#146;s position is clearly that formal regulation is a positive
thing, particularly when payment systems have a systemic risk. Recent
years have seen an explosion in the values and volume passing through
them, particularly in derivatives, which many people do not understand.
I draw the attention of Members to my register of interest; I have had
20 years&#146; significant experience in the banking system. One of
the problems is lack of understanding, particularly of derivatives,
which have caused some of the major problems relating to systemic risk
and, as we have seen, the fall-out from that.</div>
<a name="08102859000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
made a couple of points, using the words &#147;robust&#148; and
&#147;resilience&#148;, about the system that we are creating. Has
he thought about how to stress-test the system to see how robust and
resilient it is? He referred to oversight and tools, but I am curious
to know which tools he is talking about and what he meant by that term.
How will the tools cause &#147;minimum
disruptions&#148;&#151;another phrase he used? Which groups did the
Minister consult when coming up with the proposal and what feedback did
he receive? It is important that we understand which issues were raised
and how the clause will deal with
them.</div><a name="08102859000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire talked about the
tripartite relationship between the FSA, the Treasury and the Bank of
England. That tripartite system broke down over Northern Rock. It
seemed as though everyone was pointing the finger at everyone else,
with no one taking responsibility. How will the provision fix that
situation?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div><a name="08102859000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, my
hon. Friend referred to the important issue of cross-border
relationships. Given that the financial system is global, how do we
hope to enforce our legislation on foreign entities over which we do
not have as much control as we would like? We can try to fix things in
the UK, but how will that deal with systemic breakdowns in other
countries?</div><a name="08102859000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102859000376"></a><b class="B">Stewart

<a name="08102859000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
pick up on the relationship with the tripartite system to which the
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire referred. The clause describes
how part 5 of the Bill enables the Bank of England to oversee certain
systems. Later clauses cover interpretation and regulation, but I shall
touch on them now because it is important to understand where confusion
might
arise.</div><a name="08102859000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
170 allows the Treasury to impose recognition orders. Clause 172
requires it to consult the Bank of England and the FSA and the orders
can, of course, be revoked. Clause 174 covers the regulation
principles. The Bank of England publishes them, but it is required to
consult the Treasury. Clause 175 allows the Bank of England to deal
with the code of practice, which many people might consider more
important than the principles because it is the mechanics of the
process&#151;the nuts and bolts&#151;but nothing in the Bill says
that the Bank needs to consult the Treasury at that point. Under clause
176, the Bank of England&#151;not the Treasury&#151;may require an
operator to establish rules and, under clause 177, the Bank of England
can give direction. Clause 178 says that the Bank of England must have
regard to the action taken by the
FSA.</div><a name="08102859000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
interpretation and the regulations of the Bill set out a mix or a
balance between the action that the Treasury takes and that taken by
the Bank of England, sometimes in consultation with the Treasury and/or
the FSA, and sometimes not. I am trying to get to the bottom of the
Government&#146;s thinking behind why various bits of responsibility
have been allocated to the Treasury or the Bank and why consultation is
required on certain elements, but not others. I accept that those
points touch on subsequent clauses, but I should be grateful if the
Minister would explain why the breakdown in responsibility and the
particular roles have been allocated in such a
way.</div>

Bone:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Hood.</div>
<a name="08102859000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I start with
a slightly different view of clause 167 even from that of Members of my
Front
Bench.</div><a name="08102859000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000378"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000380"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am unhappy to see regulations brought in, unless
it can be proved that they should be brought in. The Government
probably take the other view: regulations should be brought in, unless
there is an overwhelming case that they should not be introduced. That
is a difference between us from the start. I refer to &#147;Yes
Minister&#148;, because it is the best example of how the Government
work. If there was a failing in the banking system, the Governor of the
Bank of England would ask his chairman and chief executive out to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>lunch and the problem would be sorted out. From the Minister&#146;s
introduction to the clause, it seems that the system has been working
rather well and that there has never been any sign of a problem in the
oversight of the payment system. It worries me that we may be
regulating because of the present circumstances&#151;because we think
that we should be doing something&#151;but actually it will make no
difference whatever to the process or the security of the system. I
hope that the Government will persuade me otherwise as we go through
the clauses in detail, but that is my concern in
principle.</div><a name="08102859000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern has some backing to it. Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury produced
a helpful impact assessment in October 2008, which
states:</div><a name="08102859000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Authorities do not envisage that this provision will amount to a
substantial change in
practice.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is no change in practice, why are we bothering to introduce
regulations to make something happen? If it is already happening, there
seems little point in bringing it in. It concerns me that the
regulations do not have effect across the board, but are restricted to
systematic or system-wide consequences. How is it determined in advance
whether a bank or clearing house falls within those concerns? At this
stage, I am not sure that I am totally in favour of the
clause.</div><a name="08102859000340"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="08102859000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000381"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I hope that I can persuade hon. Gentlemen of the
importance of the clause. The debate has usefully set out the general
principles that will be discussed under later
clauses.</div><a name="08102859000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will explain the background to this proposal. Since early last year,
the authorities have been developing a clearer and more robust
framework for the oversight of payment systems. That was part of the
Government&#146;s wider work to strengthen the framework for
financial stability. I emphasise that these measures are not the result
of problems in the payment system. However, we must take it into
account that the characteristics and importance of payment systems
could change, or that wholly new payment systems could develop and take
on systemic importance. Given the importance of payment systems to the
financial system, and therefore to wider financial stability and
consumer protection, it is sensible to pass these measures as part of a
package of proposals in the
Bill.</div><a name="08102859000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire to his debut in
the Committee. He asked about the scope of the measure and which
systems would be covered. The consultation document identified CHAPS,
Europea, LCH.Clearnet, BACS, Cheque and Credit Clearing, the faster
payments service and the LINK scheme as areas that would be regarded as
key wholesale inter-bank systems under the authority&#146;s
preliminary assessment. It is important to recognise that such systems
process about &#163;1.5 billion daily. That emphasises their systemic
importance to our financial system and the UK
economy.</div><a name="08102859000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will make a few points on the remarks of the hon. Member for Dundee,
East and others who talked about the architecture of the system. He was
not making a debating point, but was genuinely interested in knowing
how the architecture fits together. I will explain the general
principles and we will cover the detail when discussing subsequent
clauses, as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
said.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div><a name="08102859000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The general
principle is that in the first instance it is the responsibility of the
Treasury, following consultation with the Bank of England and the FSA,
to designate a payment system and make a recognition order under clause
170. It is the responsibility of the Bank of England to exercise
oversight of the payment systems. That is clear in the Bill. As I
explained earlier, that will put the Bank of England&#146;s current
responsibilities on a statutory footing, which we believe is the right
and prudent thing to do. We want the Bank of England to consult as
appropriate with the FSA, particularly where payment systems are
embedded in recognised clearing houses or investment exchanges, which
are also subjected to the FSA&#146;s regulatory regime. That is why
there will be a memorandum of understanding between the Bank and the
FSA to ensure that there is no duplication and there is efficient
regulation.</div>
<a name="08102859000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to stress that in all these instances the tripartite
authorities will work closely together. There are clearly distinct
roles for the Treasury, the Bank and the FSA in this, but we would
expect close co-operation on a regular basis between the three
organisations that make up the tripartite
system.</div>
<a name="08102859000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000382"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="08102859000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000383"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="08102859000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000384"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Before I give way to the hon. Member for
Wellingborough I should tell him that the days are gone when the Bank
of England gets a bank in and has a cosy chat. It is important that the
tripartite authorities work closely together and have good
relationships with the banks. There is a wider recognition that putting
these arrangements on a statutory basis is the right way
forward.</div><a name="08102859000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000385"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> That is most helpful. We used the example of people
getting around a lunch table and discussing matters. We are now trying
to formalise this in some sort of memorandum of who does what and when.
Is this Committee likely to be able to see a draft of that
memorandum?</div><a name="08102859000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000386"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The Committee can see what is in the Bill. It
sets out clear and distinct roles. The issue of a memorandum where the
FSA regulates and the Bank of England regulates at the moment is pretty
much a technical issue, which we would not expect to see in the Bill. I
give way to the hon. Member for Fareham, who obviously cannot stay away
from the
Committee.</div><a name="08102859000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000387"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am drawn to it by the magnetism of the subject we
have been discussing. The Minister talked about arrangements for the
FSA to look at regulated investment exchanges and clearing houses, but
a volume of transactions does not go through them, such as derivatives
that are not traded through exchanges. How will he ensure that the
payment systems that relate to them are covered by the Bill because
they are an important volume of transactions in the wholesale market
which, if we are looking at maintaining financial stability, ought to
be covered in some way by these rules?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div><a name="08102859000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000388"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> There are powers in the Bill that allow the
Treasury, in consultation and having received advice from the Bank of
England and the FSA, to recognise key wholesale inter-bank payment
systems. I have given an indication of which payment systems of
preliminary assessment would suggest that we would want them to be
recognised. But we need to ensure that we have adequate coverage so
that the Bank can discharge its responsibilities for financial
stability
appropriately.</div><a name="08102859000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000389"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> I presume that the Minister is talking about clause
170 where the Treasury makes the recognition order. I thank him for his
previous explanation: the Treasury makes the recognition of the systems
and the Bank then does the other bits. That is perfectly reasonable.
The question posed by the hon. Member for Fareham is very important,
given that London is one of the three key wholesale financial markets
in the world. The Minister has just said that there is provision for
the Treasury, through regulation or by order, to specify other systems
that might come into this. Will he provide a little more detail? Does
he have anything in mind? How would he go about putting a recognition
order in place for one of those large wholesale systems that is not at
the moment an official, recognised inter-bank system? How would that
happen and what criteria would be used to do
that?</div><a name="08102859000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000390"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We are talking about the general principles in
this clause. We shall get on to those questions when we debate the
relevant clauses. The hon. Gentleman also asked about who was consulted
and what issues were raised. Consultees included the Bank of England,
payment system operators, users of payment systems and the payments
council, which is the representative body for payment systems.
Everybody wanted to see clarity and responsibility in the system and we
believe that the Bill achieves that. Overall, there was widespread
support for the legislative proposals and we can proceed with
confidence. The financial community broadly welcomes the thrust of what
we are trying to do in part 5 of the Bill. No doubt, we will want to
tease out some of the detail during this and other sittings.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000391"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b><b class="B"> </b>I have two questions for the Minister. This
is an interpretation clause and should not detain us for long. The
clause relates to an inter-bank system. Subsection (1) refers
to</div>
<a name="08102859000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;arrangements
designed to facilitate or control the transfer of money between
financial institutions who participate in the
arrangements.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be grateful if the Minister said a little more about money. We
know that money includes credit, but the Bank of England publication,
&#147;Oversight of Payment Systems&#148; from November 2000, states
that</div><a name="08102859000104"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;money&#146;
is regarded as cash (ie notes and coins issued by the central bank or
government) and claims against credit institutions in the form of
deposits.&#148;</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div><a name="08102859000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues:</div><a name="08102859000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the end, however, what is acceptable as &#145;money&#146; is a
matter of behaviour and the boundary could move.&#148;</div>
<a name="08102859000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the Minister agree
that money is a more flexible concept than it might first
appear?</div>
<a name="08102859000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point is about subsection
(5):</div><a name="08102859000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
system is an inter-bank payment system for the purposes of this Part
whether or not it operates wholly or partly in relation to persons or
places outside the United
Kingdom.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
comes back to the territorial point that has been mentioned already. In
order to fall within the regime, is it necessary for the operation of
the payment system to be in the UK? Does it matter where the
participants are? Is that the test? If so, this is a broad territorial
test, and it could appear to cover any payment system anywhere in the
world. I assume that the key point is the operation&#151;where is
that performed? If it is performed from the UK, will it be caught by
the system so that it does not matter where participants are
based?</div>
<a name="08102859000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000392"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> On my hon. Friend&#146;s last point, if I send
money to America and there is a transfer between a British bank and its
subsidiary in the US, is that part of the system? If the payment
originates in the US and money is sent to me, will the regulations
cover the bank over there? That is an important
point.</div>
<a name="08102859000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000393"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> I, too, shall be brief. I am sorry to see that
the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) is not on
the Committee. I know how assiduous he is with explanatory notes.
Having learned my lessons from him, I will ask a couple of questions
relating to points made in the explanatory notes. The first is about
subsection (2), which states that if non-financial institutions
participate, that will not prevent the process from being considered an
inter-bank payment system. I am curious about what institutions the
Minister has in mind when he talks about non-financial institutions.
Why has that been raised, what red flags have given him concern about
non-financial institutions and why are they being brought under the
umbrella? I suspect I know why, but I am curious to hear his take on
the matter.</div>
<a name="08102859000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
question relates to subsection (5), but it approaches from a different
angle to that taken by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Hertfordshire. It relates to the issue of systems operating wholly or
mainly outside the UK that are to be included and how we will deal with
different regulatory environments. A provision might be interpreted as
being right in the UK because it has an impact on what goes on in the
UK, but how do we try to enforce policies with institutions under
different regulatory regimes in other
countries?</div><a name="08102859000341"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="08102859000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000394"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am happy to try to provide clarification for
the hon. Gentleman. As the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
said, the clause defines the use of the term &#147;inter-bank payment
system&#148; throughout part 5. He referred specifically to
subsection (1), which defines the term &#147;inter-bank payment
system&#148; for the purposes of the Bill and refers to the
arrangements that enable the transfer of money. Subsection (4) confirms
that that includes credit between participating financial institutions,
which are defined in subsection (3) as banks and building 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>societies. Let me be clear that the Bill will give us the flexibility to
recognise new systems in the future, and we think it appropriate that
we should be able to do so. Let me also be clear that that does not
include internal bank systems or correspondent banking
arrangements.</div>
<a name="08102859000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also raised the issue of subsection (5), which will ensure
that systems operating wholly or mainly in relation to persons or
places outside the UK can be classed as inter-bank payment systems for
the purposes of part 5. I shall give a little more detail on that
because a few hon. Members questioned how the legislation would work.
Recognised inter-bank payment systems that are wholly or partly based
outside the UK might be systemically important for the UK financial
system. Where that is the case, part 5 provides for the Treasury to
recognise them and for the Bank of England to oversee them to the
extent that that is possible. In most circumstances, that oversight
would be delivered through the Bank of England&#146;s participation
in international co-operative agreements with other central banks,
because that is the nature of things.</div>
<a name="08102859000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, we
cannot regulate for the American banking system, as the hon. Member for
Wellingborough hinted, but we can ensure that the Bank of England can
participate in those international co-operative agreements and make the
points that it needs to in order to discharge its
responsibilities.</div><a name="08102859000115"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000395"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, because what he has
just said is helpful. For further clarity, is he saying that the
Treasury will not seek a recognition order in respect of a payment
system that is regulated by another central bank? Is he saying that it
will not go that far, but that the Bank of England will undertake a
role in oversight? I am not quite clear about that. I note his point
about not wanting to regulate things that are regulated by another
central bank, but is he saying that there will not be a recognition
order for such a payment
system?</div><a name="08102859000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000396"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am clearly saying the latter. We think that in
most circumstances it will be appropriate that oversight is delivered
through the Bank of England&#146;s participation in international
co-operative arrangements. It is not right to say that that will be the
case in each and every circumstance, because I cannot anticipate what
future circumstances might be. However, the normal way of things is
that we would discuss such matters with other central banks as part of
the normal arrangements. I hope that answer provides clarity to the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000397"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My intervention on this clause will be even more
brief and concerns the terminology used of the operator and manager of
a system. Before I entered this place, I was a solicitor specialising
in regulatory matters. Unfortunately, I did not specialise in this area

<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>but in collective investment schemes. Over the years I worked in that
field, I was never entirely comfortable that I understood the
difference between operating and managing a collective investment
scheme. The clause uses the terminology of operating and managing a
payment system. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten the Committee on
the difference between the two. As far as I can see, both are swept up
under the definition of &#147;operator&#148; for these
purposes.</div><a name="08102859000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000398"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause defines various terms used throughout
part 5, as the hon. Gentleman indicated. In particular, subsection (a)
defines the term &#147;operator&#148; of an inter-bank payment
system to which the provisions of this part apply if the inter-bank
system is recognised by the Treasury under clause 170. It is a sensible
and straightforward provision. Subsection (b) allows

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000399"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I will leave the issue of which payment systems
will be recognised until we discuss clause 171. However, I have one or
two questions on clause
170.</div><a name="08102859000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
as the hon. Member for Dundee, East said, the recognition order is made
by the Treasury. Presumably, because it is an order it must be made by
the Treasury and cannot be made by the Bank of England. Will the
Minister explain what the role of the Bank of England will be in
determining whether a recognition order is appropriate? This issue
relates to the discussions we have had on the relationship between the
parties to the tripartite
arrangement.</div><a name="08102859000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2)
states:</div><a name="08102859000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
recognition order must specify in as much detail as is reasonably
practicable the arrangements which constitute the inter-bank payment
system.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
terminology</div><a name="08102859000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
as much detail as is reasonably practicable&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div><a name="08102859000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">is somewhat vague. It
may be the best that can be done in the circumstances. Does the
Minister anticipate difficulties in specifying what is covered? I do
not think that there will be, but I should be grateful for his
thoughts.</div><a name="08102859000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) makes the interesting point:</div>
<a name="08102859000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Treasury may not specify an inter-bank system operated solely by the
Bank of
England.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
the example of my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree, I too have
looked at the explanatory notes on the clause. Paragraph 381 is
interesting:</div><a name="08102859000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bank of England has a central role in relation to certain payment
systems. In particular, it operates the Real Time Gross Settlement
System and it acts as an infrastructure provider in relation to
CHAPS.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that subsection (3) is not preventing the Treasury from
specifying a system that is partly operated by the Bank of England,
because that would cover some of the main payment systems being
addressed. The terminology clearly refers to inter-bank systems
operated &#147;solely&#148; by the Bank of England, while the
explanatory notes say
that</div><a name="08102859000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Bank of England could step in and provide payment system
services.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the light of recent events, we consider that less unlikely than in the
past&#151;the Government or a Government agency performing such a
major role in this
area.</div><a name="08102859000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000400"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> My hon. Friend is titillating me, because he is
skirting around the key phrase in paragraph 381. I would underline the
part about the possibility of the Bank of England &#147;in some
circumstances&#148; stepping in. I am curious about that central
question, which I ask through my hon. Friend. What does the Minister
think such circumstances might be? What advice does he have? What
situations is he thinking
about?</div><a name="08102859000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000401"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, although I do not
know whether I should apologise for titillating him or not. I was going
to come to that very
point.</div><a name="08102859000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is noticeable that, in some jurisdictions, the performance of a payment
system is performed by a central bank, essentially, rather than by
private entities that are regulated. It might be helpful to the
Committee if the Minister indicated whether the Government considered
nationalising payment systems. For the avoidance of doubt, he could
explain why he thinks that nationalisation is a bad idea. We are with
the Government in viewing a regulatory system, rather than
nationalisation, as appropriate, but perhaps the Minister would
elaborate.</div><a name="08102859000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000402"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> It was not the issue of nationalisation that
crossed my mind. However, the explanatory notes say
that</div><a name="08102859000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
some circumstances, the Bank of England could step
in&#148;.</div><a name="08102859000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assume that the Minister does not think that &#147;could step
in&#148; means nationalisation; it just means to enforce some
regulation, which we are trying to impose through the Bill. Or am I
incorrect, and my hon. Friend correct&#151;that it is nationalisation
or
nothing?</div><a name="08102859000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000403"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Again I am grateful to my hon. Friend. My reading
was that, if the Government provide the payment system services, they
are essentially performing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>that role, which is what happens in some jurisdictions. The Government
are maintaining that option, although not on the face of the Bill. They
do not need to do so in the Bill, but the explanatory note hints at the
possibility of circumstances in which the Government would step in,
such would be the systemic risk at that time. I am not saying that that
would necessarily be the wrong thing to do, but elaboration from the
Minister would be helpful to the
Committee.</div><a name="08102859000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
my hon. Friend does not wish to intervene, I shall go back to the point
about the real-time gross settlement system, and to what extent that
can be seen as separate from the overall CHAPS. For example, is there a
contributory element? If so, it would be regulated by the Bank of
England, and we would have circumstances in which an element of CHAPS
is both operated and regulated by the Bank of England. That is my
understanding, and I do not think that subsection (3) changes that. I
should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
confirmation.</div><a name="08102859000299"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Subject
to that, I have more points to raise with regard to the scope of the
recognition system, but it would be appropriate to address that under
clause
171.</div><a name="08102859000342"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="08102859000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000404"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> I shall be brief. I am still not clear,
notwithstanding the excellent points raised by my hon. Friend the
Member for South-West
Hertfordshire.</div><a name="08102859000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes say in paragraph 381 that in some circumstances the
Bank of England could step in and provide payment system services. Is
that a nationalisation of the payment system, as my hon. Friend is
saying, or is it the Bank of England acting as a facilitator for a
short time? What period of time are the Government thinking about? Is
it two days, a week or a month, or is it a nationalisation that will be
there for a year or five years? I can see what the circumstances are
but it is the timeline that concerns me because that makes a difference
between the Bank of England being a facilitator for a short-term
systemic breakdown and a full-blown nationalisation of the payments
system.</div>
<a name="08102859000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000405"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause gives the Treasury power to designate
by a recognition order an inter-bank payment system as a recognised
system, which is subject to the Bank of England&#146;s powers of
formal oversight conferred under part 5 of the Bill.</div>
<a name="08102859000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
addressing the points raised by the hon. Members for South-West
Hertfordshire and for Braintree, particularly with regard to
subsections (2) and (3), I should like to return to the original point
about why the Treasury is being given the power to designate in these
circumstances. In essence, the Government believe that the Treasury is
best placed to make this assessment. As the UK&#146;s finance and
economic ministry, it has wider powers than the Bank of England. The
Government have responsibility for delivering conditions for business
success in the UK by supporting fair, stable and efficient financial
markets. The Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer also remain
responsible for ensuring compliance with the UK&#146;s international
obligations. The Government have these wider responsibilities but we
think it right to work closely with the Bank of England which will take
clear responsibility in terms of its involvement in financial
stability, with the other party to the tripartite arrangement, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>the FSA. We remain convinced that the Treasury should have overall
responsibility in the area of recognition orders.</div>
<a name="08102859000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire raised a number of points about
subsection (2) which says that the recognition order must contain
sufficient description of the arrangements that constitute the
inter-bank system so that it is clear to operators, customers, members,
third parties and the Bank of England what has led to the
system&#146;s recognition and, importantly, in order to identify the
arrangements over which the obligations conferred under part 5 of the
Bill apply. We have no indications of any problems with this but it is
clearly something required to ensure that part 5 of the Bill can
operate effectively.</div>
<a name="08102859000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
also raised the issue in subsection
(3):</div><a name="08102859000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Treasury may not specify an inter-bank system operated solely by the
Bank of
England.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
provision ensures that the Bill does not unintentionally capture
internal systems used by the Bank of England to conduct operations in
its role as a monetary authority. The Bank of England provides
facilities that allow transactions in inter-bank systems to be settled
across its balance sheet. It is not an operator of payment systems
within the meaning of the Bill. I hope that makes the situation clear.
If the Bank were to become the operator of an inter-bank payment system
in the future&#151;a speculation raised by the hon. Member for
Braintree but which we think would be wholly exceptional&#151;its
operations in that field would be bound by its overall statutory
responsibilities in respect of maintaining financial stability. It
would apply the same criteria to its own operations as it would expect
of others. The risk that the operator takes insufficient account of
overall financial stability considerations, which could arise in
privately operated inter-bank payment systems, would not arise in this
case if a payment system was operated by the Bank of England. That
makes the situation clear. I hope that I have been able to answer the
questions raised by hon. Members in this
area.</div><a name="08102859000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000406"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000407"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000408"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> These are probing amendments. They are intended to
flush out some of the issues that relate to the relationship between
the regime in these provisions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>and the regime that already exists for some payment systems, under the
Financial Markets and Insolvency (Settlement Finality) Regulations
1999&#151;the settlement finality regulations, as they are known to
their friends. They provide a comprehensive legislative framework for
the purpose of protecting systemically important payment
systems.</div>
<a name="08102859000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the settlement finality directive and regulations&#151;these
regulations are based on an EU directive&#151;is to reduce risks
associated with participation in payment settlement systems by
minimising the disruption caused by insolvency proceedings brought
against a participant in such a system. The main provisions of the
directive ensure that bilateral and multilateral netting are protected
from potentially disruptive provisions of insolvency law and that
payment orders are protected from insolvency law provisions from the
moment they are entered into a designated system. There is a
prohibition of insolvency laws having retroactive
effect.</div><a name="08102859000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as I can see&#151;I suspect the Minister will correct me if I am
wrong&#151;under the settlement finality regulations the following
payment systems have been designated: CHAPS sterling and CHAPS euro,
CLS, CREST and LCH.Clearnet. They are regulated by the FSA because they
are recognised investment exchanges or clearing houses. The purpose of
the regulations is to grant some certainty to these payment systems and
their participants that insolvency law will not intervene and unravel a
whole set of transactions.</div>
<a name="08102859000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
distinction to what we have here, the designated systems system is an
opt-in system. Systems can choose to be designated and benefit from
this protection. Here the Bill is structured so that the Treasury
determines whether a system should be recognised. Such recognition does
not provide particularly great benefits, other than providing external
confidence. It imposes a number of obligations on the systems. The
point that I am seeking to examine with these amendments is whether it
is right to distinguish between the systemically important designated
system and a new recognised system, whether that will overcomplicate
the matter and whether there is anything we can do to roll the two
together.</div>

John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): The hon. Gentleman has just

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000410"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I had seen an
earlier version of the amendment paper. Two separate amendments had
been tabled and both appear to be in the final printed version. The
hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, which is a great pity. At least let
me discuss what I was intending to do.</div>
<a name="08102859000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000411"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Which one are you going to speak
to?</div><a name="08102859000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000412"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> It is difficult to argue for amendment
No. 46 over No. 47&#151;they both have their
merits.</div>
<a name="08102859000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000413"></a>Ian

<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div><a name="08102859000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000414"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> As the Minister says&#151;they both have their
flaws. I shall move on to the purpose of the amendments tabled, albeit
not put on the amendment paper correctly. Amendment No. 46 essentially
says that one may only make an order if the system is eligible under
the settlement finality
regulations.</div><a name="08102859000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Actually,
there is a subtle difference between the amendments. The amendment
paper is correct and I apologise for suggesting that it was not. If the
hon. Member for Southport looks carefully, he will see that the
distinction is that amendment No. 47 states that a system may only be
recognised if it &#147;has been designated&#148; as opposed to
&#147;is eligible for designation&#148;. I apologise for being slow
and for suggesting that an error had been
made.</div><a name="08102859000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
be fair, technically, amendment No. 46 has its weaknesses. The schedule
to the settlement finality regulations sets out requirements that must
be satisfied for a system to be designated. It might be better if
amendment No. 46 referred to that schedule rather than simply saying
&#147;is eligible&#148;. We are seeking to explore whether the
designated regime in the settlement finality regulations is likely to
cover the types of entity that could be at systemic risk and whether
those entities will benefit from the insolvency protection law. We
could give systems greater control over whether they fell under the
recognition regime. There is no particular voluntary system, but those
entities that are going to be systemically important are likely to fall
within the settlement finality regulations already.</div>
<a name="08102859000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can move
on, if you would like, Mr. Hood, to raise other points on
clause 171, but I am happy to leave it there, having raised the issues
of whether the two systems could be run together and of whether it
would cause unnecessary uncertainty, contradiction or complication to
have both recognised and designated systems. Whether through these
subtly different amendments or other methods, the Government should
find a way of simplifying what may be an unnecessarily complex
system.</div>
<a name="08102859000343"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="08102859000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000415"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> The amendment draws out an important issue and
touches on what I said at the beginning about a general
principle&#151;how do we define a system that will have systemic
failures? How do we know which systems are brought in? We are talking
about a system that already has some designations. Looking at the
clause, I wonder whether it would have been better if the Government
had stopped at clause 171(1), which gives them the insight to be able
to make the decision on their own. To have subsection (2)(a), (b), (c),
(d) and (e) is window-dressing, in a way, because it is the first part
that counts. I understand that the Government are trying to be helpful,
but in reality, if they thought that there was a problem, they would
not worry about the rest of it; they would just go ahead and do it. I
am therefore not sure that we need subsection
(2).</div><a name="08102859000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000416"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> I want to follow on from the point that my hon.
Friend has raised. My point also concerns subsection (1), but I take a
different view on it. Clause 171 states that the Treasury
may make a recognition order only if disruption to operation of the
system, or deficiencies in its design, would</div>
<a name="08102859000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;threaten the
stability of, or confidence in, the UK financial
system&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div><a name="08102859000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that the
Minister will not wait until there is a disruption and that he will be
looking for certain red flags in the system which will trigger
disruption out there. I am therefore curious as to how he and his
advisers will go about trying to recognise a systemic breakdown before
it happens. What red flags, which may cause systemic breakdown further
down the road, has he been advised may be out
there?</div><a name="08102859000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000417"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It would be our intention first to identify
systemically important inter-bank systems and for those to be
designated. That is not because we think that there is imminent risk of
catastrophic failure of those systems, because we do not. However, we
think that it is right to identify systems that have critical
importance, and the recognition criteria in clause 171(1) and (2) are
both important in this
respect.</div><a name="08102859000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
refer specifically to the amendments. I appreciate that the hon. Member
for South-West Hertfordshire says that they are probing amendments. He
also says that they may have been inspired by some of the responses to
the consultation, where two of the responses suggested that there could
be a potential in the recognition criteria to duplicate criteria by
which a system can be designated under the Financial Markets and
Insolvency (Settlement Finality) Regulations 1999&#151;the
SFRs.</div>
<a name="08102859000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to ensure that only inter-bank payment systems eligible
for designation, or those that have been designated under those SFR
regulations, may be recognised by the Treasury. That limits the scope
of the Treasury&#146;s power under clause 171, which sets out
recognition criteria. I shall explain why I think that is a bad
idea.</div>
<a name="08102859000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
amendment No. 47, as proposed, would mean that a payment system not
designated under the SFRs could not be recognised by the Treasury by
order made under this clause, notwithstanding its systemic or
system-wide importance. That is particularly significant as there is no
obligation for payment systems to apply for designation under the SFRs.
The amendment would simply undermine the robustness of the framework
that the Government are putting in place, by providing a loophole by
which an inter-bank payment system may escape
recognition.</div><a name="08102859000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Officials
advise me that Amendment No. 46 is a moderate improvement on amendment
No. 47. Amendment No. 46 offers the alternative words: &#147;eligible
for designation&#148;. It is still, however, fundamentally flawed for
several reasons, of which I shall give the Committee one or two.
Paragraph 1 of the schedule to the SFRs requires the law of England and
Wales, or Scotland to be the governing law of the system, whereas
clause 168(5) of the Bill provides that an inter-bank payment system,
to which this part applies, may include systems that operate wholly or
partly in relation to persons or places outside the UK, and may,
therefore, be governed by foreign law. Therefore, payment systems not
eligible for designation under the SFRs&#151;because they are
governed by foreign law, for example&#151;would be precluded from
recognition regardless of their systemic or system-wide importance in
the UK.</div>
<a name="08102859000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
scope for a system to avoid even being eligible for designation. For
example, SFRs require systems to define a point after which a transfer
cannot be revoked or cancelled by the sender. If a system 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>makes that part of the rules unclear, that system would no longer be
eligible for designation. Both amendments would unnecessarily restrict
the scope of the clause and limit the inter-bank payment systems that
could be recognised by the Treasury. We do not think that they are a
good idea.</div>
<a name="08102859000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 46 and 47 constrain flexibility and we do not think that they are
required. I emphasise that when we consulted on the criteria in July
with the document, &#147;Financial stability and depositor
protection: further consultation&#148;, we specifically asked whether
the criteria set out were right, and whether they would provide
sufficient flexibility as payment systems evolved over time. The
majority of responses agreed that the criteria were appropriate and
that they offered the right degree of flexibility to allow for the
evolution of payment systems. Respondents considered the latter point
particularly important in terms of future-proofing the legislation.
That is why, should the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire choose
to press amendments Nos. 46 and 47 to a vote, I invite hon. Members to
oppose it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000418"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for addressing the
points raised by amendments Nos. 46 and 47. I appreciate his arguments.
He did not specifically address the issue of whether a more elegant
solution could ultimately be reached in relation to both the designated
system and the recognised system, but I see that trying to impose one
system on the other would create difficulties. I have one point that is
more broadly related to the clause. We have started to touch on the
issue of systemic risk, and I should be grateful if we could address
that issue in the stand part debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000419"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My point, which has been touched upon by my hon.
Friend the Member for Wellingborough, is on the issue of systemic risk
and risk of serious consequences for business or other interests
throughout the UK. Earlier, the Minister set out the payment systems
that will be recognised under the provisions. He also agreed that we
should first look at what systems will involve a systemic risk. It is
worth quoting again from the Bank of England document,
&#147;Oversight of Payment Systems&#148; from November
2000:</div><a name="08102859000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Systemic
risk is likely to be significant only in relation to payment systems
transferring amounts which are large in relation to the balance sheets
and capital resources of at least some of the members; in practice,
this usually means systems used to settle wholesale financial market
transactions in money, foreign exchange and
securities.&#148;</div>
<a name="08102859000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Minister agree that in clause 171(1)(a), those payment systems where
disruption of the operation
may</div><a name="08102859000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;threaten
the stability of, or confidence in, the UK financial
system,&#148;</div><a name="08102859000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">relates
to payments that are involved in the wholesale markets? Will the other
payment systems to which he referred, such as credit and debit card
payment systems, fall under paragraph (b), which
is</div><a name="08102859000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
have serious consequences for business or other interests throughout
the United Kingdom&#148;?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div><a name="08102859000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point I am trying to
draw out is that it is not necessary for a payment system to have
systemic risk for it to be recognised under the provisions. I should be
grateful if the Minister would confirm that.</div>
<a name="08102859000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said
earlier that the Bank of England has traditionally taken a differential
approach to the principles that apply, depending on the nature of what
they do and largely on the factors set out under clause 171(2), to
which my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough referred. We shall
probably debate that when we come to clause 171, but the Minister might
want to deal with it
now.</div><a name="08102859000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000420"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We are discussing clause
171.</div><a name="08102859000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000421"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am sorry; I meant when we come to clause 174 on
principles and clause 175 on codes of
practice.</div><a name="08102859000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
though recognition may apply under paragraphs (a) or (b), the
application of the rules and principles is likely to be tougher for
those entities where there is a systemic risk under paragraph (a) than
those under paragraph (b).</div>
<a name="08102859000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000422"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Subsection (1) contains the phrase,</div>
<a name="08102859000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only if
satisfied that any deficiencies in the design of the system, or any
disruption of its
operation&#148;.</div><a name="08102859000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us consider the airline industry. It might have a design code of
practice. The design might be right. There would be no disruption to
the operation, but the administration of the airline might be failing
to meet the design, with the consequence that something disastrous
happens at the end. That is like the banking system: the design might
be right, but its administration might be wrong. Why is that
specifically excluded from clause
171(1)(a)?</div><a name="08102859000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
test falls on two issues, but not a third. The interpayment system
might be designed right. It may be operated correctly at the time, but
as time goes on there might be a failure in the operation, of which the
Treasury would be aware. The Minister may be able to clarify why it is
not the case, but there seems to be an
omission.</div><a name="08102859000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000423"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Clause 171 states that the Treasury may make a
recognition order only if
satisfied</div><a name="08102859000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
any deficiencies in the design of the system, or any disruption of its
operation, would be
likely&#148;</div><a name="08102859000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
have consequences of a systemic nature under subsection
(1)(a), as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, or to
have</div>
<a name="08102859000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;serious
consequences for business or other interests throughout the United

(1)(b).</div><a name="08102859000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not as simple as to say that paragraph (a) means wholesale, while
paragraph (b) means retail. &#147;Systemic&#148; could be retail or
wholesale. For example, the BACS system has links to retail and is
potentially systemic. When it comes to defining which systems are
covered by paragraphs (a) and (b), there is no real disagreement within
the financial services community.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div><a name="08102859000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000424"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
clarification. He will be aware that I was quoting what the Bank of
England said in the year 2000. If the position has evolved since then,
so be it. When making a recognition order, does the Treasury intend to
make it clear whether paragraphs (a) or (b) apply or whether they will
both
apply?</div><a name="08102859000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000425"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We would certainly want to operate in an open and
transparent manner and, as I have explained, we shall seek advice from
the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority before making
such recognitions. I do not think that there will be a lot of
contention in that
area.</div><a name="08102859000344"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="08102859000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that subsection (2) is important, despite the suggestion of the
hon. Member for Wellingborough that we focus just on subsection (1).
When deciding whether something is systemic or will have serious
consequences, it is right to consider the number and value of the
transactions processed by the system, the nature of the transactions,
whether they could be handled by other systems and the relationship
between the system and other
systems.</div><a name="08102859000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will explain why those criteria are appropriate. Whether transactions
could be handled by other systems is relevant to the consideration of
systemic or system-wide importance because the extent and effect of the
disruption caused by system failure are likely to be greater if there
are no alternatives. For example, CHAPS carries high-value same-day
payments for the settlement of sterling obligations in financial
markets. No other system provides that
facility.</div><a name="08102859000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to consider relationships with other systems because such
interdependencies could generate system-wide or systemic risks that are
not apparent when the system is viewed by itself. Interdependencies
might exist operationally or because of the use of a shared liquidity
pool, such as the ability to transfer liquidity between CREST and
CHAPS. There could also be an overlap in memberships of the two
systems. The criteria in the clause will inform the assessment by the
Treasury of the systemic or system-wide importance of the inter-banking
system and thereby identify whether formal oversight by the Bank of
England is appropriate to minimise the risk to the financial stability
of the
UK.</div><a name="08102859000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wellingborough also remarked that the issue is not just
with the system, but with the administration of the system. I refer him
to later clauses, which I believe deal adequately with the points he
has
made.</div><a name="08102859000203"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000426"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have one or two questions about the procedure for
making a recognition order. The clause gives us another opportunity to
raise questions about the relationships between the Treasury, the Bank
of England and the FSA. Subsection (3) states:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div><a name="08102859000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
considering whether to make a recognition order in respect of a payment
system the Treasury may rely on information provided by the Bank of
England or the
FSA.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the Minister envisage circumstances in which the Bank of England or the
FSA will initiate the process? Will there be times when the Bank of
England goes to the Treasury and says, &#147;We think that this
payment system needs to be recognised.&#148;? Is that how the process
will work in practice? There is an obligation on the Treasury to
consult the Bank of England, but can he imagine circumstances in which
the Bank of England may take a different view and say that a payment
system should not be recognised? Are there any circumstances when the
Treasury will overrule the Bank of
England?</div><a name="08102859000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
it is unlikely, will it be possible for the operator of a payment
system to make an application to be recognised, in the same way that
they can make an application to be designated? Under subsection (1),
the Treasury will &#147;consider any representations made&#148;,
presumably by the Bank of England or the operator of the system. An
operator of a system may not want it to be recognised. What will be the
time frame in which the operators of systems that could be recognised
can make representations? How long will the Treasury take to consider
such
representations?</div><a name="08102859000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) raises the issue of recognised investment exchanges and clearing
houses and the FSA&#146;s role. Where a recognised clearing house or
investment exchange will be a recognised payment system, which entity
will take the lead in regulation&#151;the FSA or the Bank of England?
The Minister will be aware of the concerns about entities slipping
between the gaps, which I suspect is one of the driving forces behind
the Bill. Can he answer that
question?</div><a name="08102859000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000427"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I think that clause 172(1) is the &#147;going out
to lunch&#148; part of the Bill. In the past, the Bank of England,
the Treasury and the operator would get together and talk things over,
and this subsection tries to re-create that consultation. If at the end
of the consultation the Bank of England and the operator took the same
view but the Treasury took a different one, it is not clear whether the
Treasury&#146;s view would necessarily go ahead, even if the other
two parties were against
it.</div><a name="08102859000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000428"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause sets out the process by which
recognition orders are to be made. Again, I have to tell the hon.
Gentleman that this is not the &#147;going out to lunch&#148;
clause. It is a clause that makes clear how the procedure should
operate.</div><a name="08102859000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall try to add flesh to the bones of the clause, in response to the
largely theoretical questions posed by the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire. In practice, there will be a large, if not complete,
measure of agreement between the authorities in the tripartite system
and in the banking and building societies system, as to which
inter-bank systems should be recognised. Important systems may,
however, emerge in the future and the hon. Gentleman is right to want
to probe the basis on which future systems might wish to be recognised.
We have already indicated the sorts of system that will be recognised
initially, and once the legislation has been passed we expect that a
range of systems will be completely agreed between all parties. In the
future, the Bank of England and/or the FSA could bring information to
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>Treasury along with a recommendation to recognise a system. In addition,
an operator could apply to be recognised. The Treasury can consider any
representations, and the decision to recognise is at its discretion.
However, we would want to consult the FSA and, importantly, the Bank of
England. There needs to be a clear designating authority, and the
legislation makes it clear that that is the
Treasury.</div><a name="08102859000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000429"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> The Minister has just said that recognition would
be at the Treasury&#146;s discretion, but he has also said that a new
inter-bank system could emerge that might, if it failed, be a systemic
failure. Surely, the decision to recognise ought not to be at
anyone&#146;s discretion. If an inter-bank payment system has become
so big that it is critical and that if it failed it would be a systemic
failure, recognition should be automatic and not at the discretion of
the
Treasury.</div><a name="08102859000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000430"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Perhaps I was being loose with my terminology,
but let me make it clear that the Treasury, which is able to exercise
that power, will do so at its discretion. It will want to use the power
if it believes that clause 171(1)(a) or (b) are engaged. As I said, in
the normal course of events I expect there will be a large measure of
agreement on the types of inter-bank payment system we are discussing.
With regard to the potential for the future, the Treasury will be open
to representations from the Bank of England, the FSA and individual
organisations on whether there are new systems that are of such
systemic or system-wide importance that they should be
recognised.</div><a name="08102859000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire raised an issue about the time
frame. As he will appreciate, that will depend on the nature of the
representations. The Treasury might seek further information from the
Bank of England, the FSA or the operator of a system, so it is not
possible to give a precise time scale. I return to the overall point
that there has to be a recognition procedure, and we believe that it is
right that the Treasury leads on that. The Treasury will consult widely
on that point with the Bank of England, the FSA and operators. I hope
that those reassurances will be supported by the
Committee.</div><a name="08102859000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000431"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 19, in
clause 173, page 89, line 11, 
after &#145;recognised&#146;, insert
&#145;inter-bank&#146;.</div><a name="08102859000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is a technical correction intended to provide consistency
across part 5 of the Bill. Clause 170 provides for the Treasury to make
a recognition order in respect of an inter-bank payment system, thereby
bringing it within the Bank of England&#146;s remit as formal
overseer. Clause 173 provides for the revocation of a recognition order
made under clause 170. The amendment makes it clear that the Treasury
must consider requests by the operator of a recognised inter-bank
payment system only in relation to the recognition order made under
clause 170(1) and not one made, for example, under the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div><a name="08102859000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">By way of
example, clearing houses or investment exchanges may be recognised by
the FSA under part 18 of the 2000 Act. Such recognised clearing houses
and investment exchanges are then subject to the FSA&#146;s
regulatory regime, and those recognised clearing houses or investment
exchanges might contain embedded payment systems that do not meet the
recognition criteria in clause 171 and would not, therefore, be
recognised by the Treasury under clause 170(1). In such circumstances,
it would be inappropriate for the Treasury to consider requests for
revoking a recognition made by the FSA. That is why we believe this
technical amendment to be
necessary.</div><a name="08102859000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000432"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have a brief question for the Minister on the
subsection that he has amended, and we are grateful for his explanation
for that amendment. My question relates to the circumstances in which
the Treasury must consider any request by the operator of a recognised
payment system for revocation of its recognition order. We have not
tabled an amendment to the clause, but perhaps the Minister might help
the Committee on this point. When the Treasury rejects any such
request, does he consider it appropriate that it should give reasons
for that rejection? Furthermore, is there anything more that he can say
on whether an application for revocation would be successful, other
than referring to the recognition criteria in clause 171? If a payment
system saw its market share fall substantially, whether because of this
regulatory regime or commercial factors, would that be the sort of
matter that the Treasury would take into account, on which grounds it
would be willing to grant revocation?</div>
<a name="08102859000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would it ever
be possible for a payment system to put in an application with a view
to its coming into effect some months down the line? A payment system
might be seeking to wind up its business. Rather than simply doing so
and still finding itself a recognised system for these purposes and
with various obligations on it, I wonder whether it could work with the
Treasury and say, &#147;We are going to cease performing at some
time. We would like the revocation of the recognition order to coincide
with the time we cease trading so there is not a huge overlap.&#148;
Would the Treasury be willing to work in a constructive manner with
payment systems were those circumstances to arise? I do not know how
likely that would be, but certainly in other sectors when a business
winds up it wants to be able to work with the regulator to do that in
as smooth and orderly a fashion as
possible.</div><a name="08102859000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000433"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I can assure the Committee that the Treasury
always wants to act in a supportive and helpful manner in these areas.
The hon. Gentleman raises some practical points about what might happen
if an inter-bank payment system was in decline and no longer had any
systemic importance. The Bank of England will monitor the situation
closely. It will undoubtedly be in contact with the operator. The
tripartite authorities work very 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>closely together. In those circumstances, there would be no alarms and
no surprises. On the question whether reasons would be given if the
Treasury refused a request of an operator to de-recognise a payment
system, in the spirit of openness and transparency, the Treasury would
naturally want to give its reasons. I am happy to place that comment on
the record for those who look at these
things.</div><a name="08102859000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000434"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We have already touched upon these principles and
the contents of the clause in earlier discussions. I note that the
clause states that the Bank &#147;may&#148; publish principles. We
have not tabled an amendment to say that it &#147;must&#148; do so,
but I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that it is
intended that principles will be published and that they will apply to
the operators of recognised inter-bank payment
systems.</div><a name="08102859000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
set of principles is already in place for such payment systems. These
have been established by the Bank for International Settlements,
specifically the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems. They are
described as the core principles for systemically important payment
systems. They have historically been adopted by the Bank of England and
other central banks. Mr. Hood, you will be relieved to learn
that I have no intention of reading out the principles in full. In
broad terms they relate to: legal basis; the participants having a
clear understanding of the system&#146;s impact; the management of
financial risk; prompt final settlement; settlement in multilateral
netting systems; settlement assets; security and operational
reliability; efficiency; access criteria and governance. Can the
Minister say whether the principles under the clause will essentially
be those, and confirm that there is no intention of changing them? The
clause
states:</div><a name="08102859000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Before
publishing principles the Bank must obtain the approval of the
Treasury&#148;,</div><a name="08102859000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
will consultation on the principles take place more widely with
operators? Will they have an opportunity to put their
views?</div><a name="08102859000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes state that the clause will reflect the core
principles. We need to know whether those principles will be those to
which I have referred, and that there will be no real change&#151;the
point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough when he
drew attention to the regulatory impact assessment. I notice that a
breach of principles will not constitute a compliance failure for the
purposes of clause 182. Without getting into a debate on that clause,
can the Minister explain the status of the principles and say why they
will not constitute a compliance failure? It is the case for firms
generally regulated by the Financial Services Authority under the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 that there is a set of
principles and a set of rules, but that breach of the principles can
constitute a regulatory  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>offence. Indeed, most disciplinary action taken by the FSA refers to a
large extent to principles. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can also explain
that.</div><a name="08102859000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the point that the Bank of England, in its oversight of
payment systems until now, does not necessarily require each payment
system to comply with every core principle. Given what the Minister
said about which systems will constitute recognised systems, I should
be grateful for clarification. He might believe that he has provided
it, but it would help the Committee if the point were made absolutely
clear and it would help us to know whether, for those institutions,
although not systemically important, full observance of the core
principles is necessary.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000435"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I draw attention to subsection (1) and the wonderful
word &#147;may&#148; in the
phrase:</div><a name="08102859000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bank of England may publish
principles&#148;.</div><a name="08102859000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
principles have been working in practice for a great number of years,
but I understand that there is no necessity to publish them because
they are being used anyway and the regulatory impact assessment says
that there will not be any change. Is it the Government&#146;s
intention that the clause is only in the Bill in case they think that
the principles need to be published, or do they definitely intend to
publish them? If so, why does the Bill not state that the Bank of
England &#147;must publish&#148;? I am not clear whether that is
something that the Government are holding in reserve or whether they
will take such action. If that is their intention, perhaps the Bill
should be amended at a later
stage.</div><a name="08102859000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000436"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> My view is similar to that of the hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire, but possibly more basic and a little more
naive. I could have said the same about the principle, the rules or the
codes of conduct. I have not seen examples of each, but when we have
discussed them hitherto in Committee, we have talked primarily about
the robustness, the security and the resilience of payment
arrangements&#151;the technical issues. There are wider issues of
banking practices and ethics. At its simplest level, we consumers have
all noticed how debits are recognised almost immediately and credits
after appreciable delay, which causes concern and seems unreasonable in
the high-speed world of IT. There is a distinction between what is
regarded as a legitimate matter of commercial choice for payment
systems, and what is a matter for public regulation. In commenting on
this, the British Banking Association said that it was worried about
the effect of regulation on competition. I seek further clarification
from the Minister, if only to help me, on the scope of the principles,
codes and system
rules.</div><a name="08102859000237"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000437"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am sure that the whole Committee is relieved
that we are not going to have an extensive debate on
&#147;may&#148;, &#147;shall&#148; or &#147;must&#148; in
the legislation. I confirm that the intention is for the Bank of
England to publish principles to which operators of recognised
inter-bank payment systems must have regard in operating those systems.
As set out, the principles must be approved by the Treasury before
publication.</div><a name="08102859000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause, in essence, formalises an aspect of the existing structure of
oversight under which the Bank of England expects payment systems to
take account of the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and its
core principles for systemically important payment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>systems, which were referred to by the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire. &#147;Core Principles for Systemically Important
Payment Systems&#148; was published in January 2001. The principles
emphasise the importance of those systemically important payment
systems within which disruption could trigger or transmit further
disruptions among participants, or cause systemic disruptions in the
financial markets more
widely.</div><a name="08102859000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
wishing to pre-empt the contents of the Bank of England&#146;s
principles with regard to the clause, I can inform the Committee that
the types of principles covered in the CPSS&#146;s &#147;Core
Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems&#148; include a
well-founded legal basis, understanding and management of financial
risks and various elements covering matters such as operational
resilience, efficiency and effective governance. The core principles
are internationally accepted as important for sound, stable and well
functioning financial systems. The Bank will work closely with industry
in developing the principles, but we do not see the Bank intending to
change substantially the positions that it has taken in the past in
such matters. The Bank will also, of course, want to take into account
other relevant, internationally agreed recommendations and best
practice when setting its
principles.</div><a name="08102859000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire raised the issue of why
failure to comply with the principles was not deemed a compliance
failure. Later on in his speech he answered his own question, when
talking about not everyone having to comply with each principle. All
recognised inter-bank payment systems must have regard to the
principles, but it is intended that the Bank of England&#151;as
now&#151;will adopt a proportionate approach as to the level of that
regard, based on the risk posed to the system and its relative systemic
or system-wide importance. It is right, for example, that the Cheque
and Credit Clearing Company should not have the same requirements made
of it as CHAPS when there is no other alternative. Therefore, it would
not be appropriate if failure to comply with principles triggered a
compliance failure. Instead, the Bank may use additional
information-gathering powers in the form of requiring an independent
report under clause 181, for instance. Or, if a recognised inter-bank
payment system is not operating with sufficient regard to its
principles, based on the Bank&#146;s analysis, the Bank may then
choose to use its powers to issue directions or to require rule
changes. Such matters will come
up.</div><a name="08102859000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that answers the question of the hon. Member for South-West

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000438"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The clause relates to codes of practice. I know
that the Minister is not keen to have a lengthy debate about
&#147;may&#148; and &#147;must&#148;, but I shall raise the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>issue briefly. Does the Bank of England intend to publish codes of
practice? My second point is about consultation. The clause does not
mention consultation with operators, or state whether the Treasury or
the Bank of England intend to hold consultation about codes of practice
and any changes to them.</div>
<a name="08102859000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are
the codes of practice intended to elaborate on the principles, or will
they address new areas? To the layman, the principles look
comprehensive but perhaps the Minister will clarify that point.
Finally, the Bank for International Settlements produces material that
could be described as a code of practice that elaborates on the
principles. I looked at it last night&#151;there are about 100 pages
of material along those lines. The Minister said that the principles
are likely to be similar to existing core principles; will the codes of
practice mentioned in clause 175 be similar to that of the Bank for
International Settlements?</div>
<a name="08102859000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000439"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I do want to be pedantic about the issue of
&#147;may&#148; or &#147;must.&#148; I assume that the Minister
will confirm that the Bank of England will publish codes of practice.
If the Minister will say that, so should the Bill. The Bill governs the
law of the country&#151;it is not about what the Minister says, it is
what is on the statute book. If the Government have determined that
this will happen, it should be in the Bill and a Government amendment
should correct that later in the proceedings. This is an important
issue&#151;we must not have sloppy drafting in
Bills.</div>
<a name="08102859000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000440"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> My point follows the questions by my two hon.
Friends. The question is not only, &#147;What will the codes of
practice be?&#148; That is important and, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Wellingborough said, the devil is always in the detail, but
equally importantly, how will day-to-day compliance be monitored? I am
curious to know how the Minister envisages that taking
place.</div>
<a name="08102859000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000441"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It might help the Committee if I briefly explain
how the principles, the codes of practice, system rules and directions
fit together. We see them as a complementary suite of available powers.
Clause 175 differs from clause 174&#151;which is on
principles&#151;in that the codes of practice are intended to set out
binding requirements in relation to specific areas, such as messaging
standards, or levels of resilience, whereas the principles are intended
to provide high-level, overarching guidance. The principles will set
out the general conduct expected of recognised payment systems and they
will be interpreted by the Bank in a manner proportionate to the risks
posed by individual systems; whereas the codes of practice will focus
on a more specific level of detail. For example, a code of practice may
require certain types of system to observe specific minimum standards
in relation to business continuity. I can confirm that it is the Bank
of England&#146;s intention to issue a code of practice, and it will
consult with interested parties before doing
so.</div>
<a name="08102859000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000442"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> The Minister said that he expects the code of
practice to be binding. Will there be a sanction should parts of the
code fail to be met? If the code is expected to be
binding&#151;effectively legislation&#151;why is there not at least
a statement of general intent to that effect in the
Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div><a name="08102859000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000443"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The principles and code of practice are two
powers found in clauses 174 and 175. They are complemented by the
system rules in clause 176, which we will come on to, and the
directions in clause 177.</div>
<a name="08102859000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I can, I
shall say something briefly without straying on to those stand part
debates&#151;if they are thought to be necessary, Mr.
Hood&#151;because it explains the overall architecture. In clause 176
the Bank of England may want to ensure that the operator of a
recognised inter-bank payment system makes rules relating to specific
aspects of the payment system in question. For example, the Bank may
wish to ensure that the system has rules in place to manage the default
of a participant effectively. In clause 177, the Bank of England may
wish to use its formal power to impose certain directions or
instructions pertaining to how a specific recognised inter-bank payment
system may operate. This may include requiring or prohibiting certain
actions in relation to the system or setting standards to be met in the
operation of the system. For example, the Bank might direct a system to
set up a programme of tests of its crisis management arrangements,
which were referred to earlier. This suite of powers will enable the
Bank of England to carry out its function of oversight of payments
effectively and efficiently. I think that starts to address the point
raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East but I suspect we shall come
on to it at a later
date.</div><a name="08102859000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000444"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I think the question raised by the hon. Member for
Dundee, East is, why is it not in the Bill that clause 175 is binding
and subject to sanctions? Clause 182 defines a breach of clause 175 as
a compliance failure. The following clauses make it clear that
sanctions are there. Far be it from me to always want to be helpful
but, in this period of bipartisan co-operation, I think the Bill does
make it clear that sanctions are
available.</div><a name="08102859000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000445"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I was explaining, without going into detail, that
there were clauses under which we would have the opportunity to debate
those issues later. I think I have covered the points raised by hon.
Members.</div><a name="08102859000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="08102859000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000446"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The Minister has already outlined what clause 176
is about, which is the ability of the Bank of England to require an
operator of a recognised inter-bank payment system to establish rules
or to change the rules. I am simplifying a little. I again ask about
time frame and consultation and the opportunity that an operator of a
payment system will have to make representations to the Bank of
England. I imagine there will be circumstances where the Bank of
England will want to move very quickly with regard to system rules,
although there may be times when these matters can be done in a
co-operative way. I should be grateful for guidance from the Minister
as to whether he envisages clause 176 being used in exceptional
circumstances, where the Bank of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>England felt it necessary to impose rules on a payment system&#151;if
you like, forcing it on the operator, as opposed to reaching some
agreement by dialogue. I know there have been instances under the
non-statutory regime where the Bank of England has been able to reach
an agreement by raising an eyebrow&#151;in the manner of
Sir Desmond Glazebrook of &#147;Yes Minister&#148; fame,
as referred to earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for
Wellingborough&#151;and that that will be the way in which the Bank
of England will seek to work, through dialogue and co-operation, rather
than necessarily using the rules in clause 176 as a routine way of
forcing payment systems to change their
rules.</div><a name="08102859000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000447"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> Subsection (1)(d) states that an operator may be
required</div><a name="08102859000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not
to change the rules without the approval of the
Bank.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know the internal workings of any inter-bank payment systems,
but I have written financial computer systems. I would be astonished if
an entire system and the rules under which it operated did not include
the creation of financial and transaction reports, which may
subsequently be used in company accounts or bank accounts to calculate
things such as tax
liability.</div><a name="08102859000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should
the tax regime change, will the provisions mean that rules cannot be
altered to change the reporting from the systems without the approval
of the Bank? I suspect that that is not the intention, but it might be
an unintended consequence. Perhaps the Minister will think about
whether minor changes in the rules of systems should require approval
by the Bank if they are made simply to facilitate additional or changed
reporting that falls outside the inter-bank payment
system.</div><a name="08102859000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000448"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> May I remark on the importance of system rules
before addressing those points? System rules are a fundamental part of
how payment systems operate. Among other things, they cover a payment
system&#146;s legal structure, how risks are shared or managed and
how default arrangements work. For example, the Bank of England may
wish to ensure that a system has rules in place to manage the default
of a participant effectively. The Bank&#146;s powers on rules in the
clause will be an important element of its oversight role for payment
systems.</div><a name="08102859000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rules
fundamentally underpin the operation of any payment system. They are a
crucial determinant of its efficiency and stability. Ensuring that an
operator of a recognised inter-bank payment system has the appropriate
rules in place on specific aspects of the payment system will ensure
that it is not operated in a way that threatens the stability of
financial markets or other business interests across the UK. It is
important that our inter-banking system has effective rules in place
and that the Bank of England has powers regarding those
rules.</div><a name="08102859000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the questions, we usually expect the Bank to operate in a
co-operative way and discuss the system rules for an operator. It might
be that in exceptional circumstances the Bank has to act quickly. The
legislation therefore ensures that there is flexibility to take account
of that. The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked whether the
Bank&#146;s approval will be required in all cases of rule change.
Again, the word &#147;may&#148; is involved. Let me make myself
clear: the Bank of England may require the operator of a payment system
to seek approval 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>before changing its rules, but that will not necessarily happen in all
circumstances. System rules are important and it is right that the Bank
has a strong oversight responsibility in that area. That is why we are
giving these powers a statutory
basis.</div><a name="08102859000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000449"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> Will it be permissible for a bank that is required
to change the reporting in its system because of a tax change to do so
without reference to the Bank of
England?</div><a name="08102859000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000450"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am sure that that will be the
case.</div><a name="08102859000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000451"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The wording of the clause
is</div><a name="08102859000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not
to change the rules without the approval of the
Bank.&#148;</div><a name="08102859000300"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Will
it be possible in any circumstances for such approval to be
retrospective? In other words, there may be times when a payment system
needs to change the rules quickly for tax or operational reasons. In
such circumstances, the operator might have to go to the Bank and say,
&#147;We have done this; is it okay?&#148; Is that permissible
under the
clause?</div>
<a name="08102859000347"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000452"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I certainly see a distinction between routine
changes to rules to comply with legislative requirements and future tax
changes, and more wide-ranging changes to the rules that result from
the decisions taken by an operator. Were an operator to consider making
some fairly fundamental changes to its rules, I expect that it would
want to have a conversation with the Bank as regulator in the first
instance, and I think that that would happen in the normal course of
events.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000453"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> This clause allows the Bank of England to give
directions to an operator of a recognised inter-bank payment system.
With regard to the consultation representations from the affected
operator, those issues that apply to system rules also apply to
directions. Does the Minister see a direction under the clause as being
an exceptional route of action taken by the Bank of England or as
routine? May I ask specifically what those directions might relate to?
The clause
states:</div><a name="08102859000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
direction may...require or prohibit the taking of specified action
in the operation of the
system&#148;.</div><a name="08102859000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
the Minister elaborate on what &#147;specified action&#148; might
mean so that we are sure that it does not mean rule change, for
example? It could be helpful to throw out even one possibility of what
a &#147;specified action&#148; might be. It might be a question,
for example, of whether employing an individual would, or would not, be
appropriate, or whether that enables the Bank of England to assess if
particular individuals are fit and proper to perform a role within a
payment system in the way that the FSA, as a matter of course, assesses
people performing approved functions under the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000. Is that part of what clause 177 is designed to
address?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div><a name="08102859000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000454"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause gives the Bank of England power to
give directions to the operator of an organised inter-bank payment
system. Directions may require, or conversely prohibit, certain actions
in the course of the operation of a recognised inter-bank payment
system. Directions may also set standards to be met in the operation of
the system.</div>
<a name="08102859000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, the purpose of the legislation is not that directions
should be used routinely. To give a specific example, the Bank might
direct the recognised inter-bank payment system to set up a programme
of tests on its crisis management arrangements. One would hope that the
operator of the inter-bank payment system would wish to do that in any
event and that agreement would normally be reached. If the Bank thought
that the operator was unwilling to do so and that it was necessary, it
is right that it should have the power by direction to require a
programme of tests. That is an important part of the Bank&#146;s
oversight role for payment systems, as it enables it to ensure that
specific steps, such as the one I have just indicated, are taken in
relation to a payment system as and when the need arises.</div>
<a name="08102859000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Directions,
unlike system rules, will make specific instructions regarding the
general conduct of the payment system, rather than its rules of
operation. Directions could also be made as emergency measures to take
immediate action, or conversely, to stop doing something with immediate
effect. Those powers are therefore necessary because they are an
important part of the suite of regulatory tools, which I mentioned
earlier, that enable the Bank of England to ensure that the payment
system is both designed and operated in a manner that does not threaten
the stability of the UK&#146;s financial system.</div>

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000455"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Briefly, the clause states that in exercising
powers under this part of the Bill, the Bank of England shall have
regard to</div>
<a name="08102859000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any action that
the FSA has taken or could
take&#148;.</div><a name="08102859000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
comes back to a theme that has run through the morning of the
relationship between the various regulatory bodies. I can see that the
purpose of the clause is to avoid any duplication. Are there any
similar obligations on the FSA to have regard to any action taken by
the Bank in respect of payment systems? I am also slightly curious
about the
phrase,</div><a name="08102859000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
action that the FSA has taken or could
take&#148;,</div><a name="08102859000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
it is somewhat broad. I can see what the clause is trying to get at,
but one could argue that it is vague.</div>
<a name="08102859000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the
Minister reassure us that there will be good communication between the
FSA and the Bank in this area? Could he identify structurally how that
will be done? This is particularly an issue for recognised clearing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>houses and investment exchanges where the FSA has a major role. Who is
in charge with regard to those institutions? I think it is essentially
the FSA, but will the Minister confirm that that is the case? For those
payment systems that are not either a recognised clearing house or a
recognised investment exchange, does he expect that the Bank be in
charge and what role will the FSA have in those
circumstances?</div>
<a name="08102859000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000456"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> The clause touches on the tripartite arrangements,
which are not unique. There are other areas where there is more than
one agency responsible for a set of affairs, but usually there is a
clear memorandum of working between the organisations, setting out
which organisation is paramount in an area where things overlap. I am
still not clear whether one organisation will come out on top when
there is duplication. The clause deals with the relationship between
the Bank and the FSA. We have been unable to see these memorandums of
working, so will the Minister tell us whether there will be
duplication? If there is, will the Bank, the Treasury or the FSA come
out on
top?</div><a name="08102859000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000457"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I explained earlier, the Bank of England
clearly has the lead responsibility when it comes to the regulation of
inter-bank payment systems. In the case of payment systems within
recognised clearing houses and investment exchanges, which are
regulated by the FSA, the Bank will again have responsibility for the
regulation of the inter-bank payment systems. Certainly in all the
consultations in this area, there was overwhelming recognition that
there should be a single regulator when it comes to inter-bank payment
systems. To avoid duplication between the responsibilities of the FSA
in the regulation of recognised clearing houses and recognised
investment exchanges and the role of the Bank in overseeing inter-bank
payment systems, there will be a memorandum of understanding between
the Bank and the FSA. It will ensure that there is effective
co-ordination and minimum duplication of
regulations.</div>
<a name="08102859000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000458"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I dealt with the Investment Exchanges and Clearing
Houses Act 2006 when it went through Parliament. In that Act, the FSA
clearly has the responsibility for approving rule changes put forward
by the clearing houses and investment exchanges. Would it not be better
for that legislation to be modified through this Bill, rather than
relying on a memorandum of understanding?</div>
<a name="08102859000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000459"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The Bill is clear&#151;the Bank of England is
responsible for the oversight of inter-bank payment systems. If it
becomes necessary to take enforcement action, the Bank of England and
the FSA will want to agree on which one of them is best placed to do
so. It is important to recognise that we are setting out in different
parts of the Bill the clear responsibilities of the tripartite
authorities. It is right that the Treasury leads on, and has
responsibility for, recognition, and that the Bank of England has lead
responsibility on inter-bank payment
systems.</div>
<a name="08102859000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000460"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for being explicit
about inter-bank payment systems. We support the Bank of England taking
the lead. Why is there a statutory obligation on the Bank of England to
have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>regard to the FSA, but, as far as we can see, no comparable obligation
on the FSA to have regard to the
Bank?</div><a name="08102859000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000461"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is my understanding that the clause was
designed to ensure that the role of the FSA was explicitly recognised,
given its responsibilities on recognised clearing houses and investment
exchanges. I am not sure that a reciprocal power is necessary, because
there are other measures within architecture of the Bill to ensure that
the tripartite authorities talk to one another. However, I will reflect
on that point further and, if necessary, return to it at a later
stage.</div>

<a name="08102859000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000462"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We enter into the enforcement area of part 5. I
have more comments to make on clause 180, some of which relate to this
clause. Does the Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>consider the inspection powers in clause 179 to be exceptional? I assume
that the Bank of England will be able to work co-operatively with
operators of payment systems without recourse to the relevant
clauses.</div>
<a name="08102859000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) says that an operator
must</div><a name="08102859000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;grant
an inspector access, on request and at any reasonable time, to premises
on or from which any part of the system is operated&#148;.</div>
<a name="08102859000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">What will the
notice period for an inspector to access premises be? Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, for example, has various rules
and guidance about how much notice it should give an entity before it
gains access to premises. What does the Minister see the position as
being in those circumstances? It is particularly significant, given the
issues regarding clause 180, but I hope to address those this
afternoon.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102859000463"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> The clause is fairly similar to a clause that we
discussed earlier with regard to the provision for HMRC officers to
have access to ascertain documents. We had a debate in another
Committee Room about what &#147;a document&#148; meant.</div>
