<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): Will the Minister explain whether there is any magic in that order, or is it simply numerical?
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): It is not simply numerical it will facilitate the tabling of a large number of amendments. I hope that that will assist Opposition Members, otherwise amendments would have to be tabled on Report. Taking the clauses in a slightly different order will allow Opposition Members maximum time for their consideration.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 33</center></H4>
<H4><center>Employees of Legal Services Commission</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 187, in page 22, line 36, leave out `31 (as substituted by section 32' and insert `31A (inserted by section (Rights of audience: employed advocates)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 188 to 190.
<P>
Government new clause 34 Rights of audience: employed advocates.
<P>
Government new clause 36 Barristers employed by solicitors etc.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> This important group of amendments concerns rights of audience for employed lawyers. New clause 34 inserts a new section 31A into the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. The amendments to clauses 33 and 34 are consequential to the insertion of this new clause. New clause 36 concerns the rights of barristers employed in solicitors' firms.
<P>
As I explained in relation to clause 32, the Bill will leave intact the principle that lawyers' rights of audience are governed by the rules and regulations imposed by the authorised bodies which grant those rights. However, there are some rules and regulations which are simply undisguised restrictive practices, such as those which prevent employed barristers and solicitors from appearing in the higher courts, simply because of their status as employees.
<P>
New clause 34 was originally introduced in another place as clause 31 of the Bill. It was I am disappointed to say defeated by those who clearly believe that discrimination against employed layers can be justified. The Government do not believe that the professional bodies should be free to apply such discriminatory rules, and re-inserting this clause will prevent them from doing so. It provides that rules which limit the rights of audience of employed advocates are not binding on them, if those rules do not also apply to their colleagues in private practice.
<P>
The clause will enable Crown prosecutors to prosecute in the Crown court, and all other employed lawyers to appear as advocates in the higher courts even on the most occasional basis provided that they have met the qualification criteria which apply to them. They will remain subject to the rules of conduct and the disciplinary procedures of their professional bodies. Like all other advocates, they will be subject to the duties in clause 37, which are put on a statutory basis for the first time. These are the duty to the court to act with independence in the interests of justice, and the duty to obey rules of conduct. These duties override any other obligation that the employed lawyer may have, including to his employer.
<P>
Although we have discussed these issues in debating clause 32, I shall briefly repeat some of the arguments now. The Government's view is that the current situation in which rules prevent qualified advocates from exercising rights of audience simply because they are employed is entirely unacceptable. At present, we are in the absurd position where an employed barrister, however senior, is unable to exercise rights of audience in the higher courts. Even the Director of Public Prosecutions, a barrister of 30 years' standing, lost his rights of audience on the day that he was appointed.
<P>
Employed solicitors are scarcely in a better position. The rules of the Law Society impose restrictions on those employed solicitors who have obtained the higher courts advocacy qualifications. That does not apply to solicitors in private practice. An employed solicitor advocate can appear only in the higher courts led by a barrister or, theoretically, by a solicitor advocate, in private practice. These restrictions on employed barristers and solicitors are outrageous and cannot be justified. They are the worst kind of restrictive practice they protect the work and incomes of privately practising barristers and offer no shred of benefit to the public. The Government do not believe that the professional bodies should be in a position to impose rules that discriminate against their employed members.
<P>
That does not mean that employed lawyers should not be subject to regulation, but that regulation should be in the public interest. It should not be designed to promote the interest of one small section of the legal profession over those of all other lawyers.
<P>
The Government do not intend that the professional bodies should have to apply the same regulations in every respect to employed advocates as those which they apply to advocates in private practice. Clearly, they should be able to allow for the differences between them. It would not be appropriate, for example, for employed barristers to have to work from chambers, as barristers in private practice have to. Employed advocates should not be prevented by their employed status from exercising their rights of audience. This new clause is designed to stop such abuse.
<P>
The failure to reinsert this clause from the Bill would strike at the heart of the Government's proposals on rights of audience. It would leave in place the restrictions that have been placed, quite unjustifiably, on employed lawyers. The time for such restrictive practices has long gone. They are redolent of an era when solicitors, let alone employed lawyers, were thought to be not quite gentlemen not quite the sort of people who could be trusted to know how things are done, or which knife to use.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Where did the Minister get those arguments from? They are the most extraordinary arguments; I have never heard them advanced before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am reluctant to quote various colleagues who are solicitors, but a number of them made these points to me after our discussions this morning. There has long been hostility towards employed lawyers and, going back still further, hostility from the Bar towards solicitors. I accept that many of those practices have changed in more modern times. The Bill will move us into the 21st century, rather than depending on attitudes and practices that reflect the prejudices of the 19th century.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I do not want to make a meal of it, but if those attitudes do not exist, how can the Government advance arguments based on a false premise?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Some of the attitudes do still exist. They are reflected in the present professional rules that, for example, discriminate against employed lawyers. Those attitudes not only exist, but are embodied in Bar Council rules. They not only have some life, but some effect. That is why we are introducing our proposals.
<P>
New clause 36 will allow a barrister who is employed in a firm of solicitors to provide legal services, including full rights of audience, direct to his employer's clients. My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor said in another place that the Government would table an amendment to that effect. At present, solicitors employed by firms of solicitors are treated by the Law Society's rules as being in private practice. They may therefore offer their services to the public and, if they have the necessary qualifications, exercise full rights of audience.
<P>
In contrast, barristers employed by firms of solicitors are deemed to be non-practising barristers. This means that they may offer limited legal services to members of the public, but they have no rights of audience in any court under the Bar's rules, no matter how well qualified they are, and no matter how many years they may have spent as barristers in private practice.
<P>
The Government believe that such restrictions should no longer be tolerated. A barrister who would have full rights of audience if he were in private practice should have full rights of audience if he works for a solicitor, and he should be able to offer his services as an advocate direct to the public in the same way as a solicitor advocate employed in the same firm.
<P>
We could leave it to barristers who wish to work for solicitors to become solicitors, but I do not see that that would be in the interest of those involved or of the Bar itself. I am aware that some younger members of the Bar already see their future in developing closer working relationships as advocates with particular solicitors' firms and they may welcome the possibility of direct employment. These barristers do not necessarily wish to lose their identity as barristers or to sever their relationships with that branch of the profession.
<P>
Subsection (1) disapplies certain Bar Council rules that impose a prohibition or limitation on the provision of legal services on barristers employed by solicitors. In future, other bodies, such as patent agents or legal executives, may become authorised litigators. In that event, the clause would also apply to barristers employed by other authorised litigators.
<P>
Subsection (2) provides that barristers employed by solicitors can provide legal services directly to the public without the need to receive instructions through a solicitor. That is a limited exception. Other rules that impose the same limitation on the provision of legal services by barristers in private practice will continue to apply, which answers the question that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) asked this morning.
<P>
Barristers employed by solicitors will continue to be regulated by the Bar Council. It will be the responsibility of the Bar Council and the Law Society to ensure that the rules relating to such barristers, such as the disciplinary jurisdiction, do not conflict. I do not believe that that will cause significant difficulties. Legal executives employed by solicitors may be granted rights of audience by the Institute of Legal Executives, but at the same time their principals will be held responsible for their actions under Law Society rules.
<P>
Clause 33 makes provision for barristers employed by the Legal Services Commission to exercise legal services on behalf of the public. It is right that that principle should be extended to barristers employed by solicitors' firms.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I do not want to take too long I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) would like to catch your eye, Mr. O'Brien. It was interesting to listen to the Minister advancing his arguments, especially about Government new clauses 34 and 36. As I said in my intervention, he seemed to do so on the basis of an entirely different experience from that which I have enjoyed. Since being called to the Bar, I have always acted with solicitors as though we were part of a team rather than two opposing members of different armies.
<P>
I do not understand why the Government feel it necessary to introduce the new clauses. I heard the Minister's explanation, and I think that the Government were slightly peeved that one of the new clauses was deleted in the other place.
<P>
I understand that the Government must have their way and get their business through, and all the usual arguments that Governments and loyal Oppositions loyal to the constitution, that is employ on such occasions. However, the only logical point at which such arguments can end is that no distinction should be made between the Bar and the solicitors' profession; there should simply be qualified lawyers, entitled to act as courtroom lawyers or office lawyers, or as practitioners in non-contentious business or in contentious business or both. If the Government are trying to achieve that, I wish that they would have the guts to say so, rather than dancing around with rather specious arguments and bogus new clauses.
<P>
I am an old-fashioned fool, and I daresay that the Minister 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): You said it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Yes, I did say it, and I meant it. I am worried about what the Government are doing to the law. Perhaps the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), smiling away in a deep blue shirt, has touched on a raw nerve. I freely confess that I owe a lot to the Bar and to both sides of the legal profession in doing what I do today.
<P>
I wish that the Government would be slightly clearer in outlining the end game. Do they see the Bill as the full stop, or as but one stop on the route to another terminus yet to be revealed? They have been extremely unclear in unrolling the legal reform programme and, especially, in presenting clause 33 and the new clauses.
<P>
I should like the Minister to put his position firmly on the record, and I anticipate with interest his response. I fully accept that he has not been a practising member of the Bar for many years, and that he may have outdated ideas about what goes on at the bar nowadays. I understand his lack of immediate experience of modern law practice; he has had plenty of other interesting avenues to take, such as being a law lecturer, a Member of the European Parliament and a non-practising barrister who happens to be a Member of Parliament.
<P>
The Minister may be receiving advice only from certain quarters. If he had spent more time discussing matters with practising barristers and solicitors, he might have reached different conclusions, but we shall see. He is entitled to the views that he holds, and I look forward to hearing more from him. In the meantime, I invite members of the Committee to agree with or oppose the Minister's arguments.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): All we heard from the Minister was a stream of invective against one branch of the legal profession. That was neither constructive nor helpful. I accept that there is scope for considerable change in the general operation of the legal profession. In particular, the distinctions between a barrister and a solicitor, and rights of audience are matters that it is legitimate to review.
<P>
The Minister argued that such distinctions are not only archaic but were designed merely I stress the word ``merely'' as a device for operating a closed shop, particularly in favour of the Bar. I disagree. If we consider how different practices have evolved, the Minister's comments were historical nonsense. I do not believe that the system was set up to feather the nests of those at the Bar for more than 500 years. Human nature being what it is, I accept that financial advantages were perceived by those who operated a closed shop which, in respect of advocacy in the higher courts, went in favour of the Bar and the two professions split. No one is entirely clear when that split occurred.
<P>
The Victorians were considerable reformers in many respects and were the first to strike down practices that they considered archaic and were not serving a purpose. Although it went beyond the judiciary, the split has survived because of its perception that considerable advantages were to be gained from having a group of advocates who came from a common professional body to appear before the judiciary in the higher courts. I am talking about the time before county courts came into being. There was a belief and an assurance that, because of the professional standards that were applied, the standard of conduct in front of tribunals and courts would be high.
<P>
Given the whole issue of access to justice and particularly how the Bar, the Law Society, solicitors and barristers are organised, it is sensible to consider how consistently high standards of probity and conduct in advocacy can be maintained, while removing the archaic elements that undoubtedly exist. The Minister said that the restrictions are unjustifiable, and that they must go. They may be undesirable restrictions, but they are capable of justification.
<P>
Let us take the Bar as a separate entity. It is significant and, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough rightly said, we must consider why there is a distinction between employed barristers and those who practise on their own. The answer is simple. The Bar has always consisted of sole practitioners. We are responsible to and for ourselves and in our duty to the court, the client and no one else. It is true that each set of chambers builds up its own ethos that it wants to maintain, so on the whole a successful set of chambers wants to make sure that its members have a high standard of professionalism and conduct. However, at the end of the day, the buck stops with us as individuals, and we deal as individuals with the judiciary and our clients. That has been a powerful force for maintaining professional standards.
<P>
We shall leave solicitors out of the picture for the moment. The argument against allowing employed barristers rights of audience has always been that if we were to be employed as barristers, we would cease to be practising members of the Bar. Although we might have the qualifications of a barrister, we would no more do what the central thrust of being a barrister is all about than I conduct myself as a member of the Bar when I am here as a Member of Parliament; that simply happens to be in the background. If we changed that, we would do well to consider the impact that it will undoubtedly have on the way in which advocacy and the administration of justice operate.
<P>
The Minister made the point that the ethos is rather different for solicitors, and the restrictions have even been historically different. There can be employed solicitor-advocates. I think that it was on Second Reading I was not in Committee this morning to discuss the subject that I said that I am profoundly tranquil about the issue of rights of audience being extended to solicitors in the higher courts. Solicitors can have their own ethos and way of operating, but the Bar is also entitled to its own, otherwise we are logically taken to the question of whether there is any justification at all for the two separate professions. I am willing to discuss that question as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough said, it must be discussed.
<P>
On the basis of the proposals on which we may vote or allow through in a short time, it seems to me that the basic justification for the split in the professions will have disappeared. There remains an important distinction, which is between lawyers who are advocates and lawyers who are not. Unless we start to address that issue, I am concerned that the Bill will prove to be a total mish-mash. I think that it was on Second Reading I lose track of the Bill's passage, which may be because I have been too verbose and have intervened too often that I made the point that we need to focus on what advocacy is about and how we achieve good standards of advocacy, be they from employed or self-employed lawyers. If it is the Government's view that the distinction of self-employed and employed lawyer is of absolutely no account, as the Minister's approach to the matter implies, it is high time that we started to focus on a complete restructuring of the legal profession to reflect that.
<P>
In my view, the only way in which we can sensibly go forward in the long run is to consider some form of fusion that has a distinctive element for advocates. They should come under a distinct professional body, be they solicitor or Bar advocates I think that they will simply be advocates at that stage and a separate code of conduct. We should be thinking of going in that direction. If we do not, in the course of getting rid of what are seen as restrictive practices, we are about to start perpetrating some extraordinary injustices. To pick up on what the Minister said, the rights of direct access do not exist for self-employed barristers except in certain limited cases, and we could not reasonably or realistically have them without completely restructuring of our profession. Without such a change, the support systems, the office accommodation required for secretarial services and the many other aspects of our work would be impossible if there were direct access to the lay client.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> There would also be a consequential and vast increase in the cost of litigation and other legal services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> My hon. and learned Friend pre-empts by seconds what I was about to say. Such a change would result also in a massive increase in the cost of litigation, because the overheads, which are currently extremely low, would start to become a major part of the fee, as they are for solicitors.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Does the hon. Member for Beaconsfield agree that the ability to tap into the Bar's specialist and chancery expertise and, of course, its expertise in advocacy is of enormous importance to the clients of small- and medium-sized firms, whether in rural or urban areas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. That area of business will be threatened and eroded once the proposals start to bite.
<P>
It is difficult to predict what will happen to the Bar. Some barristers welcome the idea of the profession shrinking to 2,000 or 3,000 practising barristers, which I believe is what will happen. That may not be a bad thing; after all, that was the size of the profession before its great expansion in the 1960s on the back of a whole host of changes, including the start of legal aid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The 1970s.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister is probably right; the profession expanded greatly in the 1970s. It may be restricted again to a group of independent experts, but the Bill goes beyond that.
<P>
The Bill will considerably handicap the Bar. The Minister spoke about barristers teaming up with solicitors. That will happen, but there will be considerable pressure for direct access, and we shall see barristers' chambers gradually forming themselves into something that is indistinguishable from a solicitors' firm in order to provide widespread advocacy services. To that extent, the fusion that the Minister desires will come in by the back door. Perhaps that is to be welcomed, but it is extraordinary that we should be making such a dramatic change without thinking the matter through and legislating for the consequences.
<P>
The Bar's standards of advocacy are greatly to the country's credit. Those who have seen the standard of advocacy in non-common law jurisdictions to be found abroad are often appalled at what they have witnessed. The dependence of our courts on what advocates tell them, and of judges being directed on the law by advocates was not acquired overnight. Standards must be maintained.
<P>
Ideally, the Law Society and the Bar Council would set up a royal commission to consider the consequences of those changes. I dare say that the outcome will probably be a fused profession, with a separate and distinct place for advocates, with its own code of conduct and with a professional body common to solicitors and barristers indeed, that distinction is likely to disappear providing the professional conduct regulation that is vital if we are not to throw away something that has served the country well for a long time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Committee has been treated to the authentic voice of Conservatism. We were told not only that we should not make the changes outlined in the Bill, but that we should restore the position to that which pertained long before the 1990 Act, which the Conservative party enacted, and perhaps as far back as 1979. The Government's problem is working out what the Conservative party's view is.
<P>
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough taxed me by saying that I was getting advice only from certain quarters. The Government have little difficulty with what was said to be Conservative party policy, as outlined during the previous sitting by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath Mr. (Mr. Hawkins). He said he supported the principle of employed lawyers having rights of audience. Indeed, he said that that was the Conservative party's position. I think that that was why the hon. and learned Member for Harborough differentiated his personal view from that of the Conservative party. Opposition Members have expressed at least three views, and perhaps the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) will add a fourth. That is causing difficulty in establishing the Opposition's position.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall deal with the largely rhetorical observations that Opposition Members have made. I assume that they do not want to retreat beyond 1990, whatever disasters for the Bar are foretold by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. In my experience, when any major change is promoted by any Government whether Conservative or Labour the reaction of certain members of the Bar is always, ``This is the end of the Bar as we know it.''
<P>
Yet as the hon. Gentleman conceded, the reality is that the number of people practising at the Bar has increased year on year. When I was in practice in the early 1980s, only 4,000 members of the Bar were in practice. I understand that that number has increased to about 9,000. After the enactment of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, many members of the Bar foretold consequences similar to those that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, but the disasters that were expected have simply not happened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am perplexed by the Minister's comments. It seems as though he is on auto-pilot. He said that my comments were archaic and went back to before 1990. I tried to explain the virtues of the old system. If he was listening to what I was saying, he would have understood that, given that the Government were taking this road, I was suggesting a rather more radical approach. Will he address himself to that issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I did not detect an iota of radicalism in anything that the hon. Gentlemen said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> My hon. Friend suggested fusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Although the hon. Member for Beaconsfield talked about fusion, he did not do so positively. He did not say that he would advocate that position and would like it to be developed. It is all very well setting Aunt Sallies to knock down, but it is clear from what he said that he was harking back to the past. He tried to demolish the arguments for change by saying that the Bar had always been made up of sole practitioners. That is the most perfect statement of a Conservative view that one could get. He was saying that that is how things were and how they should always continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister is characteristically approaching this part of the Bill in a blinkered fashion, so he does not take on board the fact that the professional ethos of the Bar will be greatly undermined by employed barristers having rights of audience. If that is the case, it is time to rethink completely the way in which the legal professions operate. Far from fusion being a poor alternative, it may be desirable in those circumstances. That was the point that I was trying to make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Ultimately, that is for the Bar and the Law Society to determine. If they judge that that is an appropriate way forward, nothing in the Bill will prevent it from happening. I can imagine the speech of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield if the Government were to propose such a move; he would rail against government interference in independent legal professions. We have already had a taste of that during our proceedings, so I doubt that I could advocate such a proposal without his attacking me in that way.
<P>
I respect the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. He is a Conservative and he expresses his Conservatism with considerable enthusiasm. Unfortunately, it is not always consistent with the Conservatism of either hon. Members on the Opposition Front Bench or others with a more modern view of the development of the legal profession. We have probably discussed such matters sufficiently to make it clear that Opposition Members have not grasped the point that the existing rules, especially of the Bar but also of the Law Society, do not allow people who have achieved qualifications or appropriate experience to continue to practise as would be expected in almost any other profession. I used the example of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but there are many examples of members of the Bar who have practised successfully in the courts for many years, but the day that they take a position in employment they are deemed to have lost their rights of audience. That cannot be justified. The measures are designed primarily to deal with such unjustifiable restrictive practices.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I have been following the debate with a sense of the battle going on all around me. I am interested in the position of the Minister's colleagues not their personal position but that of their office the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General. Unless I am mistaken, the Solicitor-General, quite rightly, is paid a salary, as is the Attorney-General probably not enough. As they are salaried, are they deemed to be employed? Or are we dealing with a mystery such as that of Members of Parliament? No one knows whether a Member of Parliament is employed, and if he is, by whom. We certainly pay tax under schedule E, and are covered by PAYE, so the argument that we are self-employed is, perhaps, weak. The Law Officers may be in an anomalous position. Are they employed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General would agree with one thing that the hon. Gentleman said. But the position of Law Officers is special, and is governed by the ancient practices of their offices.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> There is another anomaly, with which I hope this reforming Government will deal before they leave office. Apart from being a member of the Government, the Attorney-General is also head of the Bar. I know of no other instance in which an outside interest is represented in the Government almost ex officio. This is a rather long intervention, Mr. O'Brien, but I am sure that you will agree that it is quite interesting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> It is also a long way from the matter that we are supposed to be discussing. Therefore, I shall not be tempted down that route.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I have finished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Would that were true.
<P>
The Minister prayed in aid the example of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I remember that Dame Barbara Mills complained that, having left the Bar to become an employee of the Government, and a civil servant, she lost her right of audience. However, that cannot have come as a surprise to her, as she must have read the job specification in the advertisement. No doubt from her experience as a noted practitioner at the criminal Bar in private practice, she will have noticed the difference between the Director of Public Prosecutions and herself, as will Mr. David Calvert-Smith again, a noted private practitioner at the Bar prior to becoming an employee of the state. I dare say that he entered the Attorney-General's office and asked to be the Director of Public Prosecutions with his eyes wide open. I have met him since indeed, I had met him before and he did not strike me as especially incapable of understanding an advertisement.
<P>
In the light of the Minister's remarks, is it the Government's policy that barristers should be able in future to become corporate bodies, either as limited companies or as firms? That must be the logical extension of his arguments about the distinctions made between a solicitor and a barrister and an employed lawyer, be he a barrister or a solicitor, For the benefit of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas), when I say ``he'', I also mean ``she''. Is it the Government's policy that slowly, if secretly, the individual, self-employed aspect of a barrister and the inability to fee share indeed, the unlawfulness of fee sharing will be eroded?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman has drifted a long way from the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I am not aware of the director ever having complained about that loss of rights of audience. He knew of the consequences when he applied for and secured the position. I am complaining on his behalf and on behalf of the many experienced members of the Bar who lose their rights of audience if they take employment. Under the Bar's present rules, if significant public servants, such as the DPP or crown prosecutors take a position, society will lose the benefit of their considerable experience. I emphasise that those are the rules of the Bar, and they cannot be justified in the public interest.
<P>
The hon. and learned Gentleman alluded to financial arrangements. I understand that that, too, is a matter for the Bar. I am not aware of any legal objection to the arrangements that he set out, other than the rules that the Bar prescribes for its members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> There seem to be some matters that are matters for the Bar, which the Government interfere in, and some matters that the Bar has to deal with itself. How does the Minister distinguish between the two?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman is right. He recognises the essence of what the Government are doing; indeed, I consider it to be the essence of Government responsibility. The Government are responsible for protecting the public interest. We will interfere in the rules of those professions if we judge that those professions are establishing rules that are not in the public interest. That, if the hon. and learned Gentleman wishes it, is a reasonable test to distinguish between those things that are a matter for the professions and those that are a matter for Government.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 193 and 194.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 33 would invalidate a rule of conduct that would prevent an employee of the Legal Services Commission from exercising a right of audience or right to conduct litigation on behalf of members of the public on account of his or her employed status. It removes those rules that might prevent an employed lawyer in the Legal Services Commission from undertaking professional work.
<P>
The amendments seek to amend the clause in two important ways. Amendment No. 192 extends clause 33 to cover employees not only of the commission but of any body ``established and maintained'' by the commission under its powers in clauses 7(3)(d), 14(2)(d) and 15(3)(d). Amendment No. 194 would enable barristers employed by the commission or bodies established and maintained by the commission to provide services direct to the public without the need to receive instructions through a solicitor. Amendment No. 193 is a minor drafting change to clarify the clause.
<P>
We have already discussed amendment No. 31 to clause 16, which extended the commission's code of conduct to employees established and maintained by the commission. The same principle applies here. At present, clause 33 covers only lawyers employed directly by the commission, and not lawyers employed by the not-for-profit bodies established and maintained by the commission as part of the Community Legal Service or the Criminal Defence Service.
<P>
The pilot schemes for the provision of services by salaried defenders are likely to assess various organisational structures for providing those legal services. One method would be direct employment, which is already covered by clause 33. Another would be to establish bodies in the not-for-profit sector, making grants to those bodies to employ lawyers as part of the Criminal Defence Service. It would be absurd if clause 33 did not apply in such situations.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 152, in page 73, line 4, leave out from beginning to end of line 5 on page 75.
<P>
The schedule is included in my Christmas tree and coathanger complaint. It is a long schedule and the amendment would delete part III hon. Members will no doubt have read it with care which extends from the top of page 73 to a few lines down page 75 of the Bill. As I said on Second Reading in the House, I agree with all that my hon. and learned Friend Lord Mayhew of Twysden, the former Attorney-General, said in his forthright attack on the schedule in the other place. For those who are interested, my views are as set out in that debate.
<P>
The part of the schedule that we seek to delete constitutes an unusual, unnecessary and dangerous interference by the Executive in the conduct of the courts and those who appear before them, and in the constitutional right of the judiciary to control its proceedings. I accept that the Lord Chancellor, as a Minister of the Crown and head of the judiciary, has a perfectly proper interest in the way in which our courts are administered and controlled, and in the way in which those who appear in the courts conduct themselves. However, I am not convinced by the arguments advanced against Lord Mayhew; indeed, I am dismayed by them.
<P>
I put my hands up and admit that I am an old fool who belongs to the school of parliamentarians who believe that Ministers of the Crown should not interfere in the nitty-gritty of our courts. I daresay that I am out of date and that I shall be swept away with the great tidal wave of New Labour, with its bright new dawn and so on [Interruption.] Yes, I hear all the tricoteuses at the bottom of the guillotine; let them knit away. For what it is worth, I make that final squeak on behalf of what is good in our country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): Is this a speech from the scaffold?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> It may well be but if it is, it is a far, far better thing that I do.
<P>
I joke because I have to laugh at the way in which I am utterly powerless to convince the Committee, the Government and those who support them but who may not have considered the Bill that the arguments that lie behind the majority support of the schedule and the way in which the Government seek to reform our legal processes are not valid. I understand that I am powerless to move the Government. I accept that, and I salute the Minister for the power that he has; that is how democracy works. I lost the previous election in terms of party politics and I now have to content myself with watching convoys of legislation go past my window. All I can do is wave my white handkerchief at them. It is my duty as a member of the Opposition to do my best to point out to the Committee the defects of the Bill and, if that causes amusement to Labour Members, I am prepared to be laughed at. There are some serious points to be made.
<P>
I wish to draw to the Committee's attention what I said on Second Reading about the schedule, a point that I took from a speech made by Mr. Sydney Kentridge QC, a distinguished member of the Bar of England and Wales, and of South Africa. It may be of interest to those Labour Members who did not attend our debates on Second Reading or who did not read the report of the speech made in the other place by my noble and learned Friend, Lord Mayhew.
<P>
Mr. Kentridge said that, when the apartheid Government of South Africa tried to impose their will and governmental control on the conduct of the South African courts, the judiciary, many members of the then Government party in South Africa the Nationalist party, I think and both the provincial and federal Bars South Africa pointed out that, irrespective of their political opinions, it was wholly improper for a Government to seek to attach Executive control over the courts.
<P>
As Lord Mayhew said, Executive control over the courts as exemplified by schedule 5, particularly by the provision that we want to delete, is something of which we must be wary. I invite the Committee to consider carefully what it is passing into law. As I said, I can work out the arithmetic of the Room as easily as anyone else, but thoughtless legislation is not any better merely because a majority of 10 or 15 members of the Committee do not want to remove a defective part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have said before that the office of Lord Chancellor is a stark contradiction to the doctrine of separation of powers. Indeed, the Lord Chancellor straddles all three pillars of our constitution: the Executive, the legislature and the judiciary. I cannot understand why the Government, under schedule 5, seek to add further to the vast array of powers enjoyed by the Lord Chancellor. He chairs several Cabinet Committees; he promotes Government legislation in the House of Lords and is the senior judge in the land.
<P>
A brake should be put on the Lord Chancellor's powers, especially in connection with the legal profession and its independence. An independent legal profession is one of the bulwarks of a free society and the Government should not arrogate to themselves or to their Lord Chancellor carte blanche the power, first, to determine who and which organisations should enjoy rights of audience and, secondly, to regulate the legal professions, their rules and their rights, and any alterations to those regulations and rules.
<P>
I appreciate that the Lord Chancellor has to consult under the schedule. He can choose whether to select the consultative panel and the Director General of Fair Trading, and he must consult the four designated judges. No changes should be made as provided for under schedule 5 without the Lord Chancellor being able to carry at least two of the four designated judges with him. That change would ensure that the Lord Chancellor, who is an appointed and not an elected politician with the ephemeral priorities that bedevil our trade, would at least have to carry with him two representatives of the independent legal profession.
<P>
I believe that it is of great importance that the legal profession retains at least some of its independence, which has served out constitution and fellow citizens by and large well over the years.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am a defender of the office of Lord Chancellor. That is not to say that I support any given Lord Chancellor doing whatever he wants to. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough said to me not long ago, some Lord Chancellors discharge the office much better than others, which is a subliminal part of what we have said.
<P>
Perhaps for the first time, I part company slightly with the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett). It is one of the great mistakes of trying to interpret the English constitutional position to see some great virtue in the separation of powers. There is a virtue in the independence of the judiciary, but the fascinating mistakes of the 18th century was the analysis of England that said that it was stable because it practised the separation of powers. It did not, but it was an elegant solution that informed the American constitution almost completely. That is partly why, in my respectful submission, the Americans have no control over public expenditure whatever but have the miracle of continually accruing resources.
<P>
The Lord Chancellor's position is special, unusual and a defiance of the separation of powers. I do not believe that the separation of powers is worth fighting for. The Minister and the Solicitor-General are both significant members of the legislature and the Executive. Their positions are therefore anomalous to separation of powers, which is not present in them.
<P>
I think that we make a mistake in chasing the virtue of separation of powers, as it is an enormous virtue not to have it. This Executive would have no chance of being effective unless they had a stranglehold on the legislature. They have a massive majority in the House of Commons, which is pretty effectively whipped. There are worse ways to express that, such as saying that it is pretty effectively controlled.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I invite the hon. Gentleman to speak to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I was beginning to realise that there must be some purpose in my having got to my feet.
<P>
I personally support the Conservative position on the matter and am hostile to the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I shall be brief on the matter. I was struck by the juxtaposition of the clause and what the Minister said a short time ago about when the Government consider that they could be justified in interfering in a specific profession's rules of conduct. He made a fair point when he said that restrictive practices had been looked at and that Parliament was entitled to do so and rule that certain professional practices should be struck down. That is of course what we have recently done in respect of the relation between the rights of audience of employed and self-employed barristers.
<P>
Having said that, and having stressed therefore that it would otherwise be left to the professions to regulate themselves, we move on almost immediately to the powers that the Lord Chancellor has chosen to give himself that will enable future changes to be brought about without reference to Parliament at all. That gives me even greater cause for concern and casts doubt in my mind as to the ability of the Minister although I always believe in his sincerity properly to reflect some of the underlying trends in the Government's legislation. The schedule will give enormous powers to the Lord Chancellor to carry through a further programme of reform without an opportunity for debate. That is undesirable and it undermines my confidence in what the Minister said earlier
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General </B>(Mr. Ross Cranston): I shall try to meet the argument that has been advanced. Sydney Kentridge, the doyen of the commercial Bar, raised the point as have other eminent judges and commentators. The arguments in response are conclusive. I shall first address the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. Part III of the schedule is limited in its effect. It relates only to those rules and regulations that unduly restrict a right of audience, a right to conduct litigation or the exercise of a right. In other words, it is focused and not a general power to alter all the rules of the Bar.
<P>
The power can be exercised only after extensive consultation. Clause 31 sets out the constitution of the consultative council. As for the point raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, the change is then subject to approval by both Houses of Parliament. There must be parliamentary approval; there is no possibility of a maverick Lord Chancellor in the future suddenly taking it into his or her head to rewrite the rules of the legal profession and being subject to no control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Admittedly, the Bill is large. However, it has been discussed on Second Reading, and we have spent several days considering it in Committee. What is being proposed is a three-hour debate.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to lend force to the modernisation of Parliament, we shall welcome it.
<P>
I referred to the three aspects of the schedule: it is limited in terms of its ambit, it is subject to extensive consultation and then subject to approval under the affirmative procedure. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough began his attack by invoking a constitutional position. His argument was that it was wrong for the Executive and for the legislature to have the power to change the rules of the legal profession.
<P>
The argument that Parliament and the Executive have never intervened in rights of audience is wrong. It was the Conservative Government who, in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, legislated on that subject. Since that Act, all rights of audience, including those of the Bar, have been placed on a statutory basis. Barristers do not exercise rights of audience that are derived from the judiciary. They exercise statutory rights, which have been granted to them by the Bar Council the body authorised to do so by that Conservative legislation. The Act also constitutes a statutory procedure for approving changes in those rights.
<P>
It is untrue that rights of audience have historically been the exclusive preserve of the judiciary. The Trials for Felony Act 1836, the Courts Act 1971, the County Courts Act 1984 and others demonstrate that Parliament has had its say in such matters. My right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor gave examples in which the Executive had intervened to influence the rights of audience. In 1574, the Privy Council issued instructions to the Inns of Court on various matters, including rights of audience. So the historic evidence refutes the constitutional argument advanced by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough.
<P>
Let me put the positive case. We have proposed the new power for two reasons. First, the existing power can be used only to strike down rules, not to replace them. The Government believe that lawyers should be subject to rules and regulations in the public interest and that it would not be appropriate to remove rules merely to leave an unregulated vacuum.
<P>
Secondly, the existing power relates only to rules that have not been approved under the procedures in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. It does not allow the Lord Chancellor to revisit rules that have been approved, but which have proved to be unacceptably restrictive in practice or which have become outmoded. The proposed new power will have the advantage of much greater scrutiny over the Lord Chancellor's actions. He will no longer be able to strike down or alter any rule unless Parliament gives its approval.
<P>
The Government have good relations with the legal profession, and I am confident that that will continue. As the hon. Member for Solihull mentioned, the Attorney-General is the leader of the Bar. Both he and I participate regularly in Bar Council activities. Most of the Bar has accepted, perhaps with reluctance, that rights of audience in the higher courts will be extended to Crown prosecutors, other employed lawyers and solicitors, provided that they meet the necessary requirements. We look forward to the Bar making proposals to grant rights to conduct litigation to employed barristers.
<P>
As has become apparent, the 1990 Act has failed in its intention. Many of the Bill's provisions are designed to make good the intention of that Act, and the call-in power is an essential part of that design.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon raised a more general issue and, in a way, anticipated the debate on the schedule as a whole. Two of the four judges that he mentioned the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls spoke in favour of the change in the other place. The fact that two judges, plus the Lord Chancellor, did so is a conclusive argument for change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am sure that the Solicitor-General would not wish to mislead the Committee, but the Lord Chancellor, the Master of the Rolls and the Lord Chief Justice were the only judicial figures to speak in favour of the proposal. The other Law Lords, all of whom I have met and all of whom were retired, did not speak in favour of it. The Solicitor-General would be the first to admit that, if he has read the record.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> It is certainly the case that some retired Law Lords one in particular speak extensively in the other place and sometimes with good reason, but the fact is that the two leading judges, the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls, support the change. That refutes the argument of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, in addition to the points made by the hon. Member for Solihull, who spoke about the Lord Chancellor's constitutional position.
<P>
I need not detain the Committee any longer. The schedule contains various other provisions that we have not considered in detail, but I am sure that all hon. Members have studied it carefully, and I know that my hon. Friends sitting behind me support it 100 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I cannot say that I am hugely enamoured of the Solicitor-General's response to our arguments, nor was I greatly enthused by how the Minister of State opened the debate. There is a certain crudity about the way in which the Government are steam-rolling through these matters. All that I can do is lie under the roller and become flat. In the spirit of reality if nothing else I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The purpose of this clause is to end the statutory monopoly held by the Incorporated Company of Scriveners of London over notarial work in the central London area. It provides that a notary may practise in the City of London or within three miles of its boundaries, whether or not he is a member of the Scriveners' company. Schedule 11 repeals references to the monopoly in statute accordingly.
<P>
I shall explain some of the background to this, as it may be that not everyone is completely familiar with the intricacies of the notarial profession. Notaries authenticate certain legal documents, mainly for use abroad, by signing and sealing them. They may also prepare legal documents for use abroad, undertake conveyancing and probate work, translate foreign legal documents, administer oaths and take affidavits. However, all notaries who wish to offer notarial services in the City of London or within three miles of its boundaries, must, under the current legislation, belong to the incorporated company, which is a livery company of the City of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I do not understand why that litany of services that the Minister has just read out cannot be provided by commissioners for oaths. I think that that should happen, as the fees would come in quite handy. I hasten to say that I am still a commissioner for oaths.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that that is what we are trying to achieve, or at least something similar. Members of the Scriveners company are subject to certain training requirements, as opposed to more general notaries, who are mostly solicitors. I understand that there are currently 28 Scrivener notaries practising in the City who are the beneficiaries of this monopoly. There are about 1,000 non-Scrivener general notaries who are only permitted to practise outside the specified area. This is a further example of a restrictive practice of a monopoly that cannot be justified in a modern era. The clause will allow greater competition and will eliminate that monopoly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I do not wish to do anything to clause 39, save to put the Minister on notice that on Report, I anticipate that some noise may be made by those speaking on behalf of the Scriveners company. I do not support their arguments, but none the less, it is fair that I should warn the Minister that my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) will raise the concerns of his constituents who are members of the Incorporated Company of Scriveners of London. I do not want the Committee to think that all Members of Parliament agree with what the Minister has said, even though I agree with him on this point.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 39 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 40</center></H4>
<H4><center>PERMISSION TO APPEAL</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> We are now dealing with part IV of the Bill. The clause allows for rules of court to provide that any right of appeal to a county court, the High Court or civil division of the Court of Appeal may be exercised only with permission. That was one of the conclusions reached by the review team, chaired by Sir Jeffery Bowman, which examined the workings of the civil division of the Court of Appeal. Current rules, made under section 18(1A) of the Supreme Court Act 1981, already provide for permission to be required for most appeals to the Court of Appeal. That section is repealed by schedule 12. The rule-making power is reintroduced in this clause, and extended to allow for permission also to be required in appeals coming before the county courts and High Court.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 40 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
