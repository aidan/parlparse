duty of local authority to secure sufficient

Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): I beg to move
amendment No. 10, in clause 10, page 9,
line 10, after &#145;of&#146;, insert
&#145;appropriate&#146;.</div><a name="08062675000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall take my jacket off while introducing my amendment, Mr.
Williams. I welcome you to the Committee&#151;your liberal strictures
are greatly welcome. We made quite a lot of progress on Tuesday, some
of which you witnessed in preparation for today.</div>
<a name="08062675000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now come
to clause 10 and a small probing amendment in my name and those of my
hon. Friends. The Government inserted clause 10 in Committee in the
Lords to place a duty on local authorities</div>
<a name="08062675000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to take steps
that secure, so far as reasonably
practicable,&#148;</div><a name="08062675000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">accommodation
that meets children&#146;s needs within the local authority area. We
have debated at length the desirability of children in the care system
staying as close as possible to their home environment, friends and
family.</div>
<a name="08062675000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before the
hon. Member for Stafford jumps up, let me say that my party very much
welcomes the clause, which is good and positive. However, we would like
to add to it a requirement that the accommodation be
&#147;appropriate&#148;. We go back to the principle behind the
phrase &#147;have regard to&#148;. It is slightly woolly to ask
local authorities, with all the pressures that they face, merely to
fulfil a minimum requirement to</div>
<a name="08062675000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have regard to
the benefit of having...a number of accommodation
providers&#148;.</div><a name="08062675000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary might say that everything will be covered in
regulations, and it would be good to have that clarity, but we do not
have the regulations before us, so we can only speculate as to their
contents. It would therefore be helpful to add
&#147;appropriate&#148; to new section 22G(4) of the Children Act
1989, which is inserted by the clause.</div>
<a name="08062675000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
discussed, continuity and stability of accommodation are important to a
child from a traumatic background. If a local authority merely has
regard to the benefits of making sure that there are a number of bed
and breakfasts available in its area, that will not provide the
stability and quality of accommodation that many of these young people
need, particularly if they have special needs. A case has been made
that children with acute and complex needs require the most appropriate
care placements, but the wording of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>clause does not suggest that local authorities need to&#151;although
obviously they would like to&#151;go beyond simply ensuring that
accommodation providers are available in their
area.</div><a name="08062675000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062675000196"></a><b class="B">Helen
Southworth</b> (Warrington, South) (Lab): Will my right hon.
Friend&#151;sorry, the hon. Gentleman, although he is always a
friend&#151;give
way?</div><a name="08062675000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000197"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I
will.</div><a name="08062675000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000198"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> Calling the hon. Gentleman my hon. Friend
demonstrates that I have a lot of sympathy for his argument, but I
would draw his attention to subsection (2)(b), which I was extremely
pleased to see included, because it uses the
words</div><a name="08062675000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;meets
the needs of those
children.&#148;</div><a name="08062675000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that he will press the Minister on what that means and what local
authorities need to do to fulfil that duty.</div>
<a name="08062675000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000199"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The hon. and very friendly Lady makes an
appropriate point. It is useful to debate a probing amendment to the
clause to tease out exactly what the Government mean, because the
phrase</div><a name="08062675000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;meets
the needs of those
children&#148;</div><a name="08062675000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">can
be taken in different ways. Accommodation that meets children&#146;s
need to have a basic roof over their head might not meet their need to
have accommodation appropriate to their disabilities, for example.
Alternatively, children might have a mental health problem or learning
disability that would be sensitive to the people accommodated around
them, whether inside or outside the care system where they are placed.
There is a need to meet not only their need for basic accommodation,
but their needs relating to how they are to live in that accommodation
and with the people around
them.</div><a name="08062675000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should appreciate the Minister&#146;s interpretation of how local
authorities will be required to do more than just have regard to the
existence of sufficient accommodation, but will have to make sure, as
far as is practicable, that the accommodation is appropriate for the
young person&#151;that it meets their needs and is appropriate to
them in terms of the environment where they are expected to live, both
physically and mentally, and in terms of the people around
them.</div><a name="08062675000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000200"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Kevin Brennan):</b> Diolch yn fawr&#151;thank
you&#151;Mr. Williams. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Despite the
sighing of the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham&#151;perhaps I could call him my hon. Friend, if not my
right hon. Friend, which would be out of order&#151;it is a pleasure
to see you in the Chair this
morning.</div><a name="08062675000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government inserted the clause in the other place to place on local
authorities a general duty to take steps to secure, as far as is
reasonably practicable, sufficient accommodation in their area that
meets the needs of the children they look after. In doing that, they
must have regard to the benefit of having a number of accommodation
providers in their area sufficient to enable them to perform their
duty. That means that local authorities will have to be able to justify
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>decisions that they make to provide the sufficient accommodation without
commissioning any from third
parties.</div><a name="08062675000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the sentiments outlined by the hon. Member for East Worthing
and Shoreham, which inform the amendment, but the amendment is
unnecessary, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington,
South hinted, the clause already makes it clear that any accommodation
provided for looked-after children must be capable of meeting their
various needs, and must by implication be, in the words of the
amendment, &#147;appropriate&#148;.</div>
<a name="08062675000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the
existing regulatory framework sets clear requirements for accommodation
if it is to be considered appropriate for looked-after children. All
children&#146;s homes and fostering services must be registered under
the Care Standards Act 2000. They must comply with regulations and meet
the national minimum standards. All children&#146;s homes are
inspected against those national minimum standards by Her
Majesty&#146; chief inspector of education, children&#146;s
services and skills.</div>
<a name="08062675000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fostering
services are responsible for approving individual foster carers and
ensuring that they provide an appropriate environment. Standard 6 of
the fostering services national minimum standards requires fostering
services to make
available</div><a name="08062675000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;foster
carers who provide a safe, healthy and nurturing
environment.&#148;</div><a name="08062675000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
robust system is already provided in that way to ensure that all
accommodation for looked-after children is of an appropriate
standard.</div><a name="08062675000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about specialist need, we recognise
that it will not always be reasonably practicable for every local
authority to make provision in its area to meet every type of potential
need; but for those particularly complex needs that require highly
specialised care, we would expect local authorities to work together to
commission the necessary provision on a regional or sub-regional basis.
We have been supporting such collaboration through regional
commissioning pilots. I am sure that later in our consideration of the
Bill we shall discuss some of those complex needs and placements of
children.</div><a name="08062675000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is, however, important to note that we are not saying that we believe
that complex needs cannot be met by placements in area. Indeed, in the
development of the short break pathfinders, there are several good
examples of innovative solutions to problems of providing
accommodation, albeit on a short-term basis, for children with complex
needs. We expect the learning from commissioning and developing those
to be shared and disseminated to help local authorities to develop
provision for all children, including those with complex needs, within
their areas, so that more children can stay in their area, if it is
appropriate. We are setting up a programme of peer support for local
authorities and children&#146;s trust partners so that they can learn
from each other about effective commissioning practices. I understand
that this is a probing
amendment.</div><a name="08062675000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062675000201"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams. I want to
ask one question before the Minister sits down. It relates not to
severe disability needs, but to those authorities that place large
numbers of children outside the authority because of a lack of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>places. Will there be a time scale by which authorities will be judged
on providing accommodation within their boundaries for young people who
do not have complex disability
needs?</div><a name="08062675000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000202"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> When the Bill comes into force, the sufficiency
duty in the clause will come into effect. We will expect all local
authorities, as far as is reasonably practicable, to be able to meet
all the needs of looked-after children in their area. As I outlined, we
understand that in some cases it may not be possible to meet all the
complex needs of looked-after children within area; in such cases we
will expect local authorities to work on a regional or sub-regional
basis to meet those needs, and we have been piloting such arrangements.
As for the time scale, local authorities should be doing that when the
Bill comes into
force.</div><a name="08062675000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062675000203"></a><b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): Bore da, Mr.
Williams. The Minister has referred to co-operation between local
authorities. From time to time in London authorities and perhaps
elsewhere in the country, young people leaving care are given council
tenancies in another local authority area without the knowledge of that
local authority. Such young people may not have the social or life
skills to sustain an independent home successfully, and often they get
into trouble with the police. It would be helpful if the local
authority and perhaps the police in the area that they moved to were
informed, so that problems could be headed off, rather than dealt with
reactively after they
arise.</div><a name="08062675000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000204"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I commend the hon. Lady on her able demonstration
of the language of heaven. She makes a very good point. When good
practice is followed, the scenario that she describes should not arise.
Some of the Bill, along with the broader &#147;Care Matters&#148;
implementation agenda, is about trying to effect the sort of change in
practice on the ground that she wants, but that cannot be achieved
entirely through statute. There is good practice around the country in
dealing with people who want to live independently at a young age. We
are trying to limit young people doing so further by giving them other
options through the Bill and the &#147;Care Matters&#148;
agenda.</div><a name="08062675000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
local authorities are using innovative practices to avoid the situation
described by the hon. Lady. I saw a very good example in south
Gloucester, where a trainer flat is used when a young person is
considering moving out into the community. They are given a short
three-week tenancy in a flat owned by the local authority to try out
living on their own. To be frank, some young people then realise the
difficulties of paying bills, having to live with neighbours and the
sheer loneliness of having to cope alone. Some accept wiser counsel and
decide it is right to stay with their foster carers or wherever they
have been living, just as many young people in other families would do.
The average age of young people leaving home is 24, not 16, 18 or 21.
That is the sort of good practice that we want to
encourage.</div><a name="08062675000171"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="08062675000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the clause, our aim is to ensure that young people are not placed a
long way from their support mechanisms, friends and peers, and normal
educational establishment, and that there is a lever to put pressure on
local authorities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>to provide appropriate accommodation within area wherever practically
possible, as the amendment emphasises. On that basis, I ask that the
amendment be withdrawn

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000205"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
explanation and also delighted to welcome my hon. Friend the Member for
Upminster, who has also made a mark with her expertise on the subject.
She might want to elaborate on her point when we debate new clause 19,
which we are about to do, as it is also germane to that
proposal.</div><a name="08062675000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has helpfully given reasons why he thinks the amendment
unnecessary, but perhaps it might find its way into the welfare
checklist that the Minister for Children, Young People and Families
graciously suggested might form the basis of the guidance that will be
issued with the Bill to elaborate on what is meant by
&#147;appropriate accommodation&#148;.</div>
<a name="08062675000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is one
point on which we do not want to be too constrictive, and it applies
particularly to London and large metropolitan boroughs. There is
clearly a strong practical case for keeping children close to their
home environment in large rural counties, but there might be a case for
transgressing the borders of London boroughs simply because of the lack
of specialist accommodation available. A number of London boroughs have
no children&#146;s homes of their own, so rather than specifying
rigidly that accommodation must be within a borough&#146;s physical
boundaries, it would be sensible to have the capacity for joint
commissioning across London boroughs to provide a specialist
accommodation provider or to commission from a private, independent
specialist provider. I am sure that the Minister does not intend the
Bill to be so constraining, but it is important to keep the child
closer to the home and a familiar environment wherever
possible.</div><a name="08062675000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister gave examples of step-down accommodation and trainer flats,
and further examples of that flexible good practice should be greatly
encouraged. As with the Childcare Act 2006, which the Minister for
Children, Young People and Families and I debated in Committee, it is
the local authority&#146;s duty to ensure that there are sufficient
suitable child care places in its area. Quality is also a factor, as
the local authority must ensure that child care places are of
sufficient quality, just as it must do with regard to the quality of
appropriate accommodation in this
context.</div><a name="08062675000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has given helpful clarification and, on that basis, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08062675000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="08062675000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000206"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss new
clause 19&#151;<i class="I">Appropriate
placement</i><i class="I">&#151;</i></div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;When
deciding the appropriate placement for a child in a children&#146;s
home the local authority must have regard to the proximity of other
similar
premises.&#146;.</div><a name="08062675000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000207"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I shall kick off the debate by speaking to new
clause 19 and then we can have a stand part debate. The hon. Member for
Stafford will probably pick me up on a few things, as is his
wont.</div>
<a name="08062675000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The theory
behind new clause 19 is born of practical experience, and my hon.
Friend the Member for Upminster will be aware of similar things. A few
years ago, I was approached by the local police and councillors in my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>constituency of East Worthing and Shoreham because there had been what
has been described as an explosion in the provision of independent
children&#146;s homes. We are not unique, as that typically happens
in seaside resorts around the country. Hon. Friends representing areas
such as Thanet and Fylde, as well as coastal towns in Kent at the end
of railway lines, have seen an enormous influx of children from the
care system, who have  been placed there by
boroughs&#151;particularly London boroughs&#151;because they do not
have sufficient
accommodation.</div><a name="08062675000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Typically,
there tends to be some cheap accommodation available in those towns
and, as has happened in Worthing, an independent provider will take
over a residential house. If such a house has six or fewer residents in
it, it does not require planning permission for change of use. So, we
are seeing a big increase in the number of small independent
children&#146;s homes in places such as Worthing, Thanet and Fylde.
If the place is suitable for the children and there are no knock-on
effects of what I call clustering, that increase need not be a bad
thing. In my constituency, however, unsuitability and clustering have
had a negative
effect.</div><a name="08062675000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
visited a children&#146;s home, just outside Worthing, in an old
farmhouse, which the estate had rented out to an independent
children&#146;s home company. It was looking after children from
Somerset and London, and I think there was somebody from Newcastle.
Children, most of them from an urban environment, were bunged down into
a remote farmhouse in the middle of the Sussex countryside. A bunch of
farmers came to see me to say that there had been a spate of crime and
vandalism in the area, which was being attributed to some of the
children from the home. When I visited the home it had been smashed up;
there were lots of boarded-up windows and farm equipment had been
damaged. At that time&#151;things have since greatly improved, and
the Commission for Social Care Inspection and others have
inspected&#151;the place was not properly monitored, and there was a
serious question mark over the qualifications and calibre of some of
the staff put in to deal with those children with particular
difficulties. The children wanted an urban environment and found
themselves stuck out in the country with no bus service. More sensitive
placement consideration might have avoided that
problem.</div><a name="08062675000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
following year, the chief inspector of police in Worthing approached me
to say that 27 per cent. of crimes in the previous month had been
attributed to a handful of young people who resided in
children&#146;s homes in Worthing. I do not in any way want to tar
all children in care with the propensity to get into
trouble&#151;that is clearly not the case&#151;but where they are
not properly looked after there is greater propensity for them to get
into trouble and fall foul of the
law.</div><a name="08062675000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
lot of children&#146;s homes of six or fewer children were springing
up close to each other in residential areas, and there was a lot of
mixing between the children in those homes, which was causing a
problem. Again, it is down to ensuring that placements are appropriate
and that the placed child is properly monitored by the social worker
responsible within the placing authority. We shall come to some
amendments on that. It is also down to ensuring that the homes are run
properly, and that depends on inspection and quality of
care.</div><a name="08062675000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Worthing, there was an enormous backlash from local councillors and
residents, who got up petitions and demonstrated against yet more such
homes appearing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>in our town, particularly in a limited residential area. That produced
an unfortunate backlash against children in the care system, who were
perceived as having been dumped in Worthing and not properly looked
after.</div><a name="08062675000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Upminster mentioned placing authorities. I
think that I mentioned on Tuesday that the head of children&#146;s
services in West Sussex says that 42 children from West Sussex have
been placed in the care system outside the county, most in specialist
placements. However, she estimates that we have at least 700 children
from outside West Sussex in the county. The authority should be
notified of such placements, but often it is not. We have tabled
amendments to tighten up that
procedure.</div><a name="08062675000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
delegation from Worthing went to see the then Minister, Lord Warner,
about issuing stronger guidance to ensure that placing authorities
properly notified the receiving authority that they had a child
residing in their area who was the responsibility of another authority.
That is clearly still not happening, because authorities can only
estimate the number of such children, let alone know of any particular
requirements and needs that they might
have.</div><a name="08062675000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 19 would provide that an authority, when placing a child in a
residential home, could not just say, &#147;Here&#146;s a
place.&#148; It would have to have some regard to&#151;the language
could be even tougher&#151;the fact that that home might be in an
area where there were lots of other homes, and that that clustering
might have a negative effect. A placing authority would have to have a
proper discussion with the host authority, and the authority or council
area could say, &#147;Look, this is excessive for that particular
area.&#148;</div><a name="08062675000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the moment, things are completely un-joined up. In places such as
Thanet, Worthing and Fylde&#151;and in many other local authorities
around the country, I am sure&#151;that is a problem. It is not in
the best interests of the local communities to have to pick up the
problems, or of the local police, who must deal with problems if they
become a justice matter, or of the local social services, which must
pick up the problems even though they are not responsible. Most
importantly, it is not fair to the children and young people
themselves, who are often placed in inappropriate accommodation far
away from home but in proximity to other people in similar
accommodation with whom it is not appropriate for them to mix in
certain
circumstances.</div><a name="08062675000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062675000208"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): The new clause might have
the opposite effect. Has the hon. Gentleman not considered the fact
that the language he has used might say, in the minds of some,
&#147;Actually, it&#146;s a good idea to have them all in the same
area; it keeps them all together.&#148;? It might have the wrong
result.</div><a name="08062675000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000209"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> That is an interesting observation from the hon.
Gentleman. That is certainly not the intention, and this discussion
will send out a strong signal that it is not. All practical experience
of such authorities shows that that is the last thing they want. They
want a message that they have some power or leverage to say,
&#147;Hold on, we don&#146;t think that&#146;s appropriate
here.&#148;</div><a name="08062675000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the moment, authorities cannot reject a home for six or fewer people on
planning grounds unless there is some enormous change within the home.
In terms of change of use, an application for planning permission is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>not required&#151;people can just get on with it within the strictures
of the inspection regime. I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
technically, but from our deliberations the opposite must be
true.</div><a name="08062675000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not like using the terminology &#147;have regard to&#148;, but
as the Minister is always reassuring us that it is perfectly adequate,
perhaps he will be more amenable, considering the wording of the new
clause, to placing it in the Bill so that local authorities have some
clout in resisting what has turned out to be a major problem for
Worthing and other
authorities.</div><a name="08062675000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062675000210"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): It is a great pleasure to
serve on a Committee chaired by you, Mr. Williams. In plain
English, I like your knowledgeable yet relaxed style of chairing
proceedings.</div><a name="08062675000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham was absolutely right when he
said at the beginning of today&#146;s proceedings that, in relation
to clause 10, the Government yet again deserve great credit for an
excellent piece of new law. I give them a gold badge for that one,
because accommodation is a key area of concern to everybody with an
interest in the welfare of children in the care system.</div>
<a name="08062675000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon.
Members know, I chair the associate parliamentary group for
looked-after children and care leavers. I have been attending meetings
for 11 years now and have chaired the group for about two and a half
years. We have debated many times the shortcomings in local
authorities&#146; ability to accommodate children in ways that are
good for those
children.</div><a name="08062675000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall give an example from as recently as March this year. We had a
discussion about accommodation and, sadly, we still heard story after
story of what went wrong. One story that sticks in my mind is that of
two young care leavers in my audience. They were brothers who had been
taken into care by the local authority at different times and ended up
living in different placements. When their time in care came to an end,
each was treated differently. The first one to leave care was found
accommodation with friends; he knew them well and was comfortable and
happy there. He settled in well and got a job, and there was
a good support system around
him.</div><a name="08062675000172"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div>
<a name="08062675000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">That young
man&#146;s brother was placed in a shared flat with someone who was
well-known in the locality as a top drug dealer. That boy&#151;he was
still under 18&#151;was put under immense pressure to take drugs, to
sell drugs, to run and to fetch money for the drugs. In the end, he
chose absolute homelessness rather than stay there. No one checked the
accommodation before he went there and no one listened to his concerns
when he was placed there. In the end, he had to make a stark choice and
he chose homelessness, rather than being dragged into the drugs trade.
Clause 10 tells us that local authorities must &#147;have regard
to&#148; meeting the needs of children and have a suitable range of
accommodation available for young people. That is most
acceptable.</div>
<a name="08062675000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanation given for new clause 19 by the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham reminded me that the starting point for the
debate, on this clause and many others, is the immense range of quality
services offered by local authorities. We have heard 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>some superb examples&#151;we hear of them also at meetings of the
parliamentary group&#151;of local authorities doing their utmost to
keep families
together.</div><a name="08062675000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that is not possible, local authorities try to ensure that young
children in care are placed somewhere that allows them some community
ties&#151;as close to home as they can manage&#151;which perhaps
allows them to keep in touch with grandparents, other family members
and friends, and even to try to keep the same school, health services
and so on, so that if the opportunity arises to rehabilitate those
children back to the family early, the support systems are all still in
place.</div><a name="08062675000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that is not possible and children have to spend their time in care
until it is time to leave&#151;when they become adults&#151;they
still have connections with some people so that they can return to a
community that still has some support for them.</div>
<a name="08062675000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the other
end of the scale, authorities such as the one alluded to by the hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham seem to be too easily persuaded
to place children out of area and a long way from home. That breaks
those community ties and, because of the distance involved, the chance
of blood relatives thinking that the children might be rehabilitated.
It also leaves youngsters cut off from everything they know, everything
they are familiar with and the few supports that they have. No wonder
we hear stories of youngsters going off the rails and misbehaving in
those areas&#151;they have been cut off from all support. That is bad
practice, and the clause brilliantly puts local authorities under a
duty to consider keeping children in area if they can. That will be
important in driving up
standards.</div><a name="08062675000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
couple of amendments to clause 10 that were not selected for debate,
one of which was mine, would have drawn Ministers&#146; attention to
those young people who have come to the end of their time in care
because they are no longer children. Under the Children (Leaving Care)
Act 2000, the local authority will still have some obligation to have
regard to their well-being afterwards. I hope the Minister says that
local authorities will still be obliged to ensure that looked-after
children who have left care are in suitable
accommodation.</div><a name="08062675000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall tell of a recent conversation showing how important proper
accommodation can be. Many Members who spoke on Second Reading
mentioned the lobbying that day by the Fostering Network, and many
foster carers were in Westminster. I spoke to a woman who had brought
up a girl as a foster child for many years and who came to love her as
a daughter. Despite all the obstacles that the care system put in her
way, the girl flew through her GCSEs and A-levels, and finally 
got to university.</div>
<a name="08062675000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The foster
mother was proud of all that the two of them had been through together,
so many obstacles having been overcome to get to that position. She
then learned that although the girl had accommodation on campus during
term times, when she was not at university she was on her
own&#151;without accommodation and with no help. The foster mother
was so outraged that she gave up being a foster carer and the income
that it brought in, converted the girl&#146;s flat into lodgings and
rented it to her at whatever state benefit she was able to get to help
to pay for it, so that the girl could use it during the
breaks.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div><a name="08062675000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">That went well
beyond the call of duty on the woman&#146;s part, and it was done
because of the bond of love that had grown between the two of them.
However, such events should not be happenstance. We know how few
looked-after children get to university; it should not be down to one
individual&#146;s bravery and kindness for that child to continue
there. That is a good example of accommodation going wrong for
youngsters.</div><a name="08062675000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because
of my post as chairman of the all-party group, I hold myself out as
willing to visit local authority services and meet users. I went to
north Staffordshire&#151;the county that I am from&#151;to meet
some recent care leavers. True enough, they were all still in touch
with the leaving care team, and so were getting contacts, advice and so
on. However, several of them told me that they were in a flat, getting
housing benefit to pay the rent and did not have a
job.</div><a name="08062675000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
three of those people had told me the same story about not having a
job, I said, &#147;Don&#146;t you think that in this day and age
you are in a bit of a dead-end position? You are in a flat, your rent
is paid for you, but you have no job and you are not getting any
skills. Wouldn&#146;t you rather get skills at a further education
college, get a job and make your own way in the world?&#148; Each of
them said, &#147;My adviser advised me that the safest thing for me
was to stay unemployed and have my rent paid.&#148; That is the local
authority that is looking after them advising them to do the opposite
to what any of us would want for our children&#151;certainly what I
would want for my children&#151;and what the Government want for our
country.</div><a name="08062675000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are poor services for people aged over 18 for whom we still have a
responsibility. The clause deals with massive improvements in the
situation of looked-after children in respect of accommodation. Will it
apply to children who have left care but for whom we still have a
responsibility, albeit perhaps not the full legal responsibility of
looking after children? Nevertheless, that responsibility continues
from their time in
care.</div><a name="08062675000077"></a>

Brooke:</b> I, too, congratulate the Government on clause 10,
which is the result of excellent work in the House of Lords. I refer to
it as &#147;evolution&#148;, which is sometimes a good way to reach
the point that one wants to
reach.</div><a name="08062675000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am pleased to speak after the hon. Member for Stafford because he
expressed the post-care concerns so well. All sorts of things may come
along whereby a young person just needs to touch base as much as
anything, so the provision is needed to get that extra advice.
Sometimes, a small amount of support is needed, but, without it,
somebody can start on a downhill path, which would be unfortunate if we
were getting all the other building blocks in place. We want to ensure
continuity.</div><a name="08062675000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the comments made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham. I am uncertain about the wording of his new clause, but I
think that the points he is making are valid. I have received
representations from other parts of the country&#151;the north, in
fact&#151;about local children&#146;s services not being informed
when children are placed in their area. We return again to the point
that that may be in the guidance, but there is so much evidence of it
not happening in certain circumstances that it and the guidance perhaps
need to be looked at.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div><a name="08062675000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
concerned about placing young people a long way from home in
residential children&#146;s homes, if, unfortunately, there may be an
element of antisocial or minor criminal behaviour&#151;perhaps
because the children are labelled and get judged more harshly. One way
or another, a proportion of children end up in the local youth justice
system. Multidisciplinary working between the youth offending team,
where the children are placed and the local authority that has placed
them is important. A lot more needs to be put in place to ensure that
that is
happening.</div><a name="08062675000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I return to the point of my intervention, which I obviously did not
express well. My concern is about not the legislation kicking in for
children with severe disability needs, but the fact that boroughs with
little provision&#151;few foster carers and no residential
care&#151;that place children outside their area could just go on
saying, &#147;We haven&#146;t got the foster carers or the places.
We haven&#146;t even got them in the next borough
along.&#148;</div><a name="08062675000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot see what will trigger the search for foster places nearer home,
because boroughs that are not wholeheartedly signed up to the current
agenda could hide behind the term &#147;reasonably
practicable&#148;. I realise that that is the only phrase that can go
in the Bill, but I was looking for the Minister to say that there would
be guidance and that we would not prolong a situation in which large
numbers of children are placed outside their local authority area. It
is not that these children have specialised needs, but that the
authorities that send them away are not doing enough to provide local
accommodation.</div>
<a name="08062675000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000212"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> I echo the comments of my hon. Friends and
other hon. Members by saying that it is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr.
Williams.</div><a name="08062675000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the clause, which represents a radical change for children who
are looked after by local authorities. I particularly echo the concerns
about authorities placing children out of area. Warrington has a large
number of young people placed from out of area, so I have considerable
experience of young people who do not have access to the support that
they need. Another issue is that local authorities that place
looked-after children are unable to get the information that they need
about the relevant networks and what is happening in and around care
homes.</div>
<a name="08062675000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
several points to put to the Minister. He will not be surprised to hear
that, as the chairman of the all-party group on children who run away
or go missing, I have received representations from a large number of
children who have discussed their experiences. There is no question but
that there is a significant need for local authorities across the
country to provide emergency accommodation in their areas. How will the
general duty on local authorities to secure sufficient accommodation
address that need? I ask that particularly in light of the review on
access to emergency accommodation, which he and his Department have
established for this year.</div>
<a name="08062675000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will recall the &#147;Stepping Up&#148; report by the
Children&#146;s Society, which specifically addressed the issue
through extensive consultation with local authorities. Of the 69
authorities that replied to the request for information on emergency
accommodation, only 20 indicated that such accommodation was available
for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>young runaways in their area. Of those 20, none felt that provision
fully met the need in their area, while six felt that it mostly met
local need and three that it partly met it. That is a fairly radical
gap that needs to be addressed rapidly if local authorities are to meet
the duty in the
Bill.</div><a name="08062675000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should remind the Minister that that duty will be valuable not only for
those young people who run away from something that is a danger to them
and who need somewhere safe to go because they cannot be returned home,
but for the small number of looked-after children who need a breathing
space because their needs or issues with the local authority placement
must be addressed before they are given more long-term accommodation.
Will the Minister also tell us how emergency accommodation meets the
needs of children and young people who seek a safe haven from sexual
exploitation or trafficking? How will local authorities address those
needs under clause
10?</div><a name="08062675000173"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="08062675000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
add my voice to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford on the
need for young people to have suitable accommodation on leaving care.
Many of those young people are under 18 and will be given direct
consideration under the clause. I refer the Minister back to clause 9,
which inserts new section 22C into the Children Act 1989. Under section
22C(6)(d), in addition to placement in foster care and local authority
children&#146;s homes, a placement
means</div><a name="08062675000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject
to section 22D, placement in accordance with other arrangements which
comply with any regulations made for the purpose of this
section.&#148;</div><a name="08062675000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
clause 10, will local authorities have a duty to provide accommodation
under section 22C(6)(d); and, if so, will that accommodation come under
the requirements of new section 22G(2), inserted by clause 10, that it
should be in the local authority&#146;s area and meets the needs of
the
children?</div><a name="08062675000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister discuss the issues relating to location of accommodation?
A problem raised time and again by young people who have run away from
local authority care, local authorities and police officers is that a
local authority has placed them in accommodation in close proximity to
known problems, such as drugs or sexual exploitation. Sometimes,
children are placed in close proximity to a registered sex
offender.</div><a name="08062675000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I can beg your favour, Mr. Williams, perhaps I can draw your
attention to new clause 36, which covers some of the questions that
have been raised by other hon. Members. We hope that it will be
selected for consideration later in Committee
proceedings.</div><a name="08062675000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062675000213"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams. I would like to
make several points about new clause 19. First, the distances between
the foster home, the local authority and the family home should be
taken into account. If the child has been plucked out of an adverse
situation or, worse still, if legal action has been taken to safeguard
the welfare of the child, a placement close to home may not be ideal.
Conversely, where quick reassimilation into the family home is
desirable, the child should not be placed too far away.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div><a name="08062675000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">For many local
authorities in London, placing children within the capital is not
always ideal or possible. As a result, many children are placed in
other counties. When that happens, it is much more difficult for a
local authority to maintain the level of communication and support
needed to help families through such a challenging process. We must
also be aware that children&#146;s behaviour can be
different&#151;I am not saying that it is good or bad&#151;if they
are moved to rural or coastal parts of the country from the centre of
London. Finding the right placement is a hands-on job that requires the
full attention of those in the local authority. If the child is moved
too far away, they may simply fall under the radar, with detrimental
consequences.</div><a name="08062675000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
there are no geographical limits on where children are placed or where
homes are set up, the chance of one street containing several homes
owned by different individuals or local authorities is increased. That
is not desirable and could spell trouble, as children in care are often
damaged or vulnerable in some way. Pooling large groups of such
children is not conducive to their emotional or social development. It
might even exacerbate problems that should be in the process of being
rectified.</div><a name="08062675000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062675000214"></a><b class="B">Lynda
Waltho</b> (Stourbridge) (Lab): I echo the comments of hon.
Members in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Williams, for
this most important Committee on a Bill that, once enacted, will
transform the outcomes of looked-after children for many years to
come.</div><a name="08062675000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause deals with accommodation&#151;a matter on which a great
stride is needed. As we know, many young people in care have
experienced great disruption in their lives. I am particularly
concerned about children leaving care and those up to the age of 21.
Often they have experienced such disruption that everything breaking
down at the point when they move on can sometimes mean the end. It can
determine their future and their transition to successful adult
life.</div><a name="08062675000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a memorandum to the Children, Schools and Families Committee, on which
I serve, Dr. Roger Morgan, OBE, the children&#146;s rights director,
drew our attention to the views of young care leavers who had had
various care experiences. They described having to wait in bed and
breakfast accommodation for months before any flat or suitable
accommodation became available, but many of them&#151;almost 300
young people were interviewed&#151;were worried that their
accommodation after leaving care was unsafe. They did not feel safe or
secure when they were there.</div>
<a name="08062675000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is telling
that many of them had been put into accommodation shared with people
whom they would never have been encouraged to be with while they were
in care. That seems ridiculous. Some were given flats that were
completely unsuitable or even dangerous. The majority felt that
insufficient time and regard were given to their future welfare and
that they had almost been disposed of&#151;moved on and regarded as
no longer a problem. One young person said that she had been living in
a hostel with &#147;a load of fellas&#148; and drug addicts, and a
group of three young women reported that when they left care, they were
placed in a hostel well known for prostitution.</div>
<a name="08062675000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">A variety of
safe, secure accommodation is vital for that age group. Protocols with
housing authorities  are necessary to handle appropriate
accommodation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>applications and there should be arrangements to sustain young people in
accommodation, including assistance with simple things such as
reporting repair needs and getting into those systems. Often, the
unsuitability of the property and the young people&#146;s inability
to deal with making it suitable makes the whole thing break down
again.</div><a name="08062675000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is important, and the clause is an important part of it. However,
if we are not careful, we will miss a trick in extending safe and
secure accommodation to such young people. Risking their success risks
their safety. The protections that we want for young people must be
extended to the older age group. That is why I support the comments
made by both my hon. Friends.  I hope that the Minister will
take my considerations on
board.</div><a name="08062675000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000215"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> We have had a good debate on clause stand part
and on the new clause. It emphasises the fact that, as hon. Members
have said, the Government are introducing an important new duty in
clause 10.</div>
<a name="08062675000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 10
places a general duty on the local authority to take steps to ensure
that, as far as is reasonably practicable, there is sufficient
accommodation in its area to meet the needs of the children it looks
after. That is a reflection of our ambition to enhance the range and
choice of suitable and quality placements for looked-after children,
and goes hand in hand with our commitment to ensuring that more
children are provided with accommodation in their local area, and are
placed in a different area only if the reason for their being placed in
a different area is to meet their particular needs. To take the point
of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, in fulfilling this duty, local
authorities do not need to take into account those children for whom an
in-area placement would be inconsistent with their welfare.</div>
<a name="08062675000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">By requiring
local authorities to consider the benefits of having a number of
accommodation providers as well, the clause makes it clear that they
cannot fulfil this duty simply by presuming that they can provide
sufficient accommodation entirely by themselves. In addition, the
clause highlights the need to have a range of accommodation that it is
sufficient to meet the different needs of children who, as we know,
have very diverse
needs.</div><a name="08062675000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause does say, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West
appropriately, astutely and typically pointed out, that</div>
<a name="08062675000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
deciding the appropriate placement for a child in a children&#146;s
home the local authority must have regard to the proximity of other
similar premises.&#148;</div>
<a name="08062675000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon. Friend
pointed out, the drafting may be a little vague for the purposes of
legislation, but I understand the intention behind the new clause and
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s purpose in proposing
it.</div><a name="08062675000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will return in a moment to the point about care leavers aged between 18
and 21 made by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and my
hon. Friend the Member for Stafford. The aim of the amendments made by
the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 is to ensure that all care leavers
between the ages of 18 and 21 have a personal adviser to provide
ongoing advice and support, and the Bill extends that personal adviser
beyond the age of 21, for as long as a young person continues in
education or training started before the age of 25.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div><a name="08062675000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The personal
adviser will work with the young person to develop a pathway plan which
sets out the young person&#146;s needs, including for accommodation
and any assistance that they require with that. Importantly, the focus
of the pathway plan and any local authority assistance is to enable and
support the young person as an adult to arrange and secure their
accommodation, rather than just to do it on the young person&#146;s
behalf.</div><a name="08062675000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that there is a lot more to do in relation to care leavers
over the age of 18. As hon. Members will be aware, we recently
announced&#151;last week, in fact, with my hon. Friend chairing the
meeting of the lobby by the foster carers alliance&#151;the 10 local
authorities that we have selected to pilot the &#147;Staying
Put&#148; 18-plus family placement programme. The programme is
designed to enable young people to remain with their former foster
carers when they are adults, so that they can leave home in a way more
typical of other young people, whose average age when they leave home
is around 24, rather than 16, 18 or even 21. If the pilot demonstrates
improved outcomes for care leavers, as we expect and hope it will, we
are planning to take action in the next comprehensive spending review
period to ensure that any care leavers who make that choice can
reasonably expect to remain in a family placement beyond the age of
18.</div>
<a name="08062675000174"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="08062675000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to the &#147;Staying Put&#148; pilots, we are taking
forward a range of proposals from the White Paper to improve support
for the transition into adulthood. For example, those who have been in
care and who go into higher education will be eligible for a personal
adviser and a bursary of a minimum of &#163;2,000, in acknowledgment
of the fact that care leavers face greater financial difficulties than
others.</div>
<a name="08062675000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Too many
young people are pushed into independent living too early and without
proper support. The &#147;Care Matters&#148; White Paper included a
comprehensive set of commitments to improve the quality of care
provided to looked-after children and care leavers. The Bill already
contains a provision to ensure that local authorities can move
looked-after children from foster care or children&#146;s homes into
unregulated places such as supported lodgings, which hon. Members have
mentioned, only after a full review of the care plan. That will involve
determining whether the child understands the implications of any
suggested move and whether they will be provided with the support that
they need.</div>
<a name="08062675000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect the
legislation to reduce the numbers of looked-after children leaving care
at 16 or 17, and that is desirable. It is therefore not sensible to
require local authorities to develop long-term strategies to build up a
stock of accommodation for what we expect to be a diminishing group of
young people.</div>

Southworth:</b> Will my hon. Friend specifically address the
issue of whether new section 22C(6)(d) will be included under clause
10? If it is in the Bill, it should be included; if it is not necessary
for it to be in the Bill, I would perhaps accept that it should not
be.</div>
<a name="08062675000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000217"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> Yes, I was coming to that, but as my hon. Friend
has given me the opportunity to mention it now, let me say that clause
10 will include the arrangements in new section 22C(6)(d). I hope that
helps my hon. Friend.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div><a name="08062675000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000218"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> Will there be a Government amendment to write
that into the Bill?</div>
<a name="08062675000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000219"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> My understanding is that clause 10 does include
new section 22(6)(d) without the need for us to make a further
amendment, but I will return to that if I am wrong. Perhaps I can
clarify the point later in my remarks if inspiration reaches me<i class="I">.
[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Indeed, it might well be on its way
right now. Yes, proposed new section 22C(6)(d) is included in clause
10, but perhaps I can clarify the issue further for my hon. Friend
later if I need to. On her other point, provision will have to be in
area, where reasonably practicable.</div>
<a name="08062675000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole
point of clause 10 is to give local authorities responsibility for
providing sufficient placements in area, where that is reasonably
practicable. Our aims is to ensure that the days of dumping&#151;as
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham put it&#151;
looked-after children out of area are over. The Government want not
only to send out the message that such practices are unacceptable, but
to legislate to make it clear that it is the responsibility of local
authorities to provide sufficient accommodation in area, where
reasonably practicable.</div>
<a name="08062675000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The phrase
&#147;reasonably practicable&#148; is not a get-out clause in any
way, shape or form, and it obviously refers to some of the points that
have been made relating to London, provision across boundaries and the
need to take a sensible approach. As for the idea that it is acceptable
to dump large numbers of looked-after children out of area, it is clear
that the clause consigns that approach to history. I am sure that that
will be welcomed throughout the Committee.</div>
<a name="08062675000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000220"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I refer&#151;I hope this is the right
provision&#151;to proposed new section 22C of the 1989 Act, headed
&#147;Ways in which looked after children are to be accommodated and
maintained&#148;. Subsection (6)(d)
specifies</div><a name="08062675000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject
to section 22D, placement in accordance with other arrangements which
comply with any regulations made for the purposes of this
section.&#148;</div><a name="08062675000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
what age does that cease to
apply?</div><a name="08062675000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000221"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I will refer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
remarks later, rather than attempting to answer now, just in case I get
it wrong, although I think I know the answer to his
question.</div><a name="08062675000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 19 would require local authorities, in considering whether to
place a child in a particular children&#146;s home, to take account
of the location of other children&#146;s homes in that area. I
understand the point that the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham makes, and his concern. He has obviously come across some
pretty bad practice in his constituency experience and is concerned
about the negative impact that the clustering of children&#146;s
homes could have with respect to antisocial behaviour or criminal
activity.</div><a name="08062675000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that, statistically, children in care are more likely than
other children or young people to be subject to a final reprimand or
warning or to be convicted of a crime, largely because they experience
many of the same risk factors as young offenders, including abuse and
neglect, instability in their lives, poor educational outcomes, poor
parenting and higher rates of mental health problems than the wider
population.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div><a name="08062675000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is
important to remember and to emphasise&#151;we should always do so
when we are talking about young people and, in particular, looked-after
children&#151;that the vast majority of looked-after children do not
get involved in crime. The number who are involved in criminal activity
is still small. Nevertheless I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
and do not want to gloss over it at
all.</div><a name="08062675000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existence of other children&#146;s homes in the area is not the key
issue. What matters is that the placement meets the needs of the child
and that the child&#146;s welfare is paramount in decisions about
care planning. In providing accommodation for children whom they look
after, local authorities must determine the most appropriate placement
on the basis of a comprehensive assessment of each child&#146;s
individual needs. Before taking any decision regarding the
child&#146;s care, they should as far as is practicable consider the
views of the child concerned, as well as those of the child&#146;s
parents or other relevant people. The placing authority should be
satisfied, in making the placement decision, that the placement is
appropriate, capable of meeting the child&#146;s needs and, where
possible, in line with the child&#146;s
choice.</div><a name="08062675000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
a looked-after child has been identified as having the risk factors
that make them vulnerable to antisocial or offending behaviour, the
system needs to work effectively to support them and ensure that the
risk factors are properly addressed. The child&#146;s care plan
should set out how their needs will be met, and that is likely to
include information that influences the type and location of their
placement.</div><a name="08062675000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
a looked-after child is placed in a children&#146;s home, a key role
for the home is to provide a supportive and structured environment with
appropriate rules and expectations about behaviour. All providers of
children&#146;s homes are expected to comply with regulations and
meet the prescribed national minimum standards for the operation of the
home and the care provided. That should and does include the management
of the children&#146;s
behaviour.</div><a name="08062675000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
chief inspector of education, children&#146;s services and skills
already has a range of enforcement powers that may be used in cases
where children&#146;s homes fail to meet the standards expected of
them. We are including in the Bill measures to strengthen those
provisions, such as allowing the chief inspector to restrict new
admissions to homes that are found to be performing poorly. We are
funding other steps to improve the quality of residential provision,
such as the development of training and professional development
standards for all residential care staff. It is not in anyone&#146;s
interest for children to be provided with accommodation in homes that
are not properly equipped or organised to manage antisocial behaviour
or to support each individual child to fulfil their potential. As part
of the review of the national minimum standard, we shall consider also
how best to encourage providers to engage positively with their local
communities and with other agencies. It is very important that that
takes place, for the very reasons that the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham mentioned: often in communities, there is a lot
of misunderstanding about children in care and about the presence of
children&#146;s homes in an area.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div><a name="08062675000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alongside such
supportive placements and good care planning, we need a youth justice
system that focuses on prevention&#151;I commend my right hon. Friend
the Minister for Children, Young People and Families on her work in
that area&#151;and provides appropriate sanctions to steer young
people away from the criminal behaviour that concerns hon. Members.
That is why the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 will
introduce the youth rehabilitation order&#151;a community sentence
for juveniles that can be tailored to meet young people&#146;s
assessed needs&#151;and why we in the Department for Children,
Schools and Families are working closely with the Home Office and the
Ministry of Justice to publish the youth crime action plan this summer,
a central theme of which will be the prevention of youth crime. I shall
move on to make some other remarks, but I hope that the hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham feels that he does not
need to press his new clause.</div>
<a name="08062675000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Isle of Wight asked about age: 18 will be the appropriate
age.</div><a name="08062675000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000222"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The hon. Member for Stourbridge made some
important points, but I got the impression that they were in respect of
post-18-year-olds, so the question is, what is happening to children
post-18?</div>
<a name="08062675000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000223"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> The duty to accommodate looked-after children
applies under clause 9 up to 18 years old. I referred to the
&#147;Staying Put&#148; pilots that we are running to try to make
it the norm for children to stay in their foster care placements up to
21 years old. However, many issues and questions&#151;legal,
practical and others&#151;need to be addressed. Of course, young
people can stay with their foster carers beyond 18, but foster carers
have brought to our attention the practical difficulties with such
accommodation, which we considered when developing the pilots. The
right approach is for us to ensure that we understand all the issues
before we roll out such a policy
nationally.</div><a name="08062675000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000224"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The problem that the Minister cited  was
with girls&#151;young women&#151;who had taken up recommended
accommodation and found that it was not foster care but an independent
home because they were post-18. Are we now being told that that cannot
be done? I get the impression that we are.</div>
<a name="08062675000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000225"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I hope that I have not given the hon. Gentleman
that impression at all. Local authority good practice when looking
after the needs and interests of care leavers should not involve
placements in the kind of inappropriate accommodation to which hon.
Members have referred. I cannot emphasise that
enough.</div><a name="08062675000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was saying that the statutory duty in the Bill applies up to 18 years
old, but that we are piloting approaches that will enable care leavers
to stay, for example, with their foster carers beyond 18&#151;with
the appropriate practical support. I am not saying that it is good
practice for any care leaver to be placed and not have the
support of their local authority beyond the age of 18. They should not
be placed in inappropriate accommodation, and it is absolutely part of
the local authority&#146;s duty to plan appropriate accommodation
with the young person after they leave care, at whatever
age.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000226"></a>Lynda
Waltho:</b> I welcome the &#147;Staying Put&#148; pilots,
which were discussed on the Floor of the House when they were
introduced. I would like the Minister to address further a point that I
made then. There is evidence from similar schemes in Northern Ireland,
which have been wonderful and successful. Given that evidence already
exists, are we not hanging back a bit too much? I understand the need
for evidence, but we need to move quickly. Does he have an end date in
mind, or a time by which a decision will have been taken? It cannot be
soon enough for those
children.</div><a name="08062675000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000227"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I sympathise and empathise absolutely with the
point that my hon. Friend makes, but I should tell her that the scheme
in Northern Ireland is relatively new, limited in scope and not
universal in application. The evidence is still new and untested in
terms of what has happened in the Northern Ireland context. Obviously,
however, we are looking at it with interest, as we will look at the
evidence from the &#147;Staying Put&#148;
pilots.</div><a name="08062675000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have tried to make it as clear as possible that as soon as we have the
opportunity to evaluate the &#147;Staying Put&#148; pilots, which
are commencing as we speak, we will look to seek the necessary
resources to roll the scheme out nationally, provided that the
evaluation shows that any legal or other practical difficulties that
may have been thrown up can be
overcome.</div><a name="08062675000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062675000228"></a><b class="B">Kerry
McCarthy</b> (Bristol, East) (Lab): Bristol is one of the
cities that have been selected to run the &#147;Staying Put&#148;
pilots. I welcome that because I have been approached, as several of my
hon. Friends have, by foster parents who have been in the difficult
situation of feeling that they have to turn someone who is all but a
member of their family out on to the streets when they reach a certain
age.</div><a name="08062675000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to press the Minister further on evaluation. I am concerned that
we will not necessarily always be able to assess until several years
down the line whether the arrangements made for young people under the
&#147;Staying Put&#148; pilots were appropriate and what was the
impact on their lives. We cannot immediately arrange for them to stay
with their family and say after several months that that is working
fine. There might be longer-term
consequences.</div><a name="08062675000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister give us an idea of the time scale for the evaluation, or
will it be a running evaluation with an assessment after six months?
Will the evaluators then stay in touch with the young people to see how
the arrangement has worked out for
them?</div><a name="08062675000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062675000229"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> The assessment will not be about whether the
arrangement is suitable for the young person. It will be about the
practical, financial, tax, benefit and other issues that may be thrown
up by the arrangement under the pilot to continue to pay foster carers
for keeping young people in their homes beyond the age of 18, rather
than using the supported lodgings
approach.</div><a name="08062675000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
supported lodgings approach is often used, but it often pays a lower
rate, which causes financial difficulty. If there is mutual agreement,
there is no reason why foster carers cannot continue to accommodate
young people leaving care. In doing so, they are entitled to supported
lodgings allowance, but often that is inadequate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div><a name="08062675000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, the
issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East are not
the issues that we are worried about. Where the young person and the
foster carer both want it, it is often in that young person&#146;s
interest to stay in the placement beyond 18. We are, however, trying to
address the often unanticipated difficulties that making such a change
throws
up.</div><a name="08062675000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have occasionally been criticised, possibly rightly, for
rushing to legislate and not trying to find out what the unintended
consequences of legislating might be. It is right that we base our
policy on clear and properly evaluated evidence, although we should do
so without unnecessarily delaying a radical and appropriately
progressive policy change, which is ultimately what the Bill
represents. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend on that
point.</div><a name="08062675000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Care
leavers over the age of 18 have a sole entitlement to mainstream
accommodation, as do other vulnerable groups of young adults. Housing
services in a local area are responsible for making those arrangements,
but they should work closely with leaving care services to ensure
holistic planning to meet the young person&#146;s needs as identified
in their pathway
plan.</div><a name="08062675000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have half an eye on the green screen up there, Mr. Williams,
so I will try to deal with the rest of the points that were raised
during this excellent debate. In relation to the duty to children
placed out of area, the Arrangements for Placement of Children
(General) Regulations 1991 require local authorities to notify the
local authority for the area where the children are being placed, which
meets the points made by the hon. Members for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole and for East Worthing and Shoreham about local authorities often
not being aware of
that.</div><a name="08062675000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope, however, that clause 10 will significantly reduce the instances
of looked-after children being placed out of area by providing local
authorities with a legal duty to have sufficient accommodation within
area.</div>
<a name="08062675000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham referred to a particular case
about an isolated home. Clause 10 is specifically intended to help to
tackle the issues of increasing provision of accommodation within the
local authority area that the children are from, so that they can be
looked after there, rather than dumped away from their
homes.</div><a name="08062675000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole also asked how that
statutory duty would bite on local authorities. Clearly, local
authorities will be expected, under statute, to assess current and
projected needs for looked-after children in their area, and we will
ensure that it is clear that they have to do that. They will have to
plan and design secure services that can meet those needs, and they
will have to engage with potential providers and service users as
necessary to continue, review and monitor those services. That role
will, of course, be inspected and made absolutely clear during that
inspection.</div><a name="08062675000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will deal with one or two other issues. My hon. Friend the Member for
Warrington, South raised an interesting point that we mentioned
earlier. She will be fully aware that we are reviewing the whole
question of the provision of adequate emergency accommodation, because
she was closely involved in the young persons action plan. We
absolutely acknowledge that children need safe places to go when they
run away from home, until the reasons for their running away are
addressed.</div>

review of the existing emergency accommodation is well under way to try
to identify its strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately to address
them. The action plan sets out a further commitment to support the
development of the commissioning and provision of emergency
accommodation for young runaways, including those who are running away
from care. As she knows, we will consult local authority and partner
organisations, as well as young people, to inform all that
work.</div><a name="08062675000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
