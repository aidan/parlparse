<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> There has been a brief interregnum. Nevertheless, I think that I have answers to most of the questions that have been asked. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) asked two questions that revolved around transparency on conversion between limited liability partnerships and ordinary partnerships. I can confirm both his points.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) asked about disincorporation. The provisions allow partnerships to become limited liability partnerships without any tax charge arising. In the jargon, the conversion is tax-neutral. I think that he also asked about companies becoming limited liability partnerships. The Bill provides that limited liability partnerships will be taxed in the same way as ordinary partnerships. A company does not enjoy tax neutrality if it becomes a partnership, and the Bill reflects that treatment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's other questions, are linked. The phasing out of the cash basis will be covered in an article in the Inland Revenue bulletin. The transitional period for phasing out the cash basis will continue. Interest on loans taken out to buy interests in limited liability partnerships is allowable against total income, subject to the clear limits set out in the clause.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about transparency if a limited liability partnership ceases to carry on trade or business. In that case, it becomes a body corporate and is taxed as such, by corporation tax instead of income tax. During an orderly winding up, as opposed to liquidation, it is likely that a business will continue, so the transparency will remain.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) turned the question on its head by asking about limited liability partnerships that convert to limited companies. The position is the same as for a partnership that becomes a company, which means no tax neutrality.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked about liquidation and rollover relief for business assets. That is highly technical stuff. If the Committee bears with me, I shall try to answer the question.
<P>
Proposed new section 59A of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 applies only when the limited liability partnership is carrying on a business. In liquidation, the limited liability partnership ceases to carry on a business, and the assets are in the hands of the liquidator. When the limited liability partnership goes into liquidation, it will be taxed under normal corporate rules. The liquidator will be taxed on disposal of limited liability partnership assets by reference to the original acquisition cost and date of the asset by the limited liability partnership. The limited liability partnership members each have only one asset, which is their interest in the limited liability partnership. They will be taxed as individuals on any gain or loss that arises on the disposal of that interest during liquidation.
<P>
We were asked to confirm that a limited liability partnership member who realises a limited liability partnership asset on the sale of a business and acquires an asset in another business will not be charged on that gain. We can confirm that rollover relief will be available in the usual way.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I am extremely grateful to the Minister for mentioning those matters. I shall turn to what I call disincorporation. The Minister will know that one suffers significant tax problems, particularly with capital gains tax, in, for example, winding up a limited company and transferring the business into a limited liability partnership. That is a penalty of disincorporation. I do not seek a detailed answer from the Minister, but would be grateful if he simply started the ball rolling by saying whether the Department of Trade and Industry and the Inland Revenue can come to some arrangement on or start the process of facilitating such action. It has caused a problem for many years.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I asked this morning for brief interventions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now make his point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> In that case, the best thing that I can do is wait for the Minister to finish his speech. Then I shall return to make various points.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I take it that the hon. Gentleman was referring to what happens to transparency if the limited liability partnership ceases to carry on a trade, profession or business. The transparency cannot continue, because the limited liability partnership becomes a body corporate and is taxed as such. It is no longer a partnership operating to provide a service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I shall not labour the point much more. I hope that the DTI and the Treasury will examine facilitating disincorporation, especially now that individuals can transfer from trading through a limited liability company to doing so through a limited liability partnership.
<P>
The Minister answered my question on rollover relief. I believe that he said that if the qualifying rules for rollover relief had applied to an asset that a limited liability partnership owned and that was sold and reinvested in another business, the rollover relief would not be clawed back if the other business continued to function and the limited liability partnership was wound up.
<P>
The Government should explain how the tax provisions impact on existing limited partnerships under the Limited Partnerships Act 1907, the provisions of which are to some extent carried over to limited liability partnerships that carry on trades. The rules for 1907 limited partnerships mean that they can have loss relief on the amount of capital that the partner contributes and on the amount of undrawn profits. As there is some confusion in business and in the professional world, I hope that the Minister will confirm that the Government intend to allow limited liability partnerships that carry on trades to benefit from loss relief on the capital contributed and on undrawn profits.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I can confirm that the limits set out in new section 118ZC of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 mean that, subject to the terms of the membership agreement, relief will be available in respect of any capital that the member has subscribed, plus any undrawn profit and any further amounts that the member has undertaken to contribute if the limited liability partnership is wound up. It is important to bear in mind that existing Taxes Acts provisions were designed for limited partnerships under the 1907 Act; in particular, a limited partner's capital is registered, as are any changes in the amount, and certainly does include undrawn capital or amounts committed in the event of winding up. By contrast, a limited liability partnership member's capital can be provided for in the membership agreement. It follows that if the agreement provides that sums of members' undrawn share of profit stand as capital, those sums will count with the members' capital towards the amount of loss relief that can be claimed against their other income.

<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Stamp duty</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have a small point to make about stamp duty. I understand that there is complete stamp duty neutrality—that is, no stamp duty is payable if an 1890 Act partnership becomes a limited liability partnership. However, I understand that that is contingent upon there being the same partners at the instant when the old partnership ceases and the new limited liability partnership commences. That will often happen on a firm's accounting day, which is usually when old partners retire or new partners come in, or both. When there is not absolute identity on the crucial day on which a limited liability partnership is formed, will the Minister confirm that, provided that it is not done for tax avoidance purposes, stamp duty neutrality—that is, exemption from stamp duty—will apply? A well-advised partnership will, of course, understand that changes on that date may be a problem, but not all partnerships are well advised.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Although I cannot give the confirmation that the hon. Gentleman seeks, the charge can be avoided by arranging matters so that the change of partners or members takes place the instant, as the term is, before or after the incorporation of the limited liability partnership.
<P>

<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Minister confirm that members of a limited liability partnership will not be treated as employed earners under the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997? Will he also confirm that they will be liable to pay class 2 contributions?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Yes, I can confirm that although a specific provision is needed to ensure that although there was a charge to class 4 national insurance contributions there is no office or employment for members of a limited liability partnership that would form the basis for treating them as employed earners.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 13 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Insolvency and winding up</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): We now come to the clauses on the regulations. I repeat what I said earlier—key regulations, which should have been in the Bill, and which would have made it easier to understand, have been relegated to secondary legislation.
<P>
Clause 14 relates to the application of insolvency law to limited liability partnerships, and anxiety has been expressed about the clawback of members' drawings in the period two years prior to a limited liability partnership becoming insolvent. It was felt that new section 214A of the Insolvency Act 1986 was less likely than the equivalent provisions for companies to encourage a business to try to trade from an insolvent position.
<P>
Since the original consultation, the Government have amended their drafting of new section 214A, and appear to have taken note of the anxiety expressed, but I should like to know if the Minister has consulted interested bodies about the revised wording, which was published only in May. A huge volume of regulation has emanated from the Bill, and the view of the Select Committee that gave the Bill its pre-legislative scrutiny, was that it should also scrutinise the recently published revised draft of the proposed secondary legislation. Will the Minister submit the draft regulations to the Select Committee for consideration?

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I reiterate that we deprecate the fact that so many of the proposals are in regulations, many of which have not yet been published. There is a commercial expedient for the Bill being in statute as fast as possible, but as a rule, regulations should be in primary legislation and part and parcel of statute. I hope that the Government will heed what I say because it applies to other measures, as well as to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I take the points made by the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Torridge and West Devon. We consulted carefully on the matter, took cognisance of the responses and as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, changed things, especially in new section 214A. In the end, it is a matter of judgment. We carefully considered whether the draft regulations, which are intended to prevent members from siphoning off funds in the event of insolvency, should appear in the Bill. We concluded against that approach because it would cause a muddle of primary and secondary legislation: the remainder of the insolvency provisions would remain in secondary legislation, but this part would not. Furthermore, the intended insolvency regulations would not rewrite the Insolvency Act 1986 for all purposes; they would make amendments only insofar as the Act was applied to limited liability partnerships. Inserting section 214A into the Bill would amend the Insolvency Act for all purposes, which is odd because none of the other amendments to the Act for limited liability partnerships covers all purposes. It is, in any case, more sensible to keep the insolvency provisions together.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked about the scrutiny of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry. When it undertook pre-legislative scrutiny, it paid close attention to the effect of the clause and argued that the attractions of limited liability were unlikely to be outweighed by the distant prospect of clawback in the event of insolvency. It believed that, although the provisions might require some adjustment in detail, some provision along the lines of section 214A was required. I stress that the provision will be subject to affirmative procedure, and with that assurance, I hope that the Committee will accept the clause.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Clause 15 introduces all the regulations that incorporate vast chunks of the Companies Act 1985 into limited liability partnership rules. We have two particular concerns. The first is about merger and acquisition accounting. As hon. Members will know, merger accounting is different from acquisition accounting: merger accounting works by adding up the assets and liabilities of the two bodies; acquisition accounting is more complicated because all assets, including good will, have to be valued, put into the books and amortized.
<P>
When a company acquires another company, acquisition accounting is important to ensure that the shares issued in exchange for that company fully reflect its value and that any consequences if the managers of the acquirer have paid too much to the acquiree are fully reflected in the profit and loss accounts so that the managers can be held to account to shareholders for their decision. Limited liability partnerships do not have shares, so the most appropriate method of accounting when two limited liability partnerships merge is the simpler form of merger accounting. However, because the regulations incorporate the Companies Act provisions, when two firms merge and one is smaller or larger than the other, the rules will require acquisition accounting—cumbersome, expensive and, frankly, unnecessary.
<P>
The Government's response is to encourage the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies to draw up a statement of recommended practice. Is the Minister sure that that is an adequate solution to the problem? Will it take precedence over the regulations that will be incorporated by the clause?
<P>
My second concern is about professional partnerships paying ex gratia annuities to former partners or their widows. Such annuities would be paid only if firms had funds to pay them. If profits were insufficient, firms simply would not bother paying the annuity to the widow or partner. The accounting rules that will be incorporated by the clause require any such annuities to be capitalised as a liability. That would mean examining the present net value of the payments and projecting for the likely future—in other words, entering a large capital liability into the accounts. In most cases, that would render the partnership technically insolvent. I have seen no references to this problem in consultation responses. How does the Minister propose to deal with it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I wish to make a point about solicitors. Can regulations be made under clauses 15 or 16 to enable solicitors' firms to become limited liability partnerships? Are the regulation-making powers in the clauses sufficient to enable such firms to practise as limited liability partnerships?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> If the Committee will bear with me, I shall come on to the question of solicitors' firms becoming limited liability partnerships when we reach new clause 1, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon.
<P>
I should like to thank the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for identifying a matter—the effect of the Bill on annuities—that was not dealt with in consultation. I shall deal first with his question about merger and acquisition accounting. The structure of limited liability partnerships is different from that of other companies, so we believe that a different statement of recommended practice, which will provide specific accounting guidance, is required. The statement of recommended practice would supplement the statutory requirements contained in the regulations. It would also supplement, but not override, the requirements for accounting standards.
<P>
With the approval of the Accounting Standards Board, the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies has set up a steering group to monitor and advise on the drawing up of the statement of recommended practice for limited liability partnerships. A separate working party will be responsible for its preparation and it will involve representatives of the main groups likely to be affected by it. A draft will be made available to interested parties. We propose to amend the provisions on merger and acquisition accounting set out in the July 1999 consultation document on the draft regulations by removing all references to shares. The chairman of the working party preparing the statement of working practice supports the proposed changes.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The House of Lords Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee says in its report that the clause is 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a Henry VIII provision which allows regulations to amend or repeal primary and secondary legislation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a serious concern and in drawing attention to it I can do no better than quote subsection (1):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regulations may make in any enactment such amendments or repeals as appear appropriate in consequence of this Act or regulations made under it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a long-established rule of company law that a subsidiary company cannot purchase the shares of its parent company because although a demand for shares in the parent company is created by a technically separate legal entity, it is wholly owned and controlled by the company from which it is buying the shares. Ultimately, that leads to disaster.
<P>
When an Act of Parliament passes through the House, we do not expect it to be amended other than by our full procedure. Passing an Act that gives the power to create secondary legislation, with its much simpler procedure, in order to amend primary Acts—even the primary Act that gave the very power to change an Act by regulation—is potentially dangerous. What is to stop such a regulation changing clause 16 and giving a named individual the power to change the Bill and other enactments? I hope that that measure would be spotted as it progressed through the negative or affirmative procedure, but it might not be, because those procedures involve little scrutiny. My view is that we should never pass Henry VIII clauses, and I urge the Committee to oppose clause 16. Henry VIII clauses are extremely dangerous and the House's procedures were not developed to deal with them.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I endorse those comments. Of course, the Minister might remind us that Conservative Governments also introduced Henry VIII clauses. I do not know whether such clauses had been invented when my party was last in power.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Any device that has been used in the House was probably invented by Lloyd George when he was Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> We are talking about Henry VIII, and my party was in power after he sat on the throne. We deprecate such clauses. They are wide-ranging, constitutionally utterly inappropriate and unacceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien </B>(Eddisbury): I support my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton in objecting to Henry VIII clauses. Although I can safely say that Henry VIII probably was on the throne when the Liberal Democrats were last in power, none of the Conservative Members present was a Member of Parliament during the time of the previous Conservative Government, so it is open to us to say that we Conservatives would not follow a practice that I admit previous Governments followed.
<P>
Henry VIII clauses attack the proper scrutiny of primary legislation. We had exactly the same arguments in Committee on the Freedom of Information Bill. If one considers the importance of that Bill to individuals and of this Bill to companies, one crucial running theme of certainty becomes apparent. The technique may be a way of avoiding creating the necessary climate of certainty in which people can base decisions on the Bill. I am not suggesting that that is the case, but Henry VIII clauses can encourage sloppy thinking and the introduction of legislation before it is ready. They can also reduce Parliament's ability to scrutinise legislation properly.
<P>
There is the danger—it may have been hinted at—that because the legislative programme is so intense, the technique will be considered useful because it avoids the need to allocate the necessary time for examining the details of primary legislation. We must be careful. The timetable pressure may mean that a truncated approach is adopted, which will result in inadequate legislation being passed.
<P>
I join in the objections. The Bill requires certainty and proper scrutiny, so a Henry VIII clause is unsuitable. I also object to such clauses in principle.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): The hon. Gentleman is not a member of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, which thoroughly examines all statutory instruments. I can assure him that if there were any suggestion that any such legislation was ultra vires, that Committee would raise the issue quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am not a member of that Committee, but I have served on various delegated legislation Committees. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has raised a fair point and that he trusts the process, but it is also fair to recall that Henry VIII clauses have become a habit. It would be lax of us not to make the point that they should be reviewed.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, clauses 14 and 15 contain the Bill's main regulation-making powers. Clause 14 permits regulations to be made about insolvency and the winding up of a limited liability partnership, and clause 15 permits the application of the law relating to companies or other corporations. However, there is legislation that does not fall exactly within the powers contained in clauses 14 or 15, but which must be applied to limited liability partnerships or their members to achieve the overall policy aim of parity of treatment between a limited liability partnership and a company.
<P>
A significant example is the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, which will apply to members of a limited liability partnership. That Act is directed mainly towards company directors and is important to insolvency and company law. However, it is arguable that the powers in clauses 14 and 15 do not provide sufficient vires to ensure the Act's application to the members of a limited liability partnership. Therefore, the Act will be applied to limited liability partnerships by schedule 4 to the draft regulations, using the powers in clause 16.
<P>
The Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee in another place examined the Bill's powers. If members of that Committee had had serious concerns, they would have made them known. They commented that the clause was a Henry VIII power. Such a power is perfectly acceptable when used appropriately. The Government would not use it in any other way, and nothing in the Committee's report suggests inappropriate use.

<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>General</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 10, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) A statutory instrument containing regulations under the Act shall be submitted to the Trade and industry Committee of the House of Commons for that committee's possible investigation prior to being laid before both Houses of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment proposes a requirement that all statutory instruments proposed as a result of the Bill should be given pre-legislative scrutiny by the Trade and Industry Committee before being laid before Parliament. The concept of pre-legislative scrutiny by a Select Committee or a Standing Committee that can take evidence from outside bodies and individuals is a useful way in which to scrutinise new law. This Bill was suggested as a candidate for that approach and it has been a highly successful experiment, judging by the quality of the Select Committee's report.
<P>
Given that so much of the substance of the legislation is contained in regulations, the experiment is not complete unless the regulations are put through the same procedure. That is the recommendation of the Select Committee, which said in its report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From our scrutiny of the legislative proposals on the creation of Limited Liability Partnerships, we consider that, while unlikely to be politically controversial, the Bill merits a Second Reading on the floor of the House; that the committee stage can be expected to be reasonably brief—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of which we cannot be sure—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and that the draft Regulations will require further examination by this Committee before being laid, at which point they will require affirmative resolution.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, the Select Committee believes that the regulations should be reviewed by the Committee. The Minister skimmed over the point when it was raised briefly under clause 14, and he did not respond to the request for specific information about his plans for the regulations. We do not want to delay the legislation, but it is important that the process is completed. It is good to see that clause 17(4) provides that the regulations will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, but despite that I still believe that they should be submitted to the Trade and Industry Committee for examination. Even under the affirmative resolution procedure, amendments cannot be tabled, so if the House is to have any say in the drafting of the regulations, they should be put before the Select Committee.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The amendment would require any statutory instrument that contains regulations made under the Bill to be considered by the Trade and Industry Committee before being laid before Parliament. Such a provision would be unusual. Although we have a pre-legislative scrutiny procedure for draft Bills, under which the Trade and Industry Committee scrutinised this Bill, it would be peculiar to include a requirement that statutory instruments must go before the Select Committee before they are laid. It is true that the Committee said that were we to continue with our proposed approach, we would need to make revised drafts of the secondary legislation publicly available in sufficient time for outside bodies and the Committee to examine them. Such a revised draft was published on July 1999, when the Department of Trade and Industry wrote to the Clerk to the Committee, provided a copy of the revised regulations and invited the Committee to discuss any aspect of them. The Committee has not reverted to the Department on that issue, which speaks volumes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am disappointed by that reply because the final version of the revised draft regulations were available only in May, and the Select Committee should have been invited to examine the regulations then. However, this is a probing amendment to discover what the Minister's intentions are. It is clear that the Government do not intend to forward the regulations to the Select Committee. That is disappointing because it means that the experiment into pre-legislative scrutiny has not gone through the full cycle, but given that that has been confirmed, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 10, line 43, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) No regulations to which this subsection applies shall create criminal offences which provide for imprisonment or trial on indictment.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment refers to an issue that I raised on Second Reading about secondary legislation. My concern is that clause 17(2)(a) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regulations under this Act may in particular . . . make provision for dealing with non-compliance with any of the regulations (including the creation of criminal offences).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation, which the Minister cited as evidence that the Committee was happy with the regulations, expressed concern in its report on the Bill. I quote from paragraph 8 of its report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Committee has one concern about the power. The draft regulations create offences punishable on summary conviction by a fine but the power is wide enough to allow the regulations to provide for imprisonment or for trial on indictment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then goes on to make the important point:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If, as seems likely, the intention is to provide only for summary trial and a fine, the Committee is of the opinion that it would be better for this limitation to appear in the bill.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Its final recommendation is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Committee draws the attention of the House to the power to create offences by regulations and invites it to consider whether the bill should be amended to provide that such offences should be punishable on summary conviction by a fine.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the Select Committee assumed that the only offences that were likely to be created under the regulations would be minor offences punishable by summary trial and a fine. On that basis, it allowed the regulations to go through. However, the Minister in the other place gave the game away. On Second Reading, Lord McIntosh of Haringey said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Delegated Powers Committee has . . . suggested that if the intention is to provide only for summary trial and a fine, such a limitation should appear in the Bill. But it is our intention to apply to Limited Liability Partnerships the same offences as apply to companies under the Companies and Insolvency Acts . . . In some cases these offences are triable on indictment and punishable with imprisonment.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 9 December 1999; Vol. 607, c. 1421.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>I fully understand the intention. It makes sense for the same offences to apply to limited liability partnerships, but I am concerned about how those offences are included in the rules for limited liability partnerships.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee gave its approval to the secondary legislation provided for in the Bill on the assumption that the regulations would involve only summary offences punishable by a fine. The Select Committee wanted that point to be included in the Bill. Had the Select Committee understood that the regulations would introduce serious criminal offences punishable by imprisonment, it is likely that it would have expressed a different opinion and might have proposed that the criminal offences should be dealt with in primary legislation. In the interests of probity, the Government should take the matter up with the Chairman of that Committee so that it can be re-examined.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I endorse that point. New regulations, which could deny liberty, should not be incorporated in law except by primary legislation. That is clear to all Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> May I make it clear that we wrote to the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation in response to its report and explained that offences punishable by imprisonment would apply. It was aware of that before the Bill was debated in the House of Lords.
<P>
We have already made clear our intention that where criminal offences are punishable by imprisonment when applied to directors of a company, that same penalty will apply to members of a limited liability partnership. I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will accept the need to ensure a level playing field between companies and limited liability partnerships in those circumstances, so that one is not treated more leniently than the other. The offences will include: failure to keep accounting records; carrying on business with intent to defraud creditors or for any fraudulent purpose; making a false, misleading or deceptive statement to auditors; destroying or mutilating limited liability partnership documents; falsifying such documents or making false entries; parting with such documents; and altering them or making omissions.
<P>
Any member of a limited liability partnership who is found guilty of those offences will be liable to imprisonment or a fine or both, just like directors of a company who are found guilty of those crimes. As I am sure that the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Torridge and West Devon will agree that those are serious offences that might have a direct impact on innocent third parties. It would be most peculiar if a court were restricted in the penalties that it could apply to members of a limited liability partnership in contrast to the range of penalties available to the court to punish directors for the same offences.
<P>
If I could beg the indulgence of the Committee, I want to refer to the issue of abuses and penalties that was raised during this morning's sitting by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson). He referred to the possibility of limited liability partnerships being used as bolt holes for illegal activities. I have spoken to the Home Office about my hon. Friend's query. Where there is a conviction for drug trafficking, the court is required to consider making a confiscation order and will consider whatever assets the dealer holds or of which he is a beneficiary. It should make no difference whether a dealer is using a partnership, company or limited liability partnership. The Home Office has advised that we should be reassured that there is no risk of creating a loophole allowing major drugs dealers, for example, to put properties out of reach through the use of limited liability partnerships. The Committee should know about that point and I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson) for raising it.
<P>
The amendment would remove the power to create new criminal offences by way of regulations, punishable by imprisonment or triable on indictment. At this stage we have no intention of creating any new offence for members of limited liability partnerships that does not already exist for company officers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Is the Minister saying that any new imprisonable offence will be introduced with respect to limited liability partnerships only by primary legislation in relation to the Companies Act 1985?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No. On the contrary, it is important to preserve the flexibility to create offences in future and to decide how they should be punished. We are creating a new entity and abuses that we have not envisaged may take place. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we uncover every day all kinds of serious scams—involving the internet, for example. In many cases no legislation exists to enable enforcement agencies to deal with those activities, many of which are cross-border. There may be new crimes for which we shall have to formulate new punishments.
<P>
The limited liability that the new entity will bestow on its members will be a privilege whose abuse could have serious repercussions for those innocently involved with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Did the Minister state, in his letter to the Chairman of the House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation, that the power would be used only to transfer criminal offences currently in the Companies and Insolvency Acts into the Bill, or that it might also be used to create new criminal offences?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It is my understanding that we made it clear that it might well be necessary to create remedies for new crimes that might emerge in the future, without having to go through the panoply of primary legislation to do so. It would not be wise to limit our scope for dealing with new abuses that might arise.
<P>
Under subsections (5)(a) and (b), any regulations that would apply provisions other than those already in the Companies Act 1985 and the Insolvency Act 1986 would be subject to appropriate parliamentary control by affirmative resolution. That would include new offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I understand the need to ensure that the regulatory regime around limited liability partnerships is the same as that applied to companies under the Companies Act. Different criminal regimes for limited liability partnerships and for companies in the matter of serious offences such as fraud would not be sensible. Our objection is to using secondary legislation to incorporate the relevant legislation into the Bill. Specific provision should have been included.
<P>
I accept that the Minister's Department wrote to the Chairman of the House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation before Second Reading in the other place. In retrospect, it would have been better to deliver the relevant information to the Chairman in the memorandum that the Department of Trade and Industry submitted to the Select Committee as that would have avoided any confusion about the purpose of the clause. I am appalled by the prospect that the mechanism in question could be used to create new criminal offences. Creating a new crime is a very big deal in this country, and should be a very big deal for the House. In many ways, making something a crime should require more severe procedures in the House than is the case with civil matters. Affirmative resolution for secondary legislation is a completely inadequate means of creating new criminal offences. We should revise our procedures to prevent the creation of new crime by delegated legislation.
<P>
In view of the likelihood of our returning to this matter on Report, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 11, line 4, after `in' insert

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 3.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We have noticed that the references in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 5 to ``provisions contained in'' the Insolvency Act 1986 or the specified parts of the Companies Act 1985 may be interpreted too narrowly. In either case, some of the provisions in question might themselves apply subordinate legislation. It would be peculiar, and unintentional, if that fact of itself triggered the affirmative procedure, so we want to make matters more certain by changing the wording to refer to provisions ``contained in or made under'' the Acts.

Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause is intended as a probing measure. I hope that the Minister will confirm that it is unthinkable that firms of solicitors should be unable to become limited liability partnerships—and quickly. A large body of legislation making reference to solicitors will need to be amended in the light of the Bill. Solicitors and their practices are referred to in various Acts as partners, partnership firms, members of a firm, members of a partnership and, in the context of solicitors working through a company, directors and officers of a recognised body.
<P>
For limited liability partnerships to be a viable option for solicitors, all that legislation must be applied to limited liability partnerships and to their members. For example, sections 9 and 10 of, and schedule 2 to, the Administration of Justice Act 1985, under which solicitors can practise through incorporated bodies, need to be amended. For some time the Department of Trade and Industry led the Law Society to believe that these regulations could be achieved by making regulations under clauses 15 and 16. I have already referred to that.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister's Department recently changed its mind and informed the Law Society that it believes that it lacks the power to make the regulations under those clauses. The Law Society believes that the Minister's Department is incorrect and that the powers are adequate. We need clarification of the DTI's position and some certainty about how we can ensure quickly that the limited liability partnership form is made available to solicitors' firms. It is imperative that they can take advantage of limited liability partnership status as soon as it is open to other firms so that they can continue to be a leading force in the provision of global legal services.
<P>
We have every reason to be proud of the role that our leading international law firms and other law firms take in global business and commerce. I understand that the Lord Chancellor's Department is well aware of the issue and is trying to find a solution. However, because we need to move speedily to a solution, one must be found in the Bill, and the DTI may need to take additional powers. New clause 1 is not perfect, but it is a starting point and the Government may wish to table their own amendment on Report.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> New clause 1 would introduce a wide-ranging power for the Lord Chancellor to make regulations amending or modifying any piece of legislation affecting solicitors to enable them to practice through the limited liability partnership vehicle. While I shall urge the Committee to resist the change, we intend that limited liability partnerships should be available to solicitors. Nothing in the Bill prevents that; the possible difficulties that have been raised are in the separate legislation governing solicitors. As I mentioned on Second Reading, my officials are in discussion with the Law Society and the Lord Chancellor's Department to consider what changes to that legislation might be necessary and how best to give them legislative effect.
<P>
The volume of legislation governing solicitors makes this a complex and time-consuming matter. The legislation is being examined to consider whether primary legislation is unavoidable and, if so, to determine what specific changes need to be made. For example, we now know that the Law Society's power to recognise bodies corporate, which it uses to recognise companies, is already sufficiently wide to embrace limited liability partnerships. That is a good start. What is less certain is how existing references in legislation to terms specific to companies, such as ``officer'' or ``director'', would read across to limited liability partnerships.
<P>
My Department is working with the Law Society and the Lord Chancellor's Department, which has the expertise on this matter, to look at the detail of the legislation so that a considered view can be taken on the most appropriate way forward. Once it has been determined what amendments are necessary to the raft of legislation affecting solicitors, we can explore whether existing powers allow for those amendments to be made by regulation. Should primary legislation prove to be the only option—it is not certain that it is—we will consider with the Lord Chancellor's Department how best to achieve that. I understand that a regulatory reform order is planned to make amendments to a number of areas of legislation affecting solicitors. That may be a suitable vehicle for changes with respect to limited liability partnerships. I recognise that the Law Society is concerned about timing, but we do not expect that people will be able to incorporate as limited liability partnerships before early 2001. In the meantime, we will work as quickly as we can to reach a satisfactory conclusion and, if necessary, to remove obstacles in the way of solicitors making use of limited liability partnerships.
<P>
Returning to the new clause, we do not believe that the case has been established for introducing a power to amend other primary legislation by regulations, as we cannot say either that the power is necessary or how it might be used. For those reason, I resist the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and heartened by what he says. Could he bear in mind that time is of the essence? I hope that he can concede that it would be grossly unfair and discriminatory if other businesses, professions and trades could become limited liability partnerships while solicitors could not.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am glad that the Minister agrees. I beg to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Committee do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This has been a short Bill, but I should nevertheless like to thank you for chairing the Committee so well Mr. Stevenson. I should also like to thank the Hansard writers and everyone else involved, including my hon. Friends and the Minister for his customary courtesy.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am happy to reiterate the words of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I must point out that Bills never look short on a Thursday afternoon. We have all benefited greatly from your expertise in chairing the Committee Mr. Stevenson. That has been a big contributory factor to its brevity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I wish to join the Minister and the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton in thanking you, Mr. Stevenson, the Hansard reporters and the officials, who have been extremely helpful, and members from all parts of the Committee. Though the Committee stage has been short, we all welcome the thrust of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful for those remarks. Committees are a two-way process. Co-operation and patience is needed from everyone. I place on record my thanks to all hon. Members and everyone involved in the work of the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
