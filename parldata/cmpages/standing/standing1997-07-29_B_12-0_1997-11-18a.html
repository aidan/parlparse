<H4><center>Clause 68</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to reduce Child Benefit for Lone Parents</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns (West Chelmsford):</B> When we broke for lunch I was reminding the Minister of several remarks made by his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State before the last general election. She adamantly expressed an opinion that was completely at variance with the proposals in the clause. I should like to wind up this part of my speech by reminding the Minister of a final quote. The right hon. Lady said in the House:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We cannot sort out the &#163;10 billion benefit bill for lone parents by shaving their benefits bit by bit.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Earlier in the same debate, she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The way to get lone mothers out of poverty and cut spending on benefits for them is not by cutting the amount on which they have to live year by year and plunging them further into poverty.''--[Official Report, 28 November 1996; Vol. 286, c. 500-501.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>My colleagues and I look forward to the Minister's explanation of why the Secretary of State changed her mind in such a short time.
<P>
I do not want to anticipate the Minister's speech, but I fear that we already know what he will say to justify the change. His answer will refer to the Government's commitment to keep to the previous Government's tight public spending limits. If that is the reason that is cited--I believe that it probably will be--will the policy be reversed when the two-year adherence to the previous Government's public spending limits ends? Surely the logic of the argument is that the measure will be overturned if and when that commitment ends and the Government can resume a policy to which the Secretary of State adhered so vehemently before the general election.
<P>
Clearly, the Secretary of State fundamentally disagreed with the policy and is implementing it only because she has lost a battle with the Treasury, if indeed she ever had such a battle between the general election and the July Budget. If the decision is not reversed when the spending ceiling is reviewed in two years, will not the arguments which the right hon. Lady now repeatedly uses have been shown to be bogus?
<P>
The Secretary of State's rhetoric against cutting child benefit and lone-parent premiums was unequivocal--she argued that such action was wrong. According to her, the previous Secretary of State's proposed cut would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``make hundreds of thousands of the poorest children worse off''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Yet the measure before us is designed to implement the very cuts that she said would increase poverty.
<P>
This sorry tale takes another twist that is not just embarrassing for the Government, but a damning indictment of the fact that before the general election the right hon. Lady not only attacked the measure when it was introduced as I have shown, but promised to reverse it if the Labour party were elected to government. However, she is now, for obvious reasons, doing all she can to play down the promises that she made in the early months of this year.
<P>
On the BBC's ``Question Time'' on 2 October this year, the right hon. Lady protested that she had not pledged not to introduce a cut in lone-parent benefits. In short, she was being somewhat economical with the truth. On 22 January this year in an interview with Polly Toynbee of The Independent, the right hon. Lady said that she would not implement the cuts proposed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley). Ms Toynbee asked:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``So will she or won't she introduce Tory legislation to cut single parent's benefits?''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The then shadow Secretary of State replied, ``No of course not.'' There we have it in black and white, an unequivocal, categorical commitment not to introduce the changes--a commitment that the Secretary of State has broken by asking her hon. Friends to agree to the clause.
<P>
It would be wrong of me, however, to single out the Secretary of State for Social Security and not to mention her right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. I can assure the Committee that his hands are not altogether clean in this matter. As Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister was just as guilty of raising the electorate's expectations. He made a commitment to lone parents that he would not force through the changes. When asked on ``The World at One'' on BBC Radio 4 whether he would stick to plans to equalise benefit payments, which included the proposal in clause 68, he replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``No . . . we believe we can avoid that situation within the existing budgets.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>In saying that, he went even further than his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, because he explained that the Labour party would not need to implement the previous Government's proposals despite its commitment to keep to their spending ceilings for the first two years in government. So the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State both made personal pledges that the cuts would not be introduced. Both are guilty of breaking those pledges and both are condemned by that breach of faith.
<P>
In the past week or so, I have had the good fortune to read an extremely interesting article in the Morning Star. I accept that the Morning Star is not my natural reading material--
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Hughes </B>(Doncaster, North): This is the third time you have used it!
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Indeed. That is because the article bears repetition--as long as I do not repeat myself so often that I am out of order--because it is so interesting. The Bill must go through several more stages before it leaves the House of Commons, so if we do not get answers to our questions to the Minister, we may well hear more of the article.
<P>
The article, which is by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), is extremely straightforward, frank and honest. It concerns the cuts to child benefit. What particularly caught my eye about it, apart from the hon. Lady's frank and honest comments, was the last paragraph, which sums up the Government's hypocrisy on this issue. She writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``People voted Labour because they believed that there were alternatives.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Single parents, she says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``took heart from our stance when these matters''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the proposed cuts to lone parent benefits--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``were debated during last November's budget . . . Labour members spoke passionately against these cuts, aided by a very useful briefing issued by our shadow social security team''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that I am right in saying that that team included the current Secretary of State for Social Security. Presumerably, she must have agreed with the briefing that was put out at the time in its name.
<P>
According to the hon. Member for Maryhill, the briefing stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Since One Parent Benefit is not taxed, it helps to bridge the gap between welfare and work.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	Its abolition will make working lone mothers worse off and will discourage work amongst this group.
<P>
	Lone Parent Premium recognises that lone parents face additional costs in bringing up their children.
<P>
	They do not have a partner's time or income to help with children.''
<P>
That was the Labour party's briefing before the general election, which the hon. Member for Maryhill rightly sums up by saying, ``Exactly.'' That has all been forgotten now by the Government, who have done a monumental U-turn.
<P>
New Labour made trust the key issue for five weeks during the general election campaign. It spent months before the campaign telling every special interest group up and down the country that if its members voted for Labour candidates, they would reverse the policies of the Conservative Government. Many people voted Labour in good faith because they believed the comments that they heard on the radio and television and read in the newspapers. However, as soon as the Government got into power, they did a U-turn and cruelly dashed the expectations and broke the trust of the electorate, who expected them to do what they had said in opposition they would do.
<P>
The current method of social security Ministers is to avoid that thorny issue and talk around it. Instead, they talk up the welfare-to-work proposals and the new deal for lone parents. [Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] I suspect that that is the only time during this debate that any Labour Member, apart from the Minister, will speak. Ministers have been using that method for months to divert attention from the way in which they have broken their promises on lone parent benefits, particularly in clause 68.
<P>
I return to the question of money, which the Minister mentioned before lunch. As I said then, &#163;200 million from the windfall tax and other proposals will be given over the next few years to the new deal for lone parents, but the savings from the changes to child benefit and other benefits to lone parents will save &#163;400 million over three years, so there will be an overall saving to the Treasury of &#163;200 million.
<P>
The so-called new deal is also worth examining in the context of this measure and lone parents. Two weeks ago the Secretary of State was busy telling everyone the results of the pilot schemes, which rest on the present plans of the Government to cut the benefit and implement their policy of calling in personal advisers. That policy will not help to achieve the Secretary of State's aim or live up to her rhetoric about why she is cutting the benefit in clause 68, because the scheme contains no element of compulsion. However, it was interesting that at Question Time yesterday, when challenged on that subject, then right hon. Lady refused to rule out compulsion and just kept repeating the soundbite of the day--that it is not an issue. She was not answering, but sidestepping the question.
<P>
We must get some answers from the Minister as to why the Secretary of State and the Government changed their policy once they were elected, directly contradicting what they promised the electorate during the run-up to the election, because this is a case of broken promises. Before the Minister repeats another soundbite--that the previous Government did nothing for lone parents--which we hear when discussing the cuts outlined in clause 68, I should like to remind him of a point that he failed or refused to recognise in last Wednesday's debate on lone parents, which is that he totally ignores the parent-plus policy of my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley).

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Keith Bradley): How much did the previous Government invest in parent-plus?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we go too far, I remind Members on both sides of the Committee that we are still debating clause 68 stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale, and much as I would like to be tempted by the Minister, I will follow your strict guidance.
<P>
In concluding my remarks, I point out that the other issue that the Minister will use as an argument to justify the provisions of clause 68 is the increases in help with child care announced by the Chancellor in his Budget in July. That completely ignores the help given at present to lone parents who receive the child benefit premium on their child care costs--introduced by the previous Government and, by the time they left office, worth &#163;60 a week.
<P>
In conclusion, we have now had this debate twice in different shapes and forms. We have asked the Minister a number of valid questions in the context of the Bill. We believe that those questions deserve to be answered, if only to understand why the Secretary of State has totally changed her position in six months. The Minister owes it not only to us and the proceedings of the Committee to answer those questions but to those outside the Committee Room who believed in the Labour party before the last election, so that they can better understand why they have been betrayed.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight (Arundel and South Downs):</B> My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) has presented in full the history of the U-turn on this issue that has been made by the Government, particularly by the Secretary of State for Social Security and the Prime Minister.
<P>
What are the Government's financial calculations on the savings to be made? Various bodies present different figures. The figure that I have seen is of the order of &#163;56 million a year. To be candid, that does not stack up as a justification for the measure that has been taken. The Government could easily have done some juggling and found &#163;45 million and, as the Prime Minister promised that he expected to do, they could have stayed within the spending limits for the area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that that amount of money had already been taken out of the base budget of the Department of Social Security before the election?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My understanding is that the Budget, as produced by the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, had assumed that savings would be made in this area. Precisely what the amounts are I cannot say. [Interruption.] With the greatest respect, I do not think that that is the point. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford pointed out, the Government have found significant sums to spend in other areas. It seems to us that there is a net additional cut beyond that which the previous Chancellor had planned in his Budget projections.
<P>
What is the motivation behind this volte face? It will not satisfy the Committee or the general public to be told that this is simply about &#163;45 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing that this cut is unnecessary, and would have been unnecessary had his party remained in government. Can he therefore assure us that if his party had remained in government, it would have reversed the cut? Or would it have gone ahead with an unnecessary cut?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The point was made very clearly by my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford that my party's position is clear. It believes in principle in being more evenhanded towards lone and two-parent families. Those were the proposals that my party made when in government. However, that is not the point, because we are not in government.
<P>
I understand from the notes provided that these provisions are intended to apply not to existng claimants but only to new claimants. Anyone who at present receives double child benefit will continue to get it, although until when is not clear. That suggests that some degree of disincentive is intended by these proposals. Where is the logic in grandfathering the existing arrangements but terminating them in the future? It is to get at the Government's underlying thinking that I ask for that point to be addressed.
<P>
Secondly, I can find nothing in clause 68 that embodies any pledge of clarity on the difference between existing and future claimants. Under what power do the Government propose to make that distinction?
<P>
Thirdly, I draw the Committee's attention to section 145 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, to which the clause relates. Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no rate prescribed in place of a rate previously in force shall be lower than the rate that it replaces.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, it acts as a ratchet--one can only increase child benefit, not decrease it.
<P>
Strangely, clause 68 specifically excludes lone parents from that provision, so the law will provide that while one can only increase child benefit for two-parent families, one can decrease child benefit for lone parent families. If nothing else, that is a strange legal route by which to address the problem. It will empower the Secretary of State, at least in theory, to up the one and down the other. Why have the Government chosen to address their alleged objective in that way? I suggest that it makes lone parents a group that is legally discriminated against in terms of the right to child benefit.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford said, the crucial question is: what are the Government thinking? They do not belong to the Conservative party--their party was elected on a promise, right up to the election, to change the Conservative proposals. I suggest that it is rank hypocrisy, so quickly after getting into power and without any justifiable financial need, to proceed with Conservative proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): Clause 68 is a tough measure by any count. In its original formulation by the previous Conservative Government, it gave many of us on the Conservative Benches cause for severe doubt and fear. We recognised that it was an exceptionally tough measure, affecting lone parents who may be in difficult circumstances. As we are fully aware, it is now accompanied by a series of other tough measures in the form of S.I.1997, No. 1790 which we debated a few days ago.
<P>
When the measure was conceived by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden, the then Secretary of State for Social Security, the reason why those of us on the Conservative Benches who had doubts and fears were reassured was that we understood that there was a cause for this tough and difficult measure.
<P>
<B>Ms Gisela Stuart </B>(Birmingham, Edgbaston): I am somewhat surprised by this mea culpa and heart searching by an hon. Member who did not enter the House until 1997 and yet who speaks of his feelings when he was on the Government Back Benches. Can he explain how it was possible for him to have those feelings in the days when he was not here?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> One is not born the day one enters the House of Commons. Some of us were alive and had been members of the party who took part in its policy deliberations for some years--in my case, about 15 years--before entering the House. We therefore had feelings on these matters, which we expressed. I venture to suggest that the hon. Lady herself may similarly have played a part in the Labour party's deliberations before entering the House. Certainly her party would have benefited from her interventions; whether the Conservative party benefited from mine is another issue.
<P>
The feelings of disquiet were genuinely held by many of us, but they met with an argument which convinced many of us. It was an argument about an important aspect of social policy: the necessity to avoid circumstances in which there was--or was conceived by many people to be--a strong incentive to enter temporary relationships, which could give rise to lone parenthood. It was recognised that many people fell into lone parenthood not because of any desire or action, but because of circumstances well beyond their control. It was acknowledged that the measure was tough, and that it was directed at many people who were not subject to the incentive that we were trying to create. Nevertheless, we felt that it was extraordinarily important to redress the balance.
<P>
Hon. Members may feel, as the Liberal Democrats felt then and feel now, that that argument was insufficient for so tough a measure. That debate is perfectly rational. The Committee is considering, however, clause 68 as proposed by a Government who have specifically disavowed the rational argument that reassured and convinced many of us, in the face of the tough action of the clause and the accompanying measures on income-related benefits. The Government have disavowed the rationale that persuaded those of us who care about the people involved and their fate that such a measure should be introduced--and yet they are still introducing it. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford has eloquently and repeatedly pointed out, the Government are introducing the measure after making many clear statements that they would not do so. What is the rationale for that?
<P>
I should admit that I come to the Committee with some anticipatory enthusiasm, because I look forward to hearing from the Minister any sensible further justification for the inclusion of clause 68 in the Bill. No clear justification was given in relation to its accompanying provisions when we debated S.I. 1997, No. 1790. In that debate, the Minister began, however, to sketch his argument. That argument consists, I suppose, of two parts: one negative, one positive. The negative part is the Government's assertion that a lone-parent premium is no longer necessary because, with the new deal, lone parents will find work. How readily and gratefully the Opposition could accept that negative argument, if it were true or evidenced. I am surprised that Labour Members can argue that it is with any confidence. I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister makes that argument with any confidence, in the light of the evidence so far obtained. As the Opposition understand it, 9,000 people were contacted, of whom about 2,000 were interviewed; about 1,600 having taken up the new deal--1,600 out of 9,000 is less than 25 per cent. That this has occurred to date is merely one piece of evidence. We should look further, and ask whether there is a sufficiently reasonable prospect of the new deal working to justify arguing that the premium is not required simply because the new deal will take care of the circumstances that it was intended to address.
<P>
For the answer, hon. Members should look to the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott). I hope to provoke an answer from the Minister to a clear, simple and honest question of great importance, which he was asked in our discussion of Statutory Instrument 1997, No. 1790: what is his view of the rational, powerful and decisive interventions of the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington early in the discussion of the new deal? Her comments were based on 10 years of profound experience of a constituency in which I had the misfortune to fight the 1987 election against the hon. Lady and lose. The constituency contains an enormous miscellany of lone parents: in many respects, they are the very people whom the new deal is supposed to help.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington said that, on any dispassionate analysis, the vast majority of the people to whom the new deal was meant to be directed were unlikely to be attracted into work.
<P>
What does the Minister think about that decisive intervention? If he concedes that the hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington is right, he can begin to rescue the negative strand of his argument. He could tell the Committee--or, in due course, the Secretary of State could tell the nation--that compulsion was to be introduced to the new deal. As has been pointed out, a few days ago the Secretary of State merely contented herself with repeating that that was not the issue. In the context of clause 68, however, it is.
<P>
In the absence of compulsion or incentive, and given the devastating critique of the hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, the Minister cannot advance the negative side of his argument--that the new deal will take care of the problem--because he cannot make the new deal work. To introduce legislation on the negative premise that it is supported by the new deal's ability to work, and in the face of opposition from members of the governing party, would surely be irresponsible.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The fact that the hon. Gentleman keeps repeating that his speech is in the context of clause 68 does not mean that the Chair shares that view. The debate is about clause 68, not the new deal. The hon. Gentleman has strayed far enough, and should return to the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful for that admonition, Mr. Gale.
<P>
However, the Minister may also advance a positive argument in support of clause 68. Indeed, I expect him to say that the measure can be justified by the fact that it will save money. No doubt he will tell the Committee that the previous Government's motivation was not, as I have tried to suggest, merely to redress the balance of incentives, but to save money. He will say that Conservative Members therefore have no business in criticising clause 68, which saves money.
<P>
Yet Conservative Members would never have accepted a measure with such an effect on a specific group of people if its sole rationale were to save money. In public administration, money can be saved in many ways: many Opposition Members are probably more hawkish about that than Government Members. But to use as a rationale for the policy the fact that it will save money, given the type of people who will be affected by the change of administrative practice, would be a tawdry way to govern.
<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> The hon. Gentleman is indulging in a burst of moral outrage. There are 1 million single parents bringing up 2 million children in poverty. Will the hon. Gentleman name a single thing that the previous Administration did to help those people out of poverty and back into the mainstream of society?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I hope, Mr. Gale, that you will not rule me out of order if I answer that question. I very much want to, and I shall deal with it in private with the hon. Lady later if I am not allowed to here.
<P>
The answer is clear. The ultimate solution to the problem of lone parents has two elements and may be common ground among all hon. Members. First, lone parents should be in work. We do not believe that the new deal will work, but we have no quarrel with the Government and their motivations behind it. Secondly, in many cases people should not be lone parents. We would have liked them to be living in other circumstances. We should have liked to have seen lone parents in work. Many strands of policy related to getting them back to work, one of which was directed specifically towards removing the incentive to be a lone parent--the set of benefits that we have been discussing.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Lady disagrees with me, but the source of my moral outrage is that the Government, by the introduction of the measure, have specifically disavowed that rationale. In the absence of a positive rationale other than the saving of money, the measure remains tawdry.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): The hon. Gentleman is advancing two theses: one on the moral side with which I do not agree and the other on the financial side. Would be like to substitute for the measure one that would remove money from reserves, thereby using a one-off measure to substitute for revenue, or advance your theory that the &#163;3.5 billion should be substituted for it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not my theory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not know whether it is intentional or otherwise, but it is clear that Labour Members are trying to move me as far away as possible from discussing clause 68--to which you will no doubt bring me back, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Please be assured that I will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My argument is not about whether it is appropriate for the Government to save money in general, but whether the measure is one that any sensible or compassionate Government would take exclusively to save money. I do not believe that Labour Members, if they genuinely inspected their consciences, could conceivably support the proposition that the best way in which to save money, given the multitude of ways in which to do so, would be to deprive lone parents of a premium. The proposition strikes Conservative Members as so implausible as to be extraordinary, especially in the light of the many statements ot the contrary made by the Secretary of State and other members of the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Hope </B>(Corby): Will the hon. Gentleman remind me whether it was the policy of the previous Conservative Administration to remove the item from their base budget and that, in fact, he is condemning Conservative policy?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I detect a note of dissent in Committee this afternoon on this issue. I understand the desire of certain members of the Committee to ask questions, but it would be helpful if those questions remained broadly within the ambit of clause 68. To do otherwise will simply prolong the debate which, I suspect, they wish to curtail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. Perhaps I may intrude a little further on your patience for a second and take up that point. I have not been condemning the measure, but explaining that it should have been supported--tough as it is--by a rationale. I have been arguing that that rationale has been replaced by the exclusive tawdry concern to save money. I accept that it is necessary in many dimensions to save money, but the measure is certainly tawdry in that application and it cannot be justified. Naturally, given the effects of social policy, if a Government move in that direction, any Chancellor of the Exchequer who knows how to do his sums will include savings from such a measure in the Budget. We have no complaint about that. We would do--and did--the same.
<P>
I return to my message of hope to the Minister; it has a certain ringing irony to it. The measure is the sole clause that we have discussed so far about which we can say with undiluted enthusiasm that we are delighted to find that it provides for the actions undertaken to be undertaken by regulation--regulation unconstrained in all its glory.
<P>
Clause 68 tells us that regulations may ``revoke'' or ``vary''. That offers the Minister the most remarkable opportunity to overcome the problem. He may wish to rescue the Government from the multiple troubles of having abandoned the rationale that would alone justify the clause; having put forward a negative argument for it that does not stand up; having made a positive argument for it that is insufficient in character; and having turned tail on a settled policy upon which many people relied. The Minister has the magnificent opportunity to use the power to make those particular regulations--a policy stance that would be supported by many Conservative Members.
<P>
Clause 68 is not wrong in itself but wrong because of the motives of those proposing it. The Minister has the means at his disposal to solve that problem and to solve his problems of conscience. We expect to hear from him either that he believes our arguments to be false on rational and considered grounds, in particular whether the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, upon whose observations so much depends, was wrong; or to admit that the Government have no adequate basis for the provisions of Clause 68 and to assure us that they will use the power they give themselves not to make the changes involved.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride (Bromsgrove):</B> It is with some trepidation that I follow my hon. Friends. They have given a good exposition of our objections to the Government's proposals, and spoken of the Government's explanations--or lack of them. We accept that it was originally our measure and, for reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) explained with stunning intellectual clarity, we agree with them. I do not envy the Minister. He is now reading his notes; he will need to beef up on them because the clause will be difficult to explain away.
<P>
I am quite surprised that Labour Members should see fit to interrupt us only to question us about previous Conservative policies. I thought that many of their constituents would want them to justify clause 68, especially as many voted for them on the ground that the Government were not proposing to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> My hon. Friend said that she is surprised that Labour Members have not spoken except to intervene. Their constituents will want to know their views, and the letters that we have sent to the editors of their local newspapers may help elicit a reply.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> It would be interesting to hear their views. I shall watch with great interest for their response in my part of the country, when they try to justify voting with the Government without explanation, especially as many of the electorate will not approve of them voting in that way. We wait with bated breath for the Minister to give his reasons.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State for Social Security, the right hon. Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), made a remarkable speech. Despite listing the major planks of the Bill, she failed to mention her reasons for bringing forward legislation that she had so roundly condemned when it was suggested by the Conservative Administration.
<P>
I feel sorry for the Minister, as he will have to explain his Department's and the Government's decisions and to clarify some of the points that we have raised this evening. We cannot understand why the Government should bring forward such a Bill when they condemned us for wishing to do the same. We would be pleased to hear the Minister justify it to us, to his Back Benchers--and to the electorate, who will, in the end, be his judge and jury.
<P>
We in the Conservative party do not have a problem with the measure. Indeed, it was proposed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I agree with many of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset; we have a broad spectrum of single mothers in Great Britain--there are 1.5 million, 1 million of whom live on benefit in a life that cannot be very satisfactory to either them or their children. We have always understood that the people who make up the group of single parents are diverse, despite the vilification that we have received in the past for our views, which have been distorted. We know that people become single parents for a huge variety of reasons. My mother became a single parent because she was a widow. It was a perfectly respectable, if unhappy, state to find herself in at 42. Other women may be abandoned in a relationship that they thought would be one for the future, but which sadly does not turn out that way because the man involved sees it differently.
<P>
I also agree with the points that my hon. Friends have made about the fact that there are some women, albeit a minority, who perhaps see the tax and benefits system as an opportunity to marry the state. They have done that, but should be discouraged from doing so. The measure, when it was originally proposed, was justified on the ground that it was someone's choice to be a single parent; but in making that choice, she should not be advantaged by having a better financial position than parents who lived as a married or cohabiting couple.

<P>

<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): In the hon. Lady's world view, there appears to be deserving lone parents--those who are widowed or abandoned by a male partner--and undeserving lone parents who marry the state. Will she accept that even on her view, which I do not share, the Government's proposal will penalise both the deserving and undeserving equally?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point and we must, therefore, proceed with some caution. The measure that we proposed in our Budget before we lost the election was a cautious one, designed to send out a signal. While choosing to see a difference in the motives of single parents, we cannot make completely moral judgments because, as a society, we have a duty to the children, who must be looked after and nurtured by taxpayers' money. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset explained, we sought to change the system so that there was no perceived advantage in choosing one way of life over another, and so that cohabiting or married couples received the same benefits and would be in much the same position as lone parents.
<P>
I accept that there is a limit to how far the state can proceed with such a measure, which is why we are keen to hear the Government's rationale for it. It is not good enough to say that it was bequeathed by the former Conservative Administration, so the Government will proceed with it. They should exercise their own judgment and explain why they are proceeding with the measure. It is not true that there was no other options that the Government could have chosen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend's argument, which is not one that occurred to me before, is very helpful. Is it not true that if the Government's sole rationale for the measure is to save money, by contrast with the argument that my hon. Friend is rightly advancing--that there are natural limits to the extent to which the policy can decently be pursued--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand that the Official Reporters are having difficulty hearing the hon. Gentleman because he is not facing the Chair and the microphones.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise, Mr. Gale. In my enthusiasm to intervene, I addressed the wrong part of the Room. If the Government's rationale for the measure is solely to save money, rather than imposing the constraints which, as my hon. Friend said, should attend such a policy, the Government could in theory press the matter to the extreme and discriminate against lone parents, in favour of married or cohabiting couples. Indeed, they could entirely deprive lone parents of child benefit or take any other measures against lone parents, because when one is unconstrained by any rationale other than the saving of money, one can take any such measure.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend, as usual, makes an excellent point. Will the Minister clarify the measure? Can he confirm that the Government will not make any other cut in lone parent benefit and does he accept that there is a limit beyond which such differentiation should not go? Will the cut be the final one or does the Minister reserve the right to make further cuts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I repeat that the way in which clause 18 is drafted has the extraordinary legal effect that child benefit for married parents cannot be cut, while lone parent benefit can be cut. Why has the clause been drafted as it has if that is not the intent?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for pointing that out because Opposition Members deserve answers to our questions. I am sure that the Minister's hon. Friends would also like to know precisely what they are voting for tonight. One parent benefit might in future be cut more severely than the benefit for married couples; the measure will go further than is apparent by not only harmonising benefits but cutting the benefit available to single parents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Lady is taking us a stage further in her response to the interventions of my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight). Does she agree that a possible way out of the dilemma, which is of the Government's own making--that the new deal is unsuccessfully being used as an argument to permit the clause--would be to make use of the regulation-making power to diminish further the benefit? Such use could also be made of parallel regulation-making powers to diminish yet further the benefits debated under SI 1997/1790 to the point where there was effectively compulsion--simply by reducing to the point of absurdity, so to speak, the benefits available for lone parents.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Yet again, my hon. Friend makes an interesting and valid point. We have been led to certain assumptions from contributions from the Government Benches, and the Minister's silence on the issue in the past. In the discussion last Wednesday in another place the Government were relatively silent on the issue; the Secretary of State for Social Security was similarly silent on Second Reading. Government lips have therefore been closed on the issue and we want to establish exactly what is being proposed before the Minister answers so that we can finally have clarification of the issues that concern us. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset said, the Government may further cut lone parent benefit--an assumption that can be made both from the way in which the legislation has been drafted and the fact that the only justification for the cut seems to be the saving of money, a measure that was already implicit in the Budget decision left to the Minister by the Conservative Administration. If the saving of money is the sole criterion, I would respectfully suggest--although not advocate--that more money could be saved. We would therefore like the Minister to make it clear whether further savings are to be derived from the lone parent premium, whether the Department intends to reduce the premium further and whether he will promise that the cut will be the last that the new Administration intend to make, so that that can be put on record.
<P>
If the Chancellor of the Exchequer decides that his Budget needs further pruning, he can offer up the measure in a Treasury spending round, as that will not require further parliamentary scrutiny. When considering departmental budgets, it is much easier for the Government to cut such provisions than those that require further legislation in the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Browne </B>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun): Try as I might, I cannot see any basis for the hon. Lady's interpretive flight of fantasy. The provision in subsection (1) to which she refers prescribes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a higher rate of child benefit''.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I would ask the Minister to reply to the hon. Gentleman's point, as I am not asking that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend. In the interpretation of statutes, it is usual to read more than two or three words to understand the import of a clause or subsection. The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) is in the narrowest sense correct about subsection (1), but that is like being right in the proposition that one is moving sideways when one is also moving over a cliff. The overall effect of subsection (1), as I have no doubt the Minister will assure us, is to enable the Government to make regulations to reduce the rate of lone parent premiums.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am, as the House knows, the most tolerant and mild-mannered of men, but I detect that the argument is becoming circuitous. Members of the Committee have said on a number of occasions that they want to hear the Minister's arguments, so I trust that it will not be too long before we can.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. It is the job of Conservative Members to look carefully at the Government's proposals. We await to find out, on these very specific points, whether the Minister believes that he has the power further to reduce lone parent premiums. We want his interpretation of the clause to be put on the record, to make it clear whether the interpretation of the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun is more accurate than ours.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend might find it helpful to point out that the clause heading is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Power to reduce child benefit for lone parents''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Does she agree that that is fairly explicit?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Unlike the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, I do not have a legal brain, but the heading suggests to my untutored brain that we are talking about a power to reduce lone parent premiums. Again, we await the Minister's clarification.
<P>
I note that Labour members of the Committee are keen to interrupt our speeches but have not yet risen to support the Government. What the Government are doing is anathema to what they said in opposition. When the Conservative Administration proposed the measures, the current Secretary of State told The Independent that she would not implement them. The right hon. Lady has been a champion of single parents for many years--certainly when I was a journalist--and has many times stressed on the record the importance of the lone parent premium to the income of a family supported by a single parent.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is no getting away from the fact that in the public's perception--and, in my view, in reality--the Government are being hypocritical, having said one thing before they were elected on 1 May and doing precisely the opposite now. The Minister may well stand behind the phrase that we often hear from the Government Benches, which is that there are hard choices to make. I suppose that hypocrisy is a hard choice, but that is what this measure boils down to. Many people will have voted Labour while not for one minute believing that a Labour Government would ratify the measure proposed by the Conservative Government before they lost the election on 1 May.
<P>
We Conservative members have a clear conscience, because when we were elected on 1 May our electorate knew that we supported this measure. The electorate of Labour Members of the Committee did not believe that they would support this measure, and they will want answers from them as to why they are now doing so. Labour Members may say that they never intended to oppose the measure, but their constituents deserve answers as to why they now support it.
<P>
To say that it was already included in the spending plans of the former Conservative Government is not good enough. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset said, there must be an intellectual underpinning of why the Government are proposing this measure. It is not good enough to say, ``Oh, well it saves some money.'' That raises the prospect of all sorts of other cuts that could be found in a social security budget that now amounts to almost &#163;100 billion. There must be a raison d'etre as to why you are willing to proceed now--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must remind the hon. Lady that I am not proposing anything.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Forgive me, Mr. Gale. This is my first Committee, and I am sorry if I have not been addressing my comments through the Chair, as I should be.
<P>
It is difficult to understand why the Government want to proceed in this way. I return to the point about money, which has been at the forefront of much of our discussion this afternoon and this morning. The Government propose to raise about &#163;3 billion from the windfall tax--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady is now going very wide of the mark. I trust that she will stick to clause 68 and will fairly soon bring her remarks to a conclusion.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. Let us return to the welfare to work programme and the &#163;240 million that the Government propose to provide as a counterbalance to the fact that they are axing lone parent premium. I think that it was the Conservative Government who first introduced a benefit to enable mothers who so wished to go out to work. I accept that the Government are providing new money, and that they are going further with a policy introduced by a Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Can the hon. Lady confirm that the measure that she is describing is parent-plus and how much the previous Government invested in it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I call Miss Kirkbride.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I am happy to give way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Would my hon. Friend like to confirm to the Minister that &#163;20 million was spent on 12 pilot schemes?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I would be delighted to confirm the sum involved. The fact that we piloted the measure shows that we were prudent in how we proceeded; we wanted to see whether the system would work. From my journalistic experience, I was astonished when the Government, having won the election, presented their welfare to work programme as a new idea, because they were in fact copying a good idea of the previous Conservative Administration and taking it further. They must be congratulated on taking it further, but it was not a new idea; the previous Government had introduced it on a pilot basis to establish its cost-effectiveness.
<P>
The Government's determination to suggest that the policy has been an unqualified success is premature. I understand that the figures published the other week on how many women had returned to work--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am aware that this is the first Committee on which the hon. Lady has served, but I have now reminded her three times to stay within the confines of clause 68. I would be most grateful if she would do so.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Forgive me, Mr. Gale. As clause 68 is counterbalanced by a programme that the Government want to introduce to encourage mothers to return to work, I though it germane to the debate to explain how the Government's policy is wrong and, therefore, to suggest that it requires further scrutiny.
<P>
In fact, one in 20 women returned to work as a result of the Government's programme, rather than one in four of the women who came forward to participate in the programme. One in 20 women might be expected to return to work anyway without the Government's help. If 1&#183;5 million women, or rather people--I must not be too specific--are lone parents, 1 million of whom are on benefit, one in three might be willing to return to work without the incentives offered by this or the previous Government.
<P>
The Government's proposal has severe implications. We are keen to hear the Government explain the measure. We are especially keen to hear what Government Back Benchers think about the measure. I shall now succumb to your admonition, Mr. Gale, and sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I hope that I will not take up so much of the Committee's time, but I should like to make one or two points and ask the Government some questions.
<P>
Some of the briefing papers that we have been given say much about the real cost savings that the Government hope to make under the clause. No doubt, the Government have calculated their own figures. Unless they expect every single lone mother in the country to return to work under their welfare to work programme, there will be some who are on the margin of deciding whether to return to work. In those marginal cases, there will be a greater incentive to return to work if the extra lone parent premium is still added to their child benefit.
<P>
Therefore, unless we assume that every lone mother will return to work if the clause stands part of the Bill--frankly, that is not a realistic assumption--some mother will not return to work who otherwise would have done. So there will be an effect on the Government's tax and benefits position because of those who do not return to work who have done had the benefit been kept.
<P>
What estimate have the Government made of the amount that must be netted off the savings because of those mothers who will now choose not to return to work who otherwise would have done so? If they have made no such estimate, when will they do so? I wonder whether that estimate will show that the programme is not so valuable as they like to think and, therefore, the incentive for proceeding with the clause is less than they might expect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> I wish to clarify whether the hon. Gentleman understands the provision in the way that I do: it will not apply to existing claimants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I understand that exactly, but it makes no difference to my argument about whether women who may in future be lone parents will have an incentive to go back to work. The hon. Gentleman's intervention was not relevant to that. Will the Minister give me an estimate--if he or his officials have arrived at one--of the amount that needs to be netted off the Government's savings thanks to those women who will not go back to work who might otherwise have done so?
<P>
My second question relates particularly to lone parents. What do the Government expect to do to help lone parents with child care should their children have particular difficulties or special needs? Sadly, as we all know from our experience with constituents, many children with special needs end up in single-parent homes. Often, such children cause special difficulties in families. That is sad, but it is a fact of human life, which we all have to accept. Sometimes such difficulties lead to family break-up and when that happens, families need special help to make sure that the welfare-to-work programme works as well as it should. Does the Minister have special plans to help in particular lone parents who have children with special needs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise for being slow on the move, but I want to take the hon. Gentleman back a few seconds to his reply to the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne). Does his interpretation of the situation differ from mine--perhaps he can ask the Minister to clarify it. There is nothing in clause 68 to limit its effect. It could be used to make regulations that would affect all existing and new lone parents and any limitation would presumably be introduced only in regulations. Unless I am mistaken, the point that the hon. Member for Newbury is making has a wider application than the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I would be happy to leave that question to the Minister to answer. It does not affect my argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It strengthens it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, it strengthens it.
<P>
The point that I was in the middle of making when the hon. Member for West Dorset intervened concerned lone parent families that have special difficulties because of children with special needs. If the Government are to rely so heavily on the welfare-to-work programme to get single mothers back to work, special allowance should be made for child care in families with children with special needs or a disability. I hope that the Minister can give us some reassurance on that point.
<P>
On timing, it is unfortunate--to put it at its mildest--that we are trying to introduce a clause that will take effect in the spring of next year when the full new deal goes national only in the autumn. There is at present no national child care strategy of the sort about which the Government are talking so much. Surely, it would have been better for the Government to wait until the other measures on which they are relying to enable them to go ahead with the provisions in the clause were in place before cutting back the lone parent premium, as they plan to do.
<P>
It is generally accepted that the relative cost to single parents and couples of bringing up children is uncertain. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon has already noted, there is growing evidence that lone parents face higher costs. There is, however, evidence to support different views on that question. If the Government are to go ahead with the measures before us, they should surely have waited until the eivdence became clear. The Government have taken their decision on the basis of guesswork and have admitted that they do not know what the evidence shows and that it is not sufficiently full and complete for them to make a proper decision. Surely they should have at least waited for that evidence.
<P>
That would have tied in with what I was saying about trying to implement the welfare-to-work programme and the cut in lone parent benefit at the same time. I suggest to the Government that they have, at best, got their timing badly awry in pushing through this clause at this time. It seems likely from the evidence produced so far that lone parents suffer greater costs and it is, therefore, only fair that they should be given a higher child benefit premium than couples.
<P>
Last Wednesday, in another Committee which most hon. Members here attended, my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon pointed out that statistics clearly showed that a large proportion of lone parents--a much larger proportion than of couples with children--are below the poverty line. Although that in itself is not absolute proof that lone parents face problems greater that those faced by couples, it is an indication. That is quite contrary to the line taken by Conservative Members in this and other debates.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It looks as though lone parents are already facing financial hardship greater than that faced by couples. If that is true now, clearly the situation will be worse if we go ahead with the cut in the premium for lone parents, and the last thing we want to do is make a bad situation worse.
<P>
I shall spend a short time addressing some of the remarks of Conservative Members. They have been accusing the Government of hypocrisy on this issue just as they did last Wednesday--and, of course, they are right, as we said then. However, it sickens me to hear Conservative Members accusing the Government of hypocrisy when the Conservative Govermnent introduced the measure. They have done their level best to seem to be an opposition to the Government on the clause, but if they introduced it, it seems to me that in practice they must still be in favour of it. They have not been using the Committee's time sensibly or well in spending hour after hour simply complaining about hypocrisy when they want the clause to go through.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I appreciate that the hon. Gentlemans's party rides high on self-righteousness, but if he had listened to my contribution in the Committee last Wednesday, my contribution today and the contributions of my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) on Second Reading, he would know that we have made no secret of the fact that our view in opposition is consistent with the view that we held in government. We do not oppose clause 68 and we have not been trying to do so in the debate. We are simply appalled by the hypocrisy of the Government who have changed their view in that time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The interesting difference between the Conservative party and us is that we have openly acknowledged, during the short time in which the Government have been in power, that they have taken actions that we support. Indeed, they have taken up some of our ideas. One has only to consider the independence of the Bank of England, which was not in their manifesto, but they did a U-turn and came round to our position, and I am happy to say that we accepted that. It is noticeable that the difference between what Conservative Members have been saying in the Committee and what we have been saying is that they are trying to pretend that they are opposing something--not necessarily the clause, but the actions of the Government--but they ought to be saying to the Government ``Yes, thank heavens, you have got it right. We support what you are now saying.'' That would have been the sensible way forward, and it would be constructive, rather than destructive, opposition.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) said--which is in line with the intervention by the hon. Member for West Chelmsford--``We do not have a problem with the clause.'' I am delighted that she laid that on the line. It is slightly different from the argument made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, which appeared to be that the measure was unnecessary and that the Labour party in government could happily have stayed within the budget laid down by the Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> With respect, my point was clear: we certainly proposed the measure, but merely saving &#163;45 million was in itself insufficient grounds for the Labour party to propose the measure when its philosophical base was different from ours. Several of my colleagues have also made that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Indeed, the hon. Member for West Dorset went further in saying that the measure was exceptionally tough. At one point he seemed to be about to speak against it--I was delighted--but, sadly, he fell back on arguments about social matters with which he continued for the rest of his speech. In a sense, his were also the arguments of the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset appeared to argue that the measure was necessary because it would force people into marriage--it would not allow them an incentive to remain unmarried. He seemed to think that persuading battered wives to stay with their husbands, rather than giving them a huge incentive to leave, was a good thing just because they would get a higher child benefit premium for first children. I am not sure, but perhaps he was suggesting that wives might be happy to become widows--to do away with their husbands, even--in a desperate effort to get hold of this special child benefit. I do not know which planet the hon. Gentleman has been living on, but it is not the same one as I am living on.
<P>
Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that a woman would decide whether to go to bed with her young man and become pregnant because she would get extra child benefit in the form of the premium? Is he suggesting that that is the way in which human relationships work? It seems to me that he is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Despite the sarcastic tone in which he makes them, the hon. Gentleman's points are serious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> He is an old Etonian.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It is perhaps because of his old Etonian status that the hon. Gentleman is making those serious points. They have troubled some of us for a considerable time. He is absolutely right: people do not at given moments in their lives make crucial decisions because they have summoned from the vast data bank in their mind the full array of social security payments. However, does he accept that there is a tendency, however much he may hope to disguise it from himself, for people to be rational in their disposition? Is there not a relationship--its strength is debatable--between the money to be gained by doing certain things and people's behaviour? If he accepts that there is such a relationship, will he further accept that the general trend--I am not referring to a specific case--of the imbalance between child benefit and other benefits related to lone parents and benefits related to partners or married couples would have an effect--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That should have been an intervention, not a speech. I should also tell the hon. Member for Newbury that it is in order for hon. Members to comment on the remarks of other hon. Members, but the Minister usually replies to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendell:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I shall be delighted to hear the Minister replying--I hope that he will make some of the same points.
<P>
It is odd to suggest that single women want to become mothers because of financial incentives. In fact, almost all women are aware that becoming a single mother would almost certainly bring about considerable poverty unless they had huge back-up from their families. The financial incentive, even with the single parent premium, is hugely against, not in favour of, becoming a single mother. Women are not becoming single mothers because of the premium.
<P>
The measure is appalling. To my mind, it is a considerable disincentive to work; indeed, it is exactly opposite to the principle of helping women back to work, on which the Government are supposed to be working. Introducing this clause is contrary to the rest of the Government's policy. That is why it is not surprising that, happily, we expect that we will have rather more support from those on the Labour Benches if we get a chance, as I hope we will, to debate the issue again if we cannot throw out the clause today. I hope that we will have a chance to debate the clause in the House because, along with clause 70, it is such a critical part of the Bill.
<P>
I hope that a number of Government Members will, to their credit, be proud to get rid of this clause on the Floor of the House and that it would be a matter of pride for the Labour party that at least a proportion of them agree that the clause should not be in the Bill. It will damage work incentives for single women, cause dire poverty to get much worse and should never have been entertained by any Labour Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): What a pleasure it was to see Government Back Benchers come alive during this debate. I hope that we shall have substantive contributions from at least some of them, contrary to their frozen inactivity in last Wednesday's debate. I understand their unease. It is not simply because my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford has taken the trouble and care to write to the editors of their local newspapers on this matter. It is also because I imagine that, even without such assistance, their local papers and those who read them will have a few difficult questions to put to them when they return to their constituencies at the weekend. I dare say that the same thing happened last weekend following our debate last Wednesday.
<P>
There really is no excuse for what we are witnessing. It is no good Labour Members complaining and talking about what was or was not Conservative policy prior to 1 May. The fact remains that, unlike the Liberal Democrats who, even when they are running a local council behave as if they are in opposition, it is not open to Labour Members to behave as if they are still in opposition. Whatever one's views of what happened on 1 May, the fact is that Labour Members are in Government, and will all go down with this particular ship, whether they like it or not.
<P>
Labour Members have to justify the decisions of their Government, not only to themselves, this Committee and the House but to their voters. I hope that when they respond to the letters to their local papers, whether for my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford or their own voters, they will have a good story to tell.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Do the letters that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are writing to the local papers confirm that the Conservatives are also in favour of this measure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I have not seen the letter. [Laughter] However, it will not be going to my local newspaper editor.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury laboured long and hard in his speech to make the very obvious point that this clause was the policy of the previous Government. No one on the Conservative Benches is quibbling with that. With respect, I think that he wasted a great deal of time making that point.
<P>
My point is that we are, at least for the time being, the Opposition. It is the Government who make the decisions. The Government have choices--hard choices often, but choices none the less. We know that there are Government Back Benchers who are uneasy about this policy. It is up to them to do what they can to change it. No one, least of all the hon. Member for Newbury, can claim that my party went into the last election on this issue with a false prospectus. That can certainly be said about the Labour Party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> In expanding the point on the false prospectus, does my hon. Friend agree that the Committee will have suffered from two false prospectuses if we do not receive assurances from the Minister about two matters? First, he should assure us that there will be no further reductions beyond the removal of the premium, which is permitted by the regulations. Secondly, he should say that the regulations will not be used to take measures against existing lone parents. If subsequent measures were set in hand, would not the statements about the clause in the notes on clauses be falsified?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for those telling points, with which I hope that the Minister will deal.
<P>
Just as no Parliament can bind its successor, so no Government can bind theirs. The Chancellor has claimed to have adopted the previous Conservative Government's spending plans for two years but, despite protestations to the contrary, priorities within budgets and between departmental budgets have been reshuffled. I suspect that that will continue to happen.
<P>
Choices can be made. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the problem was inherited from the previous Government. There was no compulsion to take over the policy, which is contrary to the basis on which the general election campaign was fought. That campaign affected many constituencies with a higher than average proportion of lone parents. The Government must explain why they are pursuing this policy. The policy is theirs: they must justify it.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats say what one would expect. They run up and down the touchline of national politics, appealing to particular interest groups. They have not been and will not be the Government. Unlike the official Opposition, they are not even a Government in waiting. They can make rash promises to any number of interest groups, of which lone parents just happen to be the flavour of the week.
<P>
The job of the official Opposition is to put across the hard choices open to the Government and to ensure that the Government weigh and take account of the opinions of outside organisations, about this Bill and other legislation. Such bodies purport to speak for those people--who are our constituents--who will be affected by the clause and by the regulations made under it. It is our job as Opposition Members to communicate those worries and reservations.
<P>
Members of the Committee will have received many representations from organisations on this subject, and a number were canvassed in detail last Wednesday. A couple of organisations raised several cogent points that deserve the Committee's consideration and detailed responses from the Minister.
<P>
The National Association of Citizens Bureaux has compiled an excellent briefing, which states that the clause's proposal to cut child benefit will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``make the transition from unemployment to work far more difficult for lone parents who in many cases face higher costs than couples from having sole responsibility for childcare costs and household bills.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The briefing goes on to say that the extra child benefit paid to lone parents is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a small but important recognition of the extra costs that working lone parents bear particularly in relation to child care.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The briefing details some case studies from the NACAB files. I do not know how representative the cases are, but they have been reported to the national body by local citizens advice bureaux. I think that I speak for all hon. Members when I say that this country is fortunate to have that network of bureaux: certainly in my constituency they do an excellent job of dealing with a range of problems.
<P>
The briefing offers various examples. First, a CAB in Suffolk
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reported the case of a woman with two children under four years of age who had recently separated. She was working 30 hours a week, and left the children with a registered child minder charging &#163;1.50 an hour for each child. After child care costs, she was left with &#163;58.25 per week to cover all other expenses--including the mortgage.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Another example, taken at random from the list, comes from a CAB in the west Midlands, which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reported the case of a single parent who commenced a job earning &#163;50 per week. She had been influenced in taking the job by the belief that she would get extra help with child care costs. However, because she qualified for maximum family credit, this was not possible. Out of a total income of &#163;106.50 per week, she had to pay &#163;40 to a child minder. As a result, she gave up her job after two weeks.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The CAB briefing goes on to make a point that has been made by other members of the Committee and by other organisations about the upward trend in the number of lone parents in Britain. No matter how much hon. Members may regret that trend and deprecate some of the reasons for it, all political parties have to accept that it is the reality.
<P>
The briefing also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``lone parents moving from income support to work, even if claiming family credit, increase their income and draw less from the public purse.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It cites ample evidence, of which that is one example, of the low earnings of many lone parents. According to the CAB, 43 per cent. of lone parents on family credit earn less than &#163;80 per week, compared to 32 per cent. of main earners in couples on family credit.
<P>
The briefing states that, apart from all other considerations, those lone parents are likely to be ``impoverished.'' It examines the burden of debt that lone parents often carry, their obligations and outgoings, and the likelihood that they will have a significant amount of debt by the time that they enter the system. It quotes from the Government's paper ``A New Deal For Lone Parents'', which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Lone parents are more likely to appear in the bottom of the income distribution and are more likely to remain there.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The briefing refers in conclusion to the sense of making special provision to encourage lone parents to move off benefit and into work. Fairly, it recognises the Government's explicit recognition of that in their new deal for lone parents. We have heard a lot about that already. It goes on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This contradiction with clause 68 will be apparent to those lone parents who move from income support to work under the new deal, only to find themselves back on income support a few months later--but at a new, lower rate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have heard a bit about timing from various hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Newbury. It certainly chimes in with the NACAB's view that if the Government are intent on reducing the benefits, they should at least wait until the great flagship policy of the new deal has been shown to work, or otherwise. Opposition Members have reservations about its success. With only eight pilot schemes currently in the pipeline, and &#163;150 million promised over the lifetime of this Parliament, that amount is likely to be a great deal less than the overall amount of the reductions that are envisaged under clause 68. It seems to Opposition Members that even in the Government's own policies, there is not only a credibility gap, but a time gap between the proper introduction of the new deal, and the proposals set out for early next year under clause 68.
<P>
The National Council for One Parent Families has been quoted more than once in the Committee, and extensively last Wednesday in a debate on the same topic. It is clear cut. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This policy acts as a disincentive and not an incentive to work.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear cut. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This policy acts as a disincentive and not an incentive to work.''
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Webb:</B> Could the hon. Gentleman explain the point of reading out the briefing of an organisation which opposes the measure that he supports? Does he feel that he will achieve anything by doing that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful for that intervention, impertinent though it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The hon. Member for Northavon is a professor and my hon. Friend is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I do not want to cross swords with a genuine intellectual. If, however, the hon. Gentleman had been listening to my introductory remarks, he might have picked up my comment that it is part of our job as the official Opposition--a title to which I know he and his hon. Friend the Member for Newbury aspire: to which I would say, ``dream on''--to put across the views of these organisations in Committee. That is part of the Committee's task. It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to take that line, with all the knowledge and experience of the House that he can deploy, but if there have to be lots of silent hon. Members on the Government Benches, who are saying absolutely nothing apart from getting a bit upset at the suggestion that they have reneged on their election promises, it behoves members of the official Opposition to put these views across.
<P>
I am not saying that all these views have the Waterson seal of approval, but they have a right to be heard. If Parliament and the Committee have any function, it is as a forum for all such views to be heard. They will not be heard through the speeches of Labour Members, that is for sure. I doubt if they will receive more than a respectful nod from the Minister when he comes to wind up, so I have not the slightest reservation about putting them on the record.
<P>
I was quoting the National Council for One Parent Families, which also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Two-thirds of lone parents live on or below the poverty line (defined as half of average income after housing costs).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``lone parents are the group at greatest risk of poverty in the UK.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In my experience, something similar could be said of many pensioners, but for the purposes of this debate, lone parents are at considerable risk of falling into poverty.
<P>
The briefing continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Government estimates for 1998-99 show that working lone parents could be losing over &#163;10 a week as a result of these changes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a pretty heavy burden on budgets that are already under some strain. I should be interested to know whether the Minister endorses that figure or whether he has more up-to-date data.
<P>
The NCOPF briefing refers to the new deal policy at length. It talks about a new deal package of &#163;150 million over the lifetime of this Parliament,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``with a further &#163;50 million going to improve the childcare costs disregard in Family Credit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is also mention of a national child care strategy. That is another important example of the gap--the underlap, as it were--between the proposals in clause 68, which will certainly take effect because the Government will ensure that they are driven through Parliament and that they come into effect early next year, and the new deal, in this case the national child care strategy.
<P>
Of course everyone wants a national child care strategy--it is like motherhood and apple pie. But when is it going to be delivered on the ground, to assist the lone parents about whom we are talking today? The National Council for One Parent Families points out that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the cut in the lone-parent rate of Child Benefit threatens to undermine this initiative.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Whatever one's views of the pros and cons of the policy, no policy can be examined in isolation; it must be viewed in the context of other policies that are being implemented in parallel. I am glad to note that the Minister agrees--I hope that that will mean a broad measure of common ground when he comes to speak. There must be some connections with the policies that the Government claim are designed to take the sting out of the provisions in this clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I have been listening carefully to my hon. Friend's arguments. I noticed that he referred to the statement that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``lone parents are the group at the greatest risk of poverty in the UK.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Does my hon. Friend agree that the philosophy behind that statement is similar to the view expressed by the Secretary of State for Social Security when she criticised the proposal that is now in clause 68? She said that it would be wrong to introduce such a proposal because it would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``make hundreds of thousands of the poorest children worse off''.
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. If the Secretary of State adopted the previous Government's avowed policy with her eyes firmly open, then, as what someone described as the self-styled protector of lone parents, she has performed a somersault that compares favourably with all the others that the Government have performed in the few months that they have been in power. It is remarkable that the Government have adopted this measure and that the Minister will shortly be prepared to defend it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Before my hon. Friend concludes, will he tell us whether he agrees that, in the light of the Secretary of State's comments and the illuminating documents to which he has referred, the Government have only two choices? Either they can deny that their previous views were correct, or they can provide an explanation of the significant reasons that lie behind this change in policy--notwithstanding the problems that their previous views and the statements in the documents create.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful for that intervention--I note that they are getting shorter. My hon. Friend makes an exceptionally good point. The Minister has the unenviable task of trying to defend the Secretary of State. Either the Secretary of State's pre-election comments were absolutely right, in which case it beggars belief that she is prepared to drive through this policy with the silent acquiescence of Labour Members, or she was wrong at that time and she widely overstated the likely effect on lone parents of this otherwise innocent measure. It is for us to judge. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says. He must either think that the Secretary of State was right then and is wrong now, or that she was wrong now and is right now.
<P>
The much-vaunted new deal does not go on stream nationally until October 1998. Despite the attempts to massage the figures, it is pretty apparent that early results from the pilot schemes are far from encouraging. The National Council for One Parent Families makes the point that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The New Deal will, when it is in place, offer positive support to lone parents in preparing for and finding jobs. However, cutting One Parent Benefit (along with the other cuts to lone parent benefits) will actually make it harder for future lone parents to take jobs without losing out financially.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is not my view, but one that I have faithfully passed on from a respected national organisation. Labour Members are pulling faces, but that view deserves to be heard.
<P>
Most importantly, however, we want to hear the Minister's rationale for how the Government can introduce this policy given all the abuse and vilification that they heaped on it before and during the election campaign earlier this year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> We have had a full and wide-ranging debate on the clause. Since hon. Members have repeatedly said that they await my views on the matter, I hope that they will listen to my response and allow me to develop the arguments in a considered fashion to ensure clarity in the Government's position.
<P>
The clause provides a general power to make regulations that will provide for lone parents to receive the same rate of child benefit as a couple with children. Subsection (1) provides the general power and establishes that section 145(4) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 does not apply here. Subsection (2) defines the meaning of ``lone parent''.
<P>
May I confirm that clause 68 allows only for the reduction of the lone parent addition. We are not adopting the power to reduce child benefit further. I hope that that makes the point absolutely clear. The purpose of the clause is to allow us to align the child benefit rates between lone parents and couples. That is why the clause is necessary for dealing with the lone parent premium: I repeat that it does not affect child benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If that is the case, will the Minister give the Committee an undertaking that the Government will not use the powers in clause 68, whose paragraphs (a) and (b) empower them to reduce child benefit to lone parents? It is one thing to say that that is not the intention but another to confirm it--[Interruption.] I shall read out the relevant paragraph--that regulations may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(b) vary any . . . provision by substituting a lower rate . . . notwithstanding anything in section 154 (4)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As drafted, it gives the Government that power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I knew that it was a mistake to give way to the hon. Gentleman. I have made the provision absolutely clear and I am not going into any more flights of fancy on that.
<P>
Existing recipients of the lone parent rate of child benefit at the point of change will not be affected, as long as they continue to satisfy the entitlement conditions. There will be no cash losers.
<P>
I should like to thank the hon. Member for Northavon for his contribution to this morning's debate. He made a sensible contribution which encapsulated some of the key arguments on the subject. I shall use his contribution as a peg on which to hang responses to those arguments.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman first discussed the relative needs of lone parents and couples with children. He is right to say that research is inconclusive. There are significant differences in the conclusions of different authors. Some studies support the case for extra help; others do the opposite. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, it is not only the Government who find the views inconclusive; so, after extensive consultation, does the Social Security Advisory Committee. The hon. Gentleman himself acknowledged that the results are inconclusive.
<P>
In line with the Social Security Advisory Committee, the hon. Member for Northavon suggested that the Government should not go ahead with this measure until a clearer picture can be established. There are difficulties with all the different research methods that attempt to quantify relative need. There are real difficulties in separating needs from tastes, for example. That can mean that the findings of a particular report depend strongly on the assumptions of the analysis. I know that the hon. Member for Northavon, as an academic, understands the problem of relative analysis. It is therefore the Government's view that further research is unlikely to come to any definitive conclusion on that issue.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman then turned to the question of how much lone parents can expect to be better off in work. He advised caution over claims that lone parents currently in work and supported by family credit are &#163;50 a week better off than they would be out of work. He is right; the figure is based on a particular sub-set of lone parents. The Government recognises that some lone parents face difficulties in relation to the cost of child care and receipt of maintenance. That is exactly why we have announced improvements to the child care disregard to help the very lone parents he describes. From June 1998 families can gain up to a maximum of &#163;95.50 a week if they receive family credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> one of the few worthwhile points to emerge from the Conservative Benches was that for someone on maximum family credit, in other words the lowest paid of lone parents, any increase in the child care disregard is worthless because they cannot get it. Does the Minister have any proposals to relax that ceiling or to make that child care help, through the disregard, of more value to the lowest paid lone parents?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. That is a good point and I shall be coming to child care matters a little bit later in my winding up speech.
<P>
Perhaps I should make it clear to the Committee that the estimated gain from work and family credit of &#163;50 a week does not include this additional help either. These improvements are the very first step in the programme of helping parents to have access to affordable, good quality child care which they need if they are to balance work and family life successfully. The national child care strategy will ensure that provision of child care is planned to meet the needs of parents.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbuy spoke about parents who have special needs because of their children's special needs. Clearly, built into that national child care strategy will be a recognition of those special needs. That is why the national child care strategy is meant to tailor the appropriate child care to the wide range of differing circumstances in which families find themselves so that those points can be addressed.
<P>
The Government will announce the details of our strategy shortly; but we are already committed to providing a nursery place for every four-year-old in Britain and midweek lottery money will be available for homework centres with up to half the places available containing an element of child care.
<P>
The increase in the maximum allowed for child care costs will help those already claiming and incurring child care costs for two or more children. Again, the hon. Member for Northavon is right; relatively small numbers of existing claimants will benefit. However, the changes combined with our national child care strategy and the new deal for lone parents all help to make the transition to work more attractive to the thousands of lone parents who currently feel trapped in benefit dependency and social exclusion. Cash help with child care, up to &#163;60 a week, is currently available to 40,000 lone parents and will be available to half a million from next October under the new deal for lone parents.
<P>
We are also taking action on maintenance. The receipt of regular child maintenance is a key part of our strategy for helping lone mothers back into work. Maintenance is a portable income which lone mothers keep when they start work. They need to know that the Child Support Agency will take every action to ensure that it is paid. We are therefore reviewing all aspects of the operation of the Child Support Agency to ensure that it provides an efficient and effective service. We are determined to ensure that cases are processed faster, backlogs cleared and absent fathers who avoid paying are chased. We are also allocating an additional &#163;15 million to the agency from April 1998 to be used specifically to get more absent fathers to pay the maintenance they owe.
<P>
It was suggested that the measures we are debating today are inconsistent with our welfare to work policies but that I would disagree. That is right. I will point to the improvement in the income of lone parents on taking up work and I will point to the new deal, the improvements to the child care disregard and the national child care strategy as the best way to ensure that lone parents can and will improve their incomes through work.
<P>
The welfare state must encourage work, not dependency. The Government's priority for lone parents is to support them and their families through work. The key barriers that lone parents face in moving to work are job searching, finding and paying for the right child care, building confidence and motivation, and developing their skills. We are addressing those difficulties through the new deal for lone parents and the national child care strategy, and by improving the child care disregard.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are taking further steps to protect the financial incentives to work. Lone parents already on income support or jobseeker's allowance, with the lone parent rate of family premium, will receive transitional protection, allowing them to make a subsequent claim for the lone parent rate of child benefit when they move into work. Their financial incentives to do that will not be affected by this change.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I appreciate the Minister's assurance that a lone parent who is currently on income support will have the transitional protection. But, as he knows, the income support population is volatile, with inflow and outflow. The Minister's answers suggested that next year 250,000 new lone parents will make new claims for income support. Those 250,000 will then face a lower return from paid employment under clause 68. Is that not so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Those on income support do not gain from the child benefit rate. The range of measures being introduced will reduce the barriers to their moving into work because the only way in which they can substantially improve their income is through moving from benefit dependency into work. We have to take the whole range of measures in the round rather than items in isolation.
<P>
Our manifesto commitment was clear. We promised to provide help to lone parents moving into work; we promised them the opportunity to support themselves and their families through work. Research shows that that is what lone parents want. That is what they expected from us and that is what we will deliver. That is why clause 68 should form part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I was about to tax the Minister with a key question about who is being a hypocrite. Is he, whatever the small print in the Labour party's manifesto states, really saying that he felt that his party left the average politically aware lone parent with the impression that his Government would adopt this policy lock, stock and barrel from the previous Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am not surprised. I had expected the Minister to attempt to answer the points about the Government's U-turn which were put to him during two Committee sittings. It is incredible that he can talk on, in order, during the winding-up debate about the Government's child care strategy and their policy to help lone parents back to work. That seems straightforward. I can understand that he prefers to concentrate on answering Liberal Democrat Members' speeches; after all, his party is in coalition with them. What I find staggering is that the hon. Gentleman is either frightened to, or is unable to, produce a suitable form of words to explain the various comments of his boss, the Secretary of State for Social Security, which show a U-turn between the time the Labour party was in opposition and when it became the Government.
<P>
The Minister mentioned his party's election manifesto commitment. I did not hear him mention the words ``lone parent premium'' or ``extra child benefit for lone parents'' when he read aloud. He must know that few people bother to read any party's political manifesto because they are such remarkably turgid documents. What they do is watch television, listen to the radio and read newspapers. They know that, when in opposition, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Social Security conveyed the message time and again, in newspapers, on radio, on the Floor of the House and when meeting special interest groups, that they utterly opposed the Government's proposals for cutting some elements of payments to lone parents such as child benefit, and the other benefits for which they are eligible. Before the election, the Labour party gave the impression to people all over the country that it rejected the Government's proposals and would prevent their implementation if elected. As we have said so often, the Government's actions boil down to utter hypocrisy. I am saddened that the Minister will not respond to even try to justify what is clearly unjustifiable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury said that he hoped that he would have an opportunity of raising the matter later. He, my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green and others, as well as some Labour Members, who, by signing early-day motions and writing newspaper articles, made no secret of their opposition to the Government's proposals, will have an opportunity to raise the matter on Report. Those Labour Members are as mystified as we are by the Government's line, given their comments when in opposition.
<P>
The Minister can run away from the issue today by refusing to answer questions in Committee. He will, however, be unable to run away every time the matter is raised in the House, unless, on Report, the Secretary of State has the courage to come to the House and be questioned about her previous statements.

Clause 70 is the first provision in the Bill that my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden was planning to include in his social security Bill, if we had won the election on 1 May.--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Clause 70 is the only clause in the Bill that was not proposed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden before the general election, and it would not have been included in the Bill that he would have introduced after 1 May if we had won the election. Conservative Members experience grave difficulties with the whole clause, although we will leave the more general discussion of the clause until a later stage.
<P>
Amendment No. 297 is a fundamental one, because the clause is a measure for cutting expenditure with no thought for those whom it might seriously affect. The clause would tighten up the time available--and I accept that that should be subject to regulation--for people to claim contributory benefits, for which they are eligible through paying into the system, and non-contributory benefits. The amendment seeks to obviate the most distressing effects of the clause. It would ensure that, within the Government's tight spending plans, the Bill is not too onerous upon those who find themselves in difficulty for a variety of reasons, and who need to turn to the state for financial assistance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that in many cases in which people have not made promptly to the claims to which they were entitled, the cause is perhaps a recent bereavement, or divorce, or some similar personal tragedy? That has meant that they did not keep their eye on the ball, as it were, in terms of the benefits that they could claim. It is unfortunate, therefore, that they should be required to pay the penalty for not making their claim quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> My hon. Friend mentions a significant impact of the changes outlined in the clause, and which the amendment seeks to address. He rightly mentions people who have recently been bereaved and others who, given their personal circumstances, might not be able to claim benefit within the timescale prescribed in the clause. No one wants an open-ended situation in which people can make backdated claims ad infinitum. We do not want the system to be ratcheted up in such a way, however, that it becomes too tight and places too heavy an imposition on people who may lose out on a benefit to which they were entitled.
<P>
All members of the Committee will have received a number of briefings from organisations at the sharp end, helping people who are less fortunate than us and who seek benefits for various reasons. The organisations believe that such people will be seriously adversely affected by the provision. The clause targets the most vulnerable people in society.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>

<P>
Because it restricts backdating of the claim to a month--unless the rules subsequently laid down provide otherwise--it will make obtaining benefit very difficult for people. In some cases the benefits are contributory ones. People who will have contributed, through national insurance contributions, to a benefit, will not be able to get it, because of the stringent deadline. That is a very worrying predicament.
<P>
I hope that the Government will be prepared to think again and relax the provision or compromise upon it. I do not think that the Government want to introduce harsh or onerous measures in the context that we are discussing, although clearly they have a responsibility to look after taxpayers' money and to live within the constraints of the public spending limits.
<P>
The amendment is intended to allow backdating of incapacity benefit, invalidity benefit, maternity allowance, benefits for widows and widowers, retirement pensions, attendance allowance, severe disablement allowance, invalid care allowance and disability living allowance to three months rather than the one month laid down in the Bill. That is a reasonable proposal. The previous Secretary of State for Social Security was quite happy to live with such an arrangement. One would not necessarily have expected my right hon. Friend to be prepared to allow three months; one might have thought that he would be tempted to decide on one month.
<P>
I hope that the Government will listen carefully to the arguments. The matter has caused grave concern and misgiving. Perhaps, if they have an open mind, they will think again.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Question is, That the amendment be made.
