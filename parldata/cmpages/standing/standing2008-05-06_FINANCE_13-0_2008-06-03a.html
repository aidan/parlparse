<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000342"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):</b> It is
a pleasure to see you back in the Chair, Mr. Cook, and I
look forward to serving under your chairmanship this morning. Before I
start, may I offer my best wishes to my hon. Friend the Member for
Staffordshire, Moorlands and her husband, who I understand is poorly
and in hospital? We send our best wishes to her and hope that her
husband has a speedy
recovery.</div><a name="08060388000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to answer a number of the questions that the hon. Member for Fareham
asked about the clause during the Committee&#146;s previous sitting.
I had a close look at what he said and hope to be able to respond to
most of his concerns. The clause deals with an area that is the subject
of intense interest and debate. Its specific role is to amend the
controlled foreign company rules to block some tax avoidance schemes
that were brought to our attention as a result of the disclosure
legislation introduced in 2004.</div>
<a name="08060388000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those rules are an important
part of the UK&#146;s defences against tax avoidance and are designed
to prevent UK multinationals from avoiding UK tax on their profits by
artificially moving profits to offshore companies that they control and
that are based in low-tax countries. A number of highly artificial tax
avoidance schemes that use partnerships and trusts have been marketed
in an attempt to avoid the effect of the rules.</div>
<a name="08060388000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of those avoidance schemes
aims to enable a UK group of companies to sidestep the controlled
foreign company rules by artificially diverting profits 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>from the company to a foreign trust operated by the group. The clause
will ensure that, where that happens, the profits remain within the
scope of the controlled foreign company rules. Provisions are included
to ensure that the income cannot be included more  than
once.</div> <a name="08060388000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">For a foreign
company to be within the scope of the rules, it must be controlled by
UK residents. Another scheme involves a UK group arranging for the
majority of shares in one of its controlled foreign companies to be
transferred to an unconnected party, even though all of its profits
continue to belong to the group. The clause will ensure that, where
that happens, the profits remain within the scope of the controlled
foreign company rules.</div>
<a name="08060388000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The income of a controlled
foreign company is exempt from UK tax when 90 per cent. of the profits
in any one accounting period are distributed to the UK. A third scheme
seeks to qualify for this exemption by meeting this distribution
requirement using profits sourced from other accounting periods. Those
profits carry overseas tax credits, which means that no UK tax will be
paid on them. The clause will ensure that were that happens, the
exemption is not available.</div>
<a name="08060388000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, a foreign holding
company of a UK group that owns trading companies that are exempt from
the CFC rules will be similarly exempted when at least  90 per
cent. of its income in an accounting period is made up of dividends
from those trading companies. An avoidance scheme seeks to exploit that
exemption by diverting income to a partnership in which the holding
company has a majority interest. The company then claims that the
income of the partnership does not belong to the holding company. The
clause puts it beyond doubt that the profits do belong to the holding
company for the purposes of the exemption so that, where that happens,
the exemption is not available.</div>
<a name="08060388000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to be aware that the clause is not intended to catch wholly
commercial transactions. Nevertheless, where their use is driven
substantially by commercial considerations, such arrangements should
qualify for the motive test exemption. At our last sitting, the hon.
Gentleman raised a number of questions. He probed around the definition
of control and questioned whether we were taking further steps in that
respect. The avoidance schemes targeted by the clause use highly
artificial structures that are unlikely to be used for commercial
purposes. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs has discussed these
changes with representative bodies and is satisfied that few, if any,
wholly commercial transactions will be affected by the redefinition of
control. Nevertheless, as a back-stop, such legitimate arrangements
will qualify for exemption from the control of foreign company
legislation where their use is driven substantially by commercial
considerations&#151;the motive test exemption. In the unlikely event
that the redefinition of control would bring a straightforward loan by
a third party, such as a UK bank, to a foreign company within the scope
of the rules, one of the exemptions&#151;again, the motive test from
the rules&#151;would apply.</div>
<a name="08060388000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman asked me
about the test for control&#151;the definition of control and what
had become accepted as the norm. The normal definition of control is
based on both the power to direct how a company is run and the right to
a company&#146;s income. He emphasised the former of those two
criteria. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div>test for control for controlled foreign companies in the current
legislation is different and does not include a specific test based on
the right to a company&#146;s income. The clause introduces an
additional test to counter a number of avoidance schemes where groups
claim to be able to enjoy all the benefits of ownership of a controlled
foreign company without being regarded as controlling that company
under the existing definition. The change is therefore a reaction to
the avoidance and is not related to any future changes to the rules
that might emerge from the review of the taxation of foreign
profits.</div><a name="08060388000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording
used in the extended test for control mirrors closely that in the usual
definition of control in section 416 of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988. As in that section, income for the purpose of clause 61
is defined as the income of the company that is available for
distribution to its shareholders. The wording used in the extended test
for control is therefore consistent with other definitions of control
in the 1988 Act. HMRC is not aware of any difficulties caused by the
wording of section 416 and does not expect there to be any difficulties
with the comparably worded clause 61.</div>
<a name="08060388000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked me what would happen when control changes during an
accounting period. Provided that the company continues to be controlled
by UK residents, under any of the tests available, it will be regarded
as a controlled foreign company throughout the accounting period. If
the company begins or ceases to be controlled by UK residents during
the accounting period, the existing period will end and a new one will
begin when the change of control takes
place.</div><a name="08060388000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060388000343"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I am grateful to the right
hon. Lady for giving way and for the detailed approach she is taking to
the questions I raised before the recess. Regarding change of control
during the course of the year, one of the points raised with me by one
of the representative bodies related to the way in which income might
accrue over the course of a year. Looking at control in the context of
voting rights, that would change if more shares were issued or shares
were transferred from one owner to another. In the present case,
however, the issue is the rate at which income or distributable profits
accrue over the course of the year. In our last sitting, I talked about
fixed-rate preference shares. It may be that for part of the year
income accrues in a way that would give control to one
organisation&#151;fixed-rate preference share holders&#151;and
accrue in a different way later in the year, which could shift control
to the ordinary share holders. I wanted clarification from the Minister
on control and change of
control.</div><a name="08060388000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000344"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I am about to come to some of the detail that the
hon. Gentleman raised before the recess.
</div><a name="08060388000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a number of
ways for a person to have the power to direct how a company is run. It
is not uncommon, under the existing test for control, for more than one
person to be treated as controlling a controlled foreign company. In
such circumstances, each person is treated as having control. There are
separate detailed tests in the rules for determining how a controlled
foreign company&#146;s profits are to be apportioned to those
companies that have an interest in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>the CFC. Where the complexity of ownership makes those tests
inapplicable, the rules provide for the profits to be apportioned to
such companies on a &#147;just and reasonable&#148; basis. The hon.
Gentleman might argue that that is not an objective measure and that it
could create uncertainty&#151;indeed, I think he did so. However, I
am sure that he accepts that &#147;just and reasonable&#148; is a
widely used term in tax legislation&#151;for example, it appears 53
times in the 1988 Act.</div>
<a name="08060388000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is
&#147;just and reasonable&#148; will depend on all the relevant
facts and circumstances. Examples of &#147;just and
reasonable&#148; apportionment and the factors to be taken into
account can be found in the published guidance on the HMRC website. As
promised, further guidance in support of the Bill and the clause will
be published soon, probably during the summer recess&#151;the usual
practice in the event of an anti-avoidance measure being introduced. I
think that the hon. Gentleman used an example of someone owning 60 per
cent. of the economic rights but someone else controlling a different
proportion of the voting rights. There are detailed tests for
determining how a controlled foreign company&#146;s profits are to be
apportioned. The answer that I gave to the hon. Gentleman about
&#147;just and reasonable&#148; apportionment&#151;that the
matter would be considered on a case-by-case basis&#151;would, I am
sure, reassure those who would be advising in such cases. There are
detailed examples, and further information can be obtained from
HMRC.</div><a name="08060388000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only where
clause 61 applies will it be necessary to divide an accounting period
into the period before and the period beginning on or after 12 March.
Because the clause is targeted at highly artificial tax avoidance
schemes, there will be a division into two periods only for schemes
designed for the purposes of avoidance. If there are two accounting
periods, dividends received after 12 March 2008 will be treated as
arising after that date. A charge to UK tax on the income of a
controlled foreign company will arise only where that company exists to
avoid UK tax, since the motive test exemption will otherwise prevent
such a charge. The clause does not have effect before 12 March 2008. It
will not increase chargeable profits before that date, so there will be
no need for companies to reconsider what dividends need to be paid to
pursue an acceptable distribution policy for earlier
periods.</div><a name="08060388000046"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000345"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the right hon. Lady confirm that if a dividend
is paid after 12 March 2008 and it is 90 per cent. of the income of the
CFC for an earlier accounting period&#151;say, to 30 September
2007&#151;the company will not have to recalculate the acceptable
distribution
policy?</div><a name="08060388000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000346"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I believe that that is correct. I will take
advice, and if I am wrong I will certainly communicate that to the hon.
Gentleman and the Committee. I believe that what he said is in line
with my response to his earlier questions. Under the clause, the
cumulative income for the entire accounting period would be examined
when determining control of the company. This is a complex matter and I
have given considerable thought to the points that he made at the start
of the clause stand part debate.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000347"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the right hon. Lady take the opportunity of
this discussion about controlled foreign companies to clarify the
status of the consultation? A question that was raised with me was why
this is being done in the Finance Bill 2008 when further legislation on
CFCs is expected in the Finance Bill 2009&#151;although press reports
suggest that people are now talking about the Finance Bill 2010. The
Committee would be grateful for clarification on the record of when the
Treasury thinks that legislation will be introduced, as this matter is
causing a great deal of uncertainty in the business
community.</div><a name="08060388000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000348"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The hon. Gentleman is in danger of taking me
wider than the clause. However, I am happy to put it on the record that
the purpose of the business group that I will chair is to enable
Ministers and officials in the Treasury and HMRC to engage with a
representative group&#151;not people who are representatives, but a
representative group&#151;of British multinational corporations to
consider further the work that has been done and the proposals in the
public arena on controlled foreign companies. We must ensure that any
consultation paper is right for the circumstances of the British
economy. As chair of the group, it is my intention to encourage
discussion that will enable businesses to share their experiences and
opinions and for myself as a Treasury Minister and officials to benefit
from the advice and experience that they will
bring.</div><a name="08060388000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000349"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Does that mean 2009 or
2010?</div><a name="08060388000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000350"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I was careful not to be specific and I do not
intend to be any more specific. I am looking forward to working on this
subject. I know that we will debate it further in the course of our
consideration of the Bill and on other occasions. For today, what I
have said is
sufficient.</div><a name="08060388000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000351"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I thank the Financial Secretary for her detailed
responses to most of my questions. She gave a non-specific response to
my final question&#151;I think I heard the sound of the ball being
kicked into the long grass&#151;but she has provided some very
important clarification on the functioning of the clause. I appreciate
that it is designed to tackle particularly complex and artificial
arrangements. She has assisted practitioners&#146; understanding of
the detail. On issues such as income, it would have been helpful to
have the definitions that she used in the clause. Perhaps she will
consider inserting them on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000352"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We will not oppose the clause, which will introduce
some welcome simplification to the tax system. I understand that the
changes have the support of those who have been consulted, but I want
to ask the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>Financial Secretary about process. One measure that
will be repealed by the clause relates to changes that were made in
1997. A burden was presumed to be imposed upon exempt bodies, despite
the fact that they lost the right to reclaim tax credits They were
required to submit returns annually for something that they could not
reclaim. There was a cost attached to that and they had to do it for no
apparent purpose. Is a proper process in place to ensure that where
changes are made to the tax system, they flow through so that no
burdens that have no attached purpose are left hanging
around?</div><a name="08060388000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000353"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The clause repeals a number of provisions
relating to shares and securities, and is particularly relevant to
companies such as banks, insurance companies and others that deal in
shares and securities as part of their business. The hon. Gentleman
refers specifically to repeals of provisions dating from 1997, but they
are mostly about the exploitation of tax credits on dividends and the
creation of losses. Tax credits on dividends are no longer payable to
companies, so the protections given by those rules are not needed.
Since 1995, such companies have not been able to create losses in the
way that they used to. All of the provisions repealed are almost
entirely
redundant.</div><a name="08060388000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about process. I confess that I am not clear what
point he is making. We involved the industry before making the
proposals on repeals.</div>
<a name="08060388000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000354"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My point was connected with exempt bodies, and
relates to companies that bought shares with dividends and generated a
trading loss. There are exempt bodies that have had to continue to
submit returns without being able to reclaim the tax credits. The
change should have gone through in 1997 when the laws on tax credits
were changed, yet provisions have been in place until this
year&#146;s Finance Bill. My question about processes is why was that
change not put through at the time and why has the provision remained
on the statute book for so long? There is no benefit to the exempt
bodies and submitting the returns is a cost to them, and there is no
benefit to the Exchequer from having the returns submitted
annually.</div><a name="08060388000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000355"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> That is a good question. I am not in a position
to answer, other than to say that the purpose of the anti-avoidance
simplification review is to examine legislation to ensure that we
remove from the statute book rules and legislation that is unnecessary.
All that I can say is that I introduced the measure at the earliest
opportunity.</div><a name="08060388000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Philip Hammond</b> (Runnymede and Weybridge) (Con): The clause
corrects an unintended consequence of changes made in the Finance Act
2006&#151;here we go again, Mr. Cook&#151;to the way in
which the income of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>beneficiaries of certain trusts is taxed. Where the income or assets of
a settlement can be paid or used to benefit the settlor,
settlor&#146;s spouse, civil partner or unmarried minor children, the
income is taxed as if it was that of the settlor, even if it is not
paid or applied in that way. Those types of settlements are known as
settlor-interested
settlements.</div><a name="08060388000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Finance Act 2006 changed the way in which the settlor was charged on
that income: trustees now pay tax on the settlement income at 32.5 per
cent. on dividend income and at 40 per cent. on all other income, and
the settlor gets a credit for the tax that the trustees have paid. If a
beneficiary who is not included in the group of people I listed
receives a discretionary payment from a settlor-interested trust, the
beneficiary is also taxable on the
payments.</div><a name="08060388000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Provisions
introduced in the Finance Act 2006 provided that, as the settlor has
already been taxed on the income, the discretionary beneficiary is
given a non-refundable tax credit of 40 per cent. Under the present
rules, income from a trust is taxed before savings and dividend
income&#151;apparently, that is known as the statutory ordering. The
effect of the ordering provisions is that a beneficiary may be
chargeable to a higher rate of tax on other savings or dividend income
than they would otherwise be liable to where they also receive income a
settlor-interested trust. Apparently, that was not the intended impact
of the measure.</div> <a name="08060388000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause proposes that the trust payments be treated as the highest part
of the beneficiary&#146;s income, except in respect of top-slicing
relief on income gains from life insurance contracts. If my
understanding is correct&#151;the Financial Secretary will be able to
confirm this&#151;that effectively sets aside the provisions of
schedule 1 in relation to the starting rate of tax on savings and the
ordering provided in relation to that in the Income Tax Act 2007, as
amended by schedule 1.</div>
<a name="08060388000295"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="08060388000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
changes are backdated to 6 April 2006. That is supposed to ensure that
beneficiaries are not disadvantaged by the mistake in the drafting of
the Finance Act 2006. I should be interested to know when the problem
was first spotted and why we have had to wait two years for a
correction. It may not have been identified until tax returns in
respect of 2006-07 were received and processed&#151;I hope that the
Minister can confirm that that is the case. Some sort of quality audit
process is needed, particularly in relation to Finance Acts, so that
when things go wrong and have unintended consequences. some attempt is
made to analyse the process and to ensure that we get it right the next
time.</div>
<a name="08060388000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute
of Chartered Accountants has raised a second anomaly which it says it
raised with the Government back in 2006. Although the Government have
addressed one problem in clause 64, they have not dealt with that
second anomaly. Will the Financial Secretary turn her attention to the
fact that including a discretionary payment from a settlor-interested
trust in the net income of a non-settlor beneficiary who is entitled to
age-related allowance will adversely affect that beneficiary&#146;s
entitlement to age-related allowance? This is a person who is not
included in the list of settlor, settlor&#146;s spouse, civil partner
or unmarried minor children. This is another beneficiary who receives a
discretionary payment from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>a settlor-interested trust. Because he is otherwise  entitled to
age-related allowance, that entitlement will be adversely
affected.</div> <a name="08060388000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where this
adverse effect occurs, the payment will effectively be taxed twice:
once in the hands of the settlor, as is intended by the legislation,
and again in the hands of the non-settlor beneficiary who would
otherwise have been entitled to age-related allowance. Such income is
also taken into account when assessing the beneficiary&#146;s
entitlement to tax credits and pension credits. This seems unfair and
probably an unintended consequence. Can the Financial Secretary tell
the Committee whether she is aware of this issue, what representations
she has received about it and why it has not been addressed along with
the perhaps rather larger error that is being addressed in clause
64?</div><a name="08060388000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000357"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):</b> Welcome
back to the Chair, Mr. Cook.</div>
<a name="08060388000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked whether his understanding of
the clause is correct. It seems to me broadly correct, although he
mentioned that he thought there was a relationship between the clause
and schedule 1. I just wanted to clarify that it has no effect on
schedule 1 of the Bill or any ordering provision. Apart from that, my
understanding is the same as
his.</div><a name="08060388000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000358"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000359"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Economic Secretary, but I will give
way.</div><a name="08060388000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000360"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Sorry&#151;Economic Secretary. The shuffling of
jobs gets more and more confusing.</div>
<a name="08060388000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding was that schedule 1 amends the ITA 2007 in order to
define the ordering for the purposes of the starting rate of tax on
savings. This provision deals with the ordering in respect of payments
to non-settlor beneficiaries from settlor-interested trusts and puts
them at the top of the pecking order, as it were, as the first tranche
of income. That was my understanding. I wondered how the two measures
interacted.</div><a name="08060388000296"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000361"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> My understanding is that this is a specific
provision for those specific circumstances and that there will be no
effect on the broader provisions in schedule 1. If I am advised
differently, I will return to this
point.</div><a name="08060388000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">On timing,
trust legislation is a complex area. The trust modernisation
legislation was consulted on widely, but this omission was not picked
up by the trust industry at the time. Ministers became aware of the
issue at the end of last year and action will be taken as soon as
possible to ensure that no beneficiary in this situation will be
adversely
affected.</div><a name="08060388000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also mentioned age-related allowances. That is a
different type of benefit. The primary focus of age-related allowances
is to provide additional support for those on lower incomes. The income
used to determine entitlement is the individual&#146;s total income
for the tax year from all sources of income. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>That focus would be disturbed if settlor-interested trust income that
has a tax credit covering the income tax liability was exceptionally
excluded from the total income. We feel that that would be
inappropriate.</div><a name="08060388000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000362"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Does the Economic Secretary agree that in that
example given there is effectively double taxation? There is taxation
in the hands of the settlor and in the hands of the recipient. After
the correction in the clause is made, does she agree that the person in
receipt of the age-related allowance is effectively unique in being
double taxed on that income
distribution?</div><a name="08060388000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000363"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The hon. Gentleman rightly makes the point that
has been made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales. That point has been made to us as well. Our response is that
this is a matter of consistency. The focus for the age-related
allowance would be disturbed if settlor-interested trust income that
has a tax credit covering the income tax liability was exceptionally
excluded from total income. We do not agree with the view of the ICAEW
that it is double taxation, but the taxation will be increased. We are
happy to pursue this point with the ICAEW
offline.</div><a name="08060388000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">To clarify
the point that the hon. Gentleman raised on the relationship of this
provision with schedule 1, non-settlor interested income is pushed to
the top of the

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr.
Cook.</div><a name="08060388000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will discuss
the clause briefly. I do not think that it will be controversial. The
clause concerns the taxation of foreign dividends that are taxable only
if remitted to the United Kingdom. Until 2005, they were taxed at the
higher tax rate, which is currently 40 per cent. Through a drafting
error in the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, they were
instead taxed at dividend rates so that the upper tax rate became 32.5
per cent. That applied for 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08, but it is
being corrected for any remittances of foreign dividends made after 6
April 2008. Will the Economic Secretary say what that drafting error
has cost the
Exchequer?</div><a name="08060388000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The error
resulted from the tax law rewrite project. It is probably inevitable
that some errors will be made from time to time as previous Acts are
re-enacted in language that is supposedly easier to understand.
However, I cannot help noticing, just from the clauses that I have
looked at in the Bill, that this is the second example of an error
arising as a consequence of the tax law rewrite project. Clause 46,
relating to employment-related securities, is another
example.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div><a name="08060388000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not take a zero tolerance approach; such errors will occur from time
to time. However, I would be grateful if the Economic
Secretary&#151;if not now, at some point&#151;gave the Committee
the running total of identified drafting errors with regard to the tax
law rewrite project. A year or so ago, I asked a parliamentary question
on that point to the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn
Primarolo), when she was Paymaster General. Nine errors had been
identified and corrected in the Capital Allowances Act 2001 and 18 in
the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. Four errors had been
corrected in each of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005
and the Income Tax Act 2007. I have also heard it suggested that the
tax law rewrite project identified some errors in the existing law.
That is entirely understandable. Will the Economic Secretary tell us
whether that is true, and if so whether it has resulted in any broader
changes in the law? Subject to those comments, we have no objection to
clause
65.</div><a name="08060388000091"></a>

support for the clause, which corrects a drafting error introduced by
the tax law rewrite project that consolidated legislation in
2005.</div><a name="08060388000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">To respond to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s final point, the rewrite project, by
definition, did not change any policy. I was not the Minister at that
time, but I presume that if errors were found it would have been
sensible to correct them. There were certainly no policy changes at
that point. The error before us set the higher rate of income tax on
foreign dividend income remitted to the UK by those charged on a
remittance basis at 32.5 per cent. We are correcting that error and
reapplying the 40 per cent. that applied until 2005. A remittance-basis
user who is taxed at the basic rate will continue to have their foreign
dividends taxed at 20 per cent. The clause simply restores the position
to what it was before the
mistake.</div><a name="08060388000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked how many errors were identified as regards the tax
law rewrite project. I am happy to get the team to count again and send
him a note. However, given the scale of the rewrite, finding errors is
like looking for a needle in a haystack. We are pleased with the result
of the project. The wider economy also feels that we have done a good
job. Obviously any error is regrettable, but I ask the hon. Gentleman
to consider the number of errors in the context of what has been
achieved, and to acknowledge that that number is extremely small. He
asked about the cost of that particular error. The yield from
correcting it is around &#163;10 million per annum, and I therefore
extrapolate that that is what was lost in the intervening years.
However, we are applying the clause from 2008-09 so that nobody who
inadvertently benefited subsequently loses out. I thank the hon.

flattening down the back of my skirt&#151;the experience stayed with
me for some time.</div><a name="08060388000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the clause is intended to encourage and incentivise businesses to take
more energy-saving measures in the course of their day-to-day
operations, I obviously support it and understand the rationale behind
the need to include it in the Bill. We support measures taken by the
Government to encourage businesses to invest in better insulation for
their operations. It is good for not only businesses that reduce energy
costs over time, but the environment.</div>
<a name="08060388000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise that the clause
intends to extend the provision of capital allowances relating to the
expenditure of adding insulation to reduce the loss of heat from a
building&#151;thermal insulation. Currently, the existing provision
covers expenditure on thermal insulation for existing industrial
buildings. Given that the phased withdrawal of industrial buildings
allowance by April 2011 is now planned, obviously the clause needs to
extend provision to the initial thermal insulation of all existing
buildings used for any qualifying activity other than residential
property businesses.</div><a name="08060388000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have only some brief comments on the clause. In the explanatory notes,
the Treasury states that extending the provision of this measure will
widen its environmental benefit. I understand and accept that it can be
difficult for the Treasury to estimate the precise environmental impact
of the sort of measures that are introduced to encourage environmental
benefits. I realise that that is not easy, but want to get some idea of
whether the Treasury has tried to get an understanding of the
environmental benefit that it hopes to achieve from the
clause.</div> <a name="08060388000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
important because, with limited Treasury resources and the need to keep
the tax system broadly as simple as possible and avoid unnecessary
complexity&#151;Opposition Members on the Committee 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>have certainly argued for that&#151;if we are to understand what does
and does not work, it is incumbent on the Treasury to have some
understanding of the impact of such measures when it brings them
forward, even if that is nothing more than a sense of the proportionate
breadth of impact. That way, we will hopefully end up with up with a
hypothesis on what constitutes effective fiscal measures of that sort,
or we will at least put the potential impact into context.</div>
<a name="08060388000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Has the Exchequer Secretary
made any assessment, however straightforward or simple, of the extent
to which the clause will be used more broadly by businesses once the
broader provision is available? How will the Treasury assess the
effectiveness of the provision, and is there any sort of assessment on
the amount of reliable spend that will be made, for example, on the
thermal insulation of buildings? Do we have any sense of the amount of
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions that will be saved over time as a consequence,
and is it possible to estimate the proportion of existing emissions
that might fall within the scope of the clause? In short, is there any
way of understanding whether this will be effective and
successful?</div> <a name="08060388000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that this expenditure will end up being classed as plant and
machinery and within the 10 per cent. special rate of writing down
allowances that come from allowing them to qualify as an integral
feature. I have comments on integral features which we will cover later
when we discuss clause 70. If the Minister could tell the Committee a
little more about quantification and give an assessment of the
environmental effects the Government hope to gain from the broader
measure in clause 68, it would be very
welcome.</div><a name="08060388000297"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

happy to try at least to give a flavour of the effect that we think
these changes will have. I shall first spend a small amount of time
setting the clause in context because it is the first of a group of
clauses that introduce reforms to modernise and simplify capital
allowances. The hon. Lady is right to draw the Committee&#146;s
attention to the fact that it is related to the withdrawal of
industrial buildings allowances, which is covered later in the Bill by
clauses 81 to 84. This is a consequential provision which, confusingly,
appears before those clauses. Such things often happen in
legislation.</div><a name="08060388000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since

allowances on thermal insulation added to existing buildings if those
buildings were considered industrial for capital allowances purposes.
That is because of the existence of the industrial buildings allowance,
which later clauses abolish. Such expenditure would not otherwise have
qualified for any plant and machinery capital allowances. These plant
and machinery allowances have been available at the main rate
of  25 per cent., which is reducing to 20 per cent. as part of
the package. Again, the hon. Lady alluded to that in her questioning
earlier. The measure does not apply to expenditure on
insulating new buildings, because building regulations now require that
thermal insulation at certain standards be part of any new
buildings. The sector we are dealing with is the stock of other
buildings that existed before the building regulations were
changed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div><a name="08060388000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">By abolishing
the industrial buildings allowance, we are extending these payments to
commercial buildings, rather than just industrial buildings, which is a
much wider range of potential stock of buildings than were caught under
the old system. Our calculations demonstrate that that extension
increases the scope of the measure by &#163;162 million to
&#163;201 million a year. Although the allowances are 10 per cent.
rather than 20 per cent., the potential pool of buildings that
are affected and could take advantage of the new allowances for thermal
insulation is wider. We believe that there is scope to reduce energy
loss from commercial buildings by about 8.25
megatonnes.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000370"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> When the hon. Lady talks about 8.25 megatonnes,
is she talking about a cumulative effect over time and if so to what
year? Are we talking about an annual
reduction?</div>
<a name="08060388000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000371"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I assume that it is cumulative. I am waiting to see
whether my officials can confirm that. The hon. Lady must remember that
it takes time to get insulation in place and that the savings that are
made tend not to come on stream immediately. I can now confirm that it
is cumulative and includes all insulations that might happen as a
result of this
measure.</div><a name="08060388000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000372"></a>Justine

when?</div>
<a name="08060388000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000373"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Again, I assume that that is the potential for all
buildings that would qualify that have not already been built and
comply with existing building regulations. The hon. Lady needs to
remember that the thermal insulation potential and credits for putting
it in place have been in existence since the 1970s. Building
regulations have consistently over time tightened up on the
requirements. Those who have commercial buildings have a direct
financial interest in thermally insulating their buildings because they
will save money on their energy bills. I would have thought that at a
time such as this there is even more interest in doing so. My
assumption is that that is the potential overall saving. Businesses
must decide to undertake the
insulation.</div><a name="08060388000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060388000374"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): The Exchequer Secretary
cannot say over what period this will occur because it depends on how
businesses take up thermal insulation. Is it equally difficult for her
to say how much the Revenue will lose each
year?</div><a name="08060388000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000375"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It is not a question of the Revenue losing money
because the idea of these tax incentives is to help to create
circumstances where we can have economic growth without such a large
carbon footprint and thereby make our economic growth more sustainable.
I do not see it as the hon. Gentleman does in terms of losses for the
Revenue.</div><a name="08060388000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">To set the
matter in context, Opposition Members must remember that current
building regulations mean that new commercial buildings are required to
be insulated. We have had thermal insulation credits to encourage
people to undertake behaviour that will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>reduce their own operating costs. There has been an extra incentive
since the 1970s for some buildings. We are now spreading that to
commercial buildings. It is not possible for me to stand in Committee
and say how many buildings would qualify for the insulation because we
have not had a Domesday survey of commercial buildings
recently.</div><a name="08060388000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Putney recognised when she asked her questions that it
is not easy to come up with answers. I have done my best to give her a
ballpark figure of what we think the savings will be. If she is going
to say that that is not acceptable, when she spent her entire time when
asking the question quite reasonably saying that it was very difficult
to make those kinds of estimates, I do not know where that gets
us.</div><a name="08060388000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000376"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The only reason that I am pressing the Exchequer
Secretary is that I was quite pleased to hear that some quantifiable
assessment had been made. Obviously, it is meaningless if we do not
understand what 8.5 megatonnes relates to. Regulatory impact
assessments done by the Government often spread  over 70 years.
There is a world of difference between 8.5 megatonnes being achieved
cumulatively over that time frame and it being achieved by
2020.</div><a name="08060388000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the
Climate Change Bill is before the House, I want to understand how
measures such as this clause will form part of the overall effort to
reduce emissions over the near-term years, which we all support. I am
pressing the Exchequer Secretary to give us a little more information
on that. She has given us a tantalising bit, but it is not meaningful
if we do not know the time
frame.</div><a name="08060388000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000377"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I am doing my best to enlighten the Committee by
making these difficult assessments. I can give some information on the
costings, which the hon. Member for Wellingborough asked about. The
cost is zero this year because we have to put the system in place. We
expect it to be &#163;5 million next year,  &#163;10
million the year after and &#163;15 million thereafter to 2010-11.
Hon. Members have to remember that that is tax at the margin, not the
overall amount of money that will be spent on insulation&#151;it is a
tax credit and it is marginal.</div>
<a name="08060388000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 8.6 megatonnes figure,
which I gave the hon. Lady earlier, is the annual loss, we think, per
year from commercial buildings that are not insulated. If all buildings
were insulated that amount would be saved. The hon. Lady must remember
that a lot of buildings are insulated and that new ones are required to
be. We estimate that that amount would be saved if all commercial
buildings instantly took account of the new tax credit available to
them and did what they should have been doing anyway, which hopefully
they will do because it saves money on their energy bills, regardless
of whether the tax credit
exists.</div><a name="08060388000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060388000378"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): I am grateful for that
clarification from the Minister. If that is the annual potential
saving, will she give us an indication of the Treasury&#146;s
predicted cumulative figure between now and
2020?</div>
<a name="08060388000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000379"></a>Angela

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000380"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> There is, perhaps, a more pertinent question.
The Minister&#146;s figures are helpful to understand that that is
the, if you like, global amount of emissions that we think that the
policy could address. Has the Treasury made an assessment as to how
much of what we could see saved will be saved over
time?</div><a name="08060388000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000381"></a>Angela

individuals who can apply for the tax credits&#151;perhaps all of
them will, or all of them  will
not.</div>

million. Short of being able to give the Committee individual

who own commercial buildings, will do, I do not know what else I can

Field</b><b class="B">:</b> Perish the thought that I would ask for
another figure. Does the Minister accept that the cascading figures are
almost meaningless, because part and parcel of the proposal is a
mechanism for the allowances that will allow and, indeed, encourage
people to change their behaviour? Obviously, we do not know how long a
particular building&#146;s life cycle is likely to be; it may already
be 15 years old when it qualifies for the allowance and be demolished
in a few years in any event. Above all, the policy shows the inherent
contradiction in the Government&#146;s approach to motor cars. The
Government say that they want to encourage different behaviour, which
may have a cost in relation to allowances. However, people who own
motor cars for six or seven years will be taxed under the current
arrangements, irrespective of any change that they can possibly make to
their behaviour. It is that inherent contradiction that we find so
concerning, not so much in this regard but in regard to general
policies to encourage behaviour on environmental
grounds.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div><a name="08060388000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
preserves the availability of the allowances for industrial buildings,

buildings, while complementing the approach taken to integral features,
which I know the hon. Member for Putney  will bring up at the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000388"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I must admit that when I set out a few questions
for the Exchequer Secretary, I did not expect to get into such a
discussion. I am pleased that the Treasury has tried to make an
estimate, but am disappointed that we were not able to get slightly
more detail. Even within the response that we got, the initial figure
from the Exchequer Secretary of 8.25 megatonnes became 8.6 megatonnes.
It also went from being a cumulative figure to an annual figure, and we
never did get to what the impact of the policy will be. Surely if we
are going to bear down on carbon emissions, we must have some
understanding of what an appropriate mix of policies will be in each
area of life. If we are talking about office and commercial buildings,
surely we need to know whether this particular fiscal measure will be
the key one, the one that the Treasury expects will address the issue,
or whether it is a limited measure and we need to look at other
policies if we are going to achieve the level of reduction in CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>emissions that we want in that area of
activity.</div><a name="08060388000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000389"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I, too, observed the confusion in the Exchequer
Secretary&#146;s speech, including the different figures and the
inability to distinguish between cumulative and annual savings. Does
the hon. Member for Putney share my concern that that is indicative of
a wider approach by the Treasury towards environmental taxation, which
is that it seems to be willing to sing the environmental song without
understanding the
words?</div><a name="08060388000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000390"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I raised
the issue because we need to be successful in this area. Therefore,
understanding whether the various measures that have been taken across
a range of areas will add up to success is
critical.</div><a name="08060388000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000391"></a>Angela

reasonably to understand how effective the changes will be, the
responsible thing for me to do as an Opposition spokesman is to try to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000393"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The clause repeals section 29 of the Capital
Allowances Act 2001, which gave plant and machinery allowances to
businesses that incurred expenditure in undertaking required fire
precautions as a result of being served with a prohibition notice by a
fire authority. I understand that expenditure for such purposes would
include structural works and alterations to buildings, for example fire
extinguishers, signage, alarms and sprinkler systems&#151;critical
spend for ensuring that workplaces are safe for those who work in them.
However, as I am sure the Exchequer Secretary will mention, ironically,
the relief was available only if a notice had been served as a result
of non-compliance under a self-assessment regime. Those businesses that
incurred spend responsibly in the area, because they were taking fire
precautions, were not able to obtain relief, whereas those that had not
bothered but were caught and handed a non-compliance notice, were given
relief. Ironically, preferential tax treatment was given to people for
bad behaviour. The repeal in the clause is therefore
understandable.</div> <a name="08060388000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
main query for the Minister is about the extent to which businesses
will be captured by the measure. For example, how many non-compliance
notices have been handed out by fire authorities over the past two or
three years? Is this a minor tidying-up measure which the Government
expect will have relatively little impact? Is it more about equity, or
do the Government expect it to have a broader impact in sending out a
message to businesses that non-compliance with these critical areas of
health and safety will not be tolerated and certainly will not be given
tax
relief?</div><a name="08060388000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000394"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> As the hon. Lady rightly points out, the clause
repeals a section of the Capital Allowances Act which, since 1971,
provided relief to capital expenditure on alterations to existing
buildings required by a fire authority notice. Building regulations
again have intervened and required the necessary fire safety
precautions since 1976. The relief has served its purpose and is now
little used. The hon. Lady should remember that most expenditure on
fire prevention is deductible as revenue expenditure, or qualifies for
capital allowances under first principles anyway.</div>
<a name="08060388000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The redundant
nature of the requirement became even more clear in October 2006 when,
instead of a certificate to improve, prohibition notices were
introduced. I am told that approximately 50 prohibition notices are
handed out a year. The hon. Lady rightly saw the irony in a system
which gave a tax relief for those who put people&#146;s lives at risk
in order to put right the problem in the building, but did not
encourage people who did it voluntarily and did not put people&#146;s
lives at risk to take that action. That is why the section is being
repealed.</div><a name="08060388000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000395"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The clause introduces one of the most
fundamental changes to the capital allowances regime in this
year&#146;s Bill, because it provides for a new classification of
integral features of a building or a structure, expenditure on the
provision or replacement of which will qualify for phantom machinery
writing-down allowances at a rate of 20 per cent. through the insertion
of new sections 33A and 33B into the Capital Allowances Act
2001.</div>
<a name="08060388000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principle
of creating a new category of capital allowances for integral features
of buildings has been broadly welcomed by business, mainly because that
was the approach that seemed to be favoured by the majority of
businesses at the earlier consultation that the Treasury undertook. The
use of a simple list of qualifying features rather than laying out a
definition should, in theory, ensure simplicity, although I will come
on to why it will not quite work like that in practice. From an
environmental point of view, including electrical and water systems
should help to encourage the use of green technology for those systems
which previously would not have qualified for allowances.</div>
<a name="08060388000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the breadth of assets
captured by the new category of integral features is so broad that,
unless we get further guidance from the Treasury, it is in danger of
increasing rather than decreasing complexity. There seems to be a risk
that it will capture many more classes of asset than is perhaps
intended, although we will hopefully get to hear from the Minister what
the Treasury&#146;s intention is in a little more detail later.
Obviously the measure will spread the tax relief over much longer
periods, compared with the 20 per cent. pool for plant and
machinery.</div>
<a name="08060388000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I realise
that the approach chosen by the Government to define an integral
feature is vital and there were broadly two choices of how to do that.
We could have a general definition, by which criteria were established
to see whether any given spend met the criteria and therefore qualified
as an integral feature. That might be related to purpose or it could be
trade specific. Such an approach might have had the advantage of being
flexible enough to cope with the wide variety of situations that
businesses may find themselves in with regard to spend on what might be
classed as integral features, but the downside is that it leaves more
uncertainty. Presumably, we would then have to rely on legal cases to
establish where HMRC should draw lines in
practice.</div><a name="08060388000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other route is to be more prescriptive and simply to come up with a
list of what is in and what is out. I accept that the
Government&#146;s preference for a definition of which assets should
fall within the new 10 per cent. pool was for the second approach: a
simple list rather than a purposive definition. Having read the
consultation response from the Government in the technical note of
December 2007, I understand that the majority of the respondents found
favour with the second approach. Even so, some questions remain as to
how it will work in practice and how to ensure that it works as
intended. I should therefore like to take the opportunity to ask 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 437</div>the Minister to clear up some of the uncertainty that business still has
regarding the working of the clause in practice.</div>
<a name="08060388000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under proposed new section
33A(5) an integral feature is defined
as:</div><a name="08060388000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) an electrical
system (including a lighting
system),</div><a name="08060388000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) a cold water

external solar

was included in the original pre-legislative list&#151;active
façade systems&#151;in many cases known as windows. Obviously
for tax purposes, things such as the internal and external aspects of
the fitting are never quite so straightforward. I understand that
active façades will qualify, but perhaps the Minister can
confirm that. In particular, was there a reason why HMRC had them in
the original list but then took them out? Although active
façades will be able to be part of the list approach, tax
inspectors on the ground may take a more restrictive view of what is
included and seek to exclude them. It is important to get some clarity
from the Minister on that. Later, I will come on to why having general
guidance from the Treasury on that is
important.</div><a name="08060388000299"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="08060388000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
contained a power to remove plant or machinery from the list, or to add
assets that would not otherwise be plant or machinery to it. The power
did not, however, give the Government power to add plant or machinery
or remove assets that would not otherwise be plant or machinery. I
understand why the Minister has taken this approach and I accept that
it gives flexibility to add greener assets along similar lines to those
in the list.</div> <a name="08060388000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
definition to work effectively, business must know how HMRC will
interpret the rules of the allowance. The technical note in December,

on  page 47
that</div><a name="08060388000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the government
acknowledges the need of business for early sight of guidance on how
HMRC will interpret the legislation governing the integral features

give certainty to business in understanding how the allowance would
work in practice. My understanding is that we have not yet had that
guidance. Will the Exchequer Secretary tell us when we can expect to
see the guidance and when business can expect to get a clearer idea of
how the clause will work in
practice?</div><a name="08060388000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The transfer
of existing buildings will potentially be complicated for businesses
because different sets of rules might have to be followed depending on
whether the transfer is between parties that are connected or
unconnected and whether there are intra-transfers within chargeable
gains groups. Parties concerned in the transfer of property will have
to consider carefully whether it was owned prior to or after April
2008. That could be complicated because the parties concerned will have
to look carefully at matters such as elections 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>and disposal values. They will need to understand the different
approaches and determine which code they need to
follow.</div><a name="08060388000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
follow up the issues of replacement and repairs with the Exchequer
Secretary. The Treasury appears to be trying to define the 50 per cent.
equals replacement rule in terms of spend, but there is ambiguity in
that rule and perhaps some unfairness. Can she clarify the logic behind
the replacement of integral features approach, so that we can better
understand it?</div><a name="08060388000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
interesting article in <i class="I">The Tax Journal</i> in April 2008 gave the
example of a business that owned three floors of a building and totally
replaced the wiring and fittings on one floor. In theory, that would
not meet the 50 per cent. replacement rule. However, that floor
received 100 per cent. replacement. Would HMRC approach that example as
not meeting the 50 per cent. replacement rule, as I think it would, or
are there difficulties because it is a total replacement of one part of
the building? There is an additional issue that repairing one aspect of
something could be so expensive that it would be classed as a
replacement, whereas to all intents and purposes, it was a
repair.</div><a name="08060388000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">With all of
these problems there is the obvious issue of complexity. When carrying
out what they think are repairs, companies must estimate the costs from
the outset because they could end up doing what is classed for tax
purposes as replacing integral features. It is important, therefore,
that the Exchequer Secretary covers that in slightly more detail than
we have had in the explanatory notes.</div>
<a name="08060388000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
point that I want to follow up related to the specificity of the list
approach and possible unintended consequences of the inclusion of cold
water and electrical systems in the classification of integral features
of a building or structure. I understand that there have been concerns
within the water and electricity industries that the inclusion of those
items could end up including the water processing and supply systems of
the water industry or the generating and supply systems of an
electricity undertaking. The explanatory notes state that that should
not be the case and that the list has</div>
<a name="08060388000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no particular or unique bearing
on these businesses&#146; tax treatment, compared with other
businesses.&#148;</div> <a name="08060388000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even so, it
would be helpful if the Exchequer Secretary could make it clear that
those industries will not be inadvertently captured by the inclusion of
those items on the simple list. We understand why they are there, but
will she at least confirm that the interpretation will be as we expect
and not any wider? Again, if we had had guidance from the Treasury, as
was promised, it would have been easier to answer those questions
already, and that shows why having that guidance as soon as possible is
vital.</div><a name="08060388000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that the issues of the breadth of interpretation of the simple list
item will be of broader concern to other businesses, and although I
have mentioned particular issues raised by the water and electricity
industries, other cases might also come out in the fullness of time,
after the Bill has been enacted. Therefore, perhaps the Exchequer
Secretary will confirm that concerns about the lack of guidance have
been raised with the Treasury by the CBI on behalf of its members. I am
concerned that the explanatory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>notes, although they deal with that point, ultimately do not fully
address the concerns of business and that there seems to be continued
uncertainty. Therefore, it would be helpful if she could provide some
clarification on those matters.</div>
<a name="08060388000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall, we
understand that the Government took that approach because it was the
one favoured by business at the time of the original consultation. I
question whether business would still have been in favour of that
approach had they been able to see the Bill as we do today, but more
clarification from the Exchequer Secretary might address some of the
concerns that businesses currently have about that area. We might
nevertheless get to that simpler situation with regard to the treatment
of capital allowances that, as she has said already this morning, the
Government intended to achieve when they made these
changes.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000396"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The clause introduces a new capital allowance
classification of integral features of a building or structure. It is
part of a wider package of reforms to business taxation that was
announced in the Budget 2007 and designed to promote investment and
growth through reduced administrative burdens and complexity. I am glad
that the hon. Lady has made a point of saying that simplicity is also
important in maintaining both reforms of that kind and the fairness of
the tax system.</div> <a name="08060388000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reforms include the 2 per cent. cut in the main rate of corporation tax
from 30 to 28 per cent. and a simplified capital allowances system,
with two main rates of plant and machinery allowances: the 10 per cent.
rate and 20 per cent. rate. The clause puts into effect the list of
integral features, as the hon. Lady  has
said.</div><a name="08060388000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against
that background and as part of those reforms, the Government announced
their intention to introduce a separate capital allowances
classification of assets that are commonly integral features of a
building or structure so that expenditure on those assets can be
included in the new 10 per cent. pool. The Government decided to
introduce the new classification because over the years&#151;this is
an important point that relates to what the hon. Lady said about
simplicity&#151;the boundary between plant and machinery and
commercial buildings has been an area of considerable doubt and
uncertainty in tax law. The current law fails to reflect commercial
reality, in that, over time, assets commonly regarded as integral parts
of modern buildings, such as central heating and lifts, have come to
attract plant and machinery capital allowances at the main rate, which,
although it is
reduced&#151;</div><a name="08060388000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000397"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b><b class="B"> </b>Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="08060388000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000398"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I will give way when I have finished my
sentence&#151;although the rate is reduced from 25 per cent. to 20
per cent. by clause 77, it does not generally reflect the average rate
of economic depreciation. With the full stop approaching rapidly, I
give way to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="08060388000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000399"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I apologise for interrupting the Minister
mid-sentence. Where a company has had to put in a disabled lift because
of Government legislation, how 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>would that have been treated in the past? What rate would it have
attracted? I assume that it will attract a 10 per cent. rate in the
future. What does it currently
attract?</div><a name="08060388000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000400"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I will deal with that point, if I can, in due
course. I was talking about economic depreciation and how the new 10
per cent. rate is more easily aligned with that. Our purpose in
introducing the new classification is to ensure that certain assets,
commonly standard in modern buildings, should be eligible only for the
10 per cent. &#147;special rate&#148; of writing-down allowance and
should not be classified as plant and machinery. The rationale is that
a 10 per cent. rate is more appropriate than 20 per cent. on selected
assets, because they can have longer average economic lives than plant
and machinery do
generally.</div><a name="08060388000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000401"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Has the Treasury surveyed what the average
economic depreciation of plant and machinery assets is across the
board? I have seen other organisations&#146; estimates that suggest
that the average rate of depreciation in financial accounts is
something like 11.9 per cent. Is the Treasury&#146;s 10 per cent.
based on a different analysis or has it just taken 11.9 and sliced a
bit off for good
measure?</div><a name="08060388000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000402"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Maria Eagle.</div>
<a name="08060388000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000403"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Angela, Mr. Cook. You are not the first
person to make that error and I am convinced that you will not be the
last.</div>
<a name="08060388000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Treasury
does not just take a number and slice bits off in that way. It does its
own research on these matters. There have been efforts to establish,
not only in the accounting professions but in the Treasury itself,
precisely what the rate of economic depreciation on such assets would
be. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs looked at 190 large UK
groups and found average depreciation rates of 17 to 19 per cent. on
those assets.</div>
<a name="08060388000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000404"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Minister will anticipate the next
intervention. If the average depreciation rate is 17 to  19 per
cent. and, as she has told us, the purpose of bringing it down from 25
to 10 per cent. is to bring it more into line with economic rates of
depreciation, how does her Department&#146;s survey justify the
figure that she has
chosen?</div><a name="08060388000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000405"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The survey was about all assets and it did not look
at the difference between short and long-life assets. I am sure that if
the hon. Gentleman stopped and thought about it, he would have known
what I was going to
say.</div><a name="08060388000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall respond
to the hon. Member for Putney, but I have been sidetracked down
highways and byways. I want to answer the hon. Member for
Wellingborough&#146;s question about disabled lifts&#151;the rate
was 25 per cent. before April 2008 and it is 10 per cent now.</div>
<a name="08060388000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">To go back to our purpose in
introducing the new classification, the rationale for the change is
that for long-life assets the 10 per cent. rate is more appropriate
than a 20 per cent. rate, because long-life assets last longer and one
can get more services out of them before they depreciate. The clause
lists the selected 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div>integral feature assets, which, as the hon. Lady said, include
electrical systems, hot and cold water systems, heating, air
conditioning systems, lifts, escalators and moving walkways. The list
also contains a building feature that is environmentally beneficial,
which is external solar shading. Such expenditure on the fabric or
shell of the building itself would not normally qualify for any plant
and machinery capital allowances, but its inclusion on the list means
that it will attract allowances of 10 per cent. a
year.</div><a name="08060388000300"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="08060388000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to spend a little time dealing with the hon. Lady&#146;s
questions. The 2007 consultation document explained why we were not
attracted to the so-called purposive approach to the new classification
of integral features. I detected from her contribution that she was of
that opinion. She was certainly very understanding of the
approach.</div><a name="08060388000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000406"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> As ever, my party wants to listen to businesses
and work with them to achieve solutions that work for them. It was
therefore encouraging that the Treasury adopted the approach that
businesses said they favoured at the initial stage. My concerns are
about the implementation of that approach that appears in the Bill. We
must resolve these issues so that the measure can work as businesses
had intended when they said that they felt this was the better route to
take.</div><a name="08060388000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000407"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for saying that she
holds a similar opinion to the Government on this issue. I welcome her
view that simplicity is an important effect that we are trying to
achieve. We believe that the measure should simplify the current
systems. The definitions of electrical systems have not changed and the
trade-specific qualifications are no longer there, which is a major
simplification of the
system.</div><a name="08060388000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
asked about guidance and I can tell her that it will be produced for
Royal Assent. Once the Bill has become law, HMRC will ensure that there
is guidance on the interpretation of the new capital allowances that
she talked about so that companies can take advantage of
them.</div><a name="08060388000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000408"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> May I press the Exchequer Secretary to see
whether there is any chance of getting the guidance earlier? The sooner
business can look at the guidance and understand the impact in
practice, the better. I appreciate that Royal Assent is a calendar
point when everything can be issued at the same time, but that will not
give business much time to look at this matter. I encourage her to look
at whether it is possible for the Treasury to bring forward guidance
earlier.</div><a name="08060388000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000409"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The Treasury will have to bring forward guidance
when it can ensure that it is appropriate in detail and robust enough
to stand up to scrutiny. There is no point in producing guidance
quickly if much of it is wrong. There is always a balance. I have said
to the hon. Lady that we intend to produce the guidance for Royal
Assent. If it came to my attention that the guidance was in existence
and was ready and waiting to go, it would be in everybody&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>interests to make it available as soon as possible. However, it is
important that we ensure that it is as robust as possible before it is
issued so that confusion does not
result.</div><a name="08060388000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
asked about the removal of active façades from the list. She was
quite right to point out that that means windows in ordinary language.
She will know, as will anybody who has lived in a leasehold property,
that there is the outside of a window and the inside of a window. For
the purposes of her question, that is an important distinction, believe
it or not. She asked why active façades are being excluded from
the list. It is already accepted that the external skin of the active
façade&#151;I will not say window&#151;is not eligible.
However, the internal skin can be eligible because in effect it creates
a duct within which the cooling or heating air circulates. In other
words, the relevant parts of these systems, if they are ducts within
which cooling or heating air circulates, already qualify as integral
features by virtue of being part of the cooling or heating systems of
the building. So the answer is that if air is circulating and it is
part of a cooling or heating system&#151;the windows internally count
as integral parts&#151;the outsides are not but the insides can
be.</div>

<a name="08060388000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000411"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I am not sure what further light I can cast on this
issue, but I am happy to
try.</div><a name="08060388000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000412"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> There is further light. Will this be the kind of
clarification that businesses can expect to see in the guidance
notes?</div><a name="08060388000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000413"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Well, they can see it in the proceedings of this
Committee if they care to look. Clearly the guidance will also deal
with issues such as that.</div>
<a name="08060388000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady also asked about
transfers. We recognise that it is common for property and other
companies to transfer properties intra-group. In those circumstances it
would be unfair to require the company acquiring the property on or
after April 2008 to reallocate old expenditure to the new 10 per cent.
special rate pool. So we have provided in clause 79 and schedule 26
that in these circumstances the parties may elect that their old
integral features expenditure be allocated to the buyer&#146;s main
rate pool. In the case of unconnected persons, the existing section 198
rules which enable parties to agree the value of fixtures on transfer
already require the parties to identify amounts and actual assets
covered. So allocating the expenditure attributed to some of these
identified assets to the new 10 per cent. pool should not pose too much
of an additional burden.</div>
<a name="08060388000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
also asked about the replacement rule. She used the example of the
electrical system being replaced in three floors of a building and
asked whether that would be replacement or repair. If the company owned
three floors and replaced the electrical system for one
floor&#151;those of us who are whiz at mathematics can work out that
that is a third rather than 50 per cent.&#151;it would be classed as
a repair, not a replacement. She also mentioned some of the worries
that have been expressed by the water and electricity industries about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div>the classification of cold water systems and so on in the list and
wondered whether that would apply to bigger utility plants.</div>
<a name="08060388000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad to take this
opportunity to clarify that the inclusion of cold water and electrical
systems of a building or structure in the new integral features
classification does not mean that the disparate assets that comprise a
water processing and supply system of the water industry or the
electrical systems of an electricity undertaking would be caught by the
new definition. The classification applies to systems for the use and
consumption of water and electricity, not for their production and
distribution. I hope that the hon. Lady will consider that clear
enough.</div>
<a name="08060388000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">To come back
to the guidance not being published yet, companies will not have to
submit returns including their integral features calculations for up to
12 months. Long before that time, HMRC will have provided full guidance
on the new classifications in order for the transfer from the old to
the new system to proceed with as little disruption as possible. I hope
that with those clarifications, the clause can stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08060388000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000414"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for providing some
clarity. Obviously the sooner we can get the guidance the better.
Particularly with respect to some of the concerns that businesses have
raised since the original consultation, I urge her to work closely with
businesses to address any remaining concerns, especially on some of the
issues I have raised today. Although they may be clear to Ministers, we
need to make sure that they are clear to tax inspectors who are working

the new annual investment allowance. That is part of a wide-ranging

2007 Budget, the main objective of which is to promote investment and
growth, not only through a lower corporation tax rate on a broader
base, but by refocusing the tax system for small businesses by means of
generous and better-targeted incentives for investment. The new annual
investment allowance will provide that generous new
incentive.</div><a name="08060388000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The annual

allowance for the first &#163;50,000 of investment in plant or

their size. It is also a major simplification for the 95 per cent. of
businesses that invest less than &#163;50,000 a year in plant and

of the annual investment allowance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>through the publication of formal consultation documents in July and
December 2007. Respondents to the consultation generally welcomed the
proposed annual investment allowance and agreed that it would be of

not within our power to table amendments to the Bill that would have

point, but as the hon. Gentleman knows, we have made a commitment to
match the Government&#146;s spending plans for the three years of the
comprehensive spending review period. When that commitment was made, it
looked as though that would only bind an incoming Government for the
first year, 2010-11, but by the way they are going, one wonders 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>whether the change might occur rather earlier. However, I am sure that
you would not wish me to explore that line of thinking in any detail
this morning, Mr.
Cook.</div><a name="08060388000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Exchequer
Secretary said, schedule 24 introduces the annual investment allowance
that was announced in the 2007 Budget and a capped, 100 per cent. first
year writing-down allowance of capital expenditure up to a limit of
&#163;50,000. Let us focus on what the provision will replace. It
will replace the first year allowances for small companies that have
been available in recent years. It also has to compensate small
companies for the loss of industrial buildings allowance and
agricultural buildings allowances and the drop in the standard
writing-down allowance from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent., or 10 per
cent. in the case of integral features, as we have just debated. It is
also supposed to compensate small companies for the staged increase in
the small companies corporation  tax rate.</div>
<a name="08060388000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is true to
say that the overall package of capital allowance reforms and
corporation tax changes is neutral, broadly, but it would not be true
to say that the impact of these measures on small business was neutral.
The cuts in capital allowances for large companies are offset by cuts
in the main rate of corporation tax, but overall this package of
corporate tax changes raises the taxes on small companies, which will
see their allowances cut and the rate of corporation tax they pay
increase. Of course, the annual investment allowance will also be
introduced; I will come to that in a
moment.</div><a name="08060388000301"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="08060388000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The average
gain for a UK business from the introduction of the AIA in 2008 will be
somewhere between &#163;60 and &#163;70. That is calculated by
taking the Treasury&#146;s annual cost of the AIA&#151;&#163;920
million&#151;and dividing it by the Treasury&#146;s estimate of the
number of businesses in operation. In contrast, the average cost of
additional corporation tax for small companies as a result of the
removal of the small companies rate will be will be approximately
&#163;1,000
extra.</div><a name="08060388000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
the amendments to the schedule have been grouped together. Therefore,
with your permission, Mr. Cook, I intend to address not only
the amendments, but one or two other points that would relate to the
schedule in a stand part debate, as the amendments cover quite a wide
ranging
area.</div><a name="08060388000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 146 and 147 correct a defect in the drafting. I am glad
that that was spotted before the Bill got through the House. This is a
matter of parliamentary procedure. We are happy with those amendments
and agree that they are sensible and should not have any unintended
consequences.</div><a name="08060388000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendments Nos. 200 and 201, the annual investment allowance to be
introduced under schedule 24 is available only to companies, sole
traders and partnerships exclusively between individuals. That
treatment discriminates against mixed partnerships, which are formed
between companies and individuals. It also discriminates against any
form of business carried on by a trustee, whether as a partner in a
partnership&#151;I shall mention in a minute how that might
arise&#151;or where a trustee or trustees are carrying on business in
their own right as trustees.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div><a name="08060388000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Partnerships
between companies and individuals are common, particularly in the
agricultural sector and they are not unknown in the property sector.
Partnerships between companies are a common form of joint venture
structure. Trustees, particularly trustees of farmland, may wish to
carry on a trade or enter into partnerships to carry on such a trade.
There is also a possibility, where a partner in a partnership of
individuals dies and a settlement arises, that the trustees may wish to
continue trading the partnership interest on behalf of the settlement.
In such circumstances, I understand that the whole partnership would be
denied annual investment allowance, because one of the partners had
died and that partnership interest had passed to a settlement. That
outcome seems inequitable. The Government have not explained why it is
necessary to have such an unfair, distortive restriction. The
assumption in the industry is that they must fear some kind of
avoidance or abuse. In our view, discriminatory action against certain
structures of business is not justified unless the Government can show
a specific concern about a likely area of
abuse.</div><a name="08060388000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Exchequer Secretary will be aware that the Government have a stated
policy of neutrality in respect of different types of business
structure and of fairness between taxpayers who are in similar economic
situations, regardless of their legal structure. The schedule is quite
at odds with that stated objective in the way that it discriminates
against mixed partnerships and trustees engaging in a trade. The
amendment would delete the restriction on an eligible partnership so
that all partnerships become eligible for the annual investment
allowance rather than those partnerships being excluded that are formed
otherwise than as partnerships of individuals. Amendment No. 201
includes an explicit provision that would allow a trustee or trustees
to qualify for annual investment
allowance.</div><a name="08060388000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over
the next few provisions of the Bill, the Committee is being invited to
approve a wholesale reform of the capital allowances regime, not just a
minor tinkering. To pre-empt the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s response
to the amendments, I say that in these circumstances, we do not think
the mere fact that something has or has not been allowed in the past is
sufficient justification for continuing with clearly inequitable
treatment. In the context of a wholesale reform of the capital
allowances regime, if any such unequal treatment is to continue, it
must be justified on a case-by-case basis on the grounds of serious
risk to the Exchequer of avoidance or abuse. I look forward to hearing
the specific justification for the exclusion of mixed partnerships and
trustees.</div><a name="08060388000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 202 would delete the requirement for the taxpayer to own the
relevant plant and machinery at some point in the chargeable period. On
the face of it, that may seem a rather odd amendment, but there is
already a condition that the taxpayer must have incurred the relevant
expenditure on the asset during the chargeable period. It is
unnecessary and potentially inequitable to require him also to have
owned the asset during the chargeable period. The first condition that
he must have incurred the expenditure is sufficient to deal with the
issue. Why does the Exchequer Secretary consider it necessary to have
the supplementary condition that he has owned the asset during the
period?</div><a name="08060388000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
uncommon for expenditure on plant and machinery to be incurred before
the person incurring the expenditure has ownership. For example, where 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div>special-purpose machinery is being constructed, such as the building of
a customised production line, payments on account will typically be
required while the process of design, development and manufacture is
underway. The expenditure will perhaps be incurred many months before
the equipment is transferred to the ownership of the taxpayer. It seems
irrational not to allow that expenditure when it is incurred on the
basis that ownership has not been acquired at that point. Again, if the
Exchequer Secretary has some significant anti-avoidance concern that
causes her to make this restriction, we would be very interested to
hear it. I hope that she will acknowledge that something will have to
be done to ensure that staged payments on the construction of
special-purpose plant and machinery, for example, are not caught in the
way that I have
suggested.</div><a name="08060388000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 203 deals with the transfer of annual investment allowance forwards
or backwards. Under the schedule, the annual investment allowance can
be carried neither forwards nor backwards. For medium-sized businesses
in particular, which may invest &#163;50,000 a year on average over a
period of time, there is a risk that the lack of a carry-forward or
carry-back provision will lead to tax-driven behaviour, which in turn
will lead to sub-optimal outcomes in economic efficiency. That would be
bad for the individual business and for the
economy.</div><a name="08060388000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
that businesses will be tempted to plan their capital spending on the
basis not of the economic requirements of the business or the
economically most appropriate point at which to replace capital assets,
but the availability of the allowance in-year. There will be a strong
incentive to spread capital expenditure, which in some cases will mean
delaying capital expenditure. That does not make sense for anyone, if
the equipment in question needs to be replaced or new equipment needs
to be purchased to increase business capacity. Perhaps that is not
likely at the moment, but we live in hope that we may come to a point
in the cycle where capacity is under
pressure.</div><a name="08060388000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the allowance were able to be carried forward, a company might be
inclined to invest larger sums in new plant and equipment, knowing that
it could apply some of that expenditure to first-year allowance in the
second year or subsequent years. Clearly, the attractiveness of rolling
expenditure forward to use a future year&#146;s annual allowance
decreases sharply beyond the first or second subsequent year, as
writing-down allowances would have to be forgone. However, there is a
view that there should be the ability to roll expenditure forward, and
to some extent backwards, to take advantage of unused annual investment
allowance. The amendment proposes an unlimited ability to roll the
allowance forward, and a one-year limited ability to roll it backwards.
If the Government were minded to accept the proposal in principle,
further drafting would be necessary to ensure that expenditure was not
relieved twice. Just to be clear about that, we envisage that
writing-down allowance would be denied where capital expenditure was
treated in that way, or alternatively that it would be the written-down
value that was relieved in the later year. We certainly do not suggest
a double tax allowance. I would be interested to hear the Exchequer
Secretary&#146;s reasons for the non-inclusion of an ability to carry
forward or backwards the allowances.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 448</div><a name="08060388000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
earlier, the schedule sets how the annual investment allowance will
work, and individual businesses will have to look at that and see to
what extent it will compensate them for the additional costs that they
will face from the abolition of industrial buildings allowances and
agricultural buildings allowances, and from the higher rates of
corporation tax imposed on small companies. As ever with this
Government, even sensible measures are dragged into disrepute by being
implemented by stealth. If the generosity of capital allowances is
being reduced to fund a reduction in the mainstream rate of corporation
tax, why not say so, rather than pretending that the introduction of
annual investment allowances is some kind of bonus for smaller
companies that have, of course, not seen any reduction in their
corporation tax rate? In the past few years, those companies have
suffered an increase in that rate, unprecedented in the developed
world, when the trend among all our competitors is to reduce corporate
tax rates to stay competitive in the face of increasing global
competition from the developing economies, particularly in Asia. There
will be a significant distributional impact on different types of
businesses. Those with regular eligible capital expenditure will
benefit from the annual investment allowance, whereas those without
such qualifying expenditure will merely suffer the impact of the
abolition of industrial buildings allowances and agricultural buildings
allowances, and the increase in the corporation tax rate for smaller
companies.</div><a name="08060388000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apart from
the issues that I raised regarding mixed partnerships, the lack of
carry-back and carry-forward and the unnecessary restriction on
ownership of an asset, there are a couple of other points that I would
like to raise with the Exchequer Secretary. There is no index-linking
provision in respect of the &#163;50,000 cap on the AIA. New section
51A enables the Treasury to amend that cap, but there is no restriction
to ensure that that power is used only to increase the limit in line
with inflation. Mr. Cook, the Financial Secretary has
written to your co-Chairman, Sir Nicholas, about how the Treasury
intends to use powers where draft statutory instruments have not yet
been published, but there is no clue in that letter as to how the
Treasury intends to use this particular power. It is possible that it
could use the power under new section 51A to decrease that limit. We
have to assume that that is not the Treasury&#146;s intention. Can
the Minister confirm that the Government&#146;s intention, with
respect to the power under new section 51A, is simply to be able to
increase the limit in due course? I accept that it might not make sense
to index it precisely year by year, but the intention is to increase
the limit periodically, so that its real value is broadly
maintained.</div>
<a name="08060388000302"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="08060388000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">New section 51B
introduces a restriction on the availability of the allowance for
groups of companies under common control. New section 51A does the same
for other companies under common control. In both cases, the
restrictions apply where companies are controlled by the same person
and the companies are related to one another&#151;two separate
criteria have to be satisfied. New section 51G defines
&#147;related&#148; and provides that two companies are related if
they either carry out similar activities or share premises. The similar
activities test is clearly required to avoid artificial fragmentation
of businesses&#151;we do not have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div>any argument with that. However, the shared premises test potentially
gives rise to a number of problems. The first is that it is not clear
what the term &#147;carry on&#148; means in new subsection (5),
which
states:</div><a name="08060388000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
shared premises condition is met...if...the companies carry
on qualifying activities from the same
premises.&#148;</div><a name="08060388000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall use a hypothetical example to illustrate the concern. I hope that
the Minister is briefed on it; as it was raised at the open day as an
example of a potential problem, she should have a briefing note. A
farmer manages his farming company, which carries on a farming
business. He also manages a separate holiday lettings company that lets
cottages adjacent to, but not part of, the farm. He manages both
separate businesses from his home. Is it possible that both businesses
could be said to be &#147;carried on&#148; from the same premises?
They are administered from the same premises, even though the premises
used for the delivery of the businesses are clearly separate&#151;in
one case the farm premises and in the other case the holiday cottages,
which are let out. It is an important point, as there is a danger that
many small businesses could be caught unintentionally&#151;I
think&#151;by the shared premises test, if the Minister has to tell
the Committee that two businesses administered from the same office
will be caught by the test.</div>
<a name="08060388000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are also issues about the
definition of &#147;premises&#148;. I am advised that there are a
number of different definitions used in different areas of tax
legislation and it is not clear what definition of premises is intended
to apply in the new section of the Capital Allowances Act 2001. Can the
Minister clarify where the relevant definition of premises is
found?</div> <a name="08060388000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Depending on
the Minister&#146;s answer to my question about sharing
administrative offices, and whether that constitutes the sharing of
premises and thus a connection between businesses for the purposes of
new section 51E, the Committee may need to address a question of
principle. Again, I illustrate the issue by an example. A husband and
wife jointly own two companies&#151;a taxi business and a small
building firm. Mrs. A operates the taxi company, perhaps
from their home or a small office that they rent nearby. Mr.
A runs the building business, which is administered from the same
office, but obviously will not be carried out, in the sense of
delivering building activity, in that office. The taxi business is
actively run from the office&#151;taking phone calls, making bookings
and so on&#151;while the building business is merely administered
from the office, in ordering materials, communicating with customers,
and dealing with record keeping, accounts and all the bureaucracy
entailed in running any small business these
days.</div><a name="08060388000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely to
goodness, we in the Committee do not want to create a situation in
which two such businesses have to operate from separate premises to
secure a tax benefit in the form of the annual investment allowance.
That would be crazy, forcing the husband and wife pair of businesses to
operate from separate premises, rent additional offices, pay two sets
of overheads and heat and light two sets of offices. I know that the
Minister will be worried about the carbon impact. Surely the objective
of tax policy cannot be to force people into tax-driven behaviour that
is, frankly, economically bonkers. I cannot think of another word for
it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div><a name="08060388000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not want the tax tail
wagging the economic dog, and I hope that the Exchequer Secretary will
offer the required reassurance to make it crystal clear not only to
Committee members but to those who advise small businesses throughout
the land that it is not the intention for businesses operating in that
way to be caught by the shared premises condition. If she can be clear
about that, I hope that she will also give us a commitment&#151;even
if she cannot do anything right now&#151;to look between now and
Report at whether anything can be done to the drafting of the shared
premises condition to make it absolutely clear that it does not apply
to the kind of case that I have given as an
example.</div>

Eagle:</b> I am happy to oblige.</div>
<a name="08060388000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
introduces the rules for the new annual investment allowance of
&#163;50,000 a year for business investment in plant and machinery.
The Government consulted extensively about the design and technical
detail of the annual investment allowance through the publication of
formal consultation documents in July and December 2007. Respondents to
the consultation generally welcomed the proposed annual investment
allowance and agreed that it would be of particular benefit to smaller
business. As befits a major simplification measure, the Government have
taken a light-touch approach to the targeting of the annual investment
allowance, which should ensure that the allowance is a welcome and
effective investment incentive for the vast majority of
businesses.</div>
<a name="08060388000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
deliberately sought to make the process as simple as possible, but at
the same time we must of course protect the Exchequer by ensuring that
certain basic rules protect that valuable new allowance from
exploitation and avoidance. We have done everything we can to make
those basic rules as simple and clear-cut as possible to keep the
compliance burdens to a minimum. In outline, the basic rules are
contained in the schedule and are broadly as follows. Unless,
exceptionally, two or more businesses are controlled by the same person
and also fall within one of the two simple tests per related business,
the annual investment allowance will be available to any individual
carrying on a qualifying activity. That includes trades, professions,
vocations, ordinary property businesses and individuals having an
employment or office, any partnership consisting only of individuals,
and any singleton company or group of companies.</div>
<a name="08060388000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rules
give a business almost complete freedom to allocate the annual
investment allowance between different types of expenditure in any way
that it chooses. For example, a business may allocate the annual
investment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 451</div>allowance against any expenditure on integral features&#151;the new
classification that we have just discussed&#151;or long-life asset
expenditure. Both qualify for the lower 10 per cent. rate of
writing-down
allowance.</div><a name="08060388000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
being financially beneficial, the measure should operate as a proxy for
a de minimis provision for integral features expenditure by smaller
businesses. In other words, smaller firms may be able to dispense
altogether with a 10 per cent. special rate pool if the amount of their
integral features expenditure does not exceed &#163;50,000 a year.
The rules also allow persons in control the freedom to allocate the AIA
between companies in a group, between related companies or between
related unincorporated businesses in any way that they see fit. There
is no requirement to apportion the allocation of the AIA in any way or
on any particular basis; so, for example, in a group of five companies,
all of the AIA could be allocated to one company or split between all
or any of the five as the group finds most
convenient.</div><a name="08060388000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rules
provide that a company is related to another company in a financial
year&#151;and, separately and independently, that an unincorporated
business is related to another in a tax year&#151;if the businesses
in question are controlled by the same person and either the shared
premises condition or the similar activities condition, or both, is met
in the relevant year. Whether commonly controlled businesses share the
same premises is a very simple test, and it should be straightforward
for taxpayers to understand.</div>
<a name="08060388000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall take this opportunity
to deal with the holiday let and farming business example mentioned by
the hon. Gentleman in his opening remarks. He is right to say that the
matter was raised at an HMRC open day, but Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs confirmed then that the holiday let business and farming
business that he described would not be regarded as conducted from the
same premises just because the owner of both did his paperwork in the
farmhouse. &#147;Premises&#148; has its everyday meaning in that
context. In other words, it is not where the paperwork is done; it is
where the business is actually carried on. I hope that gives him some
of the reassurance that he was after, but he wants to get to his feet,
so I am happy to
oblige.</div><a name="08060388000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000426"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that
point, although there is something of a caveat in the clarification.
She implied that what she said is the case because the activity carried
on in the farmhouse is de minimis&#151;a bit of paperwork is being
done. Perhaps she will address the other example that I used later,
which involved a more substantive carrying on of a business: the taxi
and building companies carried on by a husband and wife, not from their
home but from a rented office. She may not have the answer immediately
to hand, but can she confirm that the same rule would apply as in the
case of the farming and holiday letting business? That would be a great
reassurance.</div><a name="08060388000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000427"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I will come back to that question and try to be as
helpful as I can. It is always difficult to give tax advice on the hoof
when it will be read by many tax advisers. I do not want to seem as
though I am making it up as I go along, but I can confirm at least that

<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div>administration would not determine the location of the qualifying
activity. As with all such matters, a certain amount of checking and
considering each example will happen as we go along, in order to
clarify the rules. I hope that gives the hon. Gentleman some
comfort.</div>
<a name="08060388000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">It should be
remembered that the vast majority of people do not control a
multiplicity of related businesses. The issue may worry some, but it
will not be at the forefront of everybody&#146;s mind in every
circumstance. In general, the related businesses rules have been
welcomed in the accounting press as clear and simple to apply. We
always keep such measures under review to see how things develop.
However, there has been a general welcome for our approach with respect
to related
businesses.</div>
<a name="08060388000303"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="08060388000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman spoke about the annual investment allowance. It is important
to remember that it is a major simplification for the 95 per cent. of
UK businesses that invest up to &#163;50,000 a year. It will provide
a valuable cash-flow boost, especially for smaller businesses, as it
effectively gives 100 per cent. write-down. It will therefore encourage
investment. In that context, it is important to remember that three
quarters of small businesses are unincorporated and will therefore
benefit from the annual investment allowance without being affected by
the increases in the small companies rate. In general, if separate
businesses are engaged in separate business activities, even if they
are controlled by the same person, they will be entitled to one annual
investment allowance each.</div>
<a name="08060388000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first two
of the Opposition&#146;s amendments deal with the basic rules on who
can qualify for the annual investment allowance. They seek to extend
the allowance to any partnership, including what are called mixed
partnerships&#151;those that involve both individuals and
companies&#151;and the second of them would extend it also to include
trusts.</div> <a name="08060388000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
restriction on such partnerships and trusts claiming annual investment
allowance is carried forward from the existing first-year allowance
regime, which the new system replaces.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I hear the hon. Gentleman
chuntering, but he made those points himself. He said that just because
a rule had been in place in a previous system did not mean that it
should automatically be included in the new system. I do not disagree
with him in principle. However, it is important to understand the
reason for the rules. After careful
consideration&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I shall
explain why in a moment if the hon. Gentleman will let me finish the
sentence.</div> <a name="08060388000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
reason for introducing the rules under the previous system. When they
were introduced in 1997, the then Financial Secretary, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), who is now
Minister of State, Department of Health, explained to the Finance Bill
Committee why the allowances would not be extended to those entities.
Her explanation holds good today in relation to the annual investment
allowance exclusion. My right hon. Friend
said:</div><a name="08060388000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Incredibly
complex rules would be required to bring them in, which would open
possible abuses of tax-driven options that the hon. Gentleman would
deprecate.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee
A,</i> 23 April 1997; c.446.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 453</div><a name="08060388000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, there is an issue about
fraud avoidance, fragmentation and so on. They are all things that the
hon. Gentleman, who is a sophisticated member of the Opposition, knows
can be done; he knows what some people will do, and the lengths that
they will go to in order to attract investment allowances if they are
given the chance. He knows the implications.</div>
<a name="08060388000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, extending the
annual investment allowance to partnerships involving trusts would
complicate the rules for determining whether a business was in common
control&#151;rules that accounting experts have described
as</div> <a name="08060388000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;very simple and easy
to understand, and likely to prevent abuse without troubling ordinary
businesses.&#148;</div> <a name="08060388000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
have thought that that was welcome. I am at some loss as to why the
hon. Member for Putney should think that simplification is a good thing
yet the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge should say that we
ought to extend the rules to partnerships, trusts and mixed
partnerships. The latter would create massive complications, bringing
company tax as well as income tax rules into play, and creating a whole
string of rules to minimise the potential for avoidance. It would be
far more complex than the simple rules that we are trying to create,
which include the exclusions that the hon. Gentleman seeks to
abolish.</div> <a name="08060388000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
amendments are likely to increase the Exchequer cost of the measure by
approximately  &#163;50 million a year. Continuation of the
existing exclusions strike the right balance between simplicity and
providing a valuable incentive to businesses to invest. I ask the
Committee to resist the first two Oppositions
amendments.</div><a name="08060388000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
group of amendments includes two minor Government amendments.
Government amendment  No. 146 deals with the basic annual
investment allowance entitlement rules and seeks to correct some
defective wording by replacing it with a new subsection. The purpose is
to ensure that if a business in start up incurs pre-commencement
expenditure on or after the relevant annual investment allowance start
date in April 2008, that expenditure will qualify on commencement of
the businesses qualifying activity. The amendment therefore makes a
beneficial change.</div>
<a name="08060388000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The defective
wording that amendment No. 146 replaces occurs later in the schedule
and so, chronologically, our second amendment&#151;No.
147&#151;should be debated after that. The amendment amounts simply
to a technical tweak, and I hope that the Committee will be content for
me to refer to it as that. These Government amendments will be of
benefit to business and I encourage the Committee to support
them.</div><a name="08060388000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
confess that the remaining Opposition amendments have caused me some
confusion because I had thought that the plans they had published
reduced the main rate of corporation tax, for which they tabled an
amendment to clause 4, and that they wished to abolish the annual
investment allowance. However, these amendments would increase the
scope of the annual investment allowance at significant
cost.</div><a name="08060388000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 202 undermines the fundamental tenet of the way in which capital
allowances operate and could lead to more than one business claiming
relief for the same expenditure. I heard the comments of the hon.
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div>the amendment would remove the requirement for a business to own the
plant and machinery during the chargeable period for which they are
claiming annual investment allowance. For obvious reasons, businesses
are generally required to own or be deemed to own the plant and
machinery on which they are claiming plant and machinery allowances.
Where a business does not own the plant and machinery, it may be
possible to claim tax relief on contributions to that expenditure, but
that is governed by a different part of capital allowances legislation.
That legislation prevents the same business from claiming both for
capital allowances and for contributions. However, because the
amendment would allow businesses to claim annual investment allowance
on contributions, it is possible that one business would be able to
claim for contributions and the other for owning the plant and
machinery. That is clearly not
desirable.</div><a name="08060388000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 203 would allow businesses to carry forward or back any annual
investment allowance&#151;effectively it would prevent the annual
investment allowance being annual. The amendment would significantly
undermine the simplification benefits of the annual investment
allowance and would require businesses to track both their expenditure
and their unused annual investment allowance over a number of years.
Additional legislation would be required to deal with how to cumulate
unused allowances if they were carried forward indefinitely, which
would result in unintended behavioural effects, such as businesses
deliberately saving up annual allowance entitlement to spend
significant amounts in one year. It is likely that that would have a
significant cost that would build up considerably over
time.</div><a name="08060388000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said earlier, 95 per cent. of businesses invest less than
&#163;50,000 in any one year and the Government have taken a power,
about which the hon. Gentleman asked, to vary the level of the annual
investment allowance. I can confirm that what is in our mind with
regards to that power is perhaps not strict indexation, but it
certainly relates to going up, not down. The power to vary that is in
the Bill and the hon. Gentleman noticed it. The annual investment
allowance represents an incentive for investment and simplification for
the smallest businesses in particular. Opposition amendments tend to
complicate and with all due respect these amendments leave the annual
investment allowance open to abuse in some cases. That is particularly
true in relation to the Opposition&#146;s proposal to extend mixed
partnerships, which would certainly complicate things and lead to
situations in which there might be difficulty in defending the
integrity of the allowance.</div>
<a name="08060388000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, I ask the Committee
to support the two minor Government amendments in the group, but to
oppose the Opposition
amendments.</div><a name="08060388000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000428"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for clearing up one
or two things. I am also grateful for confirmation that the
Government&#146;s intention with regards to a broad indexation over
time is what we had hoped. To be clear, the Minister suggested that
there is some incompatibility between being opposed to something in
principle and seeking to probe the way that it will work in practice.
The truth is that the Government will get their measures through the
Committee&#151;they may even get them through the House, although
this subject is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div>something that increasingly consumes our attention. Whatever our
principled objections and preferences at strategic level, we must
establish how the Government intend to deal with something like the
annual investment allowance and we must challenge the individual
aspects and workability of that.</div>
<a name="08060388000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000429"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I suppose that my point was a slightly narrower
one. I can understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, it is
perfectly legitimate and that is what these Committees are for.
However, some of the amendments tabled by the Opposition widen the
scope of the annual investment allowance, they do not probe how it
would work.</div>
<a name="08060388000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000430"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The amendment in relation to carry forward and
carry back seeks to obtain the Minister&#146;s comments on an issue
that has been raised by an outside professional body. We are interested
to hear what she says. She has told the Committee that significant
costs would be involved, and that is a perfectly legitimate
consideration. In my remarks, I raised the concern that investment
behaviour may be tax-driven in a way that might be unhealthy and
economically inefficient. Although she did not refer to it, I hope that
the Treasury will also have considered that as a balancing factor. I
accept that there must be a balance drawn in these
things.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000431"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Of course, part of the thinking behind the change
in investment allowances in general, of which this is a part, is to
align behaviour more with the economic costs in riding down particular
investments. Will he comment on his own party&#146;s proposals in
this area? Capital allowances are cut in order to fund changes in
corporation tax, and that leads to a situation where there are tax
disadvantages to investing, as it takes the tax allowances that are
given in those circumstances below the economic cost of making the
investment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div><a name="08060388000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000432"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> It would be accompanied by a substantial
reduction in the headline rate of corporation tax. The other point is
that our proposals will be presented in the manifesto at the next
general election.</div>

it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000434"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Thank you, Mr. Cook, I shall attempt
not to respond to provocation. The Minister sought to be helpful in
explaining how the shared premises test would work. I am still
concerned, although somewhat reassured because where one business is
functionally run and performed in a premises and another is merely
administered from it, it should not be caught by the shared premises
test.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060388000436"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Minister nods her head, so that clears that
up. We are still concerned about the mixed partnership rules. She says
that there is substantial scope for abuse, and implies that I know what
that scope is. I am sorry to disappoint her, but I do not know what the
scope for abuse is&#151;I have been racking my brains trying to think
about what mischief one could get up to. She has not addressed the
point that the Government have a clear policy of similar treatment for
similar economic activity regardless of the legal structure and we are
disappointed that she was not able to deal with that.</div>
<a name="08060388000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation to ownership, of
