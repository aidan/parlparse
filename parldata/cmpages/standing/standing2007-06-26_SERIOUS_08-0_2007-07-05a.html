Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): When we adjourned, I was
halfway through explaining that amendment No. 178 was tabled on the
assumption that we will ultimately reach a resolution on the matters
that we were discussing. The amendment is reasonably straightforward
and sets out the Committee&#146;s clear intention on how data
protection issues will be addressed and the seriousness with which they
are treated. I need say no
more.</div>

Mr. Benton. It is good to see you chairing our Committee
again.</div>
					<a name="07070549000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Committee to resist the amendment, which would increase the penalties
in clause 65 for the clause 64 offence of
making</div>

disclosures of

existing maximum penalty of a two-year custodial sentence would be
increased to four
years.</div>
					<a name="07070549000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 64 and
65 were included in the Bill in recognition of the fact that a specific
additional safeguard is needed to protect against improper onward
disclosure of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs information.
That is to conform with the safeguards attached to HMRC information in
other circumstances. Clause 64 allows for the same additional
safeguards to be applied by order to public authorities&#146;
information. I hope that it is evident that the penalty in clause 65
applies in a very narrow set of circumstances relating to wrongful
onward disclosure of information shared by public authorities through a
specified anti-fraud organisation. Currently, that applies only to HMRC
information.</div>
					<a name="07070549000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
maximum penalty of two years&#146; imprisonment is consistent with
the maximum penalty for all other comparable data-sharing
offences&#151;for example, under section 19 of the Commissioners for
Revenue and Customs Act 2005 and section 10 of the Official Secrets Act
1989. In addition, the Government have proposed an amendment to the
Data Protection Act 1998 to include a maximum custodial penalty of two
years for the offence of unlawfully obtaining personal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>data under section 55 of that Act; the measure is in the recently
published Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. The Government do not
accept the case for doubling the penalty in the limited circumstances
of clause
64.</div>

Brokenshire:
						</b> I hear what the Minister says. The amendment
is in some ways different from the measures that he has highlighted. We
tabled the amendment to make clear our view that the offence must be
treated seriously, and to provide confidence in the way in which the
system will operate. I do not intend to press the amendment to a
Division; the point of tabling it was to set out for the Committee that
breaches of data protection rules and the rules in clause 64 will be
treated seriously and punished
accordingly.</div>

							<a name="07070549000300"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> The clause would insert additional wording in
schedule 3 to the Data Protection Act 1998. The disclosure of sensitive
information will be permitted if it is processed for the purpose of
disclosure to an anti-fraud organisation of the kind that we debated
this morning, or is processed by that person after being so
disclosed&#151;in other words, if it is then processed thereon. The
question is: why is the clause needed? The list of sensitive personal
data that are covered is broad in ambit, and it goes much further than
might be perceived necessary for a simple anti-fraud purpose. It has
provoked some concerns among various groups. Liberty&#146;s briefing
note says:</div>
					<a name="07070549000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
fear that this provision might instead be included because it would be
too difficult in practice to separate out this kind of sensitive
information from non-sensitive information which is contained in a
single source of data that would be shared under these
proposals.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070549000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
adds:</div>
					<a name="07070549000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Administrative
convenience is not a sufficient justification for the mass sharing of
sensitive
data.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070549000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may say that the provision is required, and that it is an
essential element in the fight against crime. However, it is wide
ranging, and he must provide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>a justification for it, an assurance that it is not based on the
administrative convenience that Liberty has highlighted, and a clearer
understanding of the provision&#146;s necessity, so that we might
consider it accordingly.</div>
					<a name="07070549000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000301"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The clause inserts a new paragraph in schedule 3
to the Data Protection Act 1998 to facilitate the sharing of sensitive
personal data, as the hon. Member for Hornchurch says, for the purpose
of preventing fraud. The first data protection principle prohibits the
processing of sensitive personal data, unless one of the conditions in
schedule 3 to the Act is met. For example, paragraphs 7(1)(b) and
7(1)(c) of schedule 3 state that processing is
necessary</div>
					<a name="07070549000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the
exercise of any functions conferred on any person by or under an
enactment, or for the exercise of any functions of the Crown, a
Minister of the Crown or a government
department.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070549000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State may by order add further conditions under schedule
3.</div>
					<a name="07070549000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although many
public bodies will be able to rely on one of the current conditions in
or applied under schedule 3, it is unlikely that the existing
conditions would cover all cases of data sharing to prevent fraud.
Therefore, the clause provides an additional condition that is tailored
to anti-fraud data sharing and will facilitate such data sharing. It
does not decrease the threshold of data protection which applies under
the Data Protection Act.</div>
					<a name="07070549000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must stress that the
provision is not a move to overturn the Data Protection Act or the
principles that form its basis. The clause will not remove the need for
data controllers either to comply with the data protection principles
or to satisfy the conditions for an exemption from them, such as the
exemption for crime prevention. The clause simply helps data
controllers to comply with the additional requirement of the Act which
relates to sensitive personal data when information is shared to
prevent fraud. Although many bodies would already be able to comply
with one of the existing conditions for sharing such information, the
clause provides consistency throughout the full range of bodies that
will share the information.</div>
					<a name="07070549000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 2 of
the Data Protection Act defines sensitive personal data; the definition
includes information about political opinions, religious beliefs and
racial origins of the data subject. It also includes information about
the commission or alleged commission by the data subject of any
offence. That part of the definition is relevant in this context. The
definition also includes criminal proceedings for any offence committed
or alleged to have been committed by the data subject. Again, that part
of the definition is of obvious relevance in the context of the
disclosure of information for the prevention of fraud. However, it is
also possible that in disclosing information relating to offences or
suspected offences, other sensitive personal data are necessarily
disclosed. For example, information that a person was suspected of
claiming sickness benefit for longer than he was entitled has the
effect of disclosing information about his physical health, namely that
he was initially entitled to such benefit. Physical or mental health or
condition is also included in the definition of sensitive personal
data.</div>
					<a name="07070549000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although many
of the disclosures to an anti-fraud organisation will be covered by one
or another of the existing conditions, not all will. That is why we are

<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>bringing forward the additional conditions. Under clause 66, all the
information that is disclosed would have to be necessary for the
prevention of fraud. In addition, the body sharing the information
would have to do so either as a member of an anti-fraud organisation or
in accordance with the arrangements made by such an organisation, so
that data sharing will be subject to the rules of the anti-fraud
organisation.</div>
					<a name="07070549000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
individuals will be informed that their data may be shared for the
purpose of fraud prevention at the point that they provide the data.
Individuals will be able to require the Information Commissioner to
assess whether their data are being processed in compliance with the
Data Protection Act. The commissioner may also investigate whether the
data controller is complying with the Act on his own initiative. He
will also be able to investigate using his normal powers and, where
appropriate, he will be able to use an enforcement notice to require
the data controller to take steps to comply with the Data Protection
Act. With that explanation, I hope that the Committee will allow clause
66 to stand part of the
Bill.</div>

Browne:
						</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. Benton, for
giving me an opportunity to speak briefly about these amendments Nos.
14, 15 and 13, which stand in my name. During our proceedings this
morning, we had a detailed conversation about clause 63; there is a lot
of overlap and cross-over into the schedule, so I do not intend to
repeat the points that I and others raised previously. However, I shall
explain, for the benefit of members of the Committee the purpose of the
amendments and the thinking behind
them.</div>
					<a name="07070549000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 14 and 15 would provide for an annual review of the code for data
matching. My concern is that the time scales are too flexible and are
insufficiently specific. The amendments, which amend the same sentence
but reorder the wording, are designed to provide for an annual review.
Amendment No. 13 relates to the point that I was discussing, along with
others, with the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham, this morning. The amendment would require the code on data
matching to be published before any information could be disclosed. I
take the point that the right hon. and learned Gentleman made that,
although that requirement would be more onerous than what is currently
in the Bill, it would be better still to accept amendment No. 241
because that would provide for approval by Parliament.</div>
					<a name="07070549000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">My intention, subject to other
contributions during the discussion on the schedule, is to press
amendments Nos. 14 and 15 to a vote, because they address a specific
different point about time scales, but not to press amendment No. 13 to
a vote. I would be minded to support amendment No. 241 if that were
pressed to a vote by other hon.

the hon. Gentleman might think about the expression &#147;on an
annual basis.&#148; As I understand it, that means that the
Commission might to do it only every 12 months, whereas it might want
to look at the matter sooner if some event crops up. Should not the
wording be &#147;at least
annually&#148;?</div>

							<a name="07070549000307"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> That is a good point. My thinking may have been
insufficiently demanding when I tabled the amendments and we may table
further amendments at a later stage. I share the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s view that requirements should be in place to ensure
that the mechanisms are reviewed periodically in a way that is likely
to provide greater safeguards. I accept that he may not regard
&#147;annually in all circumstances&#148; as sufficient, but the
clause as drafted does not specify a time scale, so it could stretch
indefinitely into the future, which would be
unsatisfactory.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000308"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> The schedule deals with data matching. I
welcome the additional changes in schedule 7, especially the insertion
of new section 32A(5) of the Audit Commission Act 1998, which
states:</div>
					<a name="07070549000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A data
matching exercise may not be used to identify patterns and trends in an
individual&#146;s
characteristics&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070549000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister referred to that this morning. That is a welcome improvement
as it defines the contrast between 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>data matching and data mining, which was referred to at the start of our
previous debate, which is very
helpful.</div>
					<a name="07070549000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
concern remains about whether we are being taken down another track. It
is important to keep the code of practice on data matching under
review. I say to the hon. Member for Taunton that the ambit of language
in proposed new section 32G(1) is already fairly broad; my
interpretation is that the code will be under constant review that may
be wider than the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments
propose.</div>
					<a name="07070549000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
the hon. Gentleman will not press amendment No. 13 to a Division. My
clear impression is that the clause refers to the data matching code
rather than to the data sharing code: the two need to be kept separate
as they are assessing different things. However, our argument that the
code needs parliamentary approval is still relevant for the purposes of
data sharing, which we debated this morning. We therefore tabled
amendment No. 241, which provides that the code on data
matching</div>
					<a name="07070549000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall not have
effect until a draft has been laid before, and approved by a resolution
of, both Houses of
Parliament.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070549000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may have
rehearsed some of the arguments earlier, but I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s response to the amendments. It is important that
there is some assurance that not only has there been consultation with
the relevant persons, such as the Information Commissioner, but that
there will be external and parliamentary scrutiny of the
code.</div>
					<a name="07070549000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
parliamentarians, we want to be able to say that we are satisfied that
the code of practice provides the intended protections, so that the
concern we have highlighted about the ambit of data matching in respect
of the code of practice is adequately addressed. I will listen with
interest to the Minister&#146;s response to the amendment before
deciding whether to press it to a
Division.</div>

							<b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I rise briefly to
support what my hon. Friend said about the amendment. I share his
reservations about the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Taunton
as it is vital to have a code that can be amended as flexibly as
possibly to deal with what may be a fast-changing situation. I attended
a presentation by the National Fraud Initiative, which the Minister
kindly
arranged.&#151;</div>

							<a name="07070549000310"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank the hon. Member for Hornchurch for the
point that he made about proposed new section 32A(5) of the Audit
Commission Act 1998. We want to ensure that our approach is
conciliatory. I also thank the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and
West Devon, who rightly pointed out to the hon. Member for Taunton that
it is the flexibility to review the code that is important. That might
be done more than once a year.</div>
					<a name="07070549000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Taunton has
tabled two amendments that would have the cumulative effect of
requiring the Audit Commission to review its code of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>data matching practice every year. To date, the national fraud
initiative has been carried out only every other year. The new
provisions already place a duty on the Audit Commission and other audit
bodies using the powers to keep the code of data matching under review.
In practice, that means that the code will be reviewed and updated
before each round of data matching occurs, in order to take account of
developments that have taken place over the previous two
years.</div>

							<a name="07070549000311"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> It is a bit like Wimbledon here&#151;it is
difficult to maintain one&#146;s train of thought. We should have
some sympathy for the competitors there.</div>
					<a name="07070549000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the amendments tabled by the
hon. Member for Taunton, it does not follow that the code should
automatically be reviewed every two years; it might be appropriate for
it to be done more or less frequently. I think that that point has also
been made by other members of the Committee.</div>
					<a name="07070549000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment tabled by the
hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert), which was moved
by the hon. Member for Hornchurch, would prevent the code of data
matching from having effect until it was approved by both Houses of
Parliament. We debated some of those issues this morning, and my
contention is still the same in respect of the code of practice and the
data sharing principles. My objection to this amendment is the same as
my objection to the earlier one requiring the data sharing code to be
approved by both Houses of Parliament before it is published. The
Information Commissioner was specifically appointed to be the
independent regulator responsible for monitoring compliance with the
Data Protection Act. The Audit Commission will be required to consult
him when preparing or revising the code, and to send a copy of the code
to the Secretary of State, who will be under a duty to lay it before
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="07070549000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
arrangements that Parliament is in the process of putting in place, I
wonder whether it is necessary, or right, for it to involve itself in
approving the code. As I indicated earlier, such a step would duplicate
the functions entrusted to the Information Commissioner by Parliament
and encroach on his supervisory and regulatory remits. The Information
Commissioner answers to Parliament and can, if he wishes to do so,
report to the House if he is unhappy with the way in which powers are
being used.</div>
					<a name="07070549000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
earlier, if we ask Parliament to approve the code of practice, where
will that leave all the existing codes, which have not been approved?
The question follows, should Parliament be asked to approve all codes
of practice as they come up for renewal? I am not sure that that would
be an economic use of Parliament&#146;s valuable time. I hope that my
explanation has reassured the hon. Gentleman and that he will be
willing to withdraw the amendment.</div>

Brokenshire:
						</b> We will reflect on the Minister&#146;s
comments on the ability of the Information Commissioner to report back
to Parliament on the code of practice, and on whether that gives this
place sufficient oversight to ensure that the protections that we would
like to have in the code are properly
maintained.</div>
					<a name="07070549000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
basis of what the Minister has said, I do not wish to press amendment
No. 241 to the vote. The work of the Audit Commission on the national
fraud initiative has been very effective, and I recognise that the
powers are intended to bring that within a statutory framework. We
shall reflect on the Minister&#146;s reassurances, including those
about the Information Commissioner, and consider whether the issue
needs to be revisited on

					<a name="07070549000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to a very different issue: the scrutiny of the Serious
Organised Crime Agency in its enlarged and expanded form. The Bill
would transfer the assets recovery 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>functions of the Assets Recovery Agency to SOCA&#151;an issue that I
shall address during the stand part debate. SOCA was created just over
a year ago, and drew together the National Crime Squad, the National
Criminal Intelligence Service, the National High Tech Crime Unit and
parts of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, as well as parts of
the immigration service. Its budget for the current financial year is
&#163;399 million of resource funding, plus &#163;43 million of
capital funding. Its status is that of an executive non-departmental
public body, sponsored by, but operationally independent of, the Home
Office.</div>
					<a name="07070549000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
understandable that the sensitive and intelligence-led nature of
SOCA&#146;s work makes it unable to provide complete information to
the public on its operations. However, that does not mean that its
effectiveness should not be subject to regular examination, scrutiny
and oversight. The Opposition believe that the amendment would provide
an important mechanism for Parliament to apply such scrutiny and would
ensure that there would be a clear, direct and annual mechanism under
which SOCA and its annual performance would be held to account,
reviewed and debated by the
House.</div>
					<a name="07070549000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">SOCA is an
essential part of the structures that exist to address the continued
threat to the country and to our constituents from serious organised
crime. The importance of its work should not be understated, but in
many ways that underlines the need for appropriate mechanisms of
scrutiny. SOCA&#146;s remit is harm reduction, which is a very broad
concept that is difficult to measure and assess. It is all the more
important, therefore, to enable Parliament to examine that role and
function and to hold SOCA to account.</div>
					<a name="07070549000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern about the checks
and balances on SOCA&#146;s operations has been brought into stark
focus by recent comments from the Court of Appeal. In the case of UMBS
Online Limited <i class="I">v. </i>Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Court of
Appeal held that SOCA had acted unlawfully in freezing payments to a
company suspected of VAT fraud. Whatever the merits of that case, the
reported comments of the Lords Justices of Appeal are potentially
disturbing. They
said:</div>
					<a name="07070549000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
feature of the way SOCA operates is that it does not condescend to
detail either in the reasoning for its decision or in disclosing the
facts upon which it relies in coming to that decision. This is not a
very satisfactory
position.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070549000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Justice
Sedley
added:</div>
					<a name="07070549000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
setting up the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the state has set out to
create an Alsatia&#151;a region of executive action free of judicial
oversight.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070549000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
seem to be quite strong words from learned judges, and they are made
even starker by the fact that Parliament itself does not have any
direct oversight over the working of SOCA either. If such serious
comments are being made about the operation of SOCA, that should give
us cause to stop and
think.</div>
					<a name="07070549000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also need to
test and question SOCA on the performance information that it does
provide. For example, questions have been raised about the robustness
of information provided by the agency on the level of its drug
seizures. Such seizures are an essential element of SOCA&#146;s role
and performance and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>the Conservatives welcomed the information about the volume of drugs
seized when it was revealed in SOCA&#146;s annual report. However,
SOCA has refused to substantiate those figures, saying that it was not
prepared to provide specific details of its ongoing work and that
previous protocols for assessing drug seizures did not apply to it
because it is a new and different organisation and that</div>
					<a name="07070549000091"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;our reporting is, in consequence,
different
too.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070549000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly,
that is not acceptable, particularly when we are considering extending
the scope, responsibility and ambit of the work undertaken by SOCA. Of
course, there may be, quite rightly, operational matters that need to
be kept secret and certain areas of SOCA&#146;s work do not need to
be put into the public domain, because of their sensitive nature and
the need to protect the public. However, I do not think that that
necessarily means that there should not be some form of direct scrutiny
of SOCA&#146;s reports and the way that it operates.</div>
					<a name="07070549000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In evidence to the Public
Accounts Committee on  7 March 2007 about the transfer of the
assets recovery functions to SOCA, Sir John Bourn, the Comptroller and
Auditor General, was asked whether SOCA would have the financial
systems in place to assess whether the costs of those functions were
greater than or less than the assets that it had recovered. Sir John
said:</div>
					<a name="07070549000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
should have a proper system of management accounts which will provide
that information and we shall see that it does
have.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070549000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister
indicate whether other measures are currently being undertaken or will
be undertaken of the other functions of SOCA, so that the reporting of
those other aspects of its work can be assessed in the same way as the
Comptroller and Auditor General proposed that its assets recovery
functions will be
assessed?</div>
					<a name="07070549000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">As SOCA has
been in operation for just over a year, it would be premature to pass
any comments on its effectiveness. There are positive indications in
terms of improved international co-operation and drug seizures. On the
downside, SOCA has prosecuted fewer cases in the UK courts than its
predecessor and missed targets on seizing criminal assets. There have
also been criticisms of its bureaucracy.</div>
					<a name="07070549000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is vital that SOCA learns
the right lessons during this early period and develops its operational
capacity to disrupt and put behind bars those involved in serious
organised crime, but in doing so it must also withstand scrutiny and
examination. We believe that the mechanism of providing for a motion to
be laid both in Parliament and in the Scottish Parliament within three
months of the laying of SOCA&#146;s annual report would be an
important means of offering that oversight. We believe that such a
mechanism would also help to strengthen the position of SOCA in its
essential fight against those who wish to harm the interests of this
country and damage the lives of our
constituents.</div>

							<a name="07070549000317"></a>Mr.
Cox:
						</b> I rise to support my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment.
We are here creating an agency with immense powers; even Government
Members must acknowledge that. Part of the debate in this Committee
over the last few days and weeks has been about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>whether or not those vast powers that are being entrusted to this agency
are right, or whether they are unprecedented and unwise. However, on
any view, the Ministers have not disguised the fact that we are talking
about large powers.</div>
					<a name="07070549000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is an astonishing thing when a High Court judge should say what was
said in the case of UMBS Online Limited <i class="I">v. </i>Serious Organised
Crime Agency, the case that my hon. Friend referred to. It means that
there is grave reservation throughout the judiciary about the levels of
accountability of SOCA. I say to the Minister that, if it is true that
the current Government are inclined to extend the functions of this
House in the monitoring and supervision of democracy in this country,
that democratic accountability ought to extend to such agencies, which
are entrusted and empowered to take away the liberties of individual
citizens, on the balance of probabilities and on affidavit evidence
without trial. The mechanism proposed by my hon. Friend is reasonable,
measured and subject to all the safeguards of this House to ensure that
only proper decisions are taken. I urge the Minister and other
Government Members to think seriously about
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000318"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank the hon. Member for Hornchurch for his
warm remarks about the creation of SOCA and the important work that it
does, notwithstanding the points about accountability that he went on
to make. It is important that we all place on the record our belief
that SOCA is a vital part of our law enforcement, which has made an
impact on the tackling of serious and organised crime. It is making a
significant difference. I appreciated the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
remarks.</div>
					<a name="07070549000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
199 would prompt debates in the UK and Scottish Parliaments on the
Serious Organised Crime Agency&#146;s annual reports. In principle, I
have no difficulty with the idea of such a debate in the UK Parliament,
and it is always open to Members of this House to initiate one. I
question whether that approach would be proportionate as a matter of
annual routine, however. The accountability that the hon. Gentleman
seeks is already secured by less heavy means. As he said, SOCA is an
Executive non-departmental public body that is funded principally by
the Home Office and is accordingly accountable to the Home Secretary in
Parliament. The mechanisms to ensure that accountability are set out in
existing legislation that was agreed only two years ago.</div>
					<a name="07070549000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parliament is already in a
position to raise questions about the work of SOCA&#151;it frequently
does so, as I know from answering them&#151;through Home Office
Ministers, whether in relation to its annual reports or not. Other
parliamentary mechanisms are available too, such as the Home Affairs
Committee, which can conduct inquiries. For the Committee&#146;s
information, I should like to point out that the chair and the director
general of SOCA met the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee last
month. They discussed the possible scrutiny by that Committee of
SOCA&#146;s work this autumn. The chair and the director general of
SOCA were keen for such an inquiry to take place and keen to give
evidence to the Committee. The current reporting arrangements for SOCA
are broadly in line with those for similar organisations. I do not
believe 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>that the imposition of additional requirements that single out the
agency for special treatment is justified.</div>
					<a name="07070549000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chairman and the director
general of SOCA are happy to appear before other parliamentary
Committees and have done so. In the early days of the agency, they had
an introductory meeting with MPs. They have offered to come to speak to
members of this Committee about SOCA&#146;s work, serious crime
prevention orders and other matters. They will do so before Report,
should hon. Members wish to attend. The Government believe that the
current arrangements for scrutinising SOCA&#146;s work are adequate.
The amendment would go beyond what is
required.</div>
					<a name="07070549000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed the second limb of the amendment with our colleagues in the
Scottish Executive. They also believe that it would impose a
requirement that goes further than necessary and further than the
equivalent arrangements for similar organisations in Scotland, such as
the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement
Agency.</div>

							<a name="07070549000319"></a>Mr.
Cox:
						</b> Does not the Minister recognise that a Lord Justice
of Appeal has said in court that the agency is an accountability-free
zone, and that there are real problems with the way in which it will be
scrutinised? The mechanisms that the Minister is talking about are not
adequate for the task of scrutiny. That is one of the reasons why the
Government are proposing new solutions to bring about the better
scrutiny of state institutions. Surely the hon. Gentleman must
recognise the pronouncements of the Court of
Appeal.</div>
					<a name="07070549000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000320"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I recognise what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I
would not wish to decry in any sense the importance of what any member
of the judiciary or others say about SOCA. The only point that I am
making is that it is open for any Member of Parliament to ask questions
about it; it is open for there to be Adjournment debates and it is open
for all sorts of parliamentary scrutiny to take place. I say to him and
the hon. Member for Hornchurch that I believe parliamentary scrutiny of
SOCA is available. It has shown itself willing to discuss matters with
parliamentary Committees and Members of Parliament and as such I see
the amendment as
unnecessary.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000321"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I am somewhat underwhelmed by the
Minister&#146;s response to the amendment. It is a serious issue in
respect of the assessment and scrutiny of SOCA, and public and more
general assurances about its work. In no way do I undermine
SOCA&#146;s willingness to discuss matters with members of the
Committee or to make itself available to any subsequent inquiry that
the Home Affairs Committee may undertake. I have no reasons to doubt
the bona fides of its officers. Indeed, a lot of them are working hard
to ensure that the best interests of the country are protected.
However, that does not mean that there should not be robust mechanisms
for
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07070549000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hear what the Minister has said about what may be available, but given
the importance of the organisation and the increase in its role as a
consequence of the Bill, it is appropriate to stop, consider and
reflect&#151;notwithstanding the fact that the House may have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>established SOCA and applied the relevant mechanisms for the provision
of reports two years ago. Given the changing role and a time of
reflection, it does not mean necessarily that we should not re-examine
matters, particularly when some surprisingly strident quotes about
judicial oversight have come from some quite senior judges.</div>
					<a name="07070549000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the time when the Prime
Minister is saying that he would like to see greater openness of
Government, we should be strengthening the role of Parliament in its
examination and scrutiny of the Government. The provision would be a
good indication of that intent and would also strengthen and improve
the operations of SOCA. I am disappointed that the Minister is not
willing to give some ground in relation to that and, on that basis, I
wish to test the Committee&#146;s opinion on the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07070549000335"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> We now move on to the broader issues arising
from the clause and what is effectively the final death-knell for the
Assets Recovery Agency. The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee
recently highlighted the weaknesses of the agency when he
said:</div>
					<a name="07070549000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To sum
up, you have spent &#163;65 million and you have recovered &#163;23
million. You have no complete record of the cases referred to you. You
have worked on over 700 cases and managed to recover assets in a mere
52, 90% of financial investigators you have trained have not completed
the courses that they need
to.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070549000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">That may be a very
harsh judgment, but the Assets Recovery Agency has not lived up to
expectations, and it has fallen short of what was required of it. That
is why, on 11 January, the Government were forced to announce the
transfer of its functions to SOCA and the National Policing Improvement
Agency, which this Bill is intended to give effect
to.</div>
					<a name="07070549000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question that
remains&#151;I think it important to discuss this in the context of
this clause&#151;is whether the successor bodies will do a better
job. We sincerely hope that they do because that is in the best
interests of this country, but it is important that the lessons of the
past are not overlooked.</div>
					<a name="07070549000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07070549000336"></a>
							<b class="B">Chris
Ruane</b> (Vale of Clwyd) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman poses the
question, &#147;Will they do a better 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>job?&#148; I can onfirm that they are already doing a better job. In
my constituency, the North Wales police, in conjunction with the
agency, took &#163;7 million from one criminal
alone.</div>
					<a name="07070549000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000337"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am obviously delighted to hear of
that particular example because it is important that we recover assets
from criminals and deprive them of their ill-gotten gains. I welcome
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention because it highlights the
importance of assets recovery work. Obviously, we are discussing the
transfer of ARA&#146;s current functions to SOCA and the National
Policing Improvement Agency. In that context, there will be a transfer
of powers, which is outlined in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07070549000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to flag up the
concerns that were expressed about the ARA in a National Audit Office
report. The report was critical notwithstanding the individual
successes that the hon. Gentleman has highlighted. The NAO pointed out
that despite the agency&#146;s best efforts to encourage bodies to
refer cases to it, four police forces and most local authorities and
trading standards offices had yet to refer a case to it.</div>
					<a name="07070549000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of criticisms were
levelled at the agency, including poor case management information,
high staff turnover and the fact that the staff did not record their
time so that the agency could not measure the resources deployed on
each case.</div>
					<a name="07070549000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that we learn from the criticisms rightly identified by the
National Audit Office and that the Minister can give us some assurance
that they have been considered and will be addressed when the successor
bodies take over the roles and functions. It is also important to know
what undertakings the NAO recommended for the future. The NAO said that
its recommendations equally applied to the successor bodies because by
the time its report came out, it was recognised that the ARA&#146;s
roles and duties were being
transferred.</div>
					<a name="07070549000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000338"></a>Chris
Ruane:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The hon. Gentleman has picked out aspects of
the NAO report that highlight the negative aspects of the agency. Were
there any positive
aspects?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000339"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> It is a fair point to make and I am very
happy to provide a copy of the NAO report. I am not seeking to portray
the report too negatively in terms of its balance. Some serious
criticisms were levied, but as I said, I am not denigrating the
individual successes achieved for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
constituents and mine. My point in terms of analysing an organisation
in its entirety is that the criticisms in the report, which are on the
public record, were made to ensure that we can improve&#151;that when
we transfer the rights, duties and responsibilities, the new agencies
will learn constructively from the criticisms. That will ensure that we
can strengthen our fight against organised criminals and disrupt their
activity by seeking to reclaim assets from
them.</div>
					<a name="07070549000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
NAO report made some specific recommendations. Can the Minister confirm
either that the Assets Recovery Agency has acted on those
recommendations or that steps are being taken to ensure that the
successor bodies to whom its responsibilities and activities will be
transferred 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>pursuant to the Bill will act on them, and that plans will be
implemented to address the structural and other issues highlighted by
the NAO to ensure that lessons are learned and previous weaknesses are
addressed?</div>
					<a name="07070549000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000340"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> I rise to support my hon. Friend&#146;s comments
and to raise another matter, which I mentioned on Second Reading in an
intervention on the Minister&#146;s colleague. Notwithstanding the
points made by the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd, it is clear that the
Assets Recovery Agency has not been as successful as we all agree it
should have been. One of the reasons is that the agency&#146;s
applications in court for recovery of funds have been delayed, causing
the precedents necessary to allow it to recover money more regularly
and swiftly not to be set on the face of the law reports.</div>
					<a name="07070549000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The delay is due at least in
part&#151;I say this with some concern, given the presence of my
right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham
and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon;
I declare an interest myself as a non-practising member of the
Bar&#151;to lawyers&#146; use of the Human Rights Act to delay the
processes so that the Assets Recovery Agency is not as efficient as it
should be.</div>
					<a name="07070549000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nothing
that I can see in the transferral of responsibilities from the Assets
Recovery Agency to SOCA will address any of those problems that seem to
be at the root of the Assets Recovery Agency&#146;s failure. I accept
that you would not wish us to stray beyond the confines of the Bill,
Mr. Benton, but can the Minister discuss any of the wider
causes for the inadequate results of the Assets Recovery Agency and
whether the Bill is likely to address
them?</div>
					<a name="07070549000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000341"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Let me say at the beginning of this clause stand
part debate that improving asset recovery through the civil
route&#151;I shall not stray, Mr. Benton, into the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the criminal route and confiscation
orders&#151;is crucial work for all of us. That so many criminals are
seen to gain from their activity, in such a way that people are amazed
that we cannot do more to take away their ill-gotten gains, is
something that unites us all.</div>
					<a name="07070549000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nothing undermines our
communities more than some young person seeing people who are obviously
living beyond their means flaunting their wealth. Whether improvements
are made through the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&#151;the criminal
route&#151;or through the civil route, we simply must do better. We
must show people that getting up in the morning, working hard at
school, getting qualifications and then going to work, with the values
that we all appreciate and want for ourselves, our communities and our
children, should be seen to be at the forefront of what we want to
achieve. I know that there is no disagreement in the Committee on that,
but it is important to assert the fact.</div>
					<a name="07070549000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000342"></a>Chris
Ruane:
						</b> I support my hon. Friend in what he says about the
impact of catching criminals and taking the money from them. The impact
in the community will be tremendous. Does he think that there would be
merit in the police being allowed to keep a larger proportion of the
money that is confiscated and ring-fencing it for anti-crime measures,
whether for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>closed circuit television, or anti-graffiti or antisocial behaviour
measures within the community itself, in order to show not only that
crime does not pay but that the community can
benefit?</div>
					<a name="07070549000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000343"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. That has little to do with clause
68.</div>
					<a name="07070549000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000344"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> It was an interesting point. As always, we
carefully consider all such matters.</div>
					<a name="07070549000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">After those introductory
remarks, Mr. Benton&#151;I appreciate your allowing me to
make them&#151;I turn to some specific points. In answer to the hon.
Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, there have been problems with the
judicial process. However, the Assets Recovery Agency has been
successful; Jane Earl and or Alan McQuillan say that their work has
changed the way in which the judicial and the legislative processes
operate. There have been problems and hold-ups, but to a certain extent
the agency has been trailblazing a route that others should be able to
follow.</div>
					<a name="07070549000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch asked about the National Audit Office report. The
director of the Assets Recovery Agency is actively addressing the
management issues identified in that report&#151;the hon. Gentleman
wanted reassurance on that point&#151;and he agrees that UK-wide
management was needed. A new system is already in place for case
management, but he recognises that it needs to be improved. The agency
is also developing a formal management review of cases that will
include a timetable for each stage; it will also hold people to
account. That answer may deal also with the point raised by the hon.
Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. Management systems will be tightened
up.</div>
					<a name="07070549000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the
Member for Vale of Clwyd made an important point when he intervened on
the hon. Member for Hornchurch. He asked whether positives were to be
found in the NAO report as well as negatives. I accept that there are
negatives, but the Assets Recovery Agency is dealing with them. My hon.
Friend will be interested to hear that the NAO report highlighted a
number of positives. The agency has established important case law in
respect of human rights. Again, that goes to the heart of the question
put by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth; the agency has
trailblazed a route through the problems, and we hope that others can
follow.</div>
					<a name="07070549000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The agency
has been successful in freezing assets and issuing tax assessments. As
for enforcement, more than 90 per cent. of awards have been
successfully recovered. The agency is also delivering training courses
and has received positive feedback from those who have attended. As
well as having had difficulties, the Assets Recovery Agency has had
some positive results. My hon. Friend made an excellent point when
asking  about that.</div>
					<a name="07070549000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Asset recovery is a vital
weapon in tackling serious and organised crime, as such crime is driven
by profit. Removing the profit is an effective lever in making
communities safer. The Assets Recovery Agency is successfully taking
forward the new civil recovery powers under the Proceeds of Crime Act
2002, and although it has taken a long time, it has seen off every
legal challenge. That is a major success, which demonstrates the robust
nature of the legislation. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div>agency has also succeeded in disrupting criminal activity through the
freezing of assets, with some notable successes in the recovery of
assets.</div>
					<a name="07070549000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">After a slow
start in the first years, the agency&#146;s performance in recovering
assets has improved significantly, with &#163;15.9 million recovered
in the last financial year. We want to build on that success. The
agency is a relatively small organisation and was, as hon. Members may
remember, set up before the Serious Organised Crime Agency came into
existence. Now that SOCA is up and running, it makes sense to bring the
key skills, expertise and resources of both bodies together in a larger
organisation. It is important to note that many of the Assets Recovery
Agency&#146;s clients have made their money from serious organised
crime, so bringing the agency&#146;s main business together with SOCA
will enable those engaged in civil recovery to benefit from the work
that SOCA is doing to develop a greater understanding of how serious
crime operates.</div>
					<a name="07070549000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are close links between the core business of the Assets Recovery Agency
and that of the Serious Organised Crime Agency and operational
advantages in bringing them together. The clause and schedule 8
transfer the Assets Recovery Agency&#146;s civil recovery functions
to SOCA. However, the civil recovery powers will not be transferred to
SOCA alone. The Government want to maximise the use of these powers and
believe that there are merits in sharing them across a number of
bodies.</div>
					<a name="07070549000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prosecuting
bodies have now acquired valuable skills and experience in assets
recovery. Where prosecutors have decided that a case does not pass
their tests for prosecution and therefore it is not possible to obtain
a confiscation order, it may be more efficient for them to pursue civil
recovery action than pass the work to SOCA. The clause provides for
both SOCA and the main prosecuting bodies to have civil recovery
powers.</div>
					<a name="07070549000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nothing in the
new proposals will detract from our efforts in tackling organised crime
in England and Wales and Northern Ireland through the recovery of
assets. The proposals will improve and enhance our efforts. In
recognition of the high profile, public confidence and success achieved
by the Assets Recovery Agency in Northern Ireland in tackling organised
crime and dealing with organised criminals, SOCA will have a designated
officer responsible for assets recovery work in Northern Ireland. I
should like to say again, to reassure people in Northern Ireland, there
will be no diminution in the resources available for assets recovery
work there.</div>
					<a name="07070549000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
National Policing Improvement Agency is a new body that will support
police forces in improving the way they work across many areas of
policing. The Assets Recovery Agency, SOCA and the Association of Chief
Police Officers agree that the current training and accreditation
function should move to the NPIA and the clause transfers that function
to it. Although it is a police body, that agency&#146;s commitment to
financial investigation will include training and accreditation for
non-police staff and for financial investigators outside England and
Wales.</div>
					<a name="07070549000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Assets
Recovery Agency has many skilled and experienced staff who will
continue to make a valuable contribution in their new organisation. The
clause and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>schedule 9 also provide for the staff of the agency to transfer to SOCA
or to the National Policing Improvement Agency as
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07070549000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I should like to put on the record once again my
appreciation of the work that Jane Earl did in establishing the Assets
Recovery Agency, for the work that Alan McQuillan has done in taking
over her efforts in the agency and to all the people in the Assets
Recovery Agency who have worked so hard in this new area of business,
which will help all of us ensure that those who try to profit from
crime will not do
so.</div>

							<a name="07070549000347"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Before I speak to the amendments, may I thank the
Public Bill Office for its assistance in drafting them? This is the
last group of amendments on which I shall have a substantial voice. The
staff of the office drafted a great many amendments, and the fact that
they have appeared on the amendment paper in order and relatively
comprehensible is to their credit, and I am grateful for
that.</div>
					<a name="07070549000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
have three purposes. First, amendment No. 168 would delete the
provision that enables the Secretary of State to</div>
					<a name="07070549000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;repeal Part 6 of the Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070549000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">and to
make a consequential change to the statues. Secondly, amendments Nos.
164 and 166 would remove the general power to repeal and amend
legislation outside the Bill. Thirdly and lastly, the amendments would
incorporate the concept of the super-affirmative resolution wherever
the affirmative procedure is being adopted.</div>
					<a name="07070549000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 168 is narrow in
compass. I am against Secretaries of State taking to themselves powers
by affirmative resolution to amend the language of or to repeal parts
of other statutes. That should be done by primary legislation, in the
passage of which one would have the opportunity to examine in much
greater detail the proposals than is possible under the affirmative
procedure.</div>
					<a name="07070549000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
second purpose, the more general point is that in the Bill, and in
clause 79 in particular, the Government are taking a much more general
power to repeal legislation by affirmative resolution. I find that
difficult to justify, because affirmative resolutions are not
amendable. Affirmative resolutions are presented to the House, which
must accept them either wholly or not at all following a short debate
lasting&#151;normally&#151;an hour and a half. In principle, that
does not seem to be a good way of handling legislation. Indeed, the
House recognised that by passing the Legislative and Regulatory Reform
Act 2006 and the super-affirmative procedure measures.</div>
					<a name="07070549000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Super-affirmative procedure
broadly means that the House has the opportunity to debate an early
draft of resolutions before they are laid before it. That way, Members
can express a view on the draft before the resolution is made. That
enables them to say whether they approve of the draft before it is
laid, and it gives the Government the ability to modify the draft to
reflect criticism. That is an improvement on the normal affirmative
procedure.</div>
					<a name="07070549000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">My view has
always been that we ought to have a mechanism for amending affirmative
resolutions when they are brought before the House, so that we are not
driven either to accepting or rejecting a law, but that is not the
procedure at the moment. The amendments would incorporate the concept
that we should always use the super-affirmative procedure for the
affirmative resolutions that will be brought about by the Bill. That is
probably the best of the available
options.</div>
					<a name="07070549000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that other hon. Members will say more on the matter, but to summarise,
I very much dislike the ministerial habit of taking powers unto
themselves. That also applies to Conservative Ministers in
Administrations of which I was a member; no doubt I did it
myself&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> The Minister is
smirking. Of course, I fear that he has a list of the affirmative 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>resolutions that I brought to the House in a
previous incarnation. In fact, I am against the habit. I become more
libertarian and liberal as I get older, although I am not a member of
the Liberal Democrats who, by the way, have no presence in the room at
the moment.</div>
					<a name="07070549000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
be slow to give Ministers the ability to change other legislation with
powers conferred in the Bill. If we are going to give such powers, it
must be done by affirmative resolution, but that itself is pretty
narrow, therefore given where we are the super-affirmative procedure is
the best we can do. Those are my reasons for tabling the
amendments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000348"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I rise briefly to speak to the amendments
tabled by my right hon. and learned Friend who, in his customary way,
set out the legal basis to justify and underpin his proposals in a
clear, concise and effective manner.</div>
					<a name="07070549000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an ongoing general
debate about the role of Parliament and the way in which the Executive
seek to take additional powers to themselves by making an order, and
the clause is another example of how further powers are being taken
away from Parliament. The Prime Minister has indicated that he wants to
strengthen the role of Parliament, and in that spirit we hope that that
historical approach may be changed, although I have doubts about
whether that will actually happen. The points that my right hon. and
learned Friend made are effective and I will listen with great interest
to how the Minister responds to
them.</div>
					<a name="07070549000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070549000349"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Given the charming way in which the right hon. and
learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham spoke to the amendment, I
am loath to speak against it, but that is what I am going to do. He was
honest enough to say that if he were in my position, he would propose
similar order-making
powers.</div>
					<a name="07070549000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer
members of the Committee to the House of Lords Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee, which considers the use of order-making
powers. We changed one or two of the powers in parts of the Bill to
take account of the points made by that Committee in its report, so
that the order-making powers in the Bill are now consistent with the
views expressed in that
report.</div>
					<a name="07070549000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
164 seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State cannot by order amend
or repeal any provision of another Act, and amendment No. 162 would
have the same effect. The Secretary of State will need to be able to
make such amendments in order to make the Bill work effectively.
Amendment No. 166 is consequential to amendments Nos. 162 and 164,
because if the Secretary of State&#146;s power to amend or repeal
other enactments is removed, clause 79(4) and (5) are no longer
necessary. However, I urge the Committee to reject the amendments as
those subsections are not there for any reason other than to make this
legislation work in
practice.</div>
					<a name="07070549000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 163 would mean that the order-making powers listed in clause 79(3)
were subject to the super-affirmative procedure. I must resist that
amendment. We set the parliamentary procedure in relation to the
order-making powers at what we believe to be the appropriate level. As
I said, in its report, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee agreed that the levels set were appropriate.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>
					<a name="07070549000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 165 and 168 relate to the Assets Recovery Agency and its merger
with the Serious Organised Crime Agency. This includes the ability to
raise a tax assessment against the suspected proceeds of crime. As part
of the transferral of that function, the Bill provides for the ability
to repeal that Revenue function so that SOCA will no longer have it as
a function. That is because the use of tax powers against the proceeds
of crime is subject to a review involving SOCA, Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs and the Home Office. The review may conclude that
the ability to raise tax assessment against unsourced but suspected
criminal proceeds is best performed by HMRC and not SOCA. The function
would therefore need to be removed from SOCA and given to HMRC.
Alternatively it may conclude that the provisions are not required, as
others are sufficient to recover the proceeds of crime. Again, that
would require the repeal of the SOCA function.</div>
					<a name="07070549000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have explained
the basis of the provision. I invite the right hon. and learned Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

guilty of hypocrisy in this matter, in that I am sure that in the past
I have moved order-making powers, and probably frequently too.
Nevertheless, I do not like them, and I do not suppose I shall ever
like them. I certainly do not like them now. If we are going to have
them, we have to decide how best to protect the liberty of the subject
and enhance parliamentary control. Given where we are, I think that the
super-affirmative procedure is probably a good thing in most cases. I
shall therefore move amendment No. 163 when I can, in order to assert
that proposition. That being so, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
