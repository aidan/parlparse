<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We are embarking on chapter II, which deals with a new stealth tax. [Laughter.] It gives me no pleasure to excite laughter from those on the Government Benches. They laugh while other people pay. This morning, I took a stealth tax bill to No. 10 Downing street for £30,000—£2,500 per space outside numbers 10,11 and 12 Downing street—to present to the Prime Minister. He, of course, will not have to pay it; businesses in London will, if either of the two Labour candidates chooses to impose it. [Interruption.] If the Minister would like to intervene and tell me that the so-called Labour candidate has attacked yet another of the Government's policies, I shall be delighted to give way. Labour's mayoral candidate for London has undermined the Government again by expressing his opposition to congestion and car parking taxes because he knows that he does not have a cat in hell's chance of getting many votes unless he opposes them.
<P>
We are faced with yet another imposition on the motorist, but in this case it will be indirect. The British Chambers of Commerce have calculated that if 25 per cent. of local councils impose the workplace parking levy on business, it would amount to a £2 billion stealth tax throughout the country. That is the order of magnitude of the tax proposed in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): The figure of £2 billion that the hon. Gentleman quotes is in marked contrast to the £20 billion that the CBI claims that congestion on our roads is costing. A cost of £2 billion to save £20 billion seems a good deal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is typical of Liberal Democrat sleight of hand. Can the hon. Gentleman explain how £2 billion of parking taxes will cure £20 billion of congestion? I am hearing nothing but muttering and silence from the hon. Gentleman. There is virtually no connection between the two. All the academic research has shown that the parking tax would have no effect on congestion. The hon. Gentleman is getting excited.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am not at all excited. As soon as he started his speech I nearly ambled off for a cup of coffee because it was so predictable. He fails to point out that a number of businesses that have looked at the proposals for both congestion and workplace charging have concluded that if they are properly and sensitively introduced to match local transport plans, they could be of benefit. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be happy to acknowledge that that is the case? If he does not, I will give him some examples.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I certainly acknowledge that transport requires investment. The Government are not delivering investment to public transport. They are allowing local authorities to borrow more, but they have allocated the lowest central Government grant ever to local transport plans. That is a stain on the Government's record that they will live to regret.
<P>
The notion that the only solution to the transport problems facing local transport authorities is more taxes, when the Government are already raising £34 billion in taxation from the motorist and are investing less than a fifth of that in transport, seems to be putting the cart before the horse. Any reputable business organisation will express opposition to these taxes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman looked over at my paperwork. Will he claim that BÿQ is not a reputable business and put that on the record?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> BÿQ managed to negotiate via Wal-„Mart a private side view with the Prime Minister that retailing is not included in the workplace parking charge. It is called a workplace parking levy because it does not include retailing. Out-„of-town retailers, such as BÿQ, may be happy to advocate a tax that other people will pay to benefit from it. The Engineers Employers Federation, the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce represent people who own factories, make things, employ shift workers and have large car parks for their employees. If any hon. Gentleman goes to see a manufacturing business in his constituency—
<P>
<B>Ms Claire Ward </B>(Watford): Any hon. Gentleman?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I apologise profusely to the hon. Lady. If Labour Members visit manufacturing businesses in their constituencies and tell them that they will be paying the workplace parking levy, should the council choose to impose it, they will get pretty short shrift for the policy for which they are about to vote. Employers will tell them that they already pay tax on their car parking spaces: it is called business rates. The car park is assessed as part of the valuation for business rate purposes and employers are already paying excessively for car parking spaces. The workplace parking levy means, in principle, double taxation on those spaces. What is presented in this Bill is a mere concept. There is no detail of how it will work. As usual, one of the most unpopular decisions that the Government are proposing will not be made by the Government. Blairism and the third way make other people take the unpopular decisions. Local councils will be forced to take them. Local government will take the blame for the extra taxes when they are imposed and will have to work out the detail of the schemes, which the Government have failed to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Is the hon. Gentleman saying that in an ideal world central Government would work out and impose every local scheme or does he agree that it would be better for local councils, communities and businesses to work out what is right for them, whether they go ahead or not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In an ideal world, there would be a Conservative Government that would not impose these taxes. It is as simple as that. In an ideal world, a business would pay less tax. There would be a guarantee of a steady reduction in the proportion of national income taken in tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Was it an ideal world when the previous Government introduced the poll tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> When we introduced the community charge, we also abolished domestic rates. It was not a new, but a substitute tax. The hon. Gentleman disagreed with the replacement tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): Did the hon. Gentleman disagree with it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No, I supported it. Many single householders and pensioners in my constituency still regret its abolition. The Conservative Government replaced it with an even better tax, the council tax. It was such a good tax that the governing party decided to keep it. It was not a new source of revenue, but an alternative method of collecting the same revenue. Congestion and workplace parking charges are a new tax, to be introduced by a Government who, before the general election, promised no new taxes. I am choosing my words carefully, because they were used by the Prime Minister. As we learnt from ``Panorama'' last night, the Prime Minister has a way with figures that I do not envy.
<P>
As well as being lobbied extensively by business organisations, I have been lobbied by individual businesses. They have highlighted the problems that the Government will have as they leave it to local authorities to work out the details of the tax. Businesses in my constituency have made it clear that they will not pay the tax. They will not go on a tax strike, as did many former members of the hard left who now sit as Labour Members. They will pay the tax, but they intend to pass on the charge to their employees. Their cry is, ``I'm not going to pay it; I'll make my employees pay it.''
<P>
They need to be told, first, that VAT has to be added to this so-called levy, and that it will have to be passed on to employees. In that respect, this indirect tax on motoring becomes a direct tax. Either way, it is an addition to the cost of employing people who are unable to get to work other than by car.
<P>
In the lexicon of socialist political correctness that informs the Government's anti-car policies, the intention is to make car transport more expensive and to encourage people to use other forms of transport. There is a flaw in that argument. First, it assumes that other forms of transport are available for people to use. Secondly, it exposes the reality that the Government will choose how people travel to work rather than people making their own decisions. The research shows that the new tax will have little effect on how people travel to work, because they do so in the best way they can, especially if they are travelling to work at times when public transport is not available.
<P>
Businesses in my constituency have complained. I have visited other businesses, including a football stadium in Birmingham. I told them that their 800 car park spaces would be liable to the car parking tax. They will be paying £250 a year on those 800 spaces; they could buy a striker every year for that money.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Only at Walsall!
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a limit to how partisan I am prepared to allow any member of the Committee to become.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I support Colchester United. I support the ``Us'' and certainly that would be a large sum of money for them, were it not for the fact that all their parking is on the street. Perhaps that is the purpose of this tax—that it should encourage football clubs not to have their own car parks but that their clients should park on the street. If they closed their car parks, grassed them over and made them into practice pitches, perhaps that would be a way of avoiding the tax. Decommissioning car parking spaces is one way of avoiding the tax and perhaps that is what is intended. When people realise that the car parking tax is actually a football tax—
<P>
<H5>10.45 a.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> More!
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I do not understand what is so funny. Members should visit their local football clubs. Even the little amateur football club in Wivenhoe in my constituency has a car park. Even it will have to pay the car parking tax were the local authority foolish enough to impose it. I presume the hon. Gentleman is going to tell me that football clubs are exempt?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I thought I would put the hon. Member out of his agony because obviously he has not read the Bill. People attending football clubs to watch football matches will not be liable and there will be no liability on the club to pay for those people attending for that purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I was beginning to wonder—because as soon as an unpopular tax is created, all sorts of exclusions to it have to be created.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member is clearly in some difficulty. I appreciate that he has had other things on his mind recently, but if he looks at the wording of the Bill, he will not see a reference to exemptions: he will see language that refers to ``workplace''. He made the point in his own speech and he seems to have forgotten the logic of it. Workplace means workplace, not people attending a football match or other entertainment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We have scored one victory there.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. There is astonishing levity. The Central Council of Physical Recreation, which I imagine to be a body that the Government respect and which is partially funded by the Government, has been in detailed discussions with the DETR about this very matter. It points out that clause 158(1)(d) could include any club that is a limited company and any club that allows junior sections for schools, indoor sporting activities, or scouts or guides for example, to use the facilities to play football. Scouts and guides play football on Saturday morning, as do the very excellent Chippenham Town football club in my constituency. They might well be included under the tax, so the levity is perhaps a little forced. The Central Council of Physical Recreation believes that they will be included. Let the Government deny that if they will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am happy to take the Minister at his word. He says that football clubs are exempt and will not have to pay this tax. Is the hon. Gentleman scared to correct me on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I said in my previous interjection that there was no question of exemptions. It was the definition of ``the workplace''. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) would have seen if he had read a little bit further in clause 158(1), that those categories are liable only if they are attending a place at which the relevant person carries on business. That is the point. It is a workplace charge. It does not relate to people attending premises to play or to watch football.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister is now halfway. If there are parking places for the people who work at the club and that would include the players, the manager and the staff—what about season ticket holders? Are they included? I am just interested. That is why we have these debates, to find out what the Government intend to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I can tell the many supporters of Stockport County that they will not have to pay the tax, which he would have realised had he read the Bill. However, reverting to his visit to Birmingham, I understand he went to Aston Villa, where the players could well afford to pay the tax if anybody could.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I see. It is now a tax. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has referred to it as such. If he is talking about who can or cannot afford to pay, why does he not speak for those who work in the engineering industry in his constituency instead of trying to score political points? They cannot afford to pay, but they will have to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I should like to revert to the Minister's reply to the arguments of my hon. Friend, the Member for North Wiltshire on physical recreation. Volunteers helping out on Saturday mornings could also be swept into the net.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister tell us that the wording in the Bill is intended to exclude parking at charity workplaces where, the workers might be voluntary, because many industries will be seriously affected?
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> None that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has worked in the motor industry. I have. It is difficult to run a factory making cars without plenty of parking spaces. If the workplace parking charge is introduced in the west midlands, as the Labour authorities plan, the motor industry reckons that the additional cost to it will be hundreds of millions of pounds a year. The idea that it will benefit from that is crazy. On one hand: the Government are fighting the Brussels Commission to be allowed to hand out a subsidy to enable a German car manufacturer to carry on investing in Britain. At the same time, they have introduced a Bill that contains proposals that will skin the motor industry of hundreds of millions of pounds every year, not to invest in the industry or even to give back to the European Commission, but to put in their own pockets.
<P>
This is an extra stealth tax that will damage the competitiveness of British industry. Who will benefit? If a workplace parking tax is imposed throughout a local authority area some people who never use public transport will pay the tax and some who use public transport will never pay it. That is not a sensible economic market solution to public transport problems. The purchasing power will rest with the local authorities that raise the tax, not with the passengers who stand to benefit from better transport.
<P>
Other sectors will also be badly affected. An example is the automotive supply chain. There are 7,000 car dealers, each with a large number of parking spaces. Why should parking at out-of-town shopping centres be exempt for retailers, but be taxed for the automotive supply chain?
<P>
Finally, I want to consider some of the serious logistical difficulties of applying the tax. Some manufacturing businesses cannot survive without shift workers. At any one time they have a number of people working on the premises and parking there, but they need twice that number of spaces to accommodate workers' cars during shift changeover periods. They need car parking for those already at the plant and more for those who are taking over at the end of the shift. What arrangements will be made for shift workers?
<P>
Sugar beet is a big industry in East Anglia requiring seasonal employment. Why should the car parking spaces there be charged at the full annual rate when they will be occupied for only part of the year?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I see nods of agreement from the Minister. We are beginning to see that this will be a complex tax and an expensive one to collect. Every employer will have to be assessed individually, not simply for the number of workplace spaces, but the proportion that will be used by employees and the type of employees that will be occupying them—whether they are shift or seasonal workers, in the case of shift worker, whether they are on a two or three shift system and in that of seasonal workers, whether they work for a quarter, half or three-quarters of the year. The easy money on which the Government thought that they would be able to lay their hands when they first proposed the tax is beginning to look problematic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned car dealers. Is that the reason why Jeffrey Archer and Stephen Norris oppose the tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is irrelevant. I used car dealers as an illustration of the many sectors affected. As I have already mentioned, charities are another. Many of my colleagues work with charities, but the hon. Gentleman has not accused me of advancing their interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): How about taking the newspaper industry as another example? News International, the publisher of The Sun, has an enormous number of car parks for employees because they work through the night when no public transport is available. They will have to pay the tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This is all about cornering a captive market where people have no alternative because it is primarily intended as a revenue-raising measure. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) referred to the benefits of the scheme: they are all for those who collect the tax, not for those who have to pay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman like to intervene on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No. I will make my own speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> In the case of charities in areas where congestion taxes are being administered, the local boroughs are at liberty to increase the voluntary grants that they provide. Therefore, if the charities say that one of the by-products of the charging is a marginal increase in their costs, they could compensate for that. Would the hon. Gentleman agree, more generally, that there is a clear relationship between the costs and provision of car parking and the amount of transport? That is why Hammersmith and Fulham has in recent years reduced the number of parking spaces available to commuters by about 30,000. That has had an impact on congestion.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That was an interesting intervention. First, the hon. Gentleman inadvertently referred to congestion charges when he meant ``car parking taxes''. Secondly, he was advocating that it should be Government policy to ensure that charities do not lose out from the tax. That will be an admirable amendment for him to table at a later stage in our discussions or on Report. It will be interesting to hear what Ministers have to say about it because there is no provision in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The point is that it is for local government to decide the economic and environmental impact of charges on congestion or workplace parking. In doing so, they may choose to change the amount of money that they give to local charities. It is not for central Government to make these decisions as the hon. Gentleman seems to imply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In the case of business rates, does the hon. Gentleman advocate that we abolish the automatic exemption of charities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No, of course not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That decision was taken at central Government level. Presumably, he does not support that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are having a debate, not a two-way conversation. We must adhere to the rules of debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The simple point is that if a local authority imposes charges in its area, it is at liberty to give some of the money back to the charities. The decision is not at the disposal of national Government if there is a variation in the impact of the charges.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have lost the thread of the hon. Gentleman's argument—so has the rest of the Committee. This is a tax on charities. I think that the hon. Gentleman is saying that councils could volunteer to pay it back to charities. I do not see in the Bill the exemption for charities that we gave them when we introduced the uniform business rate. I thought that that was the sort of amendment that he was talking about. If so, I would have supported him, but clearly he does not support charities to that extent.
<P>
The final representation that I wish to discuss is from one of the models of a modern employer as regards transport, namely, Boots. Its large site in Nottinghamshire presents a number of conundrums for local authorities operating the tax. Nottingham city council is considering a levy of £150 per vehicle, which would equate to £1 million in extra stealth taxes for Boots. The company has a 280-acre site at the end of a transport corridor, with no alternative forms of transport readily available. It employs 7,500 people and already spends £350,000 of the shareholders' money every year on its green transport plan. The Minister says that it is very good. His party is about to impose nearly three times that amount in tax on Boots for its care.
<P>
Boots says that for the tax to act as a disincentive on car usage, it should be passed on to the individual user. Penalising lower paid shift workers and creating problems in the allocation of charges will be the inevitable result of imposing the tax on Boots. It argues that the tax should be on individuals, but whether that would achieve the Government's objectives I do not know.
<P>
Boots says that the charges should not apply to the whole local authority area, but to the city centre. I accept that there would be a logic, in the Government's terms, in charging only the most congested area. Putting the charges on an outlying manufacturing site underlines that the Bill presents a tax-raising opportunity for the Government and has nothing to do with their so-called integrated transport policy.
<P>
The company argues that alternatives should be put in place before the tax is applied. I find myself echoing the now defunct Labour candidate standing in the London mayoral elections, who is trailing badly—[Hon Members: ``Dobson''].
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): Which Frank Dobson?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I mean the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson). Boots says that companies that have their own commuter plans should not be penalised and that workplace parking should apply only to the number of parking spaces provided above the theoretical number that would be granted today if the business were applying for planning permission on existing sites; they should not be penalised for the number of parking spaces that are in existence. As I said earlier, business rate calculations will reflect a parking charge of approximately £100 per place.
<P>
Boots is asking for key issues to be clarified. Which vehicles should be exempt? Will delivery vehicles be exempt, or is the tax another burden on the distribution chain in addition to the very high taxes on road haulage? Boots has 1,000 lorry movements daily. Would bus parking spaces be exempt? A bus arriving and leaving Boots is clearly doing business. That falls into the definition in clause 158 that the Minister cited, that a bus delivering employees to Boots would seem to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Attending a place at which the relevant person carries on business at or in the vicinity of the premises.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Would the hon. Gentleman clarify that? That is what Boots wants to know.
<P>
The Bill does not make it clear whether, if an employer is incurring an extra cost for the provision of a car parking space, that constitutes a benefit in kind for the employee. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that. As drafted, the charge would attract VAT, as the Minister confirmed in his letter to the Committee.
<P>
One of the most interesting conundrums for Boots of Nottingham is that part of its site is not in the Nottingham local transport plan area. Part of the site will be exempt from car parking charges, but another part will be liable for them. How is an employer meant to deal with that? If he puts all his car parking spaces over the border to avoid the tax, would that constitute a legal method of avoiding it? When arbitrary local boundaries have long since been made irrelevant by a development such as Boots, it seems unreasonable for the tax to be applied.
<P>
We are wholly opposed to the tax. It is a monstrous imposition on British business. Not a single reputable business organisation supports the principle of the car parking tax. The Government have been involved in a mesh of side deals to try to buy off various interests to enable them to introduce the tax. The Government already raise enough in transport taxation. In the current financial year they have raised £1 billion more in road fuel duties than they forecast in the last Budget. Far be it from me to say that the Government are rolling in money, but they have so much extra in stealth taxes that they should be. We do not know where all the money has gone. They seem to be spending it on anything but transport.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman—in my view, entirely fairly-—is taking advantage of the facility that I have offered the Committee, when we enter a new chapter, to have a fairly broad-ranging debate. It is a precedent that I have established. I live with the consequences of it and am perfectly happy with that. I would, however, point out to the hon. Gentleman before he sits down that we are speaking to amendments and I should not wish to establish a precedent whereby we have a general debate and then forget to speak to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for that reminder, Mr. Gale. Having concluded my introduction, I shall move immediately to amendment No. 782, which adds two new subsections. This group of amendments was suggested by one of the more reputable employer's organisations, which believes that the licensing approach should be set out more clearly in the Bill and that it should set out an alternative and more flexible approach that gives more scope for placing the liability for these levies more directly on the users of the places rather than on the businesses. If this were an honest tax and Government were honest, they would admit that the only taxes are those on people. In the end, people pay the consequences of the Government's stealth taxes, however they hide them. Business customers and business employers will ultimately pay the price for these stealth taxes and our amendments are intended to clarify that.
<P>
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Robert Syms) will speak further to these amendments. I have left the Minister more than enough to chew on and he is beginning to realise that, with this tax, he has bitten off more than he can chew.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we continue, as I have said, I have established the precedent that it is helpful for the Committee to allow a reasonably wide-ranging debate at the start of a chapter. I stand by that decision and in the course of the proceedings of this Committee that approach has been proven, both in allowing Opposition Members to make a case on broad terms and also in allowing Ministers to clarify the Government's intentions. It is a principle that I propose to adhere to, certainly as far as this Committee is concerned. However, I must remind the Committee that that licence will be reflected, as always, in my attitude to later debates on other amendments and clause stand part debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I remind the Committee of my interest in the Register of Members' Interests. I have an interest in a factory that has some workplace parking and may well be affected at some point by the provisions within this Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend's very reasonable declaration of interest failed to mention that the business that he describes is on the outskirts of Chippenham in my constituency. Would he rest assured that I will do all I can with the dreadful North Wiltshire district council to ensure that such charges are not imposed on his business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank my hon. Friend and, providing that this is not special pleading, I am quite happy. I am sure that he will do all he can to protect his constituents from the worst ravages of this tax. The workplace parking levy is one of the most controversial parts of this Bill and has caused a great deal of upset in the business community, which will have to pay it. I want to probe one or two things and take advantage of your ruling, Mr. Gale, in being a little more general than specific to the amendment, although I may well come back to that.
<P>
On page 25 of the notes on clauses, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Local authorities will be obliged to issue the licence for the number of units requested—they will not be able to use this mechanism as a means of directly controlling the number of parking places provided.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I presume, therefore, that if a company applies for 100, 200, 500, 700, or whatever, that is not a material fact. It is purely applying for a licence for that number of places. Within the consultation document, and in ``Breaking the Logjam'', it became clear there was also popular support for having a disregard for perhaps one or two or three spaces. I think that five spaces was suggested. I would be interested to hear from the Minister as to what number of parking places should be the minimum before a charging scheme kicks in.
<P>
When it comes to a charging scheme, what flexibility will an authority have in terms of the charging formula? Will it have to set one charge per parking space but the same level of charge in a particular area of a town? It may designate three streets or a particular industrial estate where the charge is ``X'' or can it vary per business or per number of parking spaces? Whatever one thinks about this tax, a business might have 200 parking spaces. It might feel that it needs 200 and, having put in for that number, it would not want to find that it is paying a higher rate because the authority says that it will charge only so much for the first 25, with steep increases above that. People would then find themselves penalised for having that number of parking spaces because the authority's policy may be to diminish parking. That business may well find that it has a problem because it needs that number of parking spaces to undertake its activities.
<P>
No doubt the Minister will give us an overview of how he feels that his part of the Bill will operate, but will he tell us how much control the local authority will have? Is their duty as a licensing authority purely to set a rate per unit? That rate will not vary depending on the number of units. If they have the power to vary it, this would cause concerns for many employers.
<P>
This provision is going to cost a lot of money. The report of the Review of Changing Options for London suggested around £3,000 per parking space in central London as an illustrative figure. We have heard figures even in retail areas of perhaps £100 or £200, which adds up to a fair amount. Bearing in mind that collection will be by the owner of a property—the person who is paying the UBR—this is going to add considerably to business costs.
<P>
<H5>11.15 a.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
I thank the Minister for his letter setting out how he sees the provision operating. It is clear from the letter that an employer may decide to pay the workplace parking levy. However, should the employer decide to recoup it from employees, that would be VAT-able. I welcome the fact that in the letter the Minister says that he understands from the Inland Revenue that it does not expect any change in the income tax treatment as a result of the introduction of the workplace parking levy. He will understand that there has been concern in the business community and not merely because of the perceived double whammy. If employers get the tax back from their employees, they will have to charge them VAT. Since most employees are not registered for VAT, unless they are self-employed, they would have to pay. There might be a triple whammy in the sense of a benefit in kind.
<P>
All of us who have been in business in Britain understand that the Inland move swiftly to reduce any benefits. This sort of benefit—travel and parking—is an area into which the Inland Revenue has looked. Where an employer pays the charge for employees, that should not be perceived as some sort of benefit.
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry points out in the letters and briefings that it has given the Committee that it does not believe that the workplace parking levy will improve congestion because once a business has its units licensed and it is paying a rate per unit, there is no incentive for not using the units. On the contrary, there is an incentive to use the parking places because they have been paid for. Apart from a means of collecting resources and money, therefore, unless some of that money is used in other ways, the workplace parking levy in itself will not help much to relieve congestion in a particular area.
<P>
Returning to an employer dealing with a local transport authority, since the latter will request a number of places, I presume that that does not preclude an employer also taking out parking places. An employer may have 50 spaces and may decide to license only 20, thereby taking out 20 or 30. There is some scope for argument here. If white lines are burned out in a car park or an area is fenced to make it unavailable for parking, how the car parks are policed may be relevant.
<P>
Employers who are trying to police their car parking, will have a problem. As someone who has run a business, I know that people pop in and out of car parks and one does not always know which business they are visiting—or even if they have parked in the wrong space. There will need to be some policing of parking arrangements for a business, particularly if parking spaces are at a premium and an employer has paid for them. For substantial businesses this could be an added cost. The Bill proposes a fine of 50 per cent. of the annual levy. There may be spot checks and a multiplication of the number of parking spaces that had not been licensed. Therefore there may well be concerns about fines being levied on businesses, particularly since the levy or fine, because of an oversight, might well lead to that business having further visits by local authority inspectors, which could well put an added burden on that business.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that a fine of 50 per cent. of the annual levy is a strong incentive to the employer to register as few places as he can so that the annual levy is as small as possible? If he is then fined a half of it, it will cost him a great deal less than it would have done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> My hon. Friend would have been a great success in business. A point raised in briefings was what happens in a business where there is a temporary increase in the number of people working on a particular site. If a building contractor works at premises for three or four months to extend a factory, there will be an increased number of vehicles parking at the site, over and above the units already licensed. There has been some suggestion in the various documents about a provision for a temporary licence. Clearly, on occasions people for whom parking will need to be provided will arrive on site. Such provision may not have been made in the licensing conditions. Should there be some degree of latitude? Sometimes people have good reasons to be on a site. There are some businesses, for example, that have teams of engineers who go out around Britain or around the world installing machinery. For 99 per cent. of the time, they will not be on the premises but there may be times when they have to come back to get something ready and there may be an upsurge in the need for parking spaces.
<P>
The flow of people parking on an annual basis may not equal the number of parking spaces. Therefore, there will be occasions when the need for parking goes up or when there will be empty spaces. How these flows are managed will be important for business. The notes on clauses set out who would have to pay and they seem to have a particular prejudice against photocopier engineers who are used as an example of people who visit businesses. They would not be exempt and would have to pay. There is nothing more annoying, than when the photocopier breaks down. It is only then that its importance is realised. One is always keen for the engineer to finish the repair as quickly as possible. In the course of a year, a photocopier engineer may spend only a few hours in a parking space. Therefore it is, important to define who visits premises and who should pay the levy. The definition in the Bill is widely drawn. No doubt the Minister will say that regulation could tighten this up.
<P>
I was pleased to see that motorcycles would generally be exempt, but I wondered whether that provision could be tightened up a little to say that they would always be exempt. Motorcycles are a means of ensuring that traffic flows more freely.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire mentioned charities. We must not forget that some people work for charities for no money. They do so because they believe that that charity is a good thing. To impose costs on such people would cause great difficulty.
<P>
There have been other concerns. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders made it clear that there are thousands of parking spaces, not only in car companies but also their supply companies. We live in that slightly peculiar world where on the one hand Government are being implored by west midlands Members and others to support local car companies for the good reason that they are valuable assets for our nation, and on the other we are adding a cost for doing business in Britain.
<P>
The CBI survey on London was interested that 68 per cent. of those members surveyed were against this tax. People who realise that they will have to pay it have real concerns about what it will to cost. There are a number of questions there, Mr. Gale. We shall be more specific when we go through the Bill clause by clause. It would be interesting if the Minister set out an overview of the Bill and how he sees it operating.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) said, the amendment was tabled mainly at the suggestion of the CBI, which believes that the licensing approach is a poor way to reduce congestion. As my hon. Friend made clear, we are wholly opposed to the tax and if Ministers are not sure of that now, they will be when we campaign for the next general election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I wish to speak briefly at this stage. Nevertheless, I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Poole and partly to the hon. Member for North Essex. I apologise to the hon. Member for Poole that I had to go out briefly during his speech. Those hon. Members were right to press the Government on some of the detailed working of the proposals since a number of concerns have been raised with members of the Committee. The hon. Member for Poole in particular has done a good job in raising them, but there is a difference between raising concerns and using them as the basis for total opposition to workplace charging regimes. While one can support the principle, one can nevertheless have concerns about some of the details.
<P>
I broadly support the proposal for enabling legislation to allow local authorities to introduce schemes of the sort described in the Bill if they believe it to be beneficial in meeting their local transport plans. It is important to recognise that contained within the legislation are enormous opportunities for varying the way in which this scheme would work. The Committee only has to look at some of the clauses that we are about to consider in some detail to see the opportunity for variation that exists: which places the scheme will cover, the prices that shall be charged, and the days of the week and even the hours of the day in which it will operate.
<P>
Local authorities will have the important opportunity to adopt the measure if they wish as part of a raft of measures to solve transport problems in their area. I welcome the fact that, as with other parts of the Bill, authorities will have the opportunity to work jointly on schemes of this sort, which incidentally, will solve for Boots in Nottingham the problem of premises that straddle two different authorities.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole has made clear his belief that if such a scheme is to be imposed in any part of the country, the employees themselves should be charged for their workplace parking space. I do not agree. The spirit of the legislation is that the charge will be placed upon the employer. The benefit of that is that it will encourage employers to work with their employees to develop green transport plans, as a number of good companies already do, without the need for the additional pressure that workplace charging imposes.
<P>
I am sure that all members of the Committee will be aware of examples of good practice from the Southampton hospital on the one hand to Hewlett Packard in Bristol and—one of the best that I have come across—the British Airports Authority at Heathrow, which has developed an extremely good, highly sophisticated computerised car-sharing scheme.
<P>
In my constituency of Bath there is a wonderful recent initiative called Take Five. The scheme works with businesses in the area to help them find effective ways to persuade their employees either to walk, cycle, use public transport or car share to get to work. It has recognised that individual small companies cannot arrange car-sharing schemes by themselves—the options are not great enough to make it work effectively. If a number of relatively small employers get together, they can collectively operate an effective scheme. The advantage of schemes such as those proposed is that they provide an additional stick—I acknowledge that it would be a stick and not a carrot—to employers to look for some alternative approaches to persuade their employees to travel to work by other means.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I acknowledge that there are a number of practical difficulties and I would like some changes in the scheme and to other aspects of employees travelling to work. For example, the 1988 ruling on employers that make a contribution to the public travel costs of their employees could be revisited. There is an opportunity now to consider tax discounts for contributions made towards employees' use of public transport. These are details that we could discuss later.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex, who is not here at present, was keen to talk about the additional taxes on businesses. If he wishes to use that phrase, I shall not dissemble. I acknowledge that that is what the levy would be, unless companies are prepared to be imaginative in their thinking and find ways to reduce it by persuading more of their employees to travel to work by other means. It is, however, important that we constantly remind ourselves of the enormous cost to businesses and their employees of congestion on our roads. The figures will be well remembered by now by all members of the Committee. Although the CBI is opposed to the measure, it does not deny that congestion costs its members in the region of £20 billion. In addition, we know the cost to motorists themselves.
<P>
According to the RAC, it is about £23 billion. We also know of the enormous cost to other public services, for example to the national health service because of air pollution from the large number of vehicles on our roads at present. The answer has to be a mixture of carrots and sticks. This is one of the sticks, but as a result of measures like this, when people really need to use their cars, they will be able to do so without being stuck in an almost interminable traffic jam. It is ludicrous that in London, for example, it is estimated that a motorist spends more than one fifth of his or her time in the car stationary in traffic jams. In the Victorian age, one could move around London at 11 miles an hour in a horse and cart and that is still the average speed of motorists here today. That is of no benefit to those in businesses who occasionally need to use cars to conduct their business.
<P>
With other Liberal Democrat Members, I support the enabling legislation that gives local authorities the opportunity to consider whether this measure is appropriate for their area as a means of achieving the broad objectives laid out in their local transport plans. Difficulties are associated with it. Many details still need to be sorted out—for example, those mentioned by the hon. Member for Poole. I may raise other matters with the Minister later, but I want to place firmly on record our support for the broad principle.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I rise briefly to support workplace car parking charges, as someone who has been in multinational business and small business and has been the leader of a local authority. The tax enables local authorities to have another tool in the repertoire to manage the local environment and economy. Let us not forget that the tax will not simply be imposed, but will be used in the wider context of the good of the community, sparingly or as is relevant.
<P>
Local authorities already have at their disposal powers to decide the level of on and off-street parking, and of residential and office permits. To a large extent, they can already manage the amount of parking and the level of enforcement—how draconian the traffic wardens are. I should put on record, Mr. Gale, that Croydon was the first place in Britain to have traffic wardens. Local authorities have opportunities to re-„manage highway junctions and to work in partnership with the business community to draw up a broader based plan for a town's development. I welcome that. The opportunity to talk to the business community about congestion charging and workplace car parking charges was good.
<P>
I do not agree with the hon. Member for Bath that this charge is merely a stick. The money is to be hypothecated. There have been opportunities to talk to the business community and we have devised a system for everyone to travel to and from work and shops more effectively, so that the local economy works better. Clearly, the charge is an implicit encouragement for more internet business and less car use, with more bus rides and with business developing further joint innovative schemes with local authorities to help workers to get to work.
<P>
There are opportunities for taxable subsidy for voluntary and other groups that want to be targeted. Not everyone will immediately cross their borough and maximise the income. That would be an absurd position for a local authority that is interested in jobs, investment, stability and environmental sustainability.
<P>
We should remind ourselves of the £20 billion congestion costs that the CBI has put on business costs and the £50 billion estimated by the European Union, which includes health and other environmental and structural costs. That puts in perspective what we are doing. The provision would be targeted in towns. Much mention has been made of manufacturing. Some of the points about the environment in which we work and live were well made, but manufacturing does not tend to be in town centres, and that is where the problems are and where the charges will be made. At the same time, we must think about the balance between retail and non-retail. I welcome these measures, but I want people to consider planning restrictions locally on the overall amount of car parking—including retail—and the cost of using it. When local authorities run the car parks, they can be involved in that.
<P>
I welcome the schemes. They are a great step forward. People will have to think carefully about how and when to use them and will be required to consult with business and the community in general to achieve managed and sustained local growth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I have listened carefully to the interesting and wide-ranging debate. My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex laid out the case against the principle of the Bill very fairly. Why the hon. Member for Bath—we are required to pronounce Bath with a short ``a''—claims that Opposition Members did not oppose the principle of workplace parking charges, having listened to my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex, I cannot imagine, but he may not have been in the Room at the time. He was right, however, to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Poole expressed the deep concerns of a number of interest groups and industries about the way in which the tax will bite.
<P>
As for the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies), if he presses ahead with his plan to impose parking charges on retailers, his local supermarkets may understand his expression ``a tool in their repertoire''. They may have an instant recognition of what he was talking about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way? I call them ``a spanner in the works''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I shall not take that line. I do not seek to duplicate what my hon. Friends and others have said, but one or two matters have not been dealt with as robustly as they might have been. Speaking as the lance corporal—having listened to the young subaltern and even the sergeant major—it is normal for me to be reasonably robust in my approach to the proposal for workplace charges on behalf of my constituents in North Wiltshire and people throughout England who will be badly affected by the proposal.
<P>
First, one has to ask what the provision is for. As always, the Liberal Democrats give us relatively obvious soundbites about its purpose. They said, ``We don't like congestion''—of course, we do not—``We don't like going at 11 mph like the Victorians''. Of course we do not. We want to move much faster. I mentioned that in Adelaide the average speed of traffic in the centre of the town is 50 mph. It would be nice to go at 50 mph, but if we did, it would encourage everyone back on to the roads. Going at 11 mph is the reason that people do not use their cars. They know that when they come into London, they will do 11 mph.
<P>
We have been told that traffic jams cost motorists £20 billion. The figures were relatively imaginary. Hon. Members subtracted the number they first thought of by and large, to make the considerations. The figures are relatively complex constructions, but if it is costing motorists £20 a year to sit in traffic jams, that is a good reason for them not to do so any more. The only reason that they continue to do so is that they prefer to. The only reason that they might support some of the provisions in the Bill, such as congestion charges and workplace charging, is because they believe, as the hon. Member for Bath suggested, that the charges will get everyone else off the roads which will enable them to drive faster.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> Eleven miles per hour in the city is undoubtedly slow, but is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that we should be able to drive at 50 mph in the city? If he is, how many of his constituents would be happy to hear it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I think that the hon. Lady may have missed the point. I will move on so as not to embarrass her too much. To reiterate briefly, the hon. Member for Bath suggested that 11 mph was not the right speed at which to move and that we should find ways to improve the speed in towns. I would not wish to go nearly as fast as they do in Adelaide, which is 50 mph, but let us imagine that there were broad highways in London, as there are in Adelaide—huge boulevards, down which they drive at 50 mph—and that thanks to these charges, we got rid of the congestion and could drive in London at 50 mph. I am not advocating that, but let us suppose that we could. What would happen? It would simply invite the motorist back on to the road. That was my argument. I was not suggesting that we should drive at 50 mph although many people in my constituency do drive at that speed, as it is largely rural. That argument does not necessarily achieve the easy soundbites that the hon. Member for Bath suggested.
<P>
Secondly, we have to ask, why not. A number of hon. Gentlemen alluded to the reason, which is simple. The tax is not designed to prevent people from driving, it is a tax on business. It does not work for that reason. My hon. Friend the Member for Poole alluded to his business in Chippenham, in my constituency. He said that if there is a car park outside the office—at Bumpers Farm, in his case, which is an industrial estate in North Wiltshire—and the workplace parking tax comes in, what is one to do? Does one dig up the concrete and say that there is no parking place outside? Even then, one would be left with a flat space—how would one prevent people from parking on it? Would one put concrete bollards on it to prevent that? Would one leave it, in the hope that an inspector would not notice and paint over the yellow stripes? They are absurd questions, but they highlight the difficulty, if workplace parking places exist. The thought that, because of the tax, they might cease to exist is, plainly, absurd. No one will do what I have described.
<P>
Secondly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Poole correctly said, because the places are there, the annual tax will be paid and they will be used. People will be coming to the factory to work, as they do in Chippenham. If one lives in the countryside there is no other way of getting to work, so the tax will have to be paid. Various visiting tradesmen, such as the photocopier engineer, will also come. The tax will be paid and there will be precisely the same number of cars and car parking slots as before. The only difference will be that a tax is levied. That exposes this as an income-raising measure rather than one that will change behaviour.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath was incorrect when he referred to what he described as the ``green transport plans'' that a number of employers have in place. Of course they do and there are advantages in doing that. The reason is that people do not like driving into work. They like getting together in their cars, or using mini-buses, as does the excellent Dyson factory in Malmesbury in my constituency. Its employees park their cars centrally and a mini-bus takes them to the factory which is down some rather obscure Cotswold lanes. That is excellent and I am pleased that they do that. The more that we can encourage that sort of thing, the better. However, people already do that and there is no workplace parking tax. There is little evidence that if there were such a tax it would necessarily increase such schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman is missing the other half of the equation. The purpose of raising the money through the workplace parking levy is to have more money available to improve the quality of public transport and the alternatives. They then work in tandem. There will be a stick to put further pressure on companies to develop green transport plans, but as they do so they will find there is improved public transport with which they can link.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> On Thursday we discussed hypothecation in general—whether it can exist, whether it should exist and whether the right amount of money will be raised in the right places to pay for public transport system. It would be otiose to repeat those arguments now, although the theologians in the Treasury have argued that case since the Liberal Democrats first thought up hypothecation some years ago. The truth is that the system simply does not work because, in Chippenham, we would not raise enough from workplace parking charges to provide the green transport systems that the hon. Gentleman describes. We could only improve public transport in Chippenham if the Government in their wisdom beneficially decided to pump in money from elsewhere, in addition to the Chippenham-raised workplace parking charge. It is an easy soundbite to say, ``Oh, don't worry about it. We'll raise the tax with workplace parking charges and that will mean we can pay for the jolly old green transport system and that will all be absolutely tickety-boo. Everyone is going to travel by public transport.'' Of course, that is not the case and it will not apply on the ground. It may apply in some places, for example, in London. The new underground line may be financed by workplace parking charges. However, the amount of money raised through local charges will equal the amount of money necessary to improve public transport in remarkably few places in England.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Also, if one has a licensing scheme, people will have to go round inspecting and enforcing it. They will have to be paid salaries by local government. A lot of the money collected from workplace parking will go into employing people to make sure that it is working.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point, as he did on the subject of how much it would cost to bring both these systems—congestion charging and workplace tax—into effect. He is right. Policing would be a nightmare. If the white lines have been removed from a concrete area and tax has been paid only on a certain amount of it, what on earth is to prevent a dishonest employer from continuing to use it as a parking place without declaring it? That would be against the law, but it would be impractical to police that sort of law breaking, which would be an inbuilt incentive to employers to bend the law, to ignore it or to find ways round it. Unless it is carefully policed, I cannot see how it will work.
<P>
The fact that the tax is to be levied on employers rather than on employees is also important. Imagine a company that has a large number workplace parking slots. One of several things will happen when this tax is levied. First, the share price will go down. It may not be by very much and probably will not much affect many companies. However, if the charge in London were to be £3,000 or £4,000 per slot, which I have heard suggested might be the necessary level, and a company had a large number of workplace parking slots, a significant amount of money could be involved. It might be enough to appear on the company's annual accounts and, therefore, potentially enough to have an effect on its share price. That would damage the company's ability to raise money on the stock exchange and to pay dividends to its shareholders—many of our constituents are shareholders. That may well be part of the Labour party's agenda, to damage the profitability of our companies. It is quite possible. However, I do not believe that this so-called new Labour Government would do that—although it perhaps would have done 20 or 30 years ago.
<P>
Let us imagine that the Treasury does not concede that this will affect companies' profitability. It would not come out of the shareholders' pockets. Where would it come from? That is easy to answer. We see it at the moment, in the City of London, where a big shakedown is taking place in banking. German banks are taking over British merchant banks. It is easy to see where the workplace charging tax will come from: out of the pockets of the employees, even if it is formally levied on the employers. It will simply be added to the cost of employing people, alongside their wages, national insurance, the company car scheme, their Christmas party and any number of other benefits of one sort or another in cash or in kind. It would be added to that package and if it is larger than the company can afford, they will reduce the number of people who work for them. That will be the end result. I would not want to say how many and the arithmetic is complex. The truth of the matter is that this will be a tax on employers and the net result will be a reduction in the number of employees.
<P>
The Minister does not take that matter seriously enough, apparently, even to listen carefully to the argument. It is a tax on employees. The closest equivalent would be the tax on company car mileage, which has not reduced the amount of that mileage, but has simply reduced the number of cars owned by employees. The companies found a way round it. They will find a way round this one too. That is one of the consequences.
<P>
A second consequence should be worrying. I am sorry to have constantly to prod the Government's collective conscience, but a Labour Government should be terribly worried—it worried people like me—that the fat cats will be entirely insouciant about this. They could not care less. Indeed, they will be delighted. I lived for many years in Balham and drove to the City of London, where I worked in a bank, the GNI, for many years. I drove because I dropped my children at school on the way and I liked driving. I did not like going on the Northern line, which was so appalling at the time. I cared nothing about how much it cost me to park when I got to the City because my company paid. It was one of my perks as a highly paid city punter—sadly, I spent all the money. Parking in the City cost a great deal of money—parking at National Car Parks in the City costs a fortune. It was very expensive indeed, but my company paid and I was delighted.
<P>
My main problem in those days was where to put the BMW. My NCP was nearly always full and even though my day started at 7 am, as it does in the City, I could not find anywhere to park my car when I arrived. Often, I had to take it back down to Southwark to find a free car park, and walk back across London bridge to get to my office.
<P>
I did not care about the cost. [Interruption.] Labour Members must listen. I am using myself as an example.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> In a moment. I enjoy the hon. Lady's interventions even though they are not necessarily a point. My argument is a serious one. I did not care about the cost of parking in London because someone else was paying for it. In any case, I was highly paid. What I did care about was the fact that I could not find anywhere to park. When this Government say that they will charge people £3,000 or £4,000 a year for the privilege of parking in the City of London, I will say, ``Brilliant! That is fantastic news. Now I know where to put my BMW. That is simply brilliant. Good old Government! Look, chaps, why don't you put it up to £5,000 or £10,000? That would be even better. That way we would get all those clapped-out F-registered cars off the road and leave plenty of room in my NCP for brand new Rolls-Royces and Jaguars and BMWs.''
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> I think that we have found a flaw in the hon. Gentleman's case. He said that his reason for driving from Balham to the City was that he enjoyed dropping his children off at school. He went on to say that he was in the office by 7 am. These poor children may deserve some assistance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Lady may think that she has spotted a flaw in the argument, but the two things did not happen at the same time. The early mornings in the office occurred after the children had gone to boarding school.
<P>
My point was a serious one. The imposition of the workplace parking charge will not necessarily be a disincentive to people. It will actually be an incentive because it will say, ``We will provide you with plenty of parking space in the City of London, so, come on guys, get off the underground and into your car.'' Bear in mind that some of the banks pay bonuses of £2 million or £3 million a year. They are not worried about the cost—there is plenty of money swilling around.
<P>
It is interesting to hear how the Government have changed their arguments. Last week they were arguing in favour of congestion charging, saying, much to my surprise, coming as this did from a Labour Minister, that the City of London institutions were in favour of it. I remember, too, that on Second Reading the term ``City of London institutions'' came up several times. As I argued then, the reason was that the fat cats could move swiftly through London into the banks. They prayed the City in aid, saying, ``The City of London is strongly in favour of it.'' If that is the case, I shall take this opportunity to point out that the City of London, the CBI, the Institute of Directors and everybody else one cares to think of is arguing strongly against workplace charging. If they want to rely on the City of London and the fat cats—I cannot imagine why they do—they must listen to the argument on workplace charging just as much as to that on congestion charging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> To advert to my hon. Friend's earlier comments about the effects of workplace parking charges in the City of London, the Government cannot want all these parking spaces to disappear as a result of their policy; if that happen, they will not raise any tax. They want plenty of parking spaces so that local authorities can raise as much money as possible. This is a tax-raising opportunity, not part of the integrated transport policy. It is part of the Treasury's policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> That is a good point. There is no evidence of a link between this tax and a reduction in the number of people on the roads. It could be argued that the opposite will happen. Is there good statistical evidence from anywhere in the world where a workplace parking charge has been imposed? There is only one example that I know of, and that is Sydney. The charge there is about 200 Australian dollars. It is viewed as a useful parking charge by people who are only too delighted to pay, because they know that others cannot afford to do so. There is no evidence that traffic in central Sydney has been reduced because of the imposition of the parking tax. If the Minister cam point to any evidence from anywhere in the world of a parking tax reducing congestion, we shall be interested to hear about it, but I would be surprised if he can. I know of none.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I have been reflecting on what the hon. Gentleman said a few minutes ago. I am slightly confused; he gave a fairly long exposition on why the fat-cat City of London institutions would desperately love the measure that the Government are introducing. He ended by telling us that no organisations—the CBI and so on, including the City of London institutions—were against workplace charging. Does that mean that he was talking a load of nonsense, or that the City of London institutions have not yet realised the brilliance of his arguments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It is remarkably easy to confuse the hon. Gentleman. Most of his contributions throughout the debate have been confused. Perhaps he will allow me to explain it simple words of one syllable. To a private individual such as I was at the time about which I was talking—and, despite the political cost of doing so, I am happy to admit that I used my car to drive into London—getting everybody else off the road would be the benefit. For the fat cat in his Jaguar or Rolls-Royce it is, of course, beneficial to have somewhere to park. The organisations such as the Institute of Directors, the CBI and the City of London, which represent not the individual but the profitability of businesses, realise the awful consequences on businesses of paying such gigantic charges.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands the clear distinction between the individual personal benefit that may accrue from the tax and the cost to business that concern the IOD, the CBI and others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Of course I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. Does it not occur to him that, once the City of London institutions become horrified about the cost of congestion to their businesses, they might adjust the perks that they give to people such as the hon. Gentleman used to be?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. The moment we start paying the tax, the net employment costs in the City of London will have to be reduced. That will probably mean not so much a reduction in the amount received by individuals as a reduction in the number of those being employed. [Hon. Members: ``No.''] Everyone says, ``Surely not,'' but that is precisely the way in which the City of London works. I worked there for 15 years and know it in some detail and that is exactly what we are seeing at the moment. In the case of the mergers between the German banks, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Dresdner, it is a matter not of their saying ``Right, chaps, you will no longer get a £2 million bonus,'' but of their saying, ``We are going to lay off up to 4,000 people.'' I have a number of constituents who are caught up in that. ``We will lay people off because we are cutting costs.'' The same applies here.
<P>
There are two or three other objections that have not been addressed as well as they might. They have perhaps more to do with what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole, rather than my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex. In some areas in most towns like Chippenham, free off-site parking can be found. If the workplace parking charge is applied, everyone will park on the streets. That is obvious, because it happens already. Why would anyone go to a factory site and pay to park if he or she could park 10 yd away in the street, free of charge? A large number of people could be forced out of factories or offices and on to the street.
<P>
When I could not find a place in a car park run by National Car Parks in the City of London, I drove across London bridge to Southwark, where there was on-street parking entirely free of charge. There are a number of other places in south London where people can park free of charge. One consequence may be that free on-street parking will be abolished, but that will have other repercussions on businesses in areas such as mine. The scheme will drive people into off-site parking.
<P>
Similarly, there may be serious consequences because of the differentials between local authorities that apply workplace charging and those that do not. If a local authority that does not have workplace charging is next to one that does, people will move their businesses into the area that does not have charging. At the margins between areas, people will move as much as they can to come under a local authority that does not charge.
<P>
There was a brief exchange earlier about whether the workplace parking tax would apply to football grounds and other sports facilities enjoyed by local people. I should like to take this opportunity, in which I am sure that the Committee will wish to join, to congratulate Chippenham Town, which had an outstanding away victory on Saturday, beating Bridlington in the north of England. The team is now through to the semi-final of the FA Vase, which is quite an achievement. There is a lot of parking space at the Chippenham Town football ground. I accept the Minister's assurance that fans will not be charged for that, but at issue is the question of the training provided for guides, scouts and other young people who go there on Saturday mornings. Clause 158(4)(c), . . . which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the provision of any course of education or training,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
might apply to football clubs such as Chippenham Town. If such clubs are providing training in the grounds on Saturday mornings, might that not come into the category of training?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> How can the Minister be so confident that a sponsor of a football club who has season ticket rights and parking facilities as part of those season ticket rights does not constitute a business customer of that football club? Any person who attends the premises and who carries on business at or in the vicinity of those premises—indeed, any football supporter who buys a ticket to attend a game is attending the business of the football club. That is how the clubs raise their money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am pleased that the Minister has cleared up one part of the confusion, but I doubt whether a corporate sponsor could be excluded from the definition of business customer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend may well be right. The Minister has given us some assurances about those who buy tickets, although he has not done so about young people and warnings. He said that players will be taxed. But the clause is badly drafted and will result in enormous barrister fees and court cases over the years. The Minister may like to contemplate the issues that we have raised and ask officials to examine carefully the drafting of the clause to consider how it can be tightened up and clarified, because it is loose in the extreme. If it will not affect football clubs, we shall be delighted. We only raise the matter because there is a possibility that football clubs may be wrapped up inadvertently in the Bill.
<P>
I was concerned about the suggestion of the hon. Member for Bath that we only had to worry about a few details and sort out the mechanism. He said that the principle behind workplace parking tax was good and that he was strongly in favour of it. I do not agree. The principle is extraordinarily bad. The arguments advanced against it by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex are extremely cogent.
<P>
I am worried that we are drifting down the track of saying, ``We are going to bring in this measure. We realise that there some downsides to it and that people are strongly opposed to it. But don't worry about that, because we shall not impose it. We are a caring Government and understand about disabled people and so on. This is only enabling legislation for local authorities to introduce such measures.'' Such an argument would be wrong for two reasons. First, let us suppose that such a scheme would be good for reducing congestion. It would surely be right for the Government to say that the provision must be put in place.
<P>
Secondly, if such provisions are simply enabling legislation that will be left to the local authority to implement, surely those who were Cabinet Ministers until recently and those who subscribe to the Labour party manifesto should be saying, ``Okay, we have read the Bill and listened to the Committee. We believe that it is a good measure. Labour authorities will be allowed to impose it, so the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras will impose such a provision in London.'' However, the moment that the Government come up against the ballot box and the right hon. Gentleman realises that, if he supports the Bill, he will lose many hundred thousands of votes, he and the Government will back off. He will say that it is difficult and that paper-based charging is too complicated. He will suggest leaving it five, 10 or 50 year, or until the global positioning system of charging has come in.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman will say, ``That nasty hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) will charge Londoners all that money, but I shall not because I am a good guy—with or without beard.'' There are one or two bearded members of the Committee, so I shall not be too rude. Surely, if the Government believe, as they say that they do, that such a provision is a worthwhile way in which to reduce congestion, that the nation needs it and that it will reduce asthma and get rid of pollution, they should do one of two things. They should either impose it nationally, or say to the person who, until recently, was a Cabinet Minister, but who is now the official Labour candidate in the mayoral race, ``Bring it in. Let us try it out. Let us see what the electorate think about it, and find out whether it reduces pollution, asthma and congestion in London.'' When the Government face the reality of the ballot box, they will back off, and I suspect that they shall do so nationally.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith </B>(Vale of Glamorgan): The biggest burden and tax on business in this country over the past two or three decades has been the appalling transport infrastructure. Anyone involved in business, especially those who run businesses, knows it represents one of the biggest costs, in terms of access to markets, employees coming to work, supplies, services and the ability to communicate. In business, time is money, and Britain has been disadvantaged for many years because of the transport infrastructure with which we have had to cope. Many businesses in town centres or elsewhere have had to build into their costs the burden of being unable to guarantee getting from A to B in an acceptable time. Our competitors overseas do not have to put up with that. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central said, the proposal is one of several tools that will be integrated to try to tackle the great burden on business after decades of neglect.
<P>
I come from and represent a seat in south Wales, where we are acutely aware of the impact of lack of investment in roads and railways over the past 20 or 30 years. We have suffered disproportionately by not having a proper motorway network. Our main motorway artery has been reduced to a two-lane carriageway on parts of the M4 to such an extent that is difficult to attract investors to the area. They are concerned about being located on the periphery of a European marketplace, but that is not true. The travelling time from London to south Wales is a little more than a couple of hours. Depending on the time of day, it is sometimes quicker to drive from Cardiff to Heathrow airport than it is from the centre of London.
<P>
A recent survey implied a belief that south Wales as an investment location was effectively 100 miles further from London that it really is. Such nonsense has a huge impact on decision making when investors choose locations. That situation exists because we have had such a poor transport record over the years, which the previous Government refused to attempt to tackle. At last we have a Government who will seriously tackle the problem of misinformed perspectives of regions, including south Wales, and the measures before us are among those that they will use. The CBI estimates that the cost of congestion is about £15 billion to £20 billion a year, but I think that that is a conservative estimate.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am listening to the hon. Gentleman with interest. Every time that supporters of the Government quote the CBI analysis, they seem to forget that the CBI argues for greater investment in roads. The best thing for south Wales would be for the M4 widening to go ahead so that the roads can carry traffic from south Wales to the markets that it wants to serve. It is ludicrous for him to argue that we need more taxes on business to help his constituents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> That is nonsense. Road-building programmes do not happen in a couple of years, but over decades, and decades of neglect have created the problem in our transport infrastructure. We need a widening of the M4 and a relief road to certain parts of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In that case, will the hon. Gentleman join me in pressing the Government to reverse their savage cuts in the road-improvement programme? He lambasts us, but we spent £26 billion improving our network of trunk roads and motorways. His Government are spending next to nothing. They have cut and slashed our programme, leaving his constituents in danger of being cut off from their markets by the congestion that he described.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> I am not sure whether that was an intervention or another speech, but, once again, what the spokesman for the Opposition says is nonsense. At long last, we have a realistic road building programme with increased investment in roads. For the first time, we are talking about roads that we shall build rather than the year-in, year-out nonsense of having a big shopping list of roads, many of which the previous Government never intended to build. The Dinas Powys bypass has waited for 25 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman trying to say that his Government are spending more on roads than the previous Government?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am being as generous as I can. I appreciate that there is a direct connection between roads and parking places, but the debate is nevertheless going wide of the mark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. It is crucial that we get matters right. The Opposition have admitted that the previous Government introduced the workplace levy, and there is no question that the parking charge in the business rate is a parking levy. The difference is that it is a stealth tax that is not intended to be spent on transport. In many major hospitals, we can see an especially pernicious workplace levy that is a direct result of the previous Government. It affects staff and visitors, and even sick patients often have to pay to park in hospitals when they go in for treatment. That is a result of the internal market, with hospitals desperate to find ways in which to raise money. Our Government have a different policy. The money that we raise will be hypothecated and used to solve the problems that we inherited. We shall not place such charges on some of the most vulnerable in society, which the Conservatives actively encouraged.
<P>
It is true that business has not welcomed the extra charge of the workplace levy on its activity. Anyone who understands business realises that no business person in his right mind would do so. Read between the lines: the CBI and chambers of commerce such as that in south Wales welcome the congestion and road charges. They openly admit that that is because the charges are on employees, not employers. They welcome the Government's integrated transport plans and the local authority plans. As business people, they know that in the long run they stand to benefit more than anyone from the measures.
<P>
We do not want a charge on our businesses that does not result in benefit being accrued. We must be acutely conscious of that. A workplace levy will not be a burden on business if it helps to tackle the nightmarish congestion in our city centres and on our roads for the past 20 years. Business wants that to happen. We must carefully consider how the money is used. We need to see direct results. Businesses want to know that their employees and customers will have access to them if the levies are introduced. They do not want to see car parking displaced. The Government have to consider the ability of local authorities to borrow on the strength of predicated income from workplace levies and some of the other charges, and we should look more seriously at the period of hypothecation. We have inherited 20, 25, 30 years' lack of investment in transport and we must recognise that it will take 10, 20, 30 years to put right. There is some flexibility, but we should see more freedom to extend the period of hypothecation so that business can have confidence that our plans will work for their benefit and encourage economic growth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I do not like the Bill, but this is its lowest point. We had interesting debates last week on the merits of pricing and the impact of allocating scarce resources to roads, but there is no merit in this proposal at all. It has nothing to do with the sensible allocation of resources and everything to do with the Department's failure to win any battles with the Treasury.
<P>
There is already a huge increase in tax on road users; £32 billion is now being taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and only £6 billion is being handed back. My constituents are some of the most afflicted in the country because 67 per cent. of them drive to work by car. As I said in earlier debates, they have no alternative when they want to travel from their rural area to a small village, medium-sized town or conurbation. The cost of setting up a comprehensive public transport system is prohibitive and it will not happen.
<P>
I find it amazing that the hon. Member for Bath supports the proposal. His voters in the south-west will be as badly affected as mine on the Welsh borders. The increase in tax has been estimated by the AA to be £900 a year for the average car user. That affects my poorest constituents. The last asset that they can afford to relinquish is the car. If they let their car go, they will lose their job. It is as simple as that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> With regard to the point that my hon. Friend made about the hon. Member for Bath, I think that he is wrong, for two reasons. First, Bath is an entirely enclosed town. Transport systems might help his constituents, if not mine, who have to go there to do their shopping. Secondly, Bath and North East Somerset council have recently had the great good sense to become controlled by the Conservative party, which I am confident will not introduce any of these charges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am delighted to hear of Tory gains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It is important that the hon. Gentleman is aware that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire is wrong on both counts. First, the constituency of Bath includes a number of outlying villages where, sadly, there is no effective transport system. Secondly, Bath and North East Somerset council certainly is not controlled by the Conservatives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Let us get back to workplace charges. My concern is that rural working people will not be able to avoid such charges. It is clear that the battle with the Treasury has been lost and there will not be adequate funds to set up comprehensive transport systems. The ball has therefore been firmly put in the DETR's court to scrabble around to find funds wherever it can. This is a straight tax affecting, in my area, my poorest constituents. There will be no gain for the environment because they will have to continue driving into towns such as Oswestry and Market Drayton, Telford and The Wrekin.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): The hon. Gentleman mentioned his poorest constituents. I have two low car-user areas of severe deprivation in my constituency where many people have no means of travelling other than by public transport. They are low car-user areas. Some of my constituents will rely on the parts of the Bill that refer to buses because that is how they get around. They cannot afford a car. It is about time he recognised that some people do not have cars.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> In my county, 67 per cent. of people drive to work in a car. One third does not have cars. The hon. Gentleman is quite right. Where he is possibly misleading his constituents—I cannot speak for the area as I do not know it—is to suggest that adequate funds will come from this parking tax to provide comprehensive public transport. It is simply not going to happen. He might be misleading his constituents on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman's constituency of Harwich is an economically marginal area. It has assisted area status and the last thing employers need is an extra stealth tax on business because they are desperate to try to attract business into that area of high unemployment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That is a most helpful observation that confirms my suspicions of what the area is like. The most obvious objection to this charge is that it is avoidable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> May I put the record straight? My area does not have assisted status. Jaywick received no help over the 18 years or more of Tory control of the constituency. People were left in deprivation without any means of transport into the town centres. That is why I take exception to the hon. Gentleman saying that he does not accept any of this Bill. We are trying to help my constituents with access. At the moment they are excluded from everything that everyone else is entitled to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The main impact of this measure is that it will put the final straw on the camel's back and will close businesses in his constituency and, sadly, his constituents will be put out of work. That is what will probably happen. We do not have any guarantee that the money will be spent on public transport to the area where his outlying constituents live. That is the real problem.
<P>
The most obvious hole in the argument is that those with cars can vote with their wheels. It is obvious that employers will not register the required number of parking places and cars will be parked around the corner. There will be an increase in parking in residential areas and an increase, incredibly, in congestion thanks to this tax.
<P>
In towns such Oswestry or Market Drayton, there are factories within five or 10 minutes of the town centre and within two or three minutes of residential areas. It is quite obvious that to avoid the tax people will park in those areas. The streets are not very wide and there will be congestion and public anger. It will not work. The detail has not been thought out at all. It is a straight charge on constituents who have no other alternative. It will have a deleterious effect on traffic circulation.
<P>
I will give two contrasting examples. I know we have had a long debate on this, Mr. Gale, and you have been most patient. The hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) spoke about business. I thought it was interesting that the one comparative survey I have seen is that from the Institute of Directors. Before everyone jumps up and says that its members are all fat cats in pin-striped suits, I point out that, according to a letter I received from it, it represents 51,000 businesses—from small and medium sized up to some of the largest businesses in the country. According to the labour market trends in December last year, it represents 43 per cent. of the work force. So, Mr. Gale, I think it worth considering its survey.
<P>
The survey showed that 81 per cent. either oppose parking charges or oppose parking charges strongly. That is a pretty devastating vote by an organisation representing 10.3 million people. As always, the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) giggles and chunters on the Back Benches. I should have thought that he would take seriously the fact that 81 per cent. oppose or oppose strongly the proposal.

<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am always fascinated by the Conservative party's praying in aid the corporate state, which I thought it opposed. I am a director of a company, but the Institute of Directors does not speak for me. I doubt whether it speaks for lots of other people, either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> It is nice to have my parliamentary tachograph present to put on Excalibur what I have been saying. However, he misses the point. To report it accurately to Millbank, he should note what I have just said. The Institute of Directors represents 10.3 million people and has 51,000 members. That is a substantial slice of the business community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> On the same basis, I am a member of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. I therefore represent 80,000 people, so the hon. Gentleman should shut up.

One of the most interesting features of the survey involved two contrasting figures 12 per cent. of respondents said that they would encourage people not to drive to them—so they would obviously just tell them to park around the corner—but interestingly, 18 per cent. would consider relocating. That is a much more serious criticism. The institute said that the proposal

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>could seriously damage business profitability and competitiveness . . . Relocation arising from a levy could seriously damage many local economies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that I have the survey with me. Only last week, I spoke to my local Institute of Directors, the South Downs and Surrey branch, which very much welcomes the Government's moves towards environmental and economic sustainability. I am interested to note that the questionnaire does not distinguish between investment in public transport and the charge. The question asked is simply, ``Do you want to be charged more money?'' The real question is, ``Do you want a better infrastructure to be created with this money to enable your workers to go to work?'' My local Institute of Directors supports the more environmental, better transport system that we propose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Everyone is in favour of a better transport system. However, as I said earlier, not enough funds will be raised locally to provide one, and the levy will constitute a tax. The institute's memorandum is absolutely clear about that. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The imposition of what could amount to a very expensive total charge in some locations . . . could seriously damage business profitability and competitiveness.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is absolutely blunt about that. It also makes the point that people will park around the corner in a residential area. In addition, as my hon. Friends the Members for Poole and for North Wiltshire said, considerable sums of money will have to be devoted to policing and administering the scheme.
<P>
I suspect that the Minister will respond by saying that those whom I suggest will park around the corner in residential areas can be swept up by the clause, and that the employers who let them park around the corner can be fined. However, Oswestry, for example, has only one traffic warden, a very nice man who has a very fine cat. He is a charming guy, but he is subject to great criticism for not policing the few double yellow lines in Oswestry. The thought that he will go around all the housing estates that are within two or three minutes' walk of factories that will be swept up by the charging scheme is unthinkable. That will simply not happen. A huge increase in administration and personnel to police the scheme will be necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> If I may be so bold, my hon. Friend is slightly missing the point. His parking warden would not go around the residential area unless parking in it were forbidden by double yellow lines, in which case we should face a significant problem that we would not otherwise face. Factories in my constituency, such as that of Dyson, with 1,000 workplace parking slots, is right in the middle of a largish residential area in the middle of the Cotswolds. Everyone would park in the housing estates, and nothing would stop them doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I may not have expressed myself clearly. At the moment, we have one traffic warden, who is failing to police the double yellow lines system. An enormous extension of double yellow lines in residential areas and an increase in traffic wardens to police them will be necessary. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. As I have mentioned previously, it is interesting that the nearest Labour-controlled council to my constituency, Telford and The Wrekin, which is a new unitary—
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> A very well run one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Yes, but it is interesting that, in response to real anger from local firms, the council boldly declared that it would not impose workplace charging, Mr. Garry Emmerson of the council's highways and transport section said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We need to have a viable public transport alternative and that would need a considerable amount of cash upfront to put into place the system that we need.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>And we would only adopt the idea if it was taken up on a regional basis at least, or preferably a national basis. Otherwise, it could have a major negative effect on the economy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are proud to trumpet that Labour council, but it will not impose the provision because it knows the damage that it would cause. I am glad about that, because my constituents who drive two or three miles into Telford and The Wrekin would have been hit by the system. They will not benefit from it, because the council will be spending money on Telford and The Wrekin transport schemes.
<P>
I have drawn attention to two pieces of evidence: the survey of the Institute of Directors that backs up my argument and the statement from a Labour council. Will the Minister explain how the provision will work? We know that it is a straight tax; it has nothing to do with congestion or improving the environment, because so many people have to use cars to get to work. But how on earth will it work in practice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had an astonishingly wide-ranging debate. We have visited the wilder shores of Chippenham, Oswestry and Adelaide, where the population live in terror of cars careering through the city at 50 mph. I would now like to bring us back to earth. I shall give the Committee a brief overview of the main purpose of the group of clauses, after which I shall deal with the points made by members of the Committee. I may appear to be moving from the sublime to the ridiculous, but I shall then refer to the amendments.
<P>
Clauses 154 to 161 deal with workplace parking levy schemes and procedures for making licensing schemes. I shall outline briefly what the clauses are designed to achieve, which in many cases parallels provisions for road user charging that we considered last week. They give local traffic authorities the power, not an obligation—if they choose to use it—to implement licensing schemes for workplace parking as defined in the Bill to combat congestion in their area. They allow flexibility for joint schemes between authorities when that is the most effective way in which to deal with local traffic problems that cross local authority boundaries.
<P>
We included such provisions in the Bill because it is generally recognised that the availability of convenient and free or relatively cheap parking is a significant factor in influencing how and where car owners choose to travel, even when an alternative to the car is available. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire, in the course of a most entertaining speech in which we learned about his earlier life, driving his BMW into the City, made the point that the availability of car parking is an influence. It can create traffic congestion, especially during peak commuting periods.
<P>
A levy on workplace parking can help to tackle the problem of traffic congestion. We are aware, however, that schemes regarded simply as revenue-raising devices are likely to be unpopular, not only with businesses, but with employees, I want to put it clearly on the record that that is why we will not permit workplace parking charges to be used solely as a revenue-raising device. There has been a great deal of misinterpretation of the motives behind the provisions. I can say quite openly that we will not approve any scheme whose main purpose appears to be to raise revenue rather than to tackle congestion.
<P>
As with road user charging, schemes will be made by order. They will be subject to widespread local consultation, particularly with the business community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Is the Minister now saying that the purpose of the tax is to reduce the availability of workplace parking slots? The reduction of places seemed to cause him to talk about my BMW. If that is the case, how does he intend to ask companies that have a significant number of workplace parking places to reduce it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I will come to that. I was setting out the principles on which the scheme is based. It should be used to reduce congestion by discouraging the provision of free or cheap workplace parking in areas where there is a serious problem. It is not designed as a universal imposition. Indeed, it is unlikely to be applicable in many of the areas that we have heard about where congestion is not a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I apologise for being out of the Committee Room when the Minister rose to his feet, but I have caught the gist of his comments. Although London is not part of this Bill, can we use the recent ROCOL report as an example of how it would work? That study deals with 35,000 spaces, which it forecasts will be reduced. It anticipates that in central London the impact on traffic will be only 2 per cent. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that there will be a permanent 2 per cent. reduction in the traffic? Is it not more likely that it will be rapidly mopped up by other kinds of road users so that there will be no net reduction in congestion?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman, who has been wrong on many counts in the course of the debate, is wrong again. The ROCOL study showed that an annual levy of £3,000 on workplace vehicle parking in central London could translate into a 4 per cent. reduction in trips into that area in the morning peak period. The figures are not those that the hon. Gentleman is using and, while I would be the first to say that a 4 per cent. reduction is not enormous, it would be significant in an area that is heavily congested at present and may make a contribution towards the solution of London's serious problem.
<P>
However, this Bill applies to the rest of the country. The provision in London was determined in the Greater London Authority Act 1999, where the powers were made available to the mayor and the London boroughs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is referring to the whole of central London, as opposed to inner London, but the same argument applies. We are talking only about London because we have the ROCOL study and we do not have a similar study for any other city. Even if there is a net 4 per cent. reduction in vehicle usage, that will be rapidly mopped up by other road users. Does the Minister think that he can sit there like King Canute and command the tide?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I apologise for briefly continuing to talk about London, but the hon. Gentleman raised it. We will come to philosophy in a moment when I refer to the comments of the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, but the philosophy behind such a charge is that it should contribute towards the improvement of public transport by hypothecation of the revenue to achieve alternative options for travel. The combination of a reduction in the overall number of vehicles coming into the area, coupled with an improvement in public transport alternatives, would work together to reduce congestion and to make it easier to travel around our city, which all members of the Committee have accepted is a problem at present. Does the hon. Member for North Essex suggest that nothing should be done about congestion in London? If so, those who might be thinking of supporting Mr. Norris will be interested to hear him say that again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman has just tacitly admitted that this is a revenue-raising device. This is the source of revenue that the Government want local authorities to use to invest in public transport, in place of the traditional grants with which the previous Government was much more generous than the present one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong again. The proposal is not revenue raising as such; it is designed to tackle congestion problems. Like any other economic instrument, it does so by imposing a financial penalty for certain activities. Because of the Government's achievement, the revenue from that will be hypothecated for investment in improved transport services. The two go hand in hand. Of course, there is an element of charge. I specified a charge of £3,000 a car in central London. The revenue from that would be used not as an alternative to existing and projected—
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This Government have already cut the grant.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman ought to check his facts before making sedentary interventions, as he is wrong again. The grants proposed for London Transport that were left behind by his Government were so hopelessly inadequate that the first thing that we had to do when we can to office was to increase the funds available to it by £365 million, There will be continued Government funding for public transport but that could be supplemented, when the Secretary of State agrees, by the revenue derived from the charge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I would like to make some progress, as I have many points to make. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in due course.
<P>
Every scheme will be submitted for confirmation to the appropriate national authority—the Secretary of State in England or the National Assembly for Wales. The Secretary of State will wish to ensure that there has been full consultation and that the scheme is in the interests of the local community. That is likely to mean that some public transport improvements have been made in advance of introducing the scheme, and that there are sensible and robust plans for spending the scheme revenue on a range of transport improvements.
<P>
Clauses 154 to 157 identify the authorities that can make licensing schemes. The Greater London Authority Act 1999 already provides powers for London authorities, and the clauses provide equivalent powers for all other local traffic authorities in England and Wales. Schemes may be made by individual traffic authorities and joint schemes can be made between local traffic authorities, or between local traffic authorities outside London and London traffic authorities. That is intended to give all the possible flexibility that might be required to combat congestion problems through co-operation between authorities.
<P>
Clauses 155 and 156 make a direct link between licensing schemes and the objectives in authorities' local transport plans. Any licensing scheme must be an integral and coherent part of an authority's overall integrated local transport strategy and help to tackle traffic congestion. If it fails to do so, it will not be approved, which is the clear answer to those who say that the provision is only about revenue raising. Schemes must directly or indirectly help to meet the policies in an authority's local transport plan. That gives an authority the flexibility, for example, to fund complementary measures outside its immediate area. That germane point was made today and last week by hon. Members who spoke about the impact of the measures on their rural areas.
<P>
Clause 158 defines ``workplace parking'' as when places are occupied at premises by vehicles used by employees, agents, suppliers, business customers or business visitors for attending their places of work. I stress places of work, not places of recreation, as there was a confused passage earlier when football clubs were rather inaccurately prayed in aid. The definition will also encompass pupils parking at their schools or colleges and we make no apology for that. Large numbers of students attend high school by car in north America, and we should deter such means of transport where good public transport alternatives are available.
<P>
Workplace parking also covers parking by the person who provides the parking and situations when the provider has entered into arrangements to provide parking nearby. Clause 158 also includes a power to make regulations to vary the detailed definition of ``workplace parking''. It provides the flexibility to amend the definition if any unforeseen omissions emerge in the future.
<P>
Clauses 159 to 161 concern licensing schemes, which will be made, varied or revoked by the use of an order. There may be joint orders between authorities in appropriate cases. The Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales will confirm or modify the orders. When a London charging authority is part of a joint scheme with a non-London authority, the order will need to be confirmed by both the Greater London Authority and the Secretary of State. It will not be confirmed until both are content.
<P>
Licensing authorities will have to consult interested parties when they make an order that makes or varies a licensing scheme. They can also hold public inquiries when they feel that that is necessary. However, clause 146 provides an additional safeguard by allowing the Secretary of State, the National Assembly for Wales or the Greater London Authority to require further consultation or a public inquiry. That would safeguard the interests of the public and businesses if it were felt that there was not full and proper consultation at local level.
<P>
I turn now to specific issues that were raised during our debate. The hon. Member for North Essex started his speech with his usual references to a stealth tax. That phrase may come back to haunt him. When it does, I shall ask him to hold his horses for a moment. It is some stealth for us to be introducing a charge that we trailed last year during the passage of the Greater London Authority Bill, which is already on the statute book and has been the subject of intensive discussion in the publication ``Breaking the Logjam'' and the consultation on it. The hon. Gentleman cited a curious example and claimed that Ministers would be exempt from the charges. He referred to a visit to Downing street to make that point. He failed to notice the fact that, when we debated the Greater London Authority Bill, the Government made it absolutely clear that Departments would be covered by the charge and that they would not be exempt from it. Similarly, workplace parking here at the Palace of Westminster will not be exempt. There is no question of exemptions for Departments or Members of Parliament.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's claim that my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras is opposed to the Government's policy is also wrong. My right hon. Friend expressed a view for which there is great support. In fact, it was said frequently last week in Committee that the introduction of a congestion-charging scheme in London would be a highly complex operation, far better handled with the use of electronic equipment than with a paper-based scheme. My right hon. Friend is essentially reflecting the fact that, during the first term as mayor, it would not be practical to introduce a more sophisticated scheme that required the installation of appropriate technology which is not yet fully available.
<P>
The claim of the hon. Member for North Essex that a workplace parking charge will have no effect on congestion is wide of the mark, as the figures that I quoted in relation to the ROCOL study demonstrated. He was on even more shaky ground when he explored the subject of football clubs. Let me make it clear, so that there is no confusion, that the workplace parking charge would, if it covered a football stadium, cover parking provisions for the employees of the club, including the professional players who used their cars to take them to the stadium to play. It would not, however, cover a supporter or individual who wanted to watch the football match. Members of an amateur club playing at premises or stadiums would not be subject to a charge. There should be no more scaremongering about the potential impact on football supporters.

<P>

<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that the hon. Member for North Essex came out with this cock-and-bull story about football club spectators having to pay this charge when he visited the Aston Villa ground a fortnight ago, proving that he had not read the Bill then and, by repeating it this morning, proving that he has not read the Bill now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a very good point and I trust that the hon. Member for North Essex will now write to Aston Villa to put the record straight—if he did in fact make those observations when he visited that club. He may be a bit embarrassed to send a copy of Hansard. As my hon. Friend rightly pointed out, the yield from the charge would not be sufficient to buy Aston Villa a striker as he implied, although it might possibly buy Chippenham Town a striker in a different—
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Surely the hon. Gentleman realised that only last year Swindon Town bought a striker from Chippenham Town for an enormous amount of money. The way in which he belittles my home town's football club does him no credit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the Member of Parliament who represents the constituency where Charlton play, I have no particular reason to say kind things about Swindon, who brought an end to the glorious winning streak that Charlton was enjoying, but Charlton still remain far and away at the top of the first division.
<P>
I will rapidly come back to the case in point. The speech of the hon. Member for North Essex bore little relationship to the amendment, which is not about the principle of the scheme, exemptions, or the impact on shift workers or charities, but about giving councils the power to levy charges on individual users as well as on the owner of premises. That is the purpose of the Opposition's amendment.
<P>
The hon. Gentlemen is in the curious position of claiming that he is wholly opposed to the charge, but actually speaking in support of an amendment that extends it into two charges. There will be not one charge, but two—a licensing scheme applying to the owner of the premises and a payment scheme applying to the individuals. If I may, I shall refer to the predecessor of the hon. Member for Bath: a certain Conservative referred to a double whammy and that is what the hon. Member for North Essex proposes—not one stealth tax, but two stealth taxes. So much for the humbug that we have had from the Opposition Benches.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole focused on specific points. He was wise to avoid the more general flights of rhetoric in which his hon. Friend the Member for North Essex indulged. He talked about thresholds and asked a perfectly reasonable question: what is the threshold below which no charge would be levied? In the response to the consultation on ``Breaking the Logjam'', we made the point that we believe there should be some framework for a threshold but we have not yet decided on whether there should be a specific figure. We say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We anticipate that some authorities may also come forward with proposals for schemes with relatively high exemption thresholds. We would not rule this approach out, but would want to be assured that J this was the most effective way of targeting local congestion.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The matter is under review and we will look further into it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole asked specifically about variations to the scheme and whether it could apply in a discriminatory way towards individual businesses. There is scope to apply the scheme in a differential way at different times. It would not necessarily apply on a weekend. It could equally apply to different parts of a licensing area. There could be a high scale of charges in a very congested central area and a lesser scale of charges in an outer area. We would not approve any scheme that had a discriminatory impact on different types of business. That would be clearly improper.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about spot checks. There must be provision for checks against evasion, because dishonest evasion of the tax would be a criminal offence. It is not our intention to penalise companies where an inadvertent excess occurs on one particular day. Emphasis has been put on the appeal procedures to ensure that, where there is a dispute, the company concerned can seek redress.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath supported our proposals I am grateful for his support and I agree entirely that the detail needs much further discussion. He opposed the amendment for sound reasons, and I agree with him on that; I will return to that point.
<P>
The provisions of workplace charging were supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central, who made the valid point that the money would be hypothecated for local transport improvement. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire once again reaffirmed his role as a lance corporal rather than a philosopher king. It reminded me of the philosopher Bertrand Russell, who once wrote a book entitled—
