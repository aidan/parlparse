							<b class="B">Sir
John Butterfill</b> (Bournemouth, West) (Con): First, may I
say what a great pleasure it is to serve under your wise chairmanship,
Mr. Taylor? We are looking forward to an interesting debate.
Secondly, I wish to express my personal thanks for the co-operation
that we received in the drafting and, indeed, extensive redrafting of
the Bill from Treasury officials, who have been most helpful
throughout. I thank also those lawyers representing the Building
Societies Association, and Mutuo. Without their combined effort, we
would not be where we are
today.</div>
					<a name="07042559000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I first
presented the Bill, I little appreciated how legally complex it was
likely to be given the large number of interactive former measures that
it will affect. At the moment, we have a slight problem in that one
particular group of mutuals&#151;the mutual insurance
companies&#151;is effectively excluded from the provisions of the
Bill. However, I am hopeful that we may find a way to overcome that
problem in the future. Everyone concerned has made a splendid effort
and I am very grateful to all of them for their
help.</div>
					
					<a name="07042559000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042559000139"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):
						</b> It is a
pleasure to serve once again under your chairmanship, Mr.
Taylor, although for the first time in a Committee of this nature. I
also thank Treasury officials, the staff and experts from Mutuo and the
Building Societies Association, and particularly the hon. Member for
Bournemouth, West, whose leadership and determination to see such
important reforms through to the statute book have been demonstrated in
recent months.</div>
					<a name="07042559000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had
a full and substantial debate on Second Reading when we aired the wider
issues surrounding 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>the important role that the mutuals sector plays in our economy and the
reason why such flexibilities are needed in order to allow building
societies and wider mutuals to operate on a level playing field. I
repeat what I said on Second Reading in paying particular tribute to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s work. The Government support the principles
that underpin the Bill, and we will endeavour to do everything that we
can to see it through to the statute
book.</div>
					<a name="07042559000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
deviation from the principles that underpin the Bill, but since Second
Reading, extensive and detailed discussions have taken place to ensure
that it can be made operational and effective, given the corporate
company and wider European legislative framework in which it is
necessary for the clauses to operate when they become law. The Bill
introduces amendments to building societies legislation on the
wholesale funding limit and the position of members in the event of an
insolvency. It also updates other mutuals&#146; legislation to
transfer the ownership of a different type of mutual society as a
subsidiary company. As I have said, taken together the measures will
strengthen the competitive position of mutuals and benefit their
members.</div>
					<a name="07042559000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 1
amends section 7 of the Building Societies Act 1986 to give the
Treasury the power to increase the limit to the proportion of funds
that may be raised from sources other than individuals&#146; shares.
As I said on Second Reading, that power should reside with the Treasury
and would be operated with full consultation with the Financial
Services
Authority.</div>
					<a name="07042559000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
societies must raise at least half their funds from shares held by
their individual members. The remainder can be raised from other
sources&#151;generally wholesale funding. The power will allow the
Treasury to increase the external funding limit up to 75 per
cent. However, the Treasury will be able to use that power only if it
also makes an order under new clause 2, which I will come to in a
moment. The new power will be subject to affirmative
resolution.</div>
					<a name="07042559000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
1 also amends section 5 of the Building Societies Act 1986, which
defines the &#147;principal purpose&#148; of a building society to
be making loans secured on residential property which are funded
substantially by its members. The new clause gives the Treasury a power
to amend that principal purpose requirement to reduce the extent to
which loans are required to be funded by the society&#146;s members.
That is to bring the requirement in line with changes to the
funding limit. Again, that power is subject to affirmative resolution.
Government amendments Nos. 7 and 8 make appropriate changes to
the long
title.</div>
					<a name="07042559000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Increasing the
funding limit will increase the amount of &#147;wholesale&#148;
funding that societies may use, giving access to cheaper funding and
creating a more level playing field with banks. That change was
recommended by the 2004 Miles review of the UK mortgage market. The
figure of 75 per cent. leaves a significant element of member
funding.</div>
					<a name="07042559000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
Second Reading, the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West made it clear
that he was in favour of using the negative resolution procedure for
the various orders that will be necessary to implement the Bill. We
have considered that point carefully during the drafting of amendments,
and I have discussed the matter with him 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>personally. We believe that all the main implementing orders for the
Bill should be made under the affirmative resolution procedure, in line
with the usual procedure for Henry VIII powers.</div>
					<a name="07042559000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers conferred by the
Bill allow the Treasury to make significant amendments to the primary
legislation governing building societies and other mutual societies.
Having considered those matters carefully, we believe that Parliament
should have the opportunity to debate the changes in the light of
consultation on the detail of the
policy.</div>
					
					<a name="07042559000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042559000140"></a>
								Sir
John Butterfill:
						</b> I am happy with the new clause with one
possible exception: the affirmative resolution procedure. The way in
which building societies and others will be affected is sufficiently
well established by the Bill that it will not necessarily require the
affirmative procedure, which will delay the implementation of various
parts of the Bill and involve much greater parliamentary work. I do not
think that the provisions deal with matters that necessarily require
the further scrutiny that one would normally ascribe to the affirmative
procedure. Nevertheless, it has been very encouraging that any
differences between us have been on a procedural matter rather than on
the principles behind the Bill. Those on both sides of the House, and
indeed all parties in the House, feel that we should try to get the
Bill on to the statute book and implemented as soon as possible. The
amendments are self-explanatory and sensible. I have no difficulties at
all with the new clause.</div>
					
					<a name="07042559000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07042559000141"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Vincent Cable</b> (Twickenham) (LD): I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Taylor. I apologise to the hon. Member for
Bournemouth, West for not being present when he introduced his Bill,
which I strongly support. It seems to be a very important piece of
work. It has been endorsed by the relevant bodies, particularly the
Building Societies Association. I wish it well, and again apologise for
not having been here to make the more general points about
it.</div>
					<a name="07042559000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Government amendments are fully in sympathy with the Bill, they are
very substantial, and I should like to raise one broad question: how
important and pressing are the funding limitations? That is an
important question, because it determines whether we need to make
explicit the raising of the limit from 50 to 75 per cent., or to make
it open-ended, and whether the legislative provisions need to be rapid,
easy or more leisurely.</div>
					<a name="07042559000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I got two different
interpretations or answers from my background reading on the Bill. On
the one hand, Northern Rock gave evidence to the all-party group and
argued that its ability to transcend the funding limitations by
demutualisation had been a critical factor in its success as a
commercial organisation. It had been able to grow rapidly and therefore
to cut the spread between its borrowing and lending rates, which were
originally the key attractions for mutuals because they do not have to
pay dividends. Northern Rock made the point that the funding
limitations had been a crucial part of its thinking about the business
model that it adopted.</div>
					<a name="07042559000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On the other
hand, as I understand the evidence, few if any mutuals&#151;we are
talking primarily about building societies&#151;have taken advantage
of the 50 per cent. that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>they are currently allowed. Why have they not done so if it is a binding
constraint? I raise that question for the reasons that I mentioned; the
answer determines precisely how urgent the process needs to
be.</div>
					<a name="07042559000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I also wish
to refer to the procedure set out in the Treasury&#146;s new clauses,
which make it clear that the Treasury rather than the FSA will be the
point of determination. Perhaps the Minister will spell out the
reasoning behind that decision. As someone who has dealt with both
bodies, I can understand that it is probably a sensible decision in
this context. I have never found the FSA to be sympathetic to the
problems of mutuals. I dealt with the FSA extensively on insurance
matters, and it clearly regarded mutuals as an irritating detour from
their preoccupations with the City&#151;it was not interested in the
idiosyncrasies of the mutual movement. Perhaps that is the reason why
the approach has been taken, and the Treasury is too polite it out.
There might be some value, however, in the Minister explaining briefly
why Treasury rather than the FSA should be the locus of decision
making.</div>
					<a name="07042559000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
conclusion, I shall reiterate what I said at the beginning of my
remarks: as someone who was involved in the campaign to stop the
collapse of the building society movement through demutualisation in
the late 1990s, I think that the arrest of the slide is valuable.
Positive initiatives are now being taken to strengthen the legislative
basis of mutuality, and I welcome the Bill as an important component of
that process.</div>
					
					<a name="07042559000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042559000142"></a>
								Sir
John Butterfill:
						</b> Perhaps I can deal with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s first point and the Minister can deal with the
second. It is my understanding that the hon. Member for Twickenham is
correct in saying that most building societies are managing adequately
within the existing limits. However, there is a considerable degree of
sentiment that says that that will not remain the case for much longer.
This is a fast-moving area and the competition is becoming ever more
threatening towards building societies, so they will need to move quite
quickly. If the situation developed, building societies would look to
the Government to introduce a Bill of this nature, which might take
quite a long time given the heavy timetable to which the Government are
always subject. This Bill gives us the opportunity to deal with the
situation now, in anticipation of those
needs.</div>
					
					<a name="07042559000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07042559000143"></a>
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Nicholas Winterton</b> (Macclesfield) (Con): I say to my hon.
Friend that I fully support the brief argument that he has just
advanced in response to the hon. Member for Twickenham, who speaks with
distinction for the Liberal Democrats. As a sponsor of the Bill, I have
made some inquiries in my constituency. A major mutual, the Cheshire
building society&#151;and a good society it is&#151;is based in
Macclesfield and a smaller building society, the Vernon, operates in my
constituency, although it is based in the Stockport constituency. They
are supportive of the Bill, because they see it as a moat or defence
for the long term. I believe that the Bill&#146;s objectives are
thoroughly
desirable.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07042559000115"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div>
					<a name="07042559000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that I
understand the Treasury&#146;s intention in tabling the amendments
and the new clause, and I am prepared to go along with it, because this
is one way of getting the legislation on the statute book and, as my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>hon. Friend said, that needs to be done soon. Perhaps the Treasury is
being a little bit over-careful, but the amendments do not detract from
the Bill. Like my hon. Friend, who has worked so hard to advance the
Bill, I am happy to accept the Treasury&#146;s amendments and the new
clause.</div>
					
					<a name="07042559000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07042559000144"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): Over-caution on the
part of the Treasury is always to be welcomed, since we so rarely see
it manifested. Like my hon. Friend, I welcome the Bill and am happy
with the amendments.</div>
					<a name="07042559000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
just wish to say that the Skipton Building Society in my constituency
is one of the big ones and is hugely important. It is the biggest
employer in Craven. Practically no voluntary activity in Craven gets
under way without the support of the building society, and schools that
bid for specialist status do so with its support. In terms of voluntary
society and corporate responsibility, it is difficult to find another
example of so many depending on one institution. Preserving its status
and enabling it to continue to be able to do the things that it does in
the community is crucial. That is the basis of my support for the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042559000145"></a>
								Ed
Balls:
						</b> I entirely agree with the comments of the hon.
Member for Bournemouth, West, who replied to the first of the two
questions asked by the hon. Member for Twickenham. When we debated this
matter in detail on Second Reading, I said that I was pleased that my
party had achieved cross-party support. By saying
&#147;cross-party&#148; I meant not simply the Labour party and the
Co-operative party, but support among Opposition Members as
well.</div>
					<a name="07042559000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The speeches
that we have heard from the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon and
the hon. Member for Macclesfield, supporting the Bill and the values
and principles that underpin the role that mutuals play in our society,
are welcome and important in respect of constituencies throughout the
country. Mutuals and building societies are playing the role that the
right hon. Gentleman has just mentioned, and if we can take action to
help them do so, either through direct Government legislation or by
backing such a Bill as this, it is right and proper that we do
so.</div>
					<a name="07042559000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
apologise to hon. Members if they feel that the Treasury has been
over-cautious in its desire to ensure full and proper parliamentary
scrutiny and accountability, but I say to the right hon. Gentleman that
this is the way that the modern Treasury seeks to proceed, and it will
continue to do so whenever
possible.</div>

								Sir
Nicholas Winterton:
						</b> My right hon. Friend the Member for
Skipton and Ripon made an excellent case for the work that mutual
building societies do in the community. They are hugely involved. To
assist the Economic Secretary, his colleague the hon. Member for
Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) is fortunate to have the
Britannia Building Society in her constituency, on the borders of my
constituency, as it is a huge employer that is massively involved in
the community, not only in north Staffordshire but in Cheshire as well.
We need to praise the role of the mutual building societies, which do a
lot of wonderful work, much of which is
unsung.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042559000147"></a>
								Ed
Balls:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we must do
more to promote the role that mutuals play. On the example that he gave
of Britannia&#146;s important role in taking over Bristol and West,
it is taking forward remutualisation in the building society sector. As
I said on Second Reading, it is a matter of pride for the Treasury and
for mutuals and co-operatives throughout the country that the
substantial majority of child trust funds&#151;a Government
innovation with cross-party, or rather imperfect cross-party
support&#151;are being provided by mutuals and friendly societies.
That is an example of the mutuals sector not simply resting on its
values and history, but providing leadership in a new development,
which is being followed by countries around the
world.</div>
					<a name="07042559000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
I said, the hon. Member for Twickenham asked two questions. It is good
to see a member of his party in Committee, given the unfortunate
absence of the Liberal Democrats on Second Reading, to cement fully the
broader cross-party support that we want for the Bill. The hon. Member
for Bournemouth, West set out fully the reason for taking the power to
raise the funding limit, which has been pressed for and supported
widely by the industry. Over the next year or so, we hope to consult in
detail with the FSA and the societies to ensure that we get the precise
number and details correct when we introduce the order, for which the

						The
second question raised by the hon. Member for Twickenham was discussed
extensively, in fact, on Second Reading. Indeed, following a wide range
of very supportive speeches from both sides of the House, my hon.
Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch asked me in an
intervention why the Treasury, not the FSA, was taking the power in the
amendments. I explained that, having consulted the hon. Member for
Bournemouth, West and the FSA, we took the view that, although the
latter is the regulator of individual institutions, the responsibility
for setting the overall framework in which that regulation occurs is a
matter for the House and the Government.</div>
					<a name="07042559000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Accountability
for getting that legislation correct lies with the House. We therefore
took the view that the Treasury in the House should propose the
framework and take the powers and that scrutiny should occur in the
House. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and
Shoreditch and the hon. Member for Twickenham that that is being done
in full consultation with the FSA, and with its agreement. I hope that
that will not present difficulties in the Committee
today.</div>

Balls:
						</b> New clause 2 will give the Treasury the power to
amend the Building Societies Act 1986 to ensure that, in the event of a
building society insolvency, any assets available are distributed
equally between creditors and members. That will change the current
position, in which creditors have priority over members. The power may
also be used to make transitional provisions to cover, for example,
debts entered into before the changes take effect. The power will be
exercised under the affirmative procedure&#151;again, for the reasons
that I outlined when I introduced clause 1 to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07042559000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
current position puts members at a disadvantage. In the event of
insolvency, they are entitled to their deposits in savings accounts
only when all creditors have been paid in full. That contrasts with
bank customers, who, because they are creditors of the bank, rank
equally with other creditors. The power to exclude categories of
special liabilities will enable the Treasury to deal with them
individually, which it was not practical to do in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07042559000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that
transitional provisions ensure that the rights of creditors in respect
of debts entered into before the commencement of the order are
unaffected by the change. The power is also exercisable under the
affirmative procedure. As the use of the power would be a significant
change to insolvency law, as applied to building societies, the views
of the Insolvency Service and others will be sought before exercising
the
power.</div>

an insolvency that small retail depositors who are unsophisticated in
financial matters should be subordinated to the wholesale capital

						</b> I pay particular tribute to the hon. Member for
Bournemouth, West, not simply because of his leadership on matters of
mutual policy, but because of his wide experience in the House,
including as an excellent Chairman of the Standing Committee that
considered the Finance Bill last year. His knowledge of procedure is
second to none, and the fact that he ensured that we voted correctly
was appreciated by hon. Members on both sides of the House, myself
included.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>
					<a name="07042559000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3 will give the Treasury the
power to modify legislation relating to the transfer of the business of
building societies, friendly societies and industrial and provident
societies, to make those transfers easier. The modifications will apply
where the transfer is from one mutual society to a company that is a
subsidiary of another mutual society. The Treasury may also use the
power to ensure that members of the transferring mutual society, and
new customers after the transfer, are given certain membership rights
in the owning mutual society.</div>
					<a name="07042559000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Treasury
may also make other changes that relate to the transfer&#151;for
example, to prevent a change in ownership of the new subsidiary company
for a specified period. Where the power is used to modify primary
legislation, or to modify the rules on subsidiaries, it will be subject
to the affirmative procedure. But it may also be used to modify
secondary legislation&#151;for example, transfer regulations made
under section 102 of the Building Societies Act 1986&#151;in which
case the negative procedure will apply.</div>
					<a name="07042559000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">These amendments are intended
to lighten the burden on financial mutual societies where they transfer
ownership from one type of mutual to another. The wider opportunities
for a more diverse range of ownership in the sector will help it to
compete both internally and in the wider financial sector. The Treasury
will also consult on the appropriate means of restricting further
transfers of ownership outside the mutual sector, so that the procedure
does not become a back-door means of demutualisation. That is likely to
be achieved by placing a time bar on future transfers of
ownership.</div>

							<a name="07042559000153"></a>Sir
John Butterfill:
						</b> Again, I very much support the clause. It
goes to the heart of the Bill. It has been anomalous that mutual
financial organisations can merge with one another only by one of them
first losing its mutuality, which rather defeats the whole object of
mutuality. It is a key part of the Bill that these arrangements will
enable those transfers to take place, without the loss of the important
principle of mutuality.</div>
					<a name="07042559000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I indicated earlier, there
is one area where I am disappointed and that is the position of mutual
insurers. I understand that their omission is due to possible concerns
about European Union law relating to companies. I think that only seven
companies are affected by that, and it may yet be possible, with the
wit and ingenuity that is available to us, to table a further amendment
on Report, so that they could be included. If that were possible, I
would welcome it, but I do not want to hold up the progress of the Bill
in its entirety on that
issue.</div>

								Ed
Balls:
						</b> Just to reply to the point made by the hon.
Gentleman, we have considered carefully whether mutual insurers could
be included in this part of the Bill. As I explained on Second Reading,
this is an area that has raised more substantial difficulties for us
than other aspects of the original proposed legislation. Mutual
insurers are difficult to define as a category. Many of them are
friendly societies, which are already covered by the Bill; others are
governed by private Acts of Parliament, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>and so could not be covered in a public Bill. Changes in that regard
would have to be made in those private Acts under the private Bills
procedure. The remaining mutual insurers are companies limited by
guarantee. We have considered whether the Bill could be extended to
companies limited by guarantee that are also insurers. However, as
insurance is regulated on a Europe-wide basis, we would have to allow
the same procedures to apply whether transfer is through a subsidiary
of a body corporate in another member state, which is similar to a
company limited by guarantee.</div>
					<a name="07042559000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The work that
we have done in consultation with the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West
and his advisers has continued to throw up a range of problems. For
example, it would be difficult to specify in UK legislation what rights
members of the transferring mutual society should enjoy in the holding
company established in another member state. That is one example of a
range of difficult definition issues that we have not been able to
solve. So far, that has meant that we have been unable to come forward
with proposals in new clause 3 covering mutual
insurers.</div>
					<a name="07042559000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However,
I take on board the hon. Gentleman&#146;s plea that we should keep
trying. I am happy to go back today and take a further look at these
matters, and to see what more can be done. I will write to members of
the Committee in a day or two to inform them whether we can continue
those discussions. If it were possible to come back with an amendment
in Report, we would do so, although I fear that simply to investigate
the matter further and see whether that was possible would take some
days. I do not know whether the timetable will give us the space to do
so, but we have no principled reason for excluding mutual insurers. If
we could table an amendment on Report, we would. We would need some
time to do the work to see whether that was possible.</div>
					<a name="07042559000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall keep in touch with
Committee members, but if we are unable to make progress, we will
continue to need to discuss the issue beyond the life of this Committee
and this Bill. It is not off the table; if we can make progress, we
will. It will take some days to look at the matter, but I do not rule
out an amendment on Report.</div>

Member for Bournemouth, West on introducing the Bill and on the huge
amount of work that he and his advisers have put in? At the same time,
may I pay tribute to the Treasury and the Government for accepting the
merits of the Bill? My hon. Friend might have been the fuse that
activated the Government to produce this legislation, which is long
overdue and very beneficial to the mutual movement. I have discussed
the matter with him and I am truly amazed at the amount of work that he
has put in. I also thank the Treasury for the way in which it has
co-operated with him in putting the basis of good legislation on the
statute
book.</div>

Balls:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Taylor. From the Government Benches, may I echo the comments of the
hon. Member for Macclesfield? In essence, the legislation, which we
will report to the House following today&#146;s debate, takes forward
the original proposals of the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West, and it
follows a great deal of detailed consultation and discussion. We are
very grateful to the hon. Gentleman and his advisers, Mutuo and the
Co-operative party, and to the Treasury and Financial Services
Authority advisers who have worked with us to translate the principles,
concepts and intention into legislation that we will take forward if
the House supports it on Report and Third Reading, and through the work
of subsequent Committees and secondary legislation. We are very
grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s work and leadership.</div>
					<a name="07042559000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In reply to
the hon. Member for Macclesfield, let me say that we are currently
undertaking a broad-based review of the legislation in this field.
There are necessarily limits to the amount of parliamentary time that
the Government can make available in these areas. Where we have had
time, we have used it, but we rely on the ability of private Members to
make proposals, when they have the opportunity to do so, that we can
support. There have been a number of private Members&#146; Bills in
recent years that have substantially improved the legislative
environment for mutuals and co-operatives in our country. This Bill is
in that tradition, and the Government have not been brought reluctantly
to the table. On the contrary, this is an established way of
legislating and one that we fully support and encourage. However,
success depends on the leadership and hard work of Members of this
House. We are very grateful indeed to the hon. Member for Bournemouth,
West for the leadership he has shown, which has enabled us to take
forward a substantial improvement in the legislative framework for
mutuals across our country.</div>

John Butterfill:
						</b> Further to that point of order,
Mr. Taylor. I wish to reiterate my gratitude for all the
co-operation received from members of the industry, the Building
Societies Association and friendly societies. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>I am especially grateful to the Treasury, which has, as the Minister
said, done a great deal of work and research on the matter before us,
and really put itself out to deal with it expeditiously. It did not
have a great deal of time in which to produce such complex legislation,
and I am very grateful to it, as I am to the Committee members who have
turned out to support me. Indeed, I am grateful to all the parties in
the House for supporting the Bill. It is rare that one gets every party
in the House supporting a Bill, and I am very grateful to them for it.
It pleases not only me, but the Portman building society in my
constituency, which is one of our largest employers, and the Liverpool
Victoria friendly society, which is the largest friendly society in my
constituency. Both are exemplars of involvement in the community and
support for community organisations, including at least two charities
with which I am personally involved. I am very grateful to
them.</div>
