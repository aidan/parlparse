						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000422"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr.
Illsley, as we continue our deliberations into the final
straight.</div>
					<a name="08020546000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments tabled in my name are fairly straightforward. We touched on
whether the affordable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column636" />Column number: 636</div>proportion of housing developments should be subject to community
infrastructure levy in earlier debates. This is a related but separate
matter.</div>
					<a name="08020546000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Gains have
been made in affordable housing and in local
authorities strengthening their arm in negotiations with developers;
they are getting better at it and securing more affordable housing as
part of delivery. We do not want to see a conflict between CIL and the
affordable housing element of a scheme, in terms of what the developer
can afford to fund.</div>
					<a name="08020546000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is such a conflict, the amendment seeks to ensure that the
affordable housing element is handled first, so that as much affordable
housing is delivered as possible, and the CIL element is considered
after that. I hope that the Minister will support that principle. He
might tell me that that is fine, and that as far as he is concerned the
Bill will do that anyway, but I will be interested to hear his
justification for that.</div>
					<a name="08020546000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is therefore
aimed at securing that progress towards achieving the affordable
housing rate that we all want, to ensure that we at least begin to
tackle the country&#146;s affordable housing
crisis.</div>
					<a name="08020546000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000423"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (John Healey):
						</b> I
can pretty quickly give the hon. Gentleman the
assurance that he seeks. He might recall that, on Thursday, on the back
of a Government amendment, the Committee discussed the nature of
affordable
housing.</div>
					<a name="08020546000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ultimately,
one of the principal drivers of the levy is to create a way in which we
can support and unlock housing growth, rather than hold it back or
prevent it. That was the reason that, last Thursday, we introduced the
Government amendment that would allow infrastructure to have an
incorporated definition of affordable housing. However, I also made it
clear that the Government intend that affordable housing will continue
to be secured through agreements, rather than through the obligation
process and the levy. That is our preferred way of operating. Clearly,
it makes sense to have that back-stop, should we require it, if the
fears of some that affordable housing might be choked off or reduced as
a result of the levy are
realised.</div>
					<a name="08020546000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000424"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> May I briefly clarify one point? Obviously, we
are entering a period of negotiations as to how CIL will work and be
constituted, but it is not clear to me what powers are available to
individual local authorities in that regard. For example, perhaps years
in advance of a negotiation, local authorities might have set what CIL
means to them, including its level and the types of infrastructure that
it would fund. If they were at risk of not delivering through a
separate section 106 agreement, would they then able to revisit it, to
ensure the affordable housing element? If the benefit of CIL is that it
is clear to all developers in the local authority in advance what the
levy will be, how could they vary it in an individual circumstance if
the section 106 negotiations were not delivering the affordable housing
element?</div>
					<a name="08020546000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000425"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> If the hon. Gentleman and others have further
concerns about this matter, they would be properly dealt with when we
move from the primary legislation to the process of production and the
settling 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column637" />Column number: 637</div>of charging schedules. However, he has registered his concerns clearly
this morning and I have taken note of
them.</div>
					<a name="08020546000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08020546000426"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Jacqui Lait</b> (Beckenham) (Con): I apologise for
being slightly wrong-footed, but I was expecting
another group of amendments to be called before this one. My concerns
are very similar to those of the hon. Member for North Cornwall.
However, mine go a little further than just affordable housing. I am
concerned about ensuring that section 106 agreements can continue more
or less as they are, not just for affordable housing, but in other
areas because of the impact that the community infrastructure levy
could have on the willingness of developers to contribute to section
106
agreements.</div>
					<a name="08020546000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes,
a properly agreed and managed section 106 agreement
will be more effective for local communities than CIL. If there is a
real need for something in a local community, a section 106 agreement
might be more acceptable to that community than an infrastructure levy
that is used to develop infrastructure outside the community that is
not of immediate benefit to it. Amendment No. 610 would deal with
concerns of that nature. If the Minister could reassure us on those
points, I would be
grateful.</div>
					<a name="08020546000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000427"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I think that I can reassure the hon. Lady in two
areas. First, I will reflect on her further concerns about the
interaction between section 106 agreements and CIL. There is an
implicit flex in the intention of the amendment that would make the
levy reflect contributions to affordable housing. She will appreciate
that there is difficulty in that because it would take us back to one
of the principal criticisms of the planning gain
supplement, with its site-specific arguments and evaluations. To adjust
levy liability for individual developments to reflect the level of
affordable housing would take us into the territory of greater
uncertainty, lengthy negotiations and inevitable
disputes&#151;particularly under the terms of the
amendment&#151;over rates of return on investment and how to define
and establish such matters.</div>
					<a name="08020546000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I understand the hon.
Lady&#146;s concern that developers should not pay twice for
infrastructure, through section 106 agreements and through the levy.
Does that issue underpin her
concerns?</div>
					<a name="08020546000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000428"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> The impact could be that developers pay twice, but
my concern is about which method has primacy. If a local community
wants a health centre more than it wants the replacement of a road
junction, could it insist on the use of section 106 rather than CIL to
ensure that it gets the health
centre?</div>
					<a name="08020546000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000429"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I think that the hon. Lady will find the document
that we published nearly two weeks ago helpful on this matter,
particularly paragraphs 64 to 66. Essentially, we suggest that section
106 agreements are appropriate in three areas: on technical matters
such as restrictions on the use of land; on site-specific impacts,
which are prerequisites for planning permission; and on affordable
housing. Those are the matters to which section 106 agreements are best
suited.</div>
					<a name="08020546000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
610 would establish a boundary between section 106 agreements and the
levy by using 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column638" />Column number: 638</div>classes of infrastructure, whereby local planning
authorities could seek funding for certain types of infrastructure from
only one source: either from section 106 agreements or from the levy.
The associated amendment would give the Secretary of State the power to
provide guidance on how that might work.</div>
					<a name="08020546000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our
discussion paper, we specifically asked what approach should be taken
to that question, which I hope reassures the hon. Lady and members of
the Committee that we are working for the best solution. Through the
discussion document, I want to seek views and then formally consult.
Those are the two stages that I intend to go through on that. In fact,
the document floats an option that is stronger than guidance: a
statutory boundary between the two. That might not be the answer, but
it is one of the options that we have flagged up in the discussion
document, and that underlines the importance of the area.</div>
					<a name="08020546000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that I have tried to
explain how important that set of concerns is, how seriously we are
taking it and the work that we have got in train to sort out the best
solution, I hope that the hon. Members who tabled the amendments will
feel that they have been useful probing amendments and will not press
them to a
vote.</div>
					<a name="08020546000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08020546000430"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Clive Betts</b> (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab): I apologise
for not being here at the beginning of the debate. My hon. Friend the
Minister was just dealing with amendment No. 617, which stands in my
name. Certainly, the issue raised is in the minds of organisations such
as the British Property Federation. In a debate last week, I asked
whether a developer who paid for affordable housing on a particular
site under section 106&#151;negotiable with the local authority, as
all section 106 agreements are&#151;would be subject at the same time
to CIL, particularly if CIL was on a fairly rigid formula. That relates
to some of our discussions last week on how to measure CIL, and I
accept that there are still a lot of discussions and negotiations to be
had on whether it is a rigid formula.</div>
					<a name="08020546000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">A developer could come along
who wants to negotiate 106 but feels that, despite giving away more on
106, he will still end up paying the same amount of CIL. Alternatively,
will CIL, in practice, be more of a negotiation between the developer
and the local authority? Although I accept that it would reduce the
certainty that developers look for in some cases, it might also allow
precisely that bit of leeway for a developer to come along and ask,
&#147;Well, I would like a little more work on highways on site, but
will agreeing to that under 106 reduce the CIL I pay, or will CIL be
fixed in any case? Should I really give nothing away on 106 because I
will not get the benefit when CIL is calculated?&#148; Will the
Minister assure me that there is still room for negotiation between the
various parties that he and his officials are talking to before a final
scheme is
determined?</div>
					<a name="08020546000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000431"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I shall not go over all the points that I made
before my hon. Friend joined us, but the short answer is that there is
plenty of scope and a process for detailed further discussion. I remind
him, however, as we have said at several stages of our discussions,
that our principal intent is to set out the levy in a charging schedule
and, where possible, to avoid uncertainty, site-specific negotiation
and a lack of predictability 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column639" />Column number: 639</div>and openness about the process, as in the situation that he cited. In
such a situation, there could be disputes about the
right and realistic expectation of a developer&#146;s contribution on
a site-by-site basis. In relation to his concerns, I am anxious that we
are not dragged back to that sort of situation.</div>
					<a name="08020546000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, there is plenty of
discussion still to be had on how the proposal might work in practice,
but my hon. Friend generally underlines the case that I made to the
Committee last week for affordable housing principally being best
suited to 106 agreements and not to specification as an eligible type
of infrastructure that could be paid for under the levy. We made the
amendment last week as a back-stop. If the level of affordable housing
that the country badly needs, and that the Government badly want to
see, starts to dry up as a result of the proposal, we would have the
capacity in primary legislation to designate affordable housing as an
allowable form of infrastructure to be supported by the levy. That is
not our intention, however, as we believe that affordable housing is,
as now, best dealt with through section 106
agreements.</div>

							<a name="08020546000432"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe has
hit on the point that I was trying to make, although not very clearly
or eloquently, in my intervention on the Minister about the conflict
between a process of negotiation under 106 and something that is fixed
in advance. One of the benefits of CIL is that it is transparent.
Everyone will know what is expected of them before they bring their
development to the table. If a problem comes to light
in relation to the implementation of CIL, that will impact on
negotiations under 106.</div>
					<a name="08020546000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I am pleased to hear that
CIL can be revisited to take account of the amendment we discussed last
week, it would be too late for many developments that might already
have taken place. As I have mentioned previously, I have 70 parishes in
my constituency, and some are very small&#151;if
one development has happened, that will be it for the next 10 years.
That is the cause of my concern. I will not press the amendment to a
vote but further examination is needed so that we do not lock the
stable door after the horse has bolted and lose out on an opportunity
to get affordable housing in some areas. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div>

elicit information from the Minister. Clause 172 is commonsensical and
we do not have any problems with it, but the new clause relates to
planning contributions under the 2004 Act. Given that we are talking
about CIL and section 106, we would be grateful if the Minister could
advise us on the role of planning contributions under that Act. We
might have a third stream of contribution that could clobber
developers, particular in a market where land
properties and values are going down, and it would make it increasingly
difficult to get the developments that he is looking forward to

					<a name="08020546000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is no reflection on the
present Duke of Cornwall, for whom I have the utmost regard, but the
history of the Duchy is that at times it seeks to define itself in
terms of its constitutional role. People may not be familiar with the
constitutional peculiarities of the Duchy of Cornwall. Various
provisions apply to the foreshore, mineral rights and so on, and if one
dies intestate in Cornwall the estate goes not to the Crown but to the
Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy has a constitutional significance that it
has defended through the
courts.</div>

has a constitutional position that at times it seeks to emphasise and
at other times it seeks not to do so and defines itself as a private
estate. It cannot have it both ways. If it is a private estate, and I
would say that it is because it exists to supply an income for the heir
to the throne, why is it exempt from provisions to which other citizens
must have regard?</div>

understand the argument for the Crown&#146;s position in respect of
Government land used, for example, by the Ministry of Defence, but I
struggle to see why Duchy of Cornwall farms should be treated any
differently from other farms, such as county council-tenanted farms. I
hastily backtrack and say that the amendment implies no criticism of
the current incumbent; it seeks to discover how the Government view the
Duchy of Cornwall and why it is included with other Crown land, which
is more understandable in this context. What is the Government&#146;s

Gentleman of tabling a republican amendment, but clause 173, which we
skipped over, applies the Bill specifically to the Crown, including the
Duchy. He raised concerns about the Duchy of Cornwall receiving special
treatment under the Bill, but the clause is consistent with the
commitment to remove Crown immunity on planning matters implemented by
the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, which amended section
293 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The definition of Crown
land, which included land belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall, was
unchanged. It is consistent with other legislation that applies to the
Crown, as all Crown interests are treated the same. It would be
improper to treat one interest&#151;in this case, the Duchy
of Cornwall&#151; differently from another, as he
suggested we do.</div>
					<a name="08020546000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The drafting

difficult to start unpicking it in any Bill, including this
one.</div>
					<a name="08020546000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, the
Bill applies to the Crown, but whereas in part 8 enforcement would
refer to an appellant, in this case it would refer to an individual who
is appointed by the heirs to the Crown. It is still relevant but at the
same time it has to be written in a way that observes our constitution.
The Crown, as Head of State, cannot enforce measures on the Crown,
which is why the provisions are so drafted. I hope that that helps the
hon. Gentleman and that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman wishes to amend the clause to
ensure that any person on whom a notice is served will receive it in at
least three different ways. That would be excessive and rather
inflexible, and we are trying to introduce a quicker and more flexible
system. However, I do not disagree that it is important that a notice
is received by the person on whom it is served and the clause has been
constructed to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility for the
person serving the notice to choose the best way of doing so. For
instance, a person may be domiciled abroad, but have an interest in a
particular parcel of land. That would make hand delivery difficult and
expensive. In such situations, it would not be inconceivable that a
person would prefer to receive information via e-mail, as he suggests.
Requiring a person to serve a notice multiple times would, therefore,
make it extremely difficult for such people to comply with the
legislative requirement, if, for example, it was difficult to deliver
it by hand. That is not to mention the excessive related
costs.</div>

Lait:
						</b> As one of only two Scottish voices on the Committee,
I would like to discuss clause 183 and, with your permission,
Mr. Illsley, clause 187. If I read the Bill correctly, both
clauses refer to powers being handed to Scotland. If we discuss both
clauses now, we will not have to reiterate the arguments when we get to
clause 187. The clause is entitled &#147;Application of Act to
Scotland&#148;. Clause 187 is entitled &#147;Extent&#148;, and
lists those provisions that apply to England and Wales and those that
apply to Scotland, in a number of areas.</div>
					<a name="08020546000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Scotland has
devolved power over planning issues, but the UK retains its power over
issues such as energy policy. The clause refers to various parts of the
Bill under which there are modifications for Scotland. It omits
provisions relating to various development consent orders, in
particular paragraphs (e) and (f) of clause 105(4), which relate to
electricity generation. The question is whether that affects merely the
planning implications of the development consent orders or whether it
will allow the Scottish Parliament to take authority over the provision
and, hence, the policy. By allowing the clauses to pass, will we allow
the Scottish Parliament to take power over the policy for the provision
of energy, as opposed to the
planning?</div>
					<a name="08020546000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Government and the previous coalition
that ran the Scottish Parliament have all set their faces against
rebuilding nuclear power stations on the sites in Scotland where there
is already planning consent. Scotland has historically been a net
exporter of power to England. If those three nuclear power stations are
not rebuilt, England and Wales will start being a net exporter of power
to Scotland. That would be a shift in policy. Has this UK Parliament
agreed that there should be such a shift or are we, under the Bill,

clause 187 is correct&#151;as I have always said, I am no
lawyer&#151;it leaves only pipelines as an issue that is across
Scottish and English borders. We understand the need for that
provision, but in essence, are we not potentially handing control over
pipelines for gas, electricity and water to Scotland? Are we
inadvertently doing that by agreeing to these clauses? If the Minister
can reassure me that we are not and that we do not have any
constitutional arguments over this matter, I will be quite happy not to
press my concerns further. If I am left with any concern about the
quiet handing over to Scotland of control of UK policy, I will
certainly return to the issue on another

cross-border oil and gas country pipelines, certain modifications must
be made to particular provisions to ensure that they give the proper

							<a name="08020546000462"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> Government amendments Nos. 614, 615, 611 and new
clause 29 make a change to the requirements for the making by local
planning authorities of local development orders. An LDO grants
planning permission for the type of development which it specifies. It
can apply to a specific site, an area or across the whole of a local
authority area. It thereby removes the need to make an application for
planning permission, in almost the opposite way to the article 4
direction that we discussed under part
9.</div>
					<a name="08020546000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Town and
Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 sets the
national baseline for permitted development. The Government have made
clear their desire to extend the scope of permitted development
generally. However, alongside this aim, Ministers also want to make it
easier for permitted development rights to be amended at the local
level to reflect local circumstances, either extending them through the
use of an LDO or restricting them by the making of an article 4
direction.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column647" />Column number: 647</div>
					<a name="08020546000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power to make an LDO came
into force on 10 May 2006 and as yet no LDOs have been made. There
may be a number of reasons for this, including the
national reviews of householder permitted development that we have
already carried out. However, we believe that other changes can be made
that might help streamline the process of making an LDO. One change is
to remove the requirement for the Secretary of State&#146;s approval
before the LDO is made. That mirrors what we also propose for article 4
directions, and we intend to amend secondary legislation to achieve
that.</div>
					<a name="08020546000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
change relates to the current restriction whereby a local planning
authority can only make an LDO to implement a policy
contained in a development plan document, or a local development plan
in Wales. We believe that making that a prerequisite can cause
unnecessary delay in the making of an LDO, given the time and resources
that would be needed to see one adopted in the relevant development
plan. As we want to facilitate the use of LDOs, we propose to simplify
the process by removing that
requirement.</div>
				
					<a name="08020546000390"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div>
					<a name="08020546000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
29(2) therefore removes the requirement, laid out in section 61A of the
1990 Act, that LDOs can only be made to implement policies in a
development plan document or local development plan. Subsections (3)
and (4) make consequential amendments to the 1990 Act. The existing
requirement to consult all those likely to be affected by the making of
an LDO and to take into account representations made before it
comes into force are sufficient safeguards to ensure the appropriate
use of the power. Amendment Nos. 611, 614 and 615 are consequential
amendments to the commencement provisions in clause 188 and the repeal
provisions in schedule
6.</div>
					<a name="08020546000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000463"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining new
clause 29 and the consequential amendments in greater detail, but will
he reassure me on some of the issues that have been raised,
particularly by the Campaign to Protect Rural England? He said that the
Government have been in negotiations, and I wonder what the outcome of
those negotiations with the CPRE have been. It has certainly indicated
to me that it believes the clause to be fundamentally flawed because it
would prejudge the detailed and controlled development planning process
and the public consultation that underlines it. That is, of course, a
theme that has emerged from the Opposition Benches throughout our
debates. If consultation is curtailed and local people do not feel that
they have an adequate opportunity to register their concerns and
objections, planning and development will risk not being acceptable to
or accepted by local communities.</div>
					<a name="08020546000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CPRE also thinks that that
could undermine the &#147;plan, monitor and manage&#148; approach
to housing site allocation and release greenfield land for development,
which the Opposition are not in favour of. A consequence of that could
be that housing is in the wrong place at the wrong time. The CPRE is
also concerned about damage to the ability to protect designated
landscapes such as national parks and areas of outstanding natural
beauty, which follows on from the previous point.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column648" />Column number: 648</div>
					<a name="08020546000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CPRE believes that the
environmental impact assessment could be made on the basis of
inadequate information and would be unable to take account of the
likely cumulative effect of development, as we can see when one
development follows another, either creeping along roads or extending a
village into a town without anyone really wishing it to
happen&#151;although they would certainly notice it happen. All of
that can be open to our old friend, legal challenge. I would be
grateful if the Minister could reassure us on all of those points and
confirm that the Government are still in consultation with the CPRE and
other bodies that will inevitably have similar
concerns.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000464"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for making the
point about the CPRE, because it is important that we consult it when
taking those steps and, as I understand it, that has been ongoing
within the Department. The key thing for her to consider is that the
measure is about flexibility and enabling local authorities to use the
power as they see fit, through proper consultation at a local level. I
do not envisage the threats to greenfield land arising from the way in
which local planning authorities make the small-scale changes that we
are talking about. I am quite happy to put that on the record. It is
important that such things are done through local authorities so that
there is democratic
accountability.</div>
					<a name="08020546000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s approach is the right way to proceed. Hopefully, we
will have continued discussion and consultation with the CPRE and will
be able to reassure it. I am happy to give such reassurances
on the record. However, we must also provide local government
with the flexibility that it has in article 4 directions, where certain
planning rights can be taken away to allow for small-scale
developments.</div>

							<a name="08020546000469"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> From our point of view, amendment No. 223 is the
most important in the group because it would repeal the Planning-gain
Supplement (Preparations) Act 2007 and take it firmly off the statute
book. Throughout our discussions on the community infrastructure levy,
we made it clear that while the planning gain supplement remains on the
statute book, people will be concerned that at some point the
Government will bring it back. Their commitment to CIL is suspect until
the 2007 Act is repealed. We fought very hard against that Act while it
was going through the House and are concerned that it is still on the
statute book. There is a broader philosophical debate that to make CIL
work properly, it would be an act of good faith for the Government to
repeal PGS. We are therefore helping them down a road that I am sure
they want to take.</div>
					<a name="08020546000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 217, we do not believe that the Secretary of State needs
to make a direction because the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 does
not otherwise prevent planning permission from being granted that is
inconsistent with the development plan. The provision is unnecessary
and we recommended its
removal.</div>
					<a name="08020546000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are complex and I shall outline the reasons behind them. The
revocation of section 101 and schedule 8 of the 1990
Act would remove the power of the Secretary of State to appoint a
planning inquiry commission to inquire into proposed development. I
referred to this in our earlier debates on the infrastructure planning
commission, which, equally, we do not like. The planning inquiry
commission was first mentioned in legislation in 1968, but the
provision to establish it was never used. The provision was repeated in
legislation in 1990, but it was never used. Again, we are trying to get
the statute book into better order and wish to repeal the power to
establish the planning inquiry commission because it is
redundant.</div>
					<a name="08020546000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 220 to 221 relate to section 302 and schedule 15, for the
enforcement against breaches of planning control carried out during the
second world war. I do not think that any of us in this room remember
the second world war. We can understand potentially why that provision
was included when the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 came into
force&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Does the Minister wish to
intervene?</div>

					<a name="08020546000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the 1947 Act first came
into force, obviously there was a need to repair the
damage caused by the second world war. Possibly, we have moved on
sufficiently and can remove those provisions from the statute book. I
look forward to hearing any reasons as to why
not.</div>
					<a name="08020546000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 222 would repeal various development control provisions in the
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 which have not been brought
into force, including those that we originally talked about on planning
contributions. Sections 45 and 50 of that Act are
relevant.</div>
					<a name="08020546000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would tidy up legislation on the statute book which is not
being implemented. I would have thought that it would be a
demonstration of good governance by the Government, to which
they maintain that they are committed, if they were to clear out some
of the redundant provisions in various pieces of legislation.
Primarily, we want to see the 2007 Act repealed in
full.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): We are dealing with
the Banquo&#146;s ghost of the planning-gain supplement. It is a
spectre that has flickered in and out of our planning law for many
years. It has been tried on a number of occasions and has failed each
time, first, because it is a daft idea and, secondly, because the
parties that were in opposition then made it clear that they would not
put up with it when they got into government. Therefore, everyone has
had a good interest in ensuring that it will not work. In fact, the PGS
has had a deleterious
effect.</div>
					<a name="08020546000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
is right in that we should help the Government to clear out the debris
in the attic. It is said that the two most painful things that can
happen are to be divorced and to have to move house. I am no expert in
the former; as to the latter, turning out the attic is the main
traumatic event. We would like to help the Government clear out this
particular attic.</div>
					<a name="08020546000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the attic, I still think that there is a rule that I must go and
practise archery in the churchyard every Sunday afternoon, although no
doubt the rules of the Health and Safety Executive would get in the way
if I ever attempted to put that into practice. In fact, the
executive&#146;s motto seems to be, &#147;Go and find out what they
are doing and tell them to stop it.&#148; That is rather like
the experience of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, who said in his
autobiography that his nanny used to be given instructions by his
mother to go and find out what Bernard was doing and tell him to stop
it. The Health and Safety Executive has clearly adopted the same
motto.</div>

						</b> I did know about that because Ripon is in my
constituency. Apparently, the first reason is that the insurance
companies demand a huge amount of money to insure anyone who trips on
the cobbles. People have been running on the cobbles in Ripon, as the
second oldest incorporated city in Britain, for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column651" />Column number: 651</div>millennia, without any need for the Health and Safety Executive or an
insurance company to intervene. Secondly, the police demand a huge sum
to police it. Remembrance day parades are not possible in my
constituency now because the police say they are not prepared to deploy
the people to&#151;Mr. Illsley, I can see that you are
fascinated by this. You may wish to continue the discussion over a cup
of something at a later stage. I merely use that example to illuminate
the problem with
PGS.</div>

the Minister was at the Treasury he had a certain paternity for the
Bill. No doubt he has an attachment to it, having acted as sort of
&#147;midhusband&#148; during his time there. The other thing about
this wretched measure is that it featured in the Barker report. The
Government are prone to commissioning reports and then regarding them
as a form of holy writ to which they constantly refer. The Barker
report contained some sensible things but some pretty daft things too.
The sage of Thaxted did not get it right on every occasion and Kate
Barker did not get it right on this
one.</div>
					<a name="08020546000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real question
is why the provision should remain on the statute book. What do the

functioning in a number of places. For once we have a measure that has
been tested and been shown to yield benefits. We do not need to think
that CIL is going to fail. It is voluntary and does not need to be
applied. Why do we have this embryonic measure in reserve? If
the Government are going to keep it, what on earth is it for?</div>
					<a name="08020546000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are the woods of Dunsinane
going to march on communities that fail to apply CIL and threaten them
with the PGS? I hope that the Minister will say that they have put it
there pour encourager les autres, as the French might say. They want to
encourage the industry to engage in real consultations about a more
sensible way forward, but they have a more sensible way forward. It
works and therefore we can put Banquo&#146;s ghost safely back to
bed. I hope that the Minister will conspire with us in doing that. Then
the Committee can share one heroic
achievement.</div>

							<a name="08020546000477"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I am afraid that I cannot promise everything that
the right hon. Gentleman would like, even on pancake day in Ripon, and
I commiserate with him on that loss.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column652" />Column number: 652</div>
					<a name="08020546000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 217 is
specifically about going against one&#146;s own local development
plan by sticking a supermarket in an out-of-town location, for example.
As things stand, the Secretary of State can call it in. That would not
be the case with the amendment. Whether it was deliberate or
consequential, I hope that the hon. Lady withdraws
it.</div>
					<a name="08020546000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
218 and 219 would repeal section 101 and schedule 8 of the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990, which provide for the
constitution of planning inquiry commissions, as the hon. Lady
suggested. I accept that there has never been a planning inquiry
commission. Indeed, there is no prospect of one either. I sympathise
with the thrust of the amendment, although we would have to check
whether any consequential changes were needed before considering it
further. As the provision in the 1990 Act is effectively harmless, its
removal is not a priority and there are other pressures on
parliamentary time.</div>
					<a name="08020546000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 220 and 221,
which hark back to the second world war, would repeal section 302 of
the 1990 Act and its associated procedural schedule 15. Section 302
enables local planning authorities to enforce against wartime breaches
of planning control by the Crown for five years after the land has been
sold, and although we know of only two or three cases in the past 30
years, the provision is not entirely dead. For example, it could have
been used as a consequence of the Government&#146;s deciding to build
an airfield without planning permission during the war years. It could
also have occurred if garages, for example, had been built without
permission at the time. However, if a developer were to purchase that
land now they may well apply for planning permission on the wider
footprint of the area because of that development. The clause allows us
enforcement to prevent that from happening for up to five years after
the purchase.</div>
					<a name="08020546000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I accept that the likelihood of any further cases arising is
increasingly remote, we should not dismiss the possibility and close
the door on potentially legitimate enforcement. The Department had not
received any representations on section 302 prior to amendments Nos.
220 and 221 being tabled, which suggests that the continued existence
of section 302 is not a significant cause of concern
among local authorities or practitioners.</div>
					<a name="08020546000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 222 would repeal
provisions in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 that have
yet to come fully into force&#151;section 43(1) in so far as it
relates to section 70B of the 1990 Act and section 81B of the Planning
(Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act
1990&#151;which allow a local planning authority to decline to
determine an application for planning permission, listed building
consent or conservation area consent where an identical or similar
application is already under consideration.</div>
					<a name="08020546000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The practice,
known as twin-tracking, is a device sometimes used by developers so
that if a planning authority fails to make a decision within the
statutory determination period of eight weeks for minor applications
and 13 weeks for major applications, they can appeal on one application
while leaving the other application to continue to be considered by the
local planning authority. We recognise that that can be a waste of
local resources, but we have not yet commenced the provision because,
as we indicated during the passage of the measure, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column653" />Column number: 653</div>power should not come into force until the
performance of local planning authorities has improved. Given the
significant improvement in their performance in recent years,
twin-tracking can only reduce, but we cannot accept the amendments as
we want to see a continued improvement in the eight and 13-week
targets.</div>
					<a name="08020546000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot
accept the proposal in amendment No. 222 to repeal section 25 of the
2004 Act. It relates to simplified planning zones and would require
them to be identified in regional spatial strategies. As the hon.
Lady pointed out, that provision has not been
commenced. Repealing the provision has some attractions with regard to
tidying up the planning zones, but the amendment is not the
most appropriate means of doing so in this case; nor is it the right
time to do so, because we are seeking to look more widely at simplified
planning zones, their role and relevance now that local authorities can
make use of local development orders to achieve the same
ends.</div>
					<a name="08020546000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">To that end, we
published a consultation draft of &#147;Planning Policy Statement 4:
Planning for Sustainable Economic Development&#148; in December,
which includes a specific question on whether we need a separate policy
on simplified planning zones. The consultation period on draft PPS 4 is
open until mid-March, and that will allow local authorities, industry
and the public an opportunity to give their considered views on the
merits of that policy area. It is right and proper that we allow that
time before making any decisions on it. To act now would be premature,
so I cannot accept the repeal of section 45.</div>
					<a name="08020546000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would also repeal
the provisions in the 2004 Act that allow for the creation by
regulations of a system of planning contributions. My hon. Friend the
Minister for Local Government mentioned that in connection with new
clause 5, which would have the same effect, and we cannot accept the
amendment for the reasons that he gave.</div>
					<a name="08020546000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would repeal the provision in section 50 of the 2004 Act and thereby
allow a local planning authority, for a limited period of time, to
share jurisdiction over the determination of a planning application
alongside the Planning Inspectorate in cases where there has been an
appeal on the grounds of non-determination. That measure would provide
extra flexibility for authorities to decide cases that were originally
put to them, which might be helpful when the reason for
non-determination might simply be the cyclical nature of Committee
meetings, for example. We have not yet implemented that provision
because we are engaged in a programme of reform of the appeals system,
which we would like to complete before considering any further changes
of that
sort.</div>
					<a name="08020546000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
223 would repeal the planning gain supplement. It is important to
recall that the Planning-gain Supplement (Preparations) Act 2007 is a
short, straightforward, three-section Act that cannot be used to
introduce PGS. It only allows certain authorities to incur preparatory
expenditure in getting ready for PGS, does not permit the Government to
introduce the PGS, and would require new primary legislation, as was
made clear during its passage.</div>

the community infrastructure levy.</div>

Dhanda:
						</b> As I said, it is a short, three-section Act, and
that is as far as we have got with regard to PGS. There is no need to
repeal the preparations Act, as it is only a narrow, preparatory
measure designed to ensure the regulation and probity of Government
expenditure in accordance with Government accounting rules. It is
important that the preparations Act cannot be used to impose PGS, and
further primary legislation would be needed to do so. That in itself is
a strong enough commitment from the Government, and one that hon.
Members should accept. It would require further primary legislation to
progress with the PGS.</div>

Nothing can be done with it and nothing has been done because of it. It
is there because it is there because it is there. Why not get rid of
it? Why should it sit there like a barnacle on the hull of the planning
system, having no earthly use, being totally inedible and slowing
things down? It is a pointless piece of legislation. The
Minister&#146;s only case is that the Government passed it, but it
can do nothing. It is sitting there, dead in the water and all that it
can do is impede the passing

the Government&#146;s commitments on the PGS. It is not unusual for
measures to exist that have gone through the House and have not been

you have probably gathered, Mr. Illsley, the Opposition
cannot understand why it is so difficult for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column655" />Column number: 655</div>the Government to do anything other than repeal the Planning-gain
Supplement (Preparations) Act 2007. According to the Government
themselves, it is going nowhere and is cluttering the statute book. We
wish to see them repeal that Act as an earnest of good intent. To give
them time to reflect on that, I hope that I have the support of my hon.
Friends in not pressing amendment No. 223 to a vote. However, we will
return to this matter on another
occasion.</div>
					<a name="08020546000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not wish to rehearse the arguments that I have put forward for the
other amendments. We have received a glimmer of hope on some of them,
such as the commitment made by the Minister for Local Government. We
will go away and think about them. However, on many of these issues the
Government have said, &#147;It is our legislation and we dare not
repeal it because it will show that we are weak.&#148; They would
actually be strong if they were to repeal things. It would show that
they have every intention of cleaning up the statute

						</b> New clause 10 is the key, as the other amendments
are consequential upon it. I am sure that many of us have encountered
constituency cases in which buildings outside listed areas, but which
are precious to the community, have been demolished without consent. We
are trying to protect those buildings, so that planning permission must
be granted to demolish them. Many towns and villages have cherished
buildings that are part of the townscape or of the village that people
love, which are sometimes demolished without
permission.</div>
					<a name="08020546000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sadly, in
my constituency there is now only a site where once there was Lavender
cottage. I saw it being knocked down on a Saturday morning, which made
me suspicious. I got hold of the planning department, but, by the time
the bureaucracy had ground into action, the building was unreplaceable.
Needless to say, there has subsequently been a
planning application for multiple dwelling units on that site.
Meanwhile, the street in which the house existed is altered
fundamentally because of the demolition. Although I have personal
experience of that, I know that I am not alone in wishing that there
were greater controls over demolition of buildings. That is why I have
tabled the new
clause.</div>

					<a name="08020546000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Culture, Media and Sport is planning to publish a draft
heritage protection Bill in the spring. It will contain provisions to
abolish conservation area consent as a separate consent and merge it
with planning permission. What does that mean? It is intended that, at
the same time as the Bill comes into force, amendments will be made to
the demolition direction and the general permitted development order to
provide that demolition and partial demolition in a conservation area,
to which the hon. Lady alludes, is development and will require
planning permission. It will not be permitted development simply to
knock down those buildings in conservation areas. We therefore believe
that any changes in new clause 10 would be better sited and considered
within the DCMS

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000500"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> This is a friendly agreement between us and those on
the Government Front Bench because we are trying to do exactly the same
thing but are using different formats to do it. If the Minister
disagrees with that, I look forward to hearing why, but my reading of
the proposals is that the Government are trying to do the same as
us.</div>
					<a name="08020546000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000501"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I congratulate the hon. Lady on wishing to
introduce time limits for making an appeal against a local planning
authority&#146;s refusal to issue a lawful development certificate,
and to set the minimum time limits that may be
prescribed for making an appeal. It is gratifying that we are on the
same wavelength in that respect. As Opposition Members will be aware,
paragraph 3 of new schedule 1 will make similar 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column659" />Column number: 659</div>amendments to section 195 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990,
together with other changes that I shall come to in a moment. However,
we do not agree with the proposed amendments to section 193, because
there is no need for those
requirements.</div>
					<a name="08020546000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee may be aware, there are two types of lawful development
certificate. The first applies where the applicant asks whether
development that has taken place is lawful
development&#151;essentially, whether it is immune from enforcement
action or benefits from permitted development rights. There is no
reason for that to receive publicity, because the development already
exists, so why would we want to advertise it in a
local newspaper or otherwise? Whether the development
is or is not lawful is a matter between the applicant and the local
planning
authority.</div>
					<a name="08020546000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the second case, the applicant asks whether proposed development can be
done without planning permission&#151;generally, whether it benefits
from permitted development rights. Again, there is no need for
publicity, because the development in question by definition will be
minor. Requiring publicity for lawful development certificates would be
entirely disproportionate. If development does not need planning
permission, third parties need not be
involved.</div>
					<a name="08020546000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">If hon.
Members are concerned that applicants for lawful development
certificates might not be telling the truth, I remind them that the
burden of proof is on the applicant. It is therefore for the applicant
to back up their claim&#151;for example, by saying
that the development in question was undertaken so long ago that it is
immune from enforcement action. An example might be an extension to a
house that was put up several years ago. We are saying that there is no
need to publicise or advertise that, but it would be incumbent on the
applicant to prove that the development had been there for a sufficient
period.</div>
					<a name="08020546000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000502"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I understand the logic of what the Minister is
saying, but may I put this example to him? The farming community often
have permitted development rights to put up, for example, a byre or
something similar. What if a farmer decided to put up a large byre next
to a housing estate and to keep thousands of pigs in it? How, if at
all, would the occupiers of the adjoining estate express their
views?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000504"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I shall say it again. A farmer will often have
permitted development rights to put up an agricultural building. Let us
say that he or she decides to put up an extensive byre next to a
council estate or other housing estate and to fill it with thousands of
pigs. What procedure would there be for the people living nearby to
express their opinion about the propriety or otherwise of permitting
that development?</div>
					<a name="08020546000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000505"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> My understanding is that such
developments are not minor, but very significant. The detail of our
proposals will obviously have to be laid 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column660" />Column number: 660</div>out in regulations, but the case that the hon. Gentleman raises is
completely different. People would not be able to do such things
without planning permission and the publicity associated with
that.</div>
					<a name="08020546000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000506"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> I can assist the Minister. The sensible reaction of
the people on the council estate would be to wait, because anybody
trying to raise pigs intensively in Wales would fail within a few
months given the price of pig meat and grain at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="08020546000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000507"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> The right hon. Gentleman is on good form. We have
had pig meat and pancakes, and I put that down to his trendy new
haircut, which has obviously helped his thinking and
concentration.</div>
					<a name="08020546000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000508"></a>Mr.
Benyon:
						</b> Just to be thoroughly boring and technical, my
understanding is that the general development order, which is what I
think the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy is referring to,
contains a proximity clause. I believe that the farmer would not be
permitted to undertake such a development within a certain distance of
the estate, although my memory of the Town and Country Planning Act
1990 is fading.</div>
					<a name="08020546000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020546000509"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> That is a helpful intervention. As I said,
however, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy is talking about
something significant but different from what we are talking about on
this set of provisions.</div>
					<a name="08020546000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members are concerned that
applicants for lawful development certificates might not be telling the
truth, so it is important to remind the Committee that the burden of
proof is on the applicant. It is for the applicant to back up their
claim that the development in question was, for example, undertaken so
long ago that it is immune to enforcement action. If the local planning
authority has any doubts, it can approach neighbours
to see whether they can verify what the applicant says. If it cannot
establish that the development is lawful, a certificate would be
refused. Guidance is available to local planning authorities in
circular 10/97 on enforcement planning control.</div>
					<a name="08020546000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is entirely right that there
should be consultation on determinations of planning applications. If a
lawful development certificate is not forthcoming and
planning permission is required, the subsequent application will
receive publicity in the normal way. I therefore invite the hon. Member
for Beckenham not to press the amendment to a Division.</div>
					<a name="08020546000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Government amendments Nos.
612 and 613, new clause 30 and new schedule 1, I shall address my main
remarks to the substantive provisions in the new schedule, but first
let me deal briefly with the other provisions. The amendments insert
references to new clause 30 and new schedule 1 into clause 188(3) so
that the provisions in them can be brought into force separately in
England and Wales. New clause 30 introduces new schedule 1.</div>
					<a name="08020546000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The substantive provisions
start at paragraph 2 of new schedule 1, which provides that a notice of
appeal made under section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act
1990</div>
					<a name="08020546000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must be
accompanied by such information as may be prescribed&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column661" />Column number: 661</div>
					<a name="08020546000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power to prescribe is exercisable by
the Secretary of State in England and by Welsh Ministers in Wales. The
provision relates to clause 160, which requires the Secretary of State
to determine the appeal method. We want to give appellants the
opportunity to state in their appeal notice their preferred method of
appeal and why. That is to ensure that any circumstances that may have
a bearing on the appropriateness of an appeal method may be brought to
the attention to the Secretary of State or the Planning Inspectorate
acting on her
behalf.</div>
					<a name="08020546000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
determining the appeal method, the fact that clause 160 and schedule 5
apply only in England must be taken into account. However, the Welsh
Assembly Government wish the provision to apply in Wales and to
be commenced there by Welsh Ministers. It is therefore more appropriate
for the provision to be included in a separate schedule. Paragraphs 3
to 6 of new schedule 1 make similar provision to paragraph 2 for other
types of appeal. Paragraph 3 on lawful development certificate appeals
has two additional elements that were covered on the debate on
new clause 9.</div>

							<a name="08020546000513"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:
						</b> I apologise to members of the Committee for the
delay in tabling the new clause. The framework powers that it contains
have been the subject of detailed negotiations to ensure their scope,
and that their content is right. It did not prove possible to finalise
the new clause as early as we would have liked. The Government of Wales
Act 2006 provides powers for the National Assembly for Wales to pass
legislation known as Assembly Measures. In relation to matters set out
in schedule 5 to the 2006 Act and in line with the principles of the
devolution settlement, new clause 22 inserts three new matters into the
town and country planning field in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column663" />Column number: 663</div>schedule 5. That will allow the Assembly to make its own legislation in
relation to the plans made by Welsh Ministers and local planning
authorities on the development and use of land in Wales. Those powers
are subject to an exception that prohibits the National Assembly from
making provision about the status of plans in relation to development
consents for nationally significant infrastructure projects.</div>
					<a name="08020546000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Assembly may also pass
measures about the matters that local planning authorities should keep
under review that affect the area&#146;s development. For example, a
measure could prescribe a list of specific matters that authorities
must keep under review, such as population, housing and other key
cross-boundary issues. A memorandum setting out the detail of those
powers has been published alongside the Bill. New clause 22 has been
included at the specific request of Welsh Ministers. The Assembly
Government believe that the power to make their own legislation in
those areas would enable them to respond quickly and positively to the
needs and challenges faced by the Welsh planning system in the
future.</div>
					<a name="08020546000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
development plan system in Wales is distinctive. Each local planning
authority must prepare a single local development plan for its area. In
doing so, it must have regard to a number of things, including the
Wales spatial plan, which is prepared by Welsh Ministers. Proposed new
matter 18.1 would enable the Assembly to change the status of the Wales
spatial plan in relation to local development plans. It would also
enable the Assembly to make provision in relation to the plan&#146;s
content and its preparations and review requirements. The new
development plan system in Wales is in its infancy and no local
planning authority in Wales has yet gone beyond the early stages of
local development plan preparation. As the new system beds in, the
Welsh Assembly Government will consider the plan requirements and any
legislative changes. They will use the framework powers when
appropriate, following consultation and in accordance with Welsh
priorities and time scales&#151;although the times scales are the
same.</div>
					<a name="08020546000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
513 is consequential and provides for the powers to come into force two
months after Royal Assent. Amendments (a) and (b) would enable the
National Assembly to legislate only in relation to plans about the
development and use of land in Wales prepared by Welsh Ministers. It
would not be able to legislate for local development plans. The
Assembly Government are responsible for overseeing the operation of the
town and country planning system in Wales, so the effect of the
amendment would be to enable the National Assembly to legislate only in
relation to part of that system. We consider that to be inconsistent
and to risk an incoherent and, as I have said, inconsistent approach
between national and local tiers of plan-making in Wales. That is
clearly not acceptable. Wales has its own distinctive development plan
system that is still in its infancy. It is entirely appropriate for the
National Assembly to have powers to enable it to respond positively to
the needs and challenges faced by the Welsh planning system in the
future. Key stakeholders, including the Welsh Local Government
Association, support these proposals. Therefore, I strongly resist the
amendments.</div>

							<a name="08020546000514"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> Just as the Minister commenced his speech with an
apology, may I also tender my apology to you, Mr. Illsley,
for raising a sequence of long points of order on the non-production of
this new clause? I know that I have tried your patience, but frankly my
own patience and that of other Committee members was severely tried
when a matter of some constitutional significance was
not tabled until 24 January. Remarkably enough, that was the very same
day that the previous incumbent of Gwydyr house decided to relinquish
his position. I am not sure whether the events were linked, but it was
a happy
coincidence.</div>
					<a name="08020546000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
group is of constitutional significance. It will
grant law-making powers&#151;primary legislative
powers&#151;to the Welsh Assembly. I understand that the powers were
applied for by the Welsh Assembly Government as long ago as last
summer, but the draft clause was not tabled until two weeks ago. It is
clear that even in the early stages of the Committee stage, the
Government were not wholly aware of the nature of the powers that were
sought. I put the issue to the Minister for Local Government very early
on in proceedings when I asked why such important powers did not appear
in the Bill at that stage. He indicated that the powers were for Welsh
Ministers in the areas for which they already have devolved competence.
That is not the case. As we have heard from the Under-Secretary, these
are new legislative powers, not for Welsh Ministers, but for the Welsh
Assembly.</div>
					<a name="08020546000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause will insert three new matters in part 1 of schedule 5 to the
Government of Wales Act 2006. By any standard, the
2006 Act is a remarkably convoluted piece of legislation. It sets up a
framework by which primary legislative powers may be devolved to the
Welsh Assembly, but there is no one route for doing that. At the last
count, there were no fewer than 13 routes by which such powers can be
devolved to the Assembly, although I believe that academics are still
counting. The two most&#151;I hesitate to use the word
popular&#151;common routes appear to be by framework powers, such as
we are considering, and by legislative competence
orders.</div>
					<a name="08020546000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
instructive to draw a distinction between those two procedures. Under
the legislative competence order procedure there is a considerable
level of scrutiny by the Welsh Assembly and by Parliament. In
Parliament, the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs
conducts evidence sessions and inquires very closely into the reasons
for the application for the legislative powers and the likely effects
of granting such powers. Remarkably, there appears to be a considerably
lower degree of scrutiny for framework powers, such as those that we
are considering. The only scrutiny that I can perceive in Parliament so
far is this sitting of a half-empty Committee for what will probably be
an hour&#146;s
debate.</div>
					<a name="08020546000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a minimum
level of scrutiny, the Government should have contrived for the new
clause to be available for debate by the whole House on Second Reading.
I would suggest that future framework powers should be in the Bill at a
far earlier
stage.</div>

Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I would
hate <i class="I">Hansard</i> to report something that is
inaccurate. It seems to me that this is a quite

the hon. Gentleman is saying with interest.</div>

am sure that he will agree that they are
empty.</div>
					<a name="08020546000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
evidence that we have seen so far of the need for the
measures that the Welsh Assembly Government appear to want is in a
memorandum prepared by them, which I first saw on 9 January. I do not
know whether other members of the Committee have seen that memorandum,
but it merits reading.</div>
					<a name="08020546000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, there was an evidence
session with the relevant Welsh Minister in a Committee Room here on
the same date. I understand that only Members
representing Welsh constituencies were invited to that evidence
session, and I dare say that Members from other parts of the United
Kingdom did not receive such an invitation. Notwithstanding the fact
that this Committee had been formed at that stage, I would have thought
that it would have been extremely informative if all its members could
have attended that evidence session. The memorandum that the Minister
has quoted from in part is of some assistance in understanding why the
powers are sought, but frankly it is not of a great deal of
assistance.</div>

the hon. Gentleman
refers.</div>
					<a name="08020546000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Welsh
development plan system was set out comprehensively, as the Minister
said, in a recent piece of legislation: part 6 of the Planning and
Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. That includes 19 detailed sections
setting out not only the Welsh spatial plan system, but the local
development plan system, which is unique to Wales and the UK, as he
also said.</div>
					<a name="08020546000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 6
requires Welsh Minister to produce a national spatial plan for Wales,
to which local authorities must have regard when
preparing their own local development plans. That spatial plan sets out
the policies that Welsh Ministers think appropriate in relation to the
development and use of land in Wales. As the Minister said, the
proposed new matter 18.1 would confer primary legislative competence on
the Welsh Assembly, enabling it to pass measures in relation to the
development and use of land in Wales. I have no violent objection
either to the devolution of legislative competence in that regard or to
Welsh Ministers moving the furniture around with regard to the Welsh
spatial plan through primary legislation. However, I observe that
section 60 of the 2004 Act already contains detailed powers and
obligations for the Welsh Minister to review and revise the plan. Those
are two aspects that Welsh Ministers say that they need to address by
means of primary legislation.</div>

honest. If he does not object to the powers that he has just described,
which is an interesting contribution to make, what is his point,

with the Ministers of the Welsh Assembly, and surely what we are

18.1.</div>

						</b> Frankly, it is hard to show much of a sense of
humour when dealing with the dog&#146;s breakfast
that is the Government of Wales Act 2006.
Nevertheless, I shall press on and enlighten the right hon. Gentleman
on my concerns about proposed matters 18.2 and 18.3 of the 2006
Act.</div>
					<a name="08020546000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed matter
18.2 will give the Assembly legislative competence</div>
					<a name="08020546000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in connection with the review by
local planning authorities of matters which may be expected to
affect...the development of the authorities&#146; areas,
or...the planning of the
development&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020546000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">of such
areas. Proposed matter 18.3 will give the Assembly competence to make
provision in connection with local development plans and the removal
of</div>
					<a name="08020546000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requirements for any
such plans&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020546000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
fact that Welsh Ministers have made an application for primary
legislative competence does not necessarily mean that such competence
should be granted. The right hon. Gentleman thinks that this
is a biscuit of which I am making a meal, but I should remind
him that we are talking about the devolution of primary legislative
powers from Parliament to the
Assembly.</div>
				
					<a name="08020546000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also remind the right
hon. Gentleman of what the new Secretary of State for Wales said about
the issue in his speech to the Welsh Grand
Committee:</div>
					<a name="08020546000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
do not believe for one second that we should be rubber-stamping LCOs or
legislation for devolution, because we would not be doing our job as
Members of this Parliament. We must scrutinise such matters properly
for the purpose of correctness, certainly, but also to establish
whether we think that there is a case to be made for the particular
powers, whatever they might be, to be devolved to the National
Assembly.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Welsh Grand
Committee,</i> 12 December 2007; c.
27.]</div>
					<a name="08020546000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">That speech was made before
he was appointed to his new position, but I would not
expect that he has changed his mind since he became the incumbent at
Gwydyr house. To that extent, the Secretary of State and I are in full
agreement, and I hope that all members of the Committee share our view.
My point is that, so far as I can see, no compelling case has been made
for the devolution of primary competence in respect of proposed matters
18.2 and 18.3.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column667" />Column number: 667</div>
					<a name="08020546000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">All of the
issues that the Welsh Assembly Government identified in their
memorandum relate to powers that are already devolved to Assembly
Ministers. Given that this is a matter of some significance, I shall
analyse the various powers that Welsh Ministers seek and allow the
Committee to make its mind up on whether they require additional
powers.</div>
					<a name="08020546000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
memorandum indicates that the Welsh Assembly Government are seeking
primary competence in respect of the matters that local planning
authorities must keep under review, being matters that might be
expected to affect the development of their area or the planning of its
development, but section 69 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act
2004 already provides for the review of local development
plans.</div>
					<a name="08020546000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The memorandum
refers to the content of local development plans&#151;that is,
prescription of what the local development plan must set out&#151;but
section 62(4) of the 2004 Act already
states:</div>
					<a name="08020546000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Regulations

					<a name="08020546000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The memorandum refers to
matters to which local planning authorities are to have regard when
preparing LDPs. Section 62(5) sets those out in great detail, and
includes the
expression,</div>
					<a name="08020546000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such other
matters as the Assembly prescribes&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020546000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is hard to think of a wider power
residing with the Assembly.</div>
					<a name="08020546000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The memorandum refers to the

Government are seeking primary powers in respect of the preparation

requirements in great detail. What additional powers do the Assembly
Government require?</div>
					<a name="08020546000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
memorandum refers to the independent examination of LDPs by persons
appointed by Welsh Ministers, but that is provided for comprehensively
in section 64. The memorandum refers to powers for Welsh Ministers to
intervene in the event that they consider an LDP to be unsatisfactory,
but that is specifically provided for by section 65. The memorandum
refers to the withdrawal, adoption, revocation, review and revision of
LDPs, which sections 66 to 70 of the 2004 Act already provide for
comprehensively and explicitly
.</div>
					<a name="08020546000395"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08020546000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The memorandum
refers to the possible revision of part only of an LDP. Section 70(2)
provides that the Assembly may direct the LPA to revise an LDP. It goes
on to refer to powers for the Welsh Ministers to
prepare, revise or approve an LDP if it believes the LPA is failing
properly to carry out the function itself. Those matters are already
specifically and comprehensively provided for in section 71. Finally,
the memorandum refers to powers to make provision in relation to joint
LDPs and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column668" />Column number: 668</div>annual monitoring reports. Again, those are
specifically provided for in sections 72 and 76 of the 2004
Act.</div>
					<a name="08020546000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why do the
Welsh Assembly Government seek primary law-making powers? Where is the
compelling case made out? Perhaps one clue is that the memorandum
indicates that Welsh Ministers are seeking legislative competence in
respect of the content, status and procedures relating to supplementary
planning guidance issued by local planning authorities. That is the nub
of the application for primary powers made by the Welsh Ministers. They
do not say why they want any such powers.</div>
					<a name="08020546000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand from the Minister
that the Welsh Local Government Association is supportive, but I have
yet to find a member of that body who is. I believe that what we have
now is an application by Welsh Ministers to hoover up further
legislative competence from this place, to hoover up discretion from
local planning authorities in terms of the preparation of the local
development plan, and to deposit those powers on the desk of Ministers
in Cardiff
bay.</div>
					<a name="08020546000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Welsh Assembly Government have shown themselves over the years to be
both acquisitive in terms of power and highly centralising. I am
concerned that the powers that they seek under the clause will enable
them to operate in an even more highly interventionist manner as far as
local planning authorities are concerned. I do not believe that it is a
function of this Parliament simply to hand over primary powers to the
Welsh Assembly unless a strong and compelling case has been
made.</div>
					<a name="08020546000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Welsh Ministers
have seen the Bill coming up on the horizon and thought it a useful
vehicle for acquiring more powers for the Assembly. They have decided
to do so without any real powers in mind. They have given utterly
spurious reasons as to why those powers should be sought. As I have
illustrated, the powers that they ostensibly seek are already in their
hands under the 2004 Act. If they seek such powers, they will have to
do considerably
better.</div>

a matter of correction, however, he said that the only paperwork about
the clause was the statement that came to us via the Secretary of State
for Wales, from which the hon. Gentleman read exhaustively. There was a
written Cabinet statement on 14 December by Ms Davidson, who attended a

matter; it has been devolved to the National Assembly for Wales. If it
is to improve the current planning system it needs these powers. I hear
what the hon. Gentleman says; he was reading verbatim from that
memorandum about the various sections that he says already apply. The
whole point of the exercise is to ensure that Ministers are empowered
to deal with this matter in its entirety in Cardiff rather than having
to come through this place. That is the gist of
it.</div>

						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the planning
system is not just devolved but, under the Welsh legislation, different
in a number of material characteristics already? The measures are being
applied to a different system of planning.</div>

							<a name="08020546000531"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> Indeed. The right hon. Gentleman speaks with
experience, having been an Executive Member of that body. The planning
system in Wales is different; for example, we lay great emphasis on the
Wales spatial plan and on local development plans. The proposed
change in the law will enable matters, especially those not transacted
in the same manner as in England, to be brought forward without having
to come through the conduit of this
House.</div>
					<a name="08020546000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">In opening the
debate, the Minister was perhaps too kind to the hon. Member for Clwyd,
West, who tabled wrecking amendments. If amendments (a) and (b) to new
clause 22 were accepted, they would wreck this part of the Bill in its
entirety. In effect, Ministers in Wales would have to attempt to carry
out their responsibilities for planning and the economy with one hand
behind their back. I would find it extraordinary if the Committee were
minded to allow that in any shape or form.</div>
					<a name="08020546000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the gestation period of the
new clause, I, too, was rather concerned that it was late coming
forward, but at least we have it now, along with a memorandum that is
more detailed than that which applies to any other
clause and from which the hon. Member for Clwyd, West has read
exhaustively. There are important reasons to accept new clause 22 and
the Government amendment.</div>
					<a name="08020546000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said, planning is
inextricably linked with the economy and if we are serious about
allowing the National Assembly for Wales to do a proper job on behalf
of the people of Wales, it must have the tools. That is exactly what
new clause 22 will provide. I reject utterly
virtually everything that has been said in support of the amendments to
it, (a) and (b). I fully support the new clause and the Government
amendment.</div>

West made an interesting point when he said that he had no violent
objection to the proposal, but the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant
Conwy is right that accepting the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column670" />Column number: 670</div>amendments would wreck what we are trying to do. It is entirely
consistent to have a synergy between the Wales spatial plan and the
local development plans and for them to line
up.</div>

						</b> In the course of explaining the proposals, will
my hon. Friend kindly tell us whether he believes that the
Conservatives have set their face against the proposition before us, in
the Assembly as well as in this place? The Conservatives in
Cardiff bay want to give the impression of pursuing and
supporting devolution, proper decision making and the rest of it,
whereas there seems to be a more luddite tendency. It is important for
the Committee to know what is going

amend the system governing the spatial strategy and local development
plans and that they want independent examination of that system, but
that is in complete contradiction to the amendments before

list of decisions to which section 288 and the six-week challenge
period applies was modified by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act
2004. The 2004 Act omitted to include decisions on major infrastructure
projects. Therefore, the effect of that omission is that, at present, a
person aggrieved by a decision of the Secretary of State on a call-in
of a major infrastructure application would have to challenge through
judicial review. Applications for judicial review must be brought
within three months of the decision. That anomaly will be corrected by
inserting paragraph (za) into section 284(3) of the 1990 Act. The
proposals will therefore ensure consistency in the treatment of
challenge
periods.</div>

Secretaries of State considers it appropriate to issue a direction
requiring a joint decision, thereby also making it possible to make
regulations enabling such cases to be determined by inspectors, as with
the vast majority of other planning appeals.</div>

would provide a power to make regulations enabling the transfer to
inspectors of appeals under schedule 2 of the Planning and Compensation
Act 1991, following the initial review of old mining permissions. It
would, therefore, provide consistency in the handling of this type of
appeal and all other types of planning and enforcement appeals.
Transferring appeals to inspectors saves unnecessary duplication of
effort and the attendant delay, as only those appeals that raise
significant policy issues of more than local importance are then
recovered for determination by the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="08020546000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
relates to reviews of permissions for mineral development, authorised
under interim development orders made between 1943 and 1948 in response
to wartime needs with few, if any, working and restoration conditions.
Most initial reviews have been completed, but those powers, including
the provision for appeals, will continue to be used by operators
wishing to revive work at long-dormant mining sites. However, given
that such appeals are concerned solely with securing modern operating
conditions on sites, for which permission has already been granted, it
would be disproportionate for them to remain as the only category of
appeals that cannot be transferred for determination by
inspectors.</div>
