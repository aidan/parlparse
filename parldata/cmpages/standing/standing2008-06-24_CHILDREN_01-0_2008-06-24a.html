<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000312"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good morning. I would like to begin with a few
announcements. Some Members have beaten me to this&#151;Members may
remove their jackets during Committee sittings. It is warm in here. I
remind Members to switch mobile phones, pagers, BlackBerrys and so
forth off, or to silent. I remind the Committee that there is a money
resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available
in the room. I also remind Members that adequate notice should be given
of amendments. As a general rule, I and my fellow Chairman do not
intend to call starred amendments.</div>
<a name="08062496000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will be first asked to consider the programme motion on the
amendment paper, the debate on which is limited to half an hour. We
will then proceed to a motion to report written evidence, which I hope
can be taken formally. If the Committee agrees to the programme motion,
we will begin scrutiny
immediately.</div><a name="08062496000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000313"></a>The

conclusion at 5.00 p.m. on Thursday 3rd
July.</div><a name="08062496000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a genuine pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first
time, Mr. Pope, following an encouraging Second Reading
which reflected the widespread commitment on both sides of the House to
the issues in the
Bill.</div><a name="08062496000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that there was accord in the usual channels regarding the
programme motion. I draw hon. Members&#146; attention to the fact
that we will not be sitting on Thursday afternoon of this week. We were
only too happy to agree to that, to accommodate the needs of Members of
the Opposition. With those brief pleasantries, and in this perhaps not
typical Wimbledon weather, I thank you, Mr. Pope, for
allowing us to remove our
jackets.</div><a name="08062496000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062496000314"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): I welcome you,
Mr. Pope. I do not think that I have served under your
chairmanship. I am sure that you will be exceedingly fair and
accommodating. I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>particularly pleased that the Minister is leading for the Government. He
and I are veterans of these things, going back to the Adoption and
Children Act 2002 and other
legislation.</div><a name="08062496000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am particularly pleased to be joined on the Opposition Benches by an
ace team of veterans. My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight was
on Committee considering the Children Act 2004 with me, and my hon.
Friend the Member for Bromsgrove who will be joining us
later&#151;she sent her apologies&#151;was on the Childcare Act
2006. There is also a debut Committee performance by my hon. Friend the
Member for Crewe and Nantwich, after his excellent maiden speech in the
debate on the Bill last week. He brings to the Committee a wealth of
experience from many years on the family court circuit in the north of
England. He also has great experience of fostering in his own family. I
am sure that he will end up teaching all of us a thing or
two.</div><a name="08062496000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
endorse the Minister&#146;s comments on the excellent Second Reading,
and point out that this is a pretty uncontentious Bill. It was amended
for the good in the Lords, and we seek to support it as much as
possible and to speed its enactment. There are areas where we want to
add detail, and we want to tighten up some of the good intentions,
which I think all members of the Committee will agree with. It will be
a constructive debate and
dialogue.</div><a name="08062496000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
way in which the amendments have been ordered means that there is an
awful lot of activity at the back end. There are not that many
amendments, and they are mostly probing or technical ones, but there
are no fewer than 32 new clauses. There are almost as many new clauses
as amendments. Things that might have been seen as amendments have been
turned into new clauses on a whole host of subjects, including
independent reviewing officers, advocacy, residential placements and
some of their terms of scrutiny, and teachers and governors having
responsibilities in schools. There are also some new clauses that we
have tabled. One is on having a welfare checklist, which we would like
to see at the heart of the
Bill.</div><a name="08062496000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would also like to see proposals on the role of a chief social worker.
We might have debated that at the beginning, during our considerations
of the first six clauses, but in your wisdom, Mr. Pope, you
have decided that we should come back to that new clause
later.</div>
<a name="08062496000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are keen
to move through the early clauses as speedily and constructively as
possible, because new clauses have been tabled by not only the
Opposition, but the Liberal Democrats and some Government Back
Benchers, and we are keen to leave sufficient time to debate those
fully nearer the end of our proceedings. On that basis, we are happy
with the programme motion. However, rather than having only an hour
during the final sitting to debate 20 new clauses, it would be nice to
pace ourselves accordingly and give them the proper debating time that
they
merit.</div><a name="08062496000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062496000315"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): This is the
first time that I have served under your chairmanship, Mr.
Pope, and it is a pleasure. I am pleased that the Minister is leading
for the Government, as we have met before in other Committees. I would
also like to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion,
because not only does he bring valuable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>experience of schools, which relates to an important aspect of the Bill,
but we feel that there should be some Welsh input from the opposition
parties, as most of the Bill will apply to Wales. I am looking forward
to the Committee&#146;s proceedings and hope that they meet my
expectations, because we are primarily in agreement that we need to do
much better for vulnerable children. Having the opportunity to make a
positive contribution to young peoples&#146; lives is a privilege, so
I hope that all of our debates will be in that spirit.</div>
<a name="08062496000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We made a
number of points on Second Reading that we want to take forward and in
relation to which we want to have more detailed debate. Many of our
concerns require clarification and pushing further. On Second Reading,
I said that so much is dealt with in guidance and regulation that
Committee is the only chance for us to get in there and ensure that the
guidance and regulations will be implemented. Implementation will be
the key to all of this. We can have all of our grand words, but unless
we get it right and get the messages out to the wider world, we will
not make the difference that I am sure we all wish to
achieve.</div><a name="08062496000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000317"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> It would be remiss of me not to mention the array
of talent that I have with me on this side of the Committee, including
my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and
Families, who has a tremendous amount of experience in these matters
and, indeed, was greatly involved with the genesis of the Bill through
the &#147;Care Matters&#148; White Paper that was published last
June. There is also a wealth of experience behind me, including my hon.
Friend the Member for Worcester, who I am sure will do all that he can
to help us achieve the Opposition&#146;s strictures on debating the
Bill in full and going through all of the new clauses.</div>
<a name="08062496000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the past,
Opposition Members have criticised the Government for their handling of
what have sometimes been called&#151;by myself
included&#151;&#147;Wallace and Gromit&#148; Bills, because the
track is laid as the Committee proceeds. With this number of new
clauses, perhaps the Opposition could be accused of something similar,
but all of these are serious and important matters that need to be
debated in full. With the aid of all members of the Committee, I am
sure that we will be able to do
that.</div><a name="08062496000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
of the Committee will know that the Bill is based on the &#147;Care
Matters&#148; White Paper, which was published last June, and the
care implementation plan. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>By way of introduction to clause 1, perhaps I might indulge you,
Mr. Pope, by setting out the context of the Bill and talking
about Part 1, which includes clauses 1 to 6, because of the intricate
way in which those clauses are interrelated. I think that that would be
relevant to this clause stand part
debate.</div><a name="08062496000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill and White Paper are structured around four key principles. The
first is ensuring good parenting from every person involved in these
children&#146;s lives. The second is giving young children a voice in
the decisions that affect their future. The third is ensuring stability
and continuity and the fourth is raising the aspirations of children in
care. Part 1 will enable us to pilot social work practices. It will
allow local authorities to delegate some of their social service
functions to more autonomous practices that will be charged with
putting the principles into
practice.</div><a name="08062496000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are all aware of the many problems faced by looked-after children. We
have heard of cases of children seeing as many as 30 different social
workers and going through nine or 10 care placements within a few
years. We cannot expect young people to set out on the path to success
that we are all aiming for if they are living from one month to the
next and are reluctant to make ties, whether to social workers, schools
or foster carers, lest they be broken. That experience of care often
comes on top of horrific experiences such as abuse and neglect. The
outcomes for looked-after children are far too
poor.</div><a name="08062496000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
White Paper sets out action that we will take on a number of fronts.
One of those is to test whether the social work practices introduced
under part 1 provide the right framework and deliver significant
improvements for children and young people in care. I will set out how
the clauses in part 1 fit together because they are intimately
connected. That will give a broader view of what we are trying to
achieve.</div><a name="08062496000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
1 provides that local authorities can delegate their social service
functions relating to looked-after children and care leavers to social
work practices, referred to in the Bill
as</div><a name="08062496000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;providers
of social work
services&#148;.</div><a name="08062496000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
thinking behind that is to give social workers a sense of ownership and
control over their work. That should stimulate greater innovation and
support better relationships with children. Social work practices might
be a good thing for social work as well as for our most vulnerable
children. That is why we are committed to giving local authorities,
which are dedicated to providing improved outcomes for their children
in care, the opportunity to try this new
approach.</div><a name="08062496000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
provided for in the later clauses, we intend to run a set of
tightly-controlled pilots for evaluation purposes, lasting initially
for two years. Those pilot arrangements are likely to continue in place
while the decision is made whether to roll out the model more widely.
My Department will select the local authorities that will pilot social
work practices and will assist with the set-up and operation of the
pilots in partnership with the sector. Crucially, that will include the
Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of
Children&#146;s Services, which is already closely engaged. Together,
we will develop tools for the pilots, including a model contract, a
payment structure and a proactive contract-management approach to
support effective operation.</div>

David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): Is my hon. Friend aware
that the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance for England is concerned
about the possible loss of human rights protection for children in and
leaving care because of contracted-out services? Is it his view that
the architecture of the Bill preserves their human rights protections
or is it within his contemplation that they will lose them under the
pilots?</div><a name="08062496000049"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000319"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> It is our view that they will keep their human
rights protections under the Bill. We will explore that in more detail
as we consider the Bill further, but in our view there is no reason why
their human rights should not be protected. We consider that social
work practices will be a functional public authority. Arrangements with
providers of social work services under the clause will be
fundamentally different from the arrangements in the case of YL
<i class="I">v.</i> Birmingham city council, which is the source of the concerns.
In that case, the majority of the House of Lords concluded that a
private care home was not exercising functions of a public nature. That
is the source of the concerns. In reaching that conclusion their
Lordships lay great emphasis laid great emphasis on the fact that a
private care home was not exercising any delegated statutory functions.
In other words, there was no duty on the local authority to provide
care and accommodation to Mrs. YL under section 21 of the
National Assistance Act 1948. The authority&#146;s statutory duty was
to arrange for the provision of care and accommodation, and that duty
had not been contracted out or delegated to the care home. However, the
functions subject to arrangements under the clause will be functions of
the local authority itself. Primary and secondary legislation imposes
those functions, so their discharge, by social work practice providers,
will be funded by the local authority. For those reasons, we strongly
consider it to be absolutely clear that providers of social work
practice will be discharging functions of a public nature. I hope that
that reassures my hon.
Friend.</div><a name="08062496000285"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="08062496000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
clauses in this part of the Bill provide context. Clause 2 restricts
the functions that the local authority can delegate to social work
practices. Those restrictions are important to ensure quality and focus
in the services offered. In particular, the independent reviewing
officer role will remain with the local authority: the IRO will have an
important role to play in the social work practice model, as it is a
mechanism whereby the local authority can quality assure the social
work service provider in relation to individual
cases.</div><a name="08062496000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
3 confirms that the local authority can be accountable for the acts and
omissions of a social work practice. I am sure that we will come on to
that in more detail, as we go through the
clauses.</div>
<a name="08062496000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000320"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Will the social work practices engage in
preventive and family support work, as well as taking responsibility
for the child once it has been taken into
care?</div><a name="08062496000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000321"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> No. The intention is that social work practices
will deal with children in care. The type of children whom we
anticipate, and the report anticipated, will be looked after by social
work practices are those who are in care and who may be likely to
remain in care 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>for a long time, because they are the ones most affected by the problems
that we have identified of instability and change, including in the
number of social workers that they face during their time in
care.</div>
<a name="08062496000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 4
provides for regulation of social work practices. It requires those who
run SWPs to be registered with Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of
education, children&#146;s services and skills and subject to regular
inspection. It will also enable us to issue national minimum standards
for social work practices and to make regulations under the Care
Standards Act 2000 in respect of social work practices, as we have done
in relation to other establishments and agencies covered by that
Act.</div><a name="08062496000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
5 is important because it provides that the local authority power to
contract with providers of social work services in clause 1 is a social
services function for the purposes of the Local Authority Social
Services Act 1970. That means that the Secretary of State will be able
to issue statutory guidance and give directions to the local authority
about the use of the power.</div>
<a name="08062496000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 6 is
critical to our work on social work practices. It provides the context
for clause 1 by allowing the social work practices set up under clause
1 to be piloted. The model&#146;s operation needs to be tested before
we can judge whether it will deliver significantly better outcomes for
looked-after children, which is why genuine pilots are needed. We will
ensure that they are proper trials so that comparisons can be made on a
like-for-like basis. We need to support the set up of pilots, but it is
not in the interests of looked-after children for us to prop up the
pilots artificially, so that they can only succeed and not fail. We
would be failing looked-after children if we did
that.</div><a name="08062496000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to make rational decisions based on the pilots. We want to be
innovative and do things in the true spirit of social work&#151;a
dedication to social progress and to being bold and ambitious for our
looked-after children, which, after all, is the purpose of the Bill. We
must be prepared to try out new ideas such as social work practices. On
that basis, I commend clause 1 to the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000322"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Perhaps I can ask for your indulgence,
Mr. Pope, given that in the first six clauses, amendments
have been tabled only to clause 6. If I speak in general terms about
these clauses, as the Minister did, we will be able to speed through
part 1. I will identify some of the problems that social work practices
aim to tackle, and then I have a list of questions about the detail for
the
Minister.</div><a name="08062496000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree in principle with the setting up and piloting of social work
practices, so we want to engage constructively. Clause 1 gives local
authorities the power to enter into arrangements to contract out their
services and responsibilities. As I understand it, the arrangements
will be similar to the way that GPs operate in GP practices or
barristers in chambers in taking on work. We agree in principle because
we desperately need to
innovate.</div><a name="08062496000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
year, the Conservative party set up commission on social work, which I
chaired. We produced a worthwhile report, which was well received. It
dealt with a wide panoply of problems that face the social worker
profession, starting with the fact that social workers are simply not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>valued in the eyes of the public and particularly in the eyes of the
tabloid press. The standing of social workers is worryingly low, yet
they should be regarded as the fourth emergency service. They are as
essential to the maintenance of a vulnerable child and his or her
family as teachers, doctors, health professionals and others, but they
are not regarded on an equal footing. We support anything in principle
that could contribute to raising the game of social workers and raising
the perception of social
workers.</div><a name="08062496000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Too
often, social workers are seen as surrogate child snatchers. Too often,
the first contact that a vulnerable family has with a social worker is
the knock on the door to initiate care proceedings. Many of us would
like to see social workers instead working constructively and
preventively with vulnerable families at an early stage, doing
everything possible to keep families together, rather than adding to
the 61,000 children in
care.</div><a name="08062496000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must remember that the majority of children in the care system are
returned to their families within a year. It is therefore particularly
important that the social worker&#151;preferably the same one
throughout&#151;establishes and maintains good relations with the
child, who may have to go into care temporarily, and with the family to
whom, hopefully, the child will
return.</div><a name="08062496000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
welcome anything that will provide innovation and an antidote to the
demotivation felt by many social workers. In parts of London and other
inner-city areas vacancy rates for social workers are as high as 20 per
cent. As our commission reported, many social workers complain about
the excessive bureaucracy, which means that too many of them spend too
much time in front of computer screens and filling in forms, rather
than in front of children and families trying to sort out problems at
the sharp end. They complain that they are too often reactive rather
than proactive, and that they are demonised in the
press.</div><a name="08062496000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
interesting report was produced by the children&#146;s rights
director in July 2006, which was all about the comments of children in
the care system about social workers and the social work system. We
should never forget to focus on the views of the children. The report
outlined the sorts of problems that social worker practices will have
to deal with. Typical comments were that a child&#146;s social worker
had moved them on when they were just settling down in a placement;
that children should not have had to stop all contact with their birth
families or have been split up from their friends; that social workers
should not ignore the views and feelings of young children; that social
workers kept changing; that social workers who were leaving were not
good at passing information on to whoever took on the child; and that
it was important that children got on with their social
worker.</div><a name="08062496000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must remember that young people in the care system have very little say
on who their social worker is. That is an important consideration for
social work practices. All those challenges are faced by social workers
now, when they are attached to local authorities, in dealing with
children in the care system. The problems will not go away just because
we have a new structure of social work practices. Those practices are
now being
piloted.</div><a name="08062496000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recently met a group of children from the care system in Warwickshire,
who came down with the cabinet member for children&#146;s services
there. Warwickshire has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>been piloting a pledge and has set up a board of children in the care
system, so that they can give their views. They have come up with some
good things. Some of their observations were that social workers were
not good at returning their calls, that social workers should turn up
to appointments on time and take an interest in what children do and
say. They also said that social workers need to keep promises, that
children need to see more of their social workers, and that social
workers should get to know the children, perhaps by taking them out
rather than staying in the house asking questions. Those are all
challenges that social work practices will have to deal
with.</div><a name="08062496000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
report was issued just last week by Ofsted on the views of parents of
children in the care system on how the children were looked after, and
more importantly on how they were being kept in touch in with them. As
I said, the majority of those children will go back to their birth
family or members of their extended family after a short spell in care.
More than a quarter of parents said that they had not seen their
child&#146;s care plan, and some did not even know what a care plan
was. A quarter did not know whether the council planned for their child
to return home. What sort of a relationship is that, if parents do not
know if there is a prospect of their child coming back home and what
the family have to do to recreate a stable environment for the child to
come back to? The report also showed that 44 per cent. of parents did
not have a say in their child&#146;s care plan, and 38 per cent. did
not agree to the plan. Fifty nine per cent. of parents said that there
had been no support from the local council to help to prevent their
children from going into care in the first place. More than three
quarters of parents said that they got no or not enough council
support, including help with the child being returned to
them.</div><a name="08062496000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are serious problems facing both children in the care system and the
families whence they come, and social workers. There are the usual
problems of high staff turnover, staff being reactive not proactive,
too much bureaucracy, money and staff flowing away from the front line,
social workers being deprived of their autonomy, children coming into
contact with too many social workers&#151;there is a lack of
continuity&#151;and children not seeing their social workers often
enough. Those are the problems facing social workers working for local
authorities now. If we are to pilot a new form of social work practice,
we need to be convinced that those new set-ups will acknowledge those
problems and will be able to deal with them head-on and come up with
solutions. At the moment that does not happen
often.</div><a name="08062496000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062496000323"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): Does my hon. Friend
agree that one of the problems is cost? The cost may be different for
those employed social workers to those in secondary accommodation. Can
he explain how that will affect the
composition?</div><a name="08062496000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000324"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. One of the
questions I wish to ask the Minister is about how the finances will
work out. It is important not to look at a charge or a social work
practice in isolation. We must look at the overall cost of the
child&#146;s experience and the overall effect on all social work
practices and social work departments within local authorities. We do
not want Peter to rob Paul, and we do not want to see 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>knock-on effects on other children. We do not want to see something
beneficial happening for a child in a short intensive burst because
there is extra finance available, only for that child then to slip back
into some of the problems they experienced before. It is important we
take an holistic approach and consider the social worker profession and
practices and practitioners within local
authorities.</div>
<a name="08062496000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="08062496000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
bottom line must be the outcomes for children. I am concerned primarily
with that, as I am sure that all of us in the Committee are. The
structures are secondary to achieving the right results for children in
the care system&#151;the most vulnerable children of all&#151;who
are the subject of this welcome Bill.</div>
<a name="08062496000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have sat in
family courts, and my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich has
made a profession in cases and I am sure will have seen this first
hand. The last time, I sat in on several cases and had lunch and talked
with the judge afterwards. He said that in every case that had come
before him that morning, the social worker present was not the one who
had started the case when he had first heard it weeks or months before.
Interestingly, in almost every case in the court that I went to, the
social worker was Australian and was actually a very good social
worker. Many of them come over here, and we are grateful that they do,
because there are many gaps in the profession, as we know. However in
many cases, unfortunately, they are not going to be around for a long
time. That lack of continuity is deeply worrying in an area where,
above all, we need continuity and stability for vulnerable children and
their families. Will social work practices provide greater continuity
than the stressed and under pressure social work departments of local
authorities do now?</div>
<a name="08062496000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are big
disparities within the system and between different local authorities.
That is one of my biggest concerns. For example, if one looks at the
records, one can find authorities where children have had had three or
more placements within the previous 12 months. Three or more placements
represents enormous upheaval for a vulnerable child who, in many cases,
has come from unsettled and threatening backgrounds. Why is there such
an enormous disparity between different
authorities?</div><a name="08062496000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
latest figures that I have been able to get out of the
Minister&#146;s Department show that as of March 2007 in Cornwall,
23.5 per cent. of children had had three or more placements in the
previous 12 months&#151;almost a quarter had experienced the
considerable turmoil of going into different foster parents, or
residential or other care in the preceding 12 months. How can being
moved that often contribute to reconstructing a degree of stability,
such as being able to stay at the same school and with the same group
of friends? I do not know why the turnover in placements was
considerable in Cornwall in particular&#151;it may have been an
exceptional year. In Stoke-on-Trent the figure was 19.1 per cent. One
imagines that the problem may be more severe in inner cities where
there are difficulties recruiting social workers, but, in contrast, the
figure for the London borough of Barnet was just 5.4 per cent. There
will always be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>divergence between local authorities&#151;they deal with different
demographics and different challenges&#151;but that is an enormous
range of
experiences.</div><a name="08062496000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the biggest challenges that the Government face is how to get
greater conformity in achievement and, preferably, get nearer to the
Barnet level of 5.4 per cent. Barnet has an excellent children&#146;s
services department: it invested in its children&#146;s services and
social workers five or six years ago and is now harvesting the
benefits. Can the Minister assure me that social work practices will go
some way to decreasing the enormous divergence of experience in those
and the other statistics relating to the achievements and outcomes of
looked-after children? Will the Minister target some of the worst or
some of the best local authorities in that range as part of the nine
pilots? I do not think that the prospective pilots have been named
yet.</div>
<a name="08062496000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
many other examples of good practice; I and other hon. Members
mentioned some on Second Reading last week, so I will not go over that
again. My point is that social work practices will not be the universal
panacea to the problems of instability among the social work
profession. We need to innovate and encourage the many voluntary
organisations&#151;NCH do a lot of preventive family support, which I
mentioned last week and Community Service Volunteers do a fantastic
volunteer social worker programme.</div>
<a name="08062496000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government tasked Professor Le Grand to chair the social care practices
working group, which was established by the then Department of
Education and Skills in November 2006. An eminent group of men and
women served on that group, including Alistair Pettigrew, who was the
director of children&#146;s social care in Lewisham and a member of
the Conservative party commission on social work, Lynne Berry, who was
the chief executive of the General Social Care Council and has also
made a contribution to our commission, and Paul Fallon, who was the
head of children&#146;s services in Barnet and to whom I am sure much
of the credit is due for the excellent figures that I have just
mentioned.</div>
<a name="08062496000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The social
care practices working group recommended the preferred model of a
professional partnership grouping of between six and 10 partners, the
majority of whom should be social workers, and the clauses suggest that
the Government have adopted that model. Interestingly, the group
recommended that the payment arrangements would allow a fixed baseline
amount to be paid to the social work practice by the local authority
and that a bonus unit based should be based on the outcome that the
social work practice achieves, presumably measured through the outcomes
for the children. Again, further detail on how that will work would be
useful, as they things come back to the financing of the practices, as
my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight mentioned.</div>
<a name="08062496000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1
leaves the details of the commissioning arrangements to regulations,
which we do not yet have. As so often happens in Public Bill
Committees, we are grasping in the dark for what the regulations that
will bring these provisions into force will look like.</div>
<a name="08062496000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
for your indulgence, Mr. Pope, while I was trying to set the
scene. I think that that is important, but members of the Committee can
be assured that I will not repeat the process for the remaining
clauses. However, I have a few additional questions for the Minister.
We want assurances that the pilots will be meaningful and not just be
set up so that they can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>report and move seamlessly into being the norm across the country. I
will be delighted if they are successful and have much to offer, but
they are controversial and a number of concerns have been raised by
professionals, local government and authorities about the knock-on
effect that the pilots might have on existing local authority-led
social work departments.</div>
<a name="08062496000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister tell us how the pilots will be evaluated, so that they will
not just be nodded through, and will he confirm that that evaluation
will assess the knock-on effects on the local authorities and the
actual outcomes for the children involved, so that we do not risk
simply creaming off some of the best social workers from local
authority departments to join the social work practices? If the pilots
are successful, they should also have a positive knock-on effect for
social workers by attracting more people into the profession and
improving standards of social workers
overall.</div><a name="08062496000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Stafford rightly mentioned the human rights dimension,
because the Bill does not say that social work practices, as providers
of services, will be functional public authorities, which I think is
the technical term that the Human Rights Act uses. That was left
hanging in the air after the debate in the Lords, so further details
from the Minister would be welcome.</div>
<a name="08062496000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the level
of qualifications held by the social workers who are likely to work
within the practices, one presumes that they will be registered social
workers who are regulated by the General Social Care Council, but who
will register and inspect those practices during the pilot period? They
will, of course, be dealing with real children, because this is not
just a dummy pilot in a dummy cockpit somewhere. The pilots will have
real social workers dealing with children in the care system who have
real problems and challenges. Clearly, they must be monitored and
regulated in the same way that we would expect social workers to be
when working directly for the local authority. Does the Minister know
where the pilots are likely to be? He does not necessarily need to list
the nine or so recommended pilots, but does he anticipate that the
range of areas will give a cross-section of different
experiences?</div><a name="08062496000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
Unison has some grave concerns. I am not pleading the case for Unison,
but it made some relevant points in the brief that we received. It
questioned whether social work practices would lack the leverage to
facilitate access to other local authority services for looked-after
children. That is a fair point. Dealing with vulnerable children
desperately needs an holistic approach. A social worker must deal with
the local school and the local education authority, and with the
housing department of the local authority if accommodation is involved.
Can the Minister assure us that social worker practices will have the
authority and standing to have that sort of relationship with
colleagues, even though those colleagues will be at arm&#146;s
length, as they will be within the local
authority?</div><a name="08062496000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unison
is also concerned that the proposals will fragment the child&#146;s
journey through the care system and work against continuity. If the
proposals are to be successful, they must address that and social work
practices must provide greater continuity than there is now. Unison
also refers to the fact that the Government have issued a prospectus
canvassing interest from local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>authorities. Perhaps the Minister could update us on how expressions of
interest are going and how advanced that process
is.</div><a name="08062496000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
principle, we warmly welcome the proposals set out in clauses 1 to 6
and the innovation that they represent. We hope that the move will be
successful, but we need to be convinced of how it will be successful
and how that success will be judged. We need to be assured that a
proper holistic evaluation of the pilot will take place. We will have
more to say about the timing of that under clause 6. I am sure that the
Minister will reply to some of our concerns. Most importantly,
professionals who are expected to transfer to these practices and those
who will work alongside them must feel reassured rather than threatened
by these controversial, but potentially exciting, provisions of the
Bill.</div><a name="08062496000087"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000325"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before we go any further, I must say that
not for the first time in my inauspicious career as a Chairman of
Committees I have been too lax. I can see that hon. Members want to
point out that clause 1 is related to clauses 2 to 5. It is reasonable
to refer to that in passing, but in future we will have more tightly
drawn clause stand part
debates.</div><a name="08062496000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000326"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I intend to be fairly brief so that I do not
repeat what has already been said. I may stray over all six clauses
because then those will be over and done with, but I promise not to
make the same points
again.</div><a name="08062496000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must remember throughout this process to focus on the individual child.
We all get dragged into using generic terms such as looked-after
children for those who will be in the system for a long time, but we
must think about individual children and what they have told us over
and over again about the strengths and weaknesses of their
relationships with their social workers. It is important to appreciate
that there are many strong relationships, but a number children do not
feel that they have been supported sufficiently. Their views on this
matter are
all-important.</div><a name="08062496000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said on Second Reading, I have some reservations about social work
practices. I want to achieve the very best for our children so I do not
have any reservations about the pilots. They will help us to see
whether we can improve the relationships between children and their
social workers. As has been said, the key to that is a stable, highly
qualified work force that is responsive to the needs of children. That
needs working on across the
board.</div><a name="08062496000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree that it is important to look at local authorities and social work
practices together to ensure that we achieve an overall gain. It is
important that this is not a zero-sum game in which we lose in one
respect as we gain in another, hence my earlier intervention on the
Minister. Social work practices will be very focused on one objective.
It is an important objective, but we must be assured that the important
preventive work and family support work is being provided by highly
qualified social
workers.</div><a name="08062496000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="08062496000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
evaluations will be key in the pilots. Will the Minister consider
having independent annual evaluations in the same way as for academies?
Social work practices could be just as important as academies in giving
a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>different approach. The evaluations should be independent and the
outcomes should be looked at by a multi-disciplinary group of
stakeholders. It is important that social work practices are keyed in
to all of the other services and the multi-disciplinary approach that
is worked towards in &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;. It would be
dreadful to achieve in one dimension while things slip through the net
in
another.</div><a name="08062496000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also important to not focus just on piloting social work practices.
I am sure that there will be many innovations within local authorities.
We should be looking at those to ensure that we are spreading good
practice. My colleague in the other place, Baroness Sharp, mentioned
that the Children&#146;s Workforce Development Council is currently
seeking bids to trial new arrangements for social workers in 18 local
authorities. Those trials will remodel social work teams to improve the
recruitment and retention of social workers and other social care
staff. They will aim to increase early intervention work and tackle
bureaucracy. We need lots of innovative practice and we always need to
be
evaluating.</div><a name="08062496000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Social
care practices are in the Bill so they have a high profile, but we
should evaluate them fully before extending the pilots. Most
importantly, we should look at the outcomes for all the services
dealing with looked-after children. We want the pilots to proceed, but
we are asking for a more holistic approach that will look at the whole
system in this
area.</div><a name="08062496000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000327"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I will attempt to respect your infallibility,
Mr. Pope. However, I think that it would be appropriate to
respond to the debate that we have had. We will then have to be very
tight in our debates on the following
clauses.</div><a name="08062496000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members have raised a number of questions on the pilots of social work
practices. I welcome the tone of those questions in supporting the need
to innovate and try out new ideas where we know that the system has not
been serving vulnerable children as well as it should have been. We
have a moral obligation to try out good ideas when they come forward.
That is what we are doing in part 1 and in clause 1 in
particular.</div><a name="08062496000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will deal first with the points raised by the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham. The Government recognise the need to support
social workers in doing their difficult and important jobs. We were
pleased that the commission that he chaired on behalf of his political
party supported many of the Government&#146;s commitments,
innovations and approaches in this area. The Government is investing
over &#163;73 million in &#147;The Children&#146;s Plan: Building
brighter futures&#148;. We published the document earlier this year;
I have a copy with me, and members of the Committee are welcome to one.
The aim of that plan is to tackle recruitment and retention and improve
capacity and morale over the next three years in the social care work
force, including piloting newly qualified social worker status. It will
also look at workloads and at the bureaucracy surrounding social
workers, which are key issues, particularly against the background of
high vacancy rates and turnover in some areas.</div>
<a name="08062496000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that
reason the Department has commissioned the Children&#146;s Workforce
Development Council to pilot&#151;as the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset
and North Poole mentioned&#151;other approaches with local
authorities, to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>remodel the delivery of social work and understand how best to configure
roles, capacity and support, with the aim of improving the outcomes for
and the experiences of vulnerable children, young people and
families.</div><a name="08062496000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
it is not just about this pilot; there is a broader agenda as the hon.
Lady rightly pointed out. Local authorities involved in those pilots
are testing a wide range of approaches, including consideration of the
roles of admin staff in social work teams, and the roles of social
workers in multi-agency teams, as well as the newly qualified social
worker pilots, which will provide managed case-loads for new social
workers in their first year&#146;s employment in children&#146;s
settings. I have a copy of the information on the Children&#146;s
Workforce Development Council pilot programmes, which gives an
additional flavour to our discussion about the piloting of social work
practices. Those pilots are in the Bill because we have to legislate in
order for them to be carried out, not because we seek to feature them
or put them above the other pilots and innovations in this
area.</div><a name="08062496000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham also mentioned the
registration of social workers. Clause 2 will require the local
authority functions being discharged by a social work practice to be
discharged by or under the supervision of registered social workers.
There was also a query on how the pilots would be regulated and
scrutinised. Many people will pay close attention to the work of social
work practices in the pilot phase. As part of the contract management
process, the local authority will keep a close eye on the outcomes
delivered by the practices, and the independent reviewing officer will
review and challenge&#151;that is the key point&#151;their work in
relation to the individual children they serve. Ofsted will take a
broader look as part of the new inspection arrangements for local
areas, which include programmed inspections focusing on the quality of
services for looked-after children. In addition, we expect that there
will be regular scrutiny of the standards of practice in social work
practices, to support national monitoring and evaluation of the social
work practice
model.</div><a name="08062496000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham also asked whether social
work practices will provide greater continuity of outcome. Our aim is
to find out whether they can. We believe that they have the potential
to bring greater continuity and stability for looked-after children,
and that there is sufficient evidence to legislate in this way.
However, we are not pre-judging that, because we need to ensure that
the pilot is genuine. That is why we are testing the model as outlined
in the
clauses.</div><a name="08062496000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to finances and the overall effect of social work practices,
which hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Isle of Wight,
mentioned, it is absolutely clear that we must look at social work
practices on a level playing field. There is no point making this the
sort of pilot that is set up to succeed. We want to set up genuine
pilots that will be independently evaluated. The funding that we are
providing, &#163;2 million per annum for the six to nine pilots
across the country, is intended only to support the initial set-up
costs.</div>
<a name="08062496000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities receive &#163;5 billion a year from the Government, of
which approximately &#163;300 million is &#147;Care Matters&#148;
implementation plan funding. Of that, roughly &#163;6 million will be
available for social work pilots over their period. In many ways, they
will be no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>more generously funded than the other pilots that have been referred to,
such as the Children&#146;s Workforce Development Council pilots,
which the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned. There
is a level playing
field.</div><a name="08062496000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a point that hon. Members are concerned about, we will ensure that the
impact on wider services and other children is an integrated part of
the evaluation of the pilots. We want to judge them not in isolation
from the rest of the social work world but in the context of any
potential impact or knock-on effects. As the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham said, if they are successful and work for social
workers as well as the young people with whom they deal, there is
long-term potential for them to act as a magnet to attract people into
the
profession.</div><a name="08062496000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000328"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> One comment that is often made by young people is
that they want potential 24-hour-a-day contact. Although that might
sound demanding, as a parent one is used to receiving phone calls at
all times of the day. Does the Minister feel that social work practices
will be able to give something extra to get closer to that parental
contact? Will there be in the contracts reasons for somebody to be on
tap for a longer
period?</div><a name="08062496000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000329"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> The hon. Lady makes a valuable point. We have
already found in some of the expressions of interest from third sector
organisations that are interested in running social work practices that
they feel they will be able to be more flexible, providing not a
nine-to-five service but one that is available longer. In one case, I
believe that it was to be until 10pm, with special payments available
for people who were called out during later hours. That is perhaps a
more personal and individual service than there might be from the
emergency team in a local authority. There is potential for the
out-of-hours service that she refers to in the social work practice
model. Again, that is only potential, and we will we not prejudge
whether that will happen in practice. We shall ensure that the wider
impact of the practices is taken into account in the
evaluation.</div><a name="08062496000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
funding of social work practices will be set out in their contract with
the local authority, which will be crucial. Like any other contact, it
will set out the services to be provided, the standards to which they
will be provided and the payments that the local authority will make.
Crucially, as the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, an
element of the contract will be outcomes-based. It is important that we
ensure that social work practices have the incentive to
improve.</div><a name="08062496000108"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): I hear what the
Minister says, but in many cases social workers are unable to perform
their statutory duties, whether health assessments or statutory visits,
purely because of the weight of bureaucracy hanging over them. I spoke
to a social worker only a few weeks ago who told me that the laptop
that used to be on the left of her desk is now in the middle, because
she spends most of her time on it. What assurances can the Minister
give that social workers will be involved in not only the evaluation
but the practice of the pilot scheme, and that they will be given the
freedom and authority to get on with their job rather than be faced
with the same bureaucracy as current social
workers?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="08062496000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000331"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I welcome the hon. Gentleman to the Committee
and, once again, to the House, and I thank him for his intervention. He
is right in the sense that one of the purposes of the social work
practices is to create a setting in which a group of professionals can
work together outwith the bureaucratic structures that they might face
working within a large social services department of a local authority,
where there may be 400 or more employees. The hon. Gentleman referred
to a GP&#146;s practice as an analogy and that may be appropriate.
Working as a team of professionals, with the ability to employ their
own admin staff to help with the natural bureaucracy of running any
small operation, they would be free to engage more directly in their
social work with
children.</div><a name="08062496000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
evaluating the pilots, we will see whether social workers will be freed
from the bureaucracy of line management and of working in a large
organisation to be able to run with the ball a little more, with clear
direction set out by the contract and by the management of the social
work practice. It will be for the local authority to decide whether to
engage a social work practice and to negotiate a costed contract,
bearing in mind its internal costs and budgets.</div>
<a name="08062496000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
supporting local authorities to improve the recruitment and retention
of social workers through learning from good practice such as that in
Barnet, which the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham mentioned.
If we could reproduce the &#147;Barnet formula&#148;&#151;to coin
a phrase&#151;across the country, we would all think that we had
successfully implemented the care matters implementation plan. I
acknowledge the progress that has been made in
Barnet.</div><a name="08062496000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mentioned the newly qualified social worker status programme, which
will be targeted, early on, in those areas where there are recruitment
difficulties&#151;London and the west midlands&#151;and will use a
major marketing campaign for social workers. Obviously, we are looking
at the recruitment and retention of social workers. Social work
practices are only one remodelling approach; approaches have been
mentioned.</div>
<a name="08062496000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000332"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Would the hon. Gentleman see the new operation
describing how people are released from the local authority by freedom
or where they have an equivalent list of responsibilities, but are a
different
body?</div><a name="08062496000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000333"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I think that I understand what the hon. Gentleman
is driving at. Basically, the social work practice will be working to a
contract agreed with the local authority, which, in effect, is
delegating services that it would otherwise provide directly. The
social work practice will have the freedom to operate as an
organisation within the contract, which draws up the services that it
is expected to deliver. On that basis I will sit
down.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000335"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> Bearing in mind what we have just debated, I will
be reasonably brief. Cause 2 restricts the functions that local
authorities can delegate to social work practices. Those restrictions
are important to ensuring quality and focus in the services offered.
The first restriction will ensure that the independent reviewing
officer role will remain with the local authorities. The independent
review officer will have an extremely important role to play under the
social work practice model, as they are the mechanism by which the
local authority will be able to quality assure the work of the provider
of social work services in relation to individual children. In that
context, the independent review officer will attend care-planning
reviews, as now, to monitor progress and make decisions about changes
as necessary. In undertaking that role, the independent review officer
will build up an important bank of knowledge about the effectiveness of
the social work practice, including its strengths and weaknesses, how
well it works with other agencies and the quality of its relationships
with children. Consistent with the IRO role, that information should
then be fed back to senior managers regularly, whether as part of wider
contract management meetings or by some other means. That information
flow will be absolutely crucial to enabling the local authority to hold
the social work practice to account meaningfully.</div>
<a name="08062496000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
restriction will ensure that social work practices cannot carry out the
local authority&#146;s functions as an adoption agency unless the
practice itself is already a registered adoption agency. That is
because we want to ensure that children who are likely to remain in
care long term are the focus of social work practices, and those are
the children who seem to suffer most from the problems with the current
system that we and other members of the Committee have identified.
Social work practices will be of most use when they develop innovative
and effective strategies for working with that group of children that
can be transferred to the local authority context and implemented
across the country. Indeed, the processes for preparing for adoption
are obviously
different.</div><a name="08062496000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third restriction that will apply to the provider of social work
services will be any restrictions applicable to the local authority by
reference to its area, such as restrictions on out-of-area placements.
That is intended to ensure consistency of treatment, despite the fact
that the functions will have been delegated between children with a
social work practice and those who remain in the care of the local
authority directly. Finally, the clause will require local authorities
to be satisfied that the functions it is to delegate to a provider of
social work practices will be discharged by or under the supervision of
registered social workers, as we have
mentioned.</div><a name="08062496000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000336"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> Clause 3 is extremely important for ensuring a
strong framework of accountability for the work of providers of social
work services. It is important to be clear that under the social work
practice model the local authority will remain the corporate parent for
looked-after children and the local authority will remain accountable
for what happens to them. Local authorities will use the children and
young person&#146;s plan to set out their priorities for local
children, including looked-after children, and inform the commissioning
of a social work
practice.</div><a name="08062496000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
local authority&#146;s director of children&#146;s services will
have oversight of the operation of the social work practice, just as
they would in relation to other local children&#146;s services
delivered directly by the local authority. In that respect, the
contract between the local authority and the social work practice will
be absolutely crucial. It is through that contract that the local
authority will set out the outcomes that the social work practices must
deliver and the framework within which they must work, including
requirements for multi-agency working and other issues relevant to the
delivery of local authority services.</div>
<a name="08062496000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once the
contract is agreed, there must be rigorous, frequent and engaged
contract management, as there is no question of the local authority
tacking its foot off the accelerator simply because of its contract
with the social work practice. We envisage a relationship of
partnership between the local authority and the social work practice,
involving regular meetings to spot potential problems early and agree
steps to put them right. The close management of the social work
practice will be important in the light of the local authority
remaining the corporate parent and retaining responsibility for the
discharge of its functions. As I explained earlier, the IRO will be
another key mechanism for ensuring
that.</div><a name="08062496000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
3 confirms that the local authority will be accountable for the acts
and omissions of the social work practice, without removing the
accountability of the practice itself. That is vital for ensuring the
proper protection of children and families supported by providers of
social work services. The local authority must remain responsible for
the discharge of its functions in relation to looked-after children,
even if it delegates some of those functions to a social work practice.
As I have said, that means that it will be accountable to the service,
provided that it remains the corporate parent of the children it looks
after, so children and their families can have the reassurance of
knowing that that claim could be pursued against the local authority
directly if things go wrong. Local authorities will require a
comprehensive contract and proactive contract
management.</div><a name="08062496000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
does not mean that the social work practice will escape liability for
its actions and failures. Its work will be sensitive, the decisions it
makes will be critical and we want to ensure that it is directly
accountable to the children and families it serves. Although clause
3(1) ensures that the local authority is accountable for the acts and
omissions of the social work practice, clause 3(2)(c) confirms that
claims may be brought against the practice in the usual way if things
go
wrong.</div><a name="08062496000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns
were raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and my
hon. Friend the Member for Stafford about the human rights
implications. I confirm what I said in response to those interventions.
Social work practices will be liable for their acts and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>omissions under the Human Rights Act 1998. Social work practices will
discharge public functions and our view is that they will automatically
come under the definition of &#147;public authority&#148; in
section 6(3)(b) of the Human Rights Act. We take that view because the
functions are imposed by legislation on the local authority and the
discharge of those functions will be paid for by the local authority
out of public
funds.</div><a name="08062496000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000337"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> Clause 4 provides for the regulation of social
work practices. It will require social work practices to be registered
with Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of education,
children&#146;s services and skills and they will be subject to
regular inspections. The clause will also enable us to issue national
minimum standards for social work practices and make regulations under
the Care Standards Act 2000, as we have for other
establishments.</div><a name="08062496000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not intend to bring the clause into force immediately. The pilot
period in clause 6 will end when clause 4 is brought into force after
there has been an evaluation of the pilots and a decision has been made
to roll the model out more widely or five years after Royal Assent,
whichever is sooner. We do not think it appropriate for social work
practices to be regulated under the 2000 Act during the pilot phase
because to introduce a new regulatory system for such a small number of
pilots would be unduly burdensome and bureaucratic. Nevertheless, we
will have the range of mechanisms that I set out earlier to monitor the
work of social care practices and assure their
quality.</div><a name="08062496000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Social
work practices will be within the scope of the annual assessments by
the inspectorates, including the chief inspector, from 2009 through the
new comprehensive care assessment and through programmed inspections of
services for children in care. Moreover, they will have to ensure that
their functions are carried out under the supervision of social workers
who are registered with the
GSCC.</div><a name="08062496000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000338"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Will the Minister say what would happen in the
scenario of a social worker who was working for one of the pilots being
struck off during the pilot period? Would it differ from what would
happen if they were working for the local authority? What additional
inspection safeguards would be triggered for such a social worker
practice, given that it would not be subject to the
GSCC?</div><a name="08062496000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000339"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> My understanding is that such a social worker
would not be able to work for the social work practice any longer. I
will correct myself if that is wrong. If there were wider implications
of that scenario for the social work practice, ultimately there would
be provision for the Government to take action centrally. Long before
that, the local authority would have the ability to terminate the
contract if events were serious 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>enough. If there was systematic failure in a social work practice, I
would expect the contract to be terminated at quite an early
stage.</div><a name="08062496000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
local authority level, there will be proactive contract management by
the local authority with input and support from the Department and
those acting on its behalf, including Government office staff. That
might involve participation in the commissioning process and attendance
at contract management meetings. They will give general advice and
guidance on commissioning and contract management issues. That will be
complemented by the individual case reviews by the independent
reviewing
officer.</div><a name="08062496000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="08062496000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there will be an independent evaluation of the social work practice
model, which we mentioned earlier, which will gather and report on
performance measuring it against a range of indicators at regular
intervals. Until we have evaluated the operation of the pilots, we will
not know whether the practice model will be extended beyond the pilot
phase and local authorities, but if it is to be continued to be used,
the services should become regulated under the Care Standards Act to
ensure high standards of practice from providers of social work
services in the long term, in the same way as any other establishment
or agency is regulated under that
Act.</div><a name="08062496000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000340"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> How will providers be released from the pilot?
Will they be obliged to work together, or will some be released and
others
not?</div><a name="08062496000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000341"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> If the independent evaluation finds that the
model as a whole has something to offer more broadly, the Government
can switch on the ability of any local authority to decide to contract
out to a social work practice. The local authority will make that
decision&#151;there will be no centrally determined or directed,
top-down Government directive ordering local authorities to use this
model. The provision will be available beyond the pilot areas to any
local authority that feels that it is an appropriate model for them.
The evaluation will consider, therefore, not whether an individual
social work practice has been successful, but whether the model itself
has something to offer to the
system.</div><a name="08062496000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

under clause 1, is a social services function for the purposes of the
Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. That means that the Secretary
of State can issue guidance and directions to the local authority about
the use of the power. That is important, because the social work
practice model is as yet untested, and we will need to put in place
mechanisms to ensure effective operation. For example, we are likely to
issue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>guidance on what must be done prior to a contract to verify the quality

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000345"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Now we have some real amendments&#151;well,
they are probing amendments, rather than real ones, so I shall not
detain the Committee too long. We have had a good debate on the concept
of social work practice already, but I am concerned about getting on
with it. Amendment No. 1 would reduce, therefore, the duration of the
pilots from five to three years, and amendment No. 2 deals with a
technicality that the Minister will probably say is not required. In
the working party report, which Professor Le Grand chaired, the time
recommended for pilots was at least two years. The recommendation
stated:</div><a name="08062496000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Group&#146;s view is that pilots would need to run for at least two
years, if not longer, to provide a sufficiently robust assessment.
Also, the Group proposes that there should be nine pilots to provide a
robust assessment&#148;.</div>
<a name="08062496000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned that it
will take too long. Why should it take at least five years to assess
whether the pilots have worked? Would it not be possible to speed
things up by having an assessment after three years? Those three years
may turn out not to be long enough&#151;all sorts of reasons for
extending the period might be raised during the development of the
schemes&#151;in which case there is nothing to stop the Government
asking for more time. It could probably be done by regulation. However,
I to do not want to see the pilots eventually being set up and running
for at least five years, with a further period of assessment being
required, further queries bring thrown up and further legislation being
required in order to give force to the status of these social worker
practices.</div>
<a name="08062496000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis
that we could find out whether or not the schemes will be a success,
the amendment would reduce the time specified from five years to three.
It is a probing amendment, and if the Minister can give us good reasons
for why five years has to be the absolute minimum, I shall be happy to
take it as read. The purpose of the amendment is to put the Minister on
the spot, to challenge the time scale and not the
principle.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000346"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I note that my noble Friend Baroness Sharp moved
similar amendments in the other place. When I read that debate, I was
concerned about the second point being made&#151;that things could
drag on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>way beyond the five years. That point needs to be addressed this
morning, which is why I partially support the amendment. My worry is
that three years might not give enough time for a robust assessment, so
I want to know how it can be extended if necessary. I share the fears
that have been raised. I can see things dragging on for about ten
years, which would be ridiculous. I therefore seek some assurance from
the Minister.</div>
<a name="08062496000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000347"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> The first amendment seeks to limit the piloting
to three years. The other seeks to ensure that the pilot period does
not start until after the powers under clause 1 have been commenced. I
acknowledge that the intention is to seek some reassurance that we will
pilot the approach of social work practices in a timely fashion and
seek further clarification on the timetable for the operation of the
pilots.</div>
<a name="08062496000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The timetable
for piloting social work practice was set out in some detail in the
other place, in the debate referred to by the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole. However, I shall repeat it because it is
important to understand the rationale behind the timetable and the
five-year period.</div>
<a name="08062496000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 6(2)
allows for clause 1 to be brought into force by reference to a
particular local authority or authorities in order to enable the
selection of local authorities to pilot the social work practice model.
Unless clause 4 is brought into effect within five years of Royal
Assent, clauses 1 to 5 will cease to have effect. We therefore have
five years to establish the pilots, allow them to run, make a thorough
evaluation of them prior to deciding whether to roll out the power to
make arrangements under clause 1 to all local authorities. Five years
is a reasonable period to undertake that work. Reducing it to three
years would compromise the effectiveness of the pilots and risk
disrupting children&#146;s lives by not allowing for the appropriate
transition periods.</div>
<a name="08062496000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
subsequent timetable for the pilots is as follows. Subject to the
successful passage of the Bill, we will move to identify local
authorities to take place in the pilots. Those local authorities will
begin commissioning social work practices in early 2009, subject to the
Bill receiving Royal Assent&#151;and subject to when it receives
Royal Assent. Detailed contract negotiations will need to take place
between the pilot local authorities and the social work practice
providers, and practical arrangements for transferring cases will need
to be put into
place.</div><a name="08062496000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aim is to have social work practices up and running, with full case
loads, by autumn 2009, and that the pilots then run for two years until
autumn 2011. During that period, evaluation evidence will be gathered.
In the fourth year, 2011-12, the independent evaluation of the pilots
will take place. We will ensure that the evaluation report is made
public, and that there is a full and proper consultation before the
model is made available to all authorities, if that is the desired
option. The full evaluation report will obviously be placed in the
Library of the
House.</div><a name="08062496000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fifth year is a necessary transition period, because if a decision is
taken to make the social work practice model available to all local
authorities, we will have to ensure that we get the regulatory regime
for social work practices right. We will have to consult on that
regime, and give the chief inspector time to prepare the inspection 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>arrangements. Those local authorities that had run the pilots would need
to commission social work practices for the post-pilot period, and
would need time to do so. If the decision were to not make the model
more widely available, the pilots would remain in place to allow a well
managed and staged transition of staff and children back to the local
authority over that year, to ensure minimum disruption to their lives.
That is an essential part of ensuring that we support the lives of the
children and young people in the pilot authorities, and it is vital to
give sufficient time for
that.</div><a name="08062496000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that members of the Committee will see that while the pilots
themselves will not last for the five-year period, we need five years
to do all the things around the piloting, including set-up, evaluation,
ensuring that we have the evidence base needed to take the right
decisions for looked-after children, and consulting on the way forward
before taking important decisions. It is also clear from the Bill that
we will need to move promptly on Royal Assent. I hope that that goes
some way towards explaining why the pilot in the Bill is set at five
years.</div><a name="08062496000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000348"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> Has the Minister envisaged an extension to the
pilot scheme&#151;currently with nine local
authorities&#151;whereby if, after the first two-year period of more
tightly controlled piloting, sufficient interest is shown by local
authorities, which will undoubtedly have been exposed to the other
pilot schemes by the nature of the cross boundaries between local
authorities, they will be allowed to participate in the scheme during
that five-year
period?</div><a name="08062496000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000349"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> It is not intended at this stage for there to be
any more pilots than the ones that we will announce. As the hon.
Gentleman says, if this model becomes immediately attractive and highly
successful and is lauded universally, there may be a queue of local
authorities desirous of taking it up at an early stage. However, the
appropriate thing to do is what we have indicated, which is to set up
the pilots that have been funded in the &#147;Care Matters&#148;
implementation plan, and to properly and independently evaluate them
before making them universally available to other local authorities. I
hope that my remarks have explained why we need five years from the
date that the Act is passed. On that basis, and given that I understand
why the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham was probing for more
detail, I hope that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="08062496000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000350"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s helpful
comments. It is clear that it is not just some five years hence and
then perhaps some after that, but that the Government appear to have a
clearer timetable, which is more rapid and concise than I had
anticipated. That is to be
welcomed.</div><a name="08062496000290"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

<a name="08062496000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the hon.
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole rose to give reluctant support I
thought that she was going to pitch for four years, and split the
difference between three and five.</div>
<a name="08062496000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that if we are to test the approach as a potential attractive
new model, we should get on with it. The assessment part of the
piloting timetable that the Government appear to have set is relatively
small&#151;not the full five years&#151;and that is helpful. I am
also encouraged 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>by the Minister&#146;s comments about proper independent evaluation
and consultation in 2011-12 as an essential part of what happens and,
looking forward to the regulatory regime, the need to construct an
inspection regime. That clarification was helpful, and I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08062496000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000352"></a>The
Minister for Children, Young People and Families (Beverley
Hughes):</b> I welcome the opportunity to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Pope. Having spent a lot of time, as my
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said, developing the White Paper, I
also welcome the opportunity to be a member of the Committee, and to
work with the other members to bring the measure to
fruition.</div><a name="08062496000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members will be aware that clause 7 was inserted into the Bill by
Members in the other place, to add the Border and Immigration Agency to
the list of agencies that are subject to section 11 of the Children Act
2004. The intention was obviously to extend to the agency the duty of
safeguarding children. I hope that all hon. Members will acknowledge
that safeguarding children has been and continues to be a top priority
for the Government.</div>
<a name="08062496000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have listened to the thoughtful and powerful arguments that
have been made on this issue about whether those responsible for
running the immigration system should have a legal duty to ensure that,
consistent with the primary duty to secure our borders, they discharge
their functions having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the
welfare of children&#151;the duty set out in section 11 of the
Children Act 2004.</div>
<a name="08062496000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome
the considerable work already undertaken by the UK Border and
Immigration Agency to implement a code of practice to protect children
from harm while they are in the UK. I hope that hon. Members will
acknowledge that the UKBA already has high standards of care compared
with similar bodies, and has worked consistently with the
Children&#146;s Commissioner for England. However, we want to go
further, learning from experience, in introducing the new
code.</div>
<a name="08062496000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
considered the arguments fully, the Home Secretary and the Secretary of
State for Children, Schools and Families have agreed that aligning the
UKBA with those agencies that are already subject to section 11 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>duty is the right thing to do for children and young people. All
agencies working with children and young people should be able to
consider how they can safeguard and promote the welfare of children.
Now is the right time to introduce a section 11 duty as part of a
reformed, streamlined immigration service, working to improve the
United Kingdom&#146;s security through stronger border protection,
while also welcoming legitimate travellers and
trade.</div><a name="08062496000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have until now concentrated, rightly, on getting the infrastructure in
place, focusing first and foremost on implementing the system. However,
the establishment of UKBA now provides an opportunity to bring a
stronger focus not just on the status of children and young people
arriving in the UK, but on their safety and welfare.</div>
<a name="08062496000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that we make the right legislative provision, to bind the
UKBA effectively into a section 11 duty, while taking account of the
agency&#146;s particular distribution of legal functions, and its
UK-wide remit. The current provision in the Bill does not address the
proposed organisation of UKBA, nor does it encompass that range of its
functions.</div>
<a name="08062496000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today, the
Government are giving a public commitment to pursue a section 11 duty
for UKBA, but we intend to do so not in this Bill but in the
forthcoming immigration Bill, which will be published in draft in July.
The intention is that it will be introduced in the 2008-09 Session, and
I therefore want to give Members notice of my intention to introduce an
amendment on Report to remove clause 7 from the Children and Young
Persons Bill. It is right that the duty affects the operation of UKBA
not just in England and Wales but throughout the UK. It is also right
that we take the necessary time and effort to work with colleagues to
find a legislative solution that is accepted throughout the UK, works
consistently in the interests of children and young people throughout
the UK, and is consistent with, and obviously does not undermine, the
integrity of our asylum and immigration system.</div>
<a name="08062496000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
Members will accept the Government&#146;s intentions and the
commitment that I have given today, and will support the way in which
we intend to proceed.</div>
<a name="08062496000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000353"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
comments. She did give us slight prior notice of her intention, and
that was helpful. I shall make some comments about why the principle
behind clause 7 is important, and welcome, cautiously, what the
Minister said.</div>
<a name="08062496000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 7 was
added to the Bill in the other House, when an amendment moved by my
noble Friend Baroness Morris of Bolton received widespread support from
all parts of the House and was passed by more than 50 votes. So, there
is widespread support for its inclusion, and those of us who were
around for the proceedings of the Children Act 2004 had a debate then
about whether it should have been included on the list in what is now
section 11 of the 2004 Act. Section 11 contains 13 different agencies
on whom there has been placed a duty to safeguard and promote the
welfare of children, ranging from the obvious, such as
children&#146;s services authorities, to strategic health
authorities, youth offending teams and so on. We had a lot of debate
about which of those should have been added.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div><a name="08062496000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Four years on,
this Bill represented the next opportunity to place a duty on the
immigration services, and some would say that it has been four years
too long, that we should not have to wait any longer and that we had
hoped that it would go through in clause 7. However, having said that,
I appreciate that clause 7 is technically deficient. The Minister
alluded to the fact that the Border and Immigration Agency has become
the UK Border Agency, and it cannot be covered because it is a UK-wide
body that the Bill does not therefore deal with. There was a problem
with the way in which clause 7, which was perfectly well intentioned,
was fashioned in the other House. The problem needed to be dealt with,
and clearly, those who supported the inclusion of the clause will need
to see the detail that the Minister has promised to produce in draft
with the Bill in July&#151;before the summer recess, I hope. We are
taking a deal on trust, but one is heartened by the Minister saying
that it is the right thing to do and that she is intent on introducing
the duty in principle.</div>
<a name="08062496000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Importantly,
however, if the provision is to be effective, it must lead to a culture
change in the immigration service. We are dealing with very vulnerable
children who come to this country seeking asylum as refugees, and with
trafficked children. This is a group&#151;in some cases,
unfortunately, a growing group&#151;of very vulnerable children who
desperately need all agencies with whom they come into contact, placed
under a duty to safeguard and promote their welfare, to act in their
best interests.</div>
<a name="08062496000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
useful to firm up the Minister&#146;s commitment that a duty equal to
the weight of that carried in section 11 of the 2004 Act would be
introduced in the new legislation. As there are two Departments
involved&#151;the Home Office, with which the Minister has personal
experience, and the Department of Children, Schools and
Families&#151;it might be useful to know which is to be the lead
Department. In that way, children&#146;s interests will not be
swallowed up in the Home Office and the DCSF will have an ongoing role
in monitoring how this duty pans out, as it has for the 13 other bodies
already covered under the 2004 Act.</div>
<a name="08062496000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the Bill to be produced before the recess is a draft Bill for the
Queen&#146;s Speech, we are looking at the actual Bill being
published in December. We could be waiting at least another year for it
to come into effect after the passing of the legislation. We could be
looking at a delay of more than five years from the first opportunity
to include the immigration authorities within the Bill in
2004.</div>
<a name="08062496000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister assure us, insofar as she can be responsible for Government
timetabling of Bills, that this will be seen as a priority? Can
anything be done in the meantime in terms of clear guidance from her
Department, or jointly with the Home Secretary&#151;not backed up by
statutory duty yet&#151;so that the immigration authorities can at
least prepare on the basis of a strong likelihood and a firm intention
by the Government that a formal statutory duty will be placed upon them
in the not-too-distant future?</div>
<a name="08062496000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish
in any way to denigrate or undermine the important processes that
currently happen within the immigration service, greatly under pressure
as it is. We have to balance what is achievable and practical without
placing the service under undue pressures, which might have knock-on
effects.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div><a name="08062496000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are dealing
with perhaps the most vulnerable subsets of children and it is
imperative that this is taken seriously and introduced unequivocally on
an equal basis to the current section 11 arrangements. Everything
possible must be done to speed up its introduction. Any comments from
the Minister on that score would be greatly
appreciated.</div><a name="08062496000191"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000354"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I congratulate the Minister for Children, Young
People and Families because I am sure that there has been considerable
dialogue between the two Departments. I welcome this as a step
forward.</div>
<a name="08062496000192"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">I
agree with the Minister that the Government have made safeguarding
children a top priority and I have been proud to be a Member of
Parliament during that period. It has to be said, however, there has
been a dual system of safeguarding: one for children who are UK
citizens and then the others. Surely, every child matters and we should
be putting the child first throughout, regardless of
status?</div>
<a name="08062496000291"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
<a name="08062496000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that
we will need to see the detail before making detailed comments. I hope
that all the organisations will be fully engaged&#151;they come under
the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium&#151;in determining the
details and the timetable. I, too, must express concern about the time
that this has taken. I remember our discussions in the Committee that
considered the 2004 Act when I joined forces with Hilton Dawson, the
former Member for Lancaster and Wyre, on this issue, as the Minister
will recall. I am sad that it has taken four years; nevertheless the
fact that we have reached the right conclusion is
welcome.</div><a name="08062496000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am aware that a halfway house&#151;&#147;Better
Outcomes&#148;&#151;has been discussed with the immigration
authorities, and I wonder what can be done in the interim between
making the momentous announcement today and the final implementation of
the measures. Because there is a change in culture, we could be doing a
lot more in the pathway to the legislation being passed. I, too,
recognise that clause 7 was technically deficient, but my greatest
regret is the time we waited, plus the long delay for the next
immigration Bill. Overall, however, we are taking a step in the right
direction.</div><a name="08062496000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062496000355"></a><b class="B">Mark

to which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole
referred between the DCSF and the Home Office, what discussions have
taken place or will take place with the National Assembly Government in
Wales, not least because we are in the vexed area of a reserved matter,
which is delivered in a devolved context? That also applies to
colleagues in
Scotland.</div><a name="08062496000196"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000356"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> First, let me say how very much I welcome the
responses from Opposition Members and their recognition that our
intention is genuine. I am pleased that we can now move forward in the
way that I outlined. I am also pleased that they acknowledged, as the
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham intimated, the difficult
tensions and dilemmas in maintaining effective immigration controls.
No-one on this Committee  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>is more acutely aware of those difficulties than I. It is important that
our nation not attract organised traffickers shipping children across
to England because it looks like being an easy place to stay for anyone
who manages to get here. We must balance that with our desire to
safeguard and protect children while they are here, although the
majority will not end up with the right to remain here. Sometimes, that
balance is genuinely difficult to
strike.</div><a name="08062496000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have moved
forward. It is not that nothing has happened during the past four
years. The BIA has a duty to protect children from harm and a code of
practice has been developed to which the agency is now working, but as
is often the case in politics, things have moved on, and it has become
possible to take further steps because of a change in context. It is
largely due to the effective way in which the Government have been able
to reassure people about immigration control that we have a different
context in which we can move forward and the immigration agency has
moved forward. I am pleased that we have reached that
point.</div><a name="08062496000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
to answer another point raised by the hon. Gentleman, the right place
to scrutinise the duty will be during consideration of the Bill that
establishes and gives a legal constitution to a new UK-wide agency. The
policy decisions about the constitutional form of the agency, what
powers it will have and how those powers will relate to the powers that
the Secretary of State will retain on immigration have not yet been
finalised. The right place for hon. Members besides us to scrutinise
the duty that we will introduce will be in the context of the Bill to
set up the UKBA. However, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the duty
will be equal and will establish parity in the obligations between the
agencies that are now subject to the section 11 duty with a duty under
the new legislation. In drafting the provision, colleagues and
officials in the Home Office and my Department will, jointly, consult
other
organisations.</div><a name="08062496000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the further delay and whether anything can be done in the mean time,
which the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole asked about, it is
important that we get the measure right. We are making a major
commitment in establishing the UKBA, and as I have said, it is right to
make this provision in the context of the Bill dealing with the UKBA
and the relevant changes. However, we have the code of practice and the
current duty and we want to ensure that we learn the lessons from the
developments that they have already been brought about in terms of
changing culture and practice in the agency dealing with immigration,
and to build on those lessons as we move forward with the equivalent
duty. Obviously, based on the commitment that I have given and in the
context of current thinking, the setting up of the UKBA will take place
in the knowledge that this statutory duty will be placed on it, and
that will inform all the thinking and planning from this point
onwards.</div><a name="08062496000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that we can proceed in the way that I have outlined. I am not
asking the hon. Members to disagree to the clause at this stage, but I
will do so on

<a name="080624101000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;and persons over 16 years of age
but under 22 years of age who have received services under section 23C
to 24D of the 1989 Act in the past five
years.&#146;.</div><a name="08062496000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment is tabled in my name and that of the hon. Member for
Upminster, our indefatigable Whip, who, I failed to mention earlier,
cannot be with us today as she is busy whipping somebody else somewhere
else. She will be bringing her qualities and great knowledge of this
subject to us
shortly.</div><a name="08062496000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment&#151;it is difficult to get something that is
not a probing amendment in respect of parts of certain clauses, but we
are trying. It is designed to tease out more about the arrangements
whereby the Government clearly recognise the ongoing responsibilities
to children who have come out of the care system and to tighten up the
terms of the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000, which was welcome,
although too many of our children leaving care still have a tough time.
I am sure that the hon. Member for Stafford, who does such an excellent
job chairing the parliamentary group on children in and leaving care,
will have some comments to
make.</div><a name="08062496000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statistics remain alarming. Nearly half of all the young people in the
care system will leave it at 16 or 17, compared with an average
&#147;flying the nest&#148; age for children living with their
families of 23 or 24. Those children are leaving the shelter of the
care system&#151;albeit it is still inadequate and some of the
outcomes are still woefully poor&#151;at a sensitive, fragile period
in their lives. At 16 or 17 they may be leaving school, going through
important exams or, hopefully, going on to higher education or training
of some sort. They may face the problems of leaving the support
mechanism that the care system has provided for many of them and
getting appropriate housing and accommodation, let alone moving on to a
job. I know that the Government recognise that and that the thrust of
the 2000 Act was to achieve greater support after children leave the
care
system.</div><a name="08062496000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is intended to place the duty for promoting the well-being of
children on those who have been responsible for them in the care system
during the previous five years. We need to achieve greater flexibility.
There is a black and white situation in respect of children in care in
the UK: they are either in care or with a family. I mentioned earlier
the number of children who come into the care system on a shorter-term
basis and return to their families, but many children in care are
completely cut off from family background and family
members.</div><a name="08062496000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">About
18 months ago, I visited Denmark with colleagues; we also went to
Helsinki. There is much greater flexibility in the systems there. While
in Denmark, we visited an impressive care home outside Copenhagen.
Proportionately, many more children in the care system there are in
residential homes. Adoption is virtually non-existent&#151;only 20
children had been adopted in the previous year in Denmark. Although the
Danes use fostering, they make far more use of residential
children&#146;s homes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div><a name="08062496000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
particularly impressive children&#146;s home that we visited housed
children ranging from under 10&#151;I think the youngest was 7 or
8&#151;right up to 22, which is an enormous range of ages. They were
looked after by fantastic pedagogue social workers from whom, as was
said on Second Reading, we in this country have a lot to learn. Those
social workers develop a great empathy with the children and are seen
as friends and confidantes as well as being the children&#146;s
guardians. The children there are not encapsulated in a
children&#146;s home and cut off from the outside world. Each week,
there is a dinner evening to which relatives are invited&#151;perhaps
the birth parents or other members of the extended family&#151;to
spend as normal a meal time as possible with the child or other
residents of the children&#146;s home. The children may spend
weekends back at home or with an extended family member. There is a
degree of
flexibility.</div><a name="08062496000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a child has to be taken out of the home environment, that need not be
the be-all and end-all&#151;the beginning of a slippery slope to
permanent care proceedings being taken and that child going into
long-term fostering or, ultimately, a long-term adoptive placement. We
need greater flexibility in our system, which is why the amendment
acknowledges, in the spirit of what the Government are trying to
achieve in the Bill, that there should be an ongoing duty to promote
the well-being of children who been involved in the care system over
several
years.</div><a name="08062496000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Life,
particularly for vulnerable children who have endured traumatic
conditions, is not a nice, smooth journey. There can be problems at
school or in training that result in their failing to get the exam
results or training qualifications that they need, so that, all of a
sudden, they are faced with an uncertain future and crisis. Another
typical problem is the housing that they have been given goes
pear-shaped for some reason. Somebody who might have appeared confident
at 16 or 17 when leaving the formal care system all of a sudden returns
to a rather more chaotic lifestyle and needs support. They need to be
able to go back to the social worker who was their support when they
were fully in the care system, or to somebody at the local authority,
in the housing department or whatever, with whom they can deal on an
understanding
basis.</div><a name="08062496000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statistics show that within two years of leaving care, of the 6,000
young people who leave care in a year, 3,000 will be
unemployed&#151;half of them will not have a job and will lack the
stability that might put them back on the road to having some degree of
permanency and sustainability in their lifestyle. No fewer than 2,100
will be mothers or pregnant. The propensity of girls leaving the care
system either to be mothers already or to become pregnant is deeply
alarming. When we simply cast those young girls off without some
ongoing monitoring by a social worker or somebody from the local health
service, a sexual advice clinic or other agency, we fail them, even
though we know they are, for various reasons, far more susceptible to
becoming teenage mothers. The Minister has rightly highlighted teenage
pregnancies as a major problem: we still have the highest level of
teenage pregnancies in western Europe. Of those 6,000 people leaving
care each year, 1,200 will be
homeless.</div><a name="08062496000292"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="08062496000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
are deeply traumatic times and things do not all go smoothly, but it
can be an erratic journey. What we are trying to achieve, which I am
sure is what the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>Government are trying to achieve also&#151;we are just trying to tease
out some detail&#151;is that there will be a flexible duty to promote
the well-being of children in England after they have formally left the
care system, until they are in a position to be able to stand on their
own two feet, and that they have some sustainability and continuity in
order to do that. That is the purpose of this probing
amendment.</div>
<a name="08062496000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that the Minister will say, &#147;No worries, it is all catered for
elsewhere in the Bill,&#148; and I would be delighted to take her at
her word, but I would like an assurance that that is the intention
behind the legislation. One criticism of the Bill is that it is full of
good intentions. It is certainly going in the right direction, but in
some areas it lacks the force to produce the delivery, which, as the
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said earlier, is crucial.
What matters is not how many clauses we pass, how many new structures
we set up, or how many people with shiny new titles and nice smart
lapel badges we create, but the effect that they will have on the
children who desperately need their support. That is what the amendment
is trying to achieve.</div>
<a name="08062496000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000358"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I have a great deal of sympathy with everything
that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has just said. I am
sure that all of us in this room have visited projects that have shown
what can be done. I have had the privilege of visiting a &#147;Make
the Difference&#148; project in Tower Hamlets. That was excellent for
the young people who were participating, dropping in, meeting
regularly, but it did not necessarily ensure that those who had dropped
out at 16 would feel confident to drop back into the varying
arrangements that are available for young people. This is an important
issue. I am quite sure that there is good practice out there in
particular local authorities, but the problem is how to spread that
good practice and how to change the situation so that we do not end up
with young people in custody, homeless and all the other very sad
consequences that often befall looked-after children when, for one
reason or another, they have left the care system. I would like to hear
what the Minister has to say about whether there is more that we can do
in legislation to give a bigger push to the spread of good
practice.</div>
<a name="08062496000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000359"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I am sure hon. Members are aware that the journey
that we have been on over recent years, which culminated in the spirit
within the children&#146;s plan, has crystallised a process of
developing a new way of working and looking at the needs of children
and young people, putting them at the heart of everything that we are
doing. What we want to do in the clause is to take the opportunity to
reflect properly in statute the Secretary of State&#146;s policy
responsibilities for the well-being of all children in the country. Our
intention in doing so is to demonstrate our long-term commitment to
improving the lives of children and young people.</div>
<a name="08062496000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
talked to children, young people and their parents during the
children&#146;s plan consultation, they made clear the positive value
that they place on the experience of childhood as a whole. They talked
about developing play, social and emotional skills and talent, for
example, and how our young people can make an important contribution,
as well as enhancing opportunities and building foundations for their
success.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div><a name="08062496000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">For many years
the Secretary of State has carried out activities for the benefit of
children and is already required by the Education Act 1996 to promote
their education. The significant developments in policy over recent
years under this Government, through the Children Act 2004, the Every
Child Matters agenda and, more recently, the establishment of the new
Department for Children, Schools and Families, mean that we want the
Secretary of State to be able to look more closely at the needs of the
whole child, and a wide range of matters affecting children&#146;s
lives, their health and their happiness. This is in addition to the
educational needs that obviously remain very important.</div>
<a name="08062496000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
our commitment to children&#146;s well-being recognises these changes
to the Secretary of State&#146;s priorities for children and is in
line with similar duties on local authorities and, indeed, on schools
too. It also reflects the Secretary of State&#146;s general policy
responsibilities in a manner that complements&#151;I will explain
this point in a moment&#151;the operational responsibilities of local
children&#146;s services and brings a consistent focus on
children&#146;s outcomes at every level in the
system.</div><a name="08062496000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have considered carefully how this new provision will impact on care
leavers. First, all relevant children who are 16 or 17 are children for
the purposes of this provision and the Secretary of State will have the
same duties to promote their well-being as he does to all other
children. We also recognise that the Secretary of State&#146;s
responsibilities clearly extend beyond children to include some groups
of particularly vulnerable young adults, such as former relevant
children&#151;that is, care leavers who are over 18. Therefore I
think it is right that this clause includes explicit reference to this
particular group, that the Secretary of State takes powers to make
provision for them, and that this arrangement mirrors that of local
authorities. We have actually modelled this clause on the parallel
provision&#151;that is, section 10 of the Children&#146;s Act
2004&#151;under which local authorities are required to co-operate
with local partners to improve the well-being of children in their
area. The same definition of well-being is used in this clause too,
reflecting the five Every Child Matters
outcomes.</div><a name="08062496000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the same way as section 10 of the 2004 Act, this clause draws a
distinction between the Secretary of State&#146;s duties to all
children and his powers to develop policies that promote well-being for
particular groups of young adults. The way in which that was done in
the 2004 Act, and the way we are replicating that now, is formally to
recognise that the state&#146;s relationship with a group of young
adults is necessarily different from that which the state has with
children who are wholly dependent and who have specifically little or
no legal autonomy. It is clearly appropriate to use terminology in a
sense that more closely reflects the partnership, in that context, that
the state needs to develop with these young people&#151;to ensure
that services are provided in a way that supports their growing
independence and recognises their right to exercise choice in whether
to engage with these services or
not.</div><a name="08062496000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with all of the points that Opposition Members have made about
the need to ensure at the local authority level that there is
continuity for those young people who need it and I think&#151;to
answer the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham&#146;s question
specifically&#151;the formulation of this clause and the power for
young people over the age of 18, achieves the intention that he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>wants to see. It enables the Secretary of State to take action but it
respects the transition that young people are making to
adulthood.</div>
<a name="08062496000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also
reflects the current distinction that we have formulated for local
authorities in section 10 of the current legislation and, indeed, in
executing that power, we know that there has been a tremendous
development in the extent to which local authorities now keep in touch
with young people over the age of 18. In that group, 90 per cent of
young people are in touch with local authorities, and the outcomes for
them, whilst we are not yet satisfied with them, are clearly
developing.</div><a name="08062496000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that hon. Members would accept that, in formulating the clause in
this way, we are reflecting what we have already decided in relation to
local authorities. It is not in any way to reflect a lesser importance
of these young people, but rather also to respect their position in
life, moving into adulthood and reflecting the way in which we have
framed the operational responsibilities of local authorities. With
that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="08062496000225"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000360"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
explanation. I thought that she was going to say, &#147;This is a
jolly good amendment, and we will accept it.&#148; That would have
been a turn-up for the books. However, we seem to be on the same
lines.</div>
<a name="08062496000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern,
however, is about striking a balance between recognising the particular
vulnerabilities and requirements of 16, 17 and 18-year-olds coming out
of the care system and respecting their transition into
adulthood&#151;as the Minister put it. Local authorities should not
use that as an excuse by saying, &#147;Well, we don&#146;t need to
trample on them.&#148; As I have said, and given evidence on, those
children are much more susceptible to greater problems than their rest
of their cohort. I have some other figures on the health aspect: two
thirds of all looked-after children were reported to have at least one
physical health complaint, and 45 per cent. of those aged five to 17
were assessed as having at least one mental health disorder, compared
with one in 10 of the child population overall. That is an enormous
difference in vulnerability.</div>
<a name="08062496000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we know,
such problems, particularly mental illness, need to be addressed as
early as possible, and there needs to be a continuum of care until
somebody can stand on their own two feet. All too often, the child and
adolescent mental health services&#151;Cinderella services within the
Cinderella service of the NHS&#151;can be erratic and a postcode
lottery. Certainly, if children in the care system are fortunate enough
to access CAMHS&#151;perhaps through being in a residential home
where, as a result of the high fees charged, they buy in mental health
services, because of the waiting list for, or lack of availability of,
certain talking therapies locally&#151;but then effectively enter the
big wide world on their own, without support from the mental health
services, we have a false economy. It will result only in that person
being less able to stand on their own two feet during the transition
into adulthood, as the Minister
said.</div><a name="08062496000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment was a probing one, and the Minister has made some favourable
comments about how we are trying to achieve the same thing. However,
this was a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>useful debate in emphasising that local authorities have a duty of care
beyond what is in the Bill. Their duties do not become minimal when
looked-after children leave the care system, and in may cases their
role remains just as important for many years to come. On that basis, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08062496000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000363"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> This is one of those annoying little amendments
that usually centres on the use of the word &#147;must&#148;, of
which we have many. However, this is a slight variation. The genesis of
the amendment goes back to debate on the Children Bill 2004, when my
hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), who
was helping me on the Front Bench, tabled an amendment to clause 8. The
amendment would have replaced a provision about functions being
discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the
safeguard of children
with</div><a name="08062496000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">'in a
manner consistent with the objective of safeguarding and
promoting'</div><a name="08062496000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
welfare of children, which was rather punchier. &#147;Having regard
to&#148; covers a multitude of sins. It does not necessarily mean
that the agency that is bound to have regard to something has to do
anything about it. It must only acknowledge that there may be a problem
or that a service needs to be delivered. As long as it has regarded it,
it does not need to follow it through. That terminology is too weak,
and I fear that in too many cases it can be used as a get-out clause
for not producing the
goods.</div><a name="08062496000293"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="08062496000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is to clause 8(5), which contains the limp language that the
Secretary of
State,</div><a name="08062496000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
discharging functions under this section, must have regard to the
aspects of well-being
mentioned&#148;</div><a name="08062496000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
section 10 of the Children Act 2004. We want to replace that with much
punchier terminology that means something, so that the Secretary of

discharge functions under this section in a manner consistent with the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div><a name="08062496000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 10 of the
Children Act is a much more positive promotion than clause 8. It
states:</div><a name="08062496000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
arrangements are to be made with a view to improving the well-being of
children&#148;</div><a name="08062496000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
relation to those various factors. We are trying to give the Secretary
of State a bit more vim, stating that he must not just have regard to,
but positively promote, the considerations in that section. I am
therefore sure that the Minister will have no problem in saying that
the amendment is worthwhile and constructive and will strengthen what
the Bill is intended to do. I shall be surprised if she ducks that
challenge.</div><a name="08062496000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000364"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I, too, look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response to that interesting presentation of the amendment, which
seemed to make a lot of
sense.</div><a name="08062496000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 26. It will not be the first
time that I have spoken to such an amendment to legislation on
children. As with our previous debate, we might get there eventually.
It is always interesting to note that the UK played a leading role in
drafting the UN convention on the rights of the child, and that the
previous Government were an early signatory of
it.</div><a name="08062496000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
October, the UK&#146;s implementation of the convention will be
examined for the third time by the UN Committee on the Rights of Child.
It is not enough to sign up, it is all about implementation. One of the
committee&#146;s 78 recommendations made in 2002 was that the UK
should incorporate the convention into domestic law. Although the
amendment would not give children new rights that could be tested in
the courts, it would introduce a children&#146;s rights proofing
process that we have not so far incorporated into our policy
development and legislation. The hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham and I were in a meeting about children&#146;s rights not
long ago, and a social worker said that one of the most important
things that would make a social worker&#146;s life clearer and
promote the career would be working to a rights agenda. That was a
telling comment, coming from somebody who actually works with
children.</div><a name="08062496000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, there are a number of articles of the convention, and I do not
propose to mention many. However, I shall touch on article 12, which
begins:</div><a name="08062496000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;States
Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her
own views the right to express those views freely in all matters
affecting the
child&#148;.</div><a name="08062496000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that the Government have made great moves forward in
listening to children. Nevertheless, there are some issues in the Bill
on which we think the child&#146;s voice could be strengthened, in
certain cases with the support of advocacy. The importance of having a
guardian is another issue. A number of issues perpetually arise that
would be tackled if we incorporated the convention into our
legislation.</div><a name="08062496000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to mention briefly that the UK still has a reservation on
article 22 of the convention on the rights of the child, which relates
to the protection of asylum-seeking children. I was quite heartened in
January when the Government announced plans to re-examine that
reservation. I would be interested to hear an update on that alongside
the news that we have had this
morning.</div><a name="08062496000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of the issues that we are raising through amendments would
automatically come under consideration if we signed up to the UN
convention. It is common 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>sense that our children&#146;s rights should be respected and that we
should incorporate the convention into all legislation that touches on
children&#146;s issues. I commend amendment No. 26 to the
Minister.</div><a name="08062496000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000365"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Mr. Pope, let me say that it is a great
pleasure to serve on this Committee under your kindly but hawk-like,
miss-nothing
eye.</div><a name="08062496000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will speak in favour of amendment No. 26. As the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole has said, this is not an amendment to
incorporate the obligations under the UN convention on the rights of
the child into UK law. In my view, that is a pity because I think that
we should incorporate those rights. We have done some great work for
children since 1997 with the target to eradicate child poverty, the
&#147;Every Child Matters&#148; agenda, the &#147;Quality
Protects&#148; programme for looked-after children, the Children
(Leaving Care) Act 2000 and now the &#147;Care Matters: Time for
Change&#148; White
Paper.</div><a name="08062496000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the children&#146;s plan last year, I think that the time is right to
incorporate the convention into our law. Instead, as the hon. Member
for East Worthing and Shoreham said, the use of the language that the
Secretary of State &#147;must have regard to&#148; is a backsliding
and easy target for him to hit. I hope that my right hon. and hon.
Friends the Ministers do not think it very demanding to expect
Ministers to have regard to the convention&#146;s rights when
carrying out their duty to promote the well-being of children in
England. After all, all Ministers sign up to the ministerial code,
which states that they have an overarching duty to obey the law,
including our international obligations. The UK has signed the
convention.</div><a name="08062496000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
the Ministers think that the amendment is a sensible first step on the
route to the wider acceptance of the rights in the UN convention? When
we agreed clause 7, there was an encouraging sign that we would do
better for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. We are going in the
right direction, and this would be another step in that direction. If
there is a clinching argument that my right hon. and hon. Friends the
Ministers will accept, it is that the General Social Care Council,
which was established by the Government to set standards for conduct
and practice in social care, supports amendment No. 26 and thinks that
it should be
passed.</div><a name="08062496000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000366"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I hope that no Opposition Member would ever accuse
me of trying to duck issues. I share the spirit of what both amendments
are trying to achieve. I hope I can convince hon. Members that the way
in which we have formulated the well-being duty in clause 8
is intended to achieve the ambitions that they have set
out.</div><a name="08062496000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to remember that the definition of well-being in the
Children Act 2004, which we are using as our basis, reflects the whole
range of outcomes that we want for children. It includes their physical
and mental health; their emotional well-being; their protection from
harm and neglect; their education, training and recreational needs;
their contribution to society and their social and economic well-being.
Those are all vital factors in determining whether children have the
enjoyable childhood that we want them to have as well as being prepared
and supported so that they can succeed in later life.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div><a name="08062496000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities and schools already have a duty to promote the well-being
of children as defined in these terms. In the clause, we are keen
accurately to reflect the Secretary of State&#146;s general policy
responsibilities in a manner that complements the operational
responsibilities of local children&#146;s services and introduces a
consistent focus on children&#146;s outcomes at every level of the
system.</div><a name="08062496000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with amendment No. 4, as formulated, is that it would narrow
the Secretary of State&#146;s well-being duty to a focus on
safeguarding alone and disregard the other key aspects of well-being.
Of course, safeguarding is a top priority, and it was a key driver in
&#147;Every Child Matters&#148;, but as I have just outlined, the
outcomes that we want to see under &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;
go beyond safeguarding into various other areas.</div>
<a name="08062496000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
not phrased in weasel words. It says:</div>
<a name="08062496000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
the general duty of the Secretary of State to promote the well-being of
children in
England.&#148;</div><a name="08062496000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
could be clearer? The hon. Gentleman has contributed positively to many
pieces of legislation on children and other areas of policy, and he is
experienced enough to know that the fact that subsection (5) uses the
phrase &#147;must have regard to&#148; before pointing to the
relevant sections of the Children Act means that the Secretary of State
must exercise the specific duty in the clause in relation to sections
10(2)(a) to (e) of the Children Act. It is therefore a little unfair to
suggest that the duty that we are trying to place on the Secretary of
State to promote well-being falls short of our
intention.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000367"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am disappointed so far, but perhaps the
Minister can tell me what weight she places on the phrase &#147;have
regard to&#148;, as opposed to the phrase</div>
<a name="08062496000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in a manner
consistent with the objectives of safeguarding the welfare of
children&#148;,</div><a name="08062496000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is in the amendment. Does she not acknowledge that the wording of
amendment carries more punch and is stronger than &#147;have regard
to&#148;, regardless of whether it refers to the duty in subsection
(1)? The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>wording in the amendment is stronger. Local authorities have had
problems with the interpretation of the phrase of &#147;have regard
to&#148;.</div><a name="08062496000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000368"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
premise. In legal terms, &#147;have regard to&#148; is equivalent
to what he has outlined. Indeed, Opposition Members argued not long ago
for a section 11 duty on the Border and Immigration Agency, so they
were apparently happy to accept that having &#147;regard to&#148;
the need to safeguard children was a strong enough formulation to
impose on that agency and all the agencies listed in section 11 of the
2004 Act. Opposition Members accepted that the wording was strong
enough in that situation, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept
that using the same terminology here&#151;as parliamentary counsel
will&#151;gives us a strong enough formulation of the duty,
particularly in conjunction with subsection (1), which makes very clear
what the duty is.</div>
<a name="08062496000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000369"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> For the avoidance of doubt, I should say that we
argued for an amendment to the effect that the wording should not be
&#147;have regard to&#148; for all the other agencies on the list,
but the Government defeated us. We are just trying to be consistent in
terms of what goes into the legislation; our current proposals do not
signal any weakening of our intent with regard to the Border and
Immigration Agency.</div>
<a name="08062496000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062496000370"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I was not a member of the Committee that discussed
the 2004 Act, but Opposition Members need to think whether the phrase
&#147;have regard to&#148; has weakened the pursuit of the
objectives before us by the agencies concerned, because I do not think
that there is any evidence that it has. The wording in the clause is
the normal way in which we express such obligations legally. Taken in
conjunction with subsection (1), it makes clear what our intention
is.</div>
