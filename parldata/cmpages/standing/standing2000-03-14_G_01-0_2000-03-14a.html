</UL></FONT>--[Mr. Elliot Morley.]<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of any amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Validation of certain charges made by</center></H4>
the Sea Fish Industry Authority
<P>
Question proposed. That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Elliot Morley):</B> The Bill is a narrow, technical measure, which deals with charges. Its purpose is to ensure the validity of charges levied by the Sea Fish Industry Authority between 1 October 1981 and 3 May 1996 in connection with its administration of grant schemes made, or treated as having been made, under the Fisheries Act 1981. It also ensures the validity of charges made by the Sea Fish Industry Authority's predecessor, the Herring Industry Board, between March 1972 and October 1981. The Herring Industry Board was abolished in 1981 when it amalgamated with SFIA, to which its liabilities were transferred.
<P>
The Bill's main objective, which is outlined in clause 1(1), is to ensure that the validity of the charges levied by the Sea Fish Industry Authority between 1 October 1981 and 3 May 1996 in connection with administering four fishing vessel grant schemes made under section 15 of the Fisheries Act 1981 and an earlier scheme made in 1976 under previous legislation. Under the 1981 Act, the responsibility for administering the latter scheme passed to the SFIA and the scheme was also deemed to have been made under the 1981 Act. The five schemes are specified in subsections 2(a) to (e).
<P>
Under the schemes made, or deemed to have been made, under section 15 of the Fisheries Act 1981, grants have been made available to fishermen in the United Kingdom for the construction, improvement or safety of vessles. They have all been administered by the Sea Fish Industry Authority on behalf of Ministers, as provided for by section 16 of the Fisheries Act 1981.
<P>
<B>Dr. Norman A. Godman </B>(Greenock and Inverclyde): I asked a question on Second Reading about the purchase of survival suits. In respect of clause 1(1)(d) and (e), do the grants allow skipper owners and small trawler companies to buy survival suits for their crew, or does such equipment not fall within the regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I know of my hon. Friend's long interest in fisheries safety and the value of survival suits in the fishing industry. They did not qualify under the old grant systems because they were not specified in the regulations, and whether fishermen had survival suits was entirely a matter for them. However, we know the value of the suits and are currently discussing a successor to the safety grant scheme, including how it should work and be directed and whether certain provisions should be encouraged, specified or assisted. We shall bear in mind what my hon. Friend said about life jackets and survival suits.
<P>
The Bill was introduced because there were concerns about the legality of the charges. It will ensure that the charges are made properly. There have been no complaints about how the charges are levied; those who receive grants signed the SFIA's conditions of approval for their payment, which referred to the deduction of a technical charge from the overall grant. No one objected to it, or to how it was applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): The Minister knows of my anxiety about the matter, and he said that there were concerns. The explanatory notes state that it is doubtful whether the previous charges were legal. The Minister should explain in what respect there is doubt or concern before the Committee agrees to the Bill. Wherein lies the dubiety?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The legal doubt about whether the authority raised the charges lies in the fact that the Sea Fish Industry Authority levies charges--in this case for the administration of a series of grants to the fishing industry--on behalf of Ministers. There was doubt about whether Ministers had the authority to make those charges. Of course, if Ministers do not have the authority, the SFIA, acting on Ministers' behalf, does not have the authority either. The Bill will ensure that there is no doubt about the matter and that the charges are legal.
<P>
A considerable sum of money--about £560 a case, or £7.3 million in total--was levied over 13,000 cases in 24 years, going back to the days of the Herring Industry Board. The human rights issue, which applies now, has been carefully considered and the Bill is compatible with the European convention on human rights.
<P>
The Bill is retrospective. As I said on Second Reading, the Government do not take lightly the introduction of retrospective legislation. However, there are precedents for doing so; the Birds (Registration Charges) Act 1997, passed under the previous Government, retrospectively validated charges levied under sections 6 and 7 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 for the registration and sale of certain dead wild birds. The Wireless Telegraphy Act 1954 gave authority to past payments made to the Postmaster General for wireless transmission and receiving licences.
<P>
The charges were legitimate in respect of the work carried out by the SFIA. As I said, there are no complaints about the charges levied; the Bill makes the powers to levy those charges proper and legal and it must be done retrospectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): On Second Reading, the Minister was pressed to convey to the House the basis of his legal advice. He declined to do so then, and appears unwilling to do so today.
<P>
The Government do not usually publish their legal advice, but the puzzling thing about this retrospective Bill is that it has taken so many years for the error to come to light. That also reflects on the previous Administration so I cannot hide behind that. However, every year technical charges were highlighted in the accounts produced by the SFIA, some of which I have here. How on earth did officials in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food--especially those in the Fisheries department--overlook those charges for nearly 21 years? It beggars belief that there could have been such a big legal loophole that no one in MAFF spotted it before now. As a result, we are discussing a retrospective Bill designed to put right what has been deemed to be wrong.
<P>
On Second Reading, many hon. Members probed the matter. We examined the 1981 Act and the delegated legislation mentioned in the Bill. It was clear that the 1981 Act gave the Sea Fish Industry Authority power to vet applications and process and distribute grant, the two main types of which are mentioned in the Bill. A statutory power was given to the Sea Fish Industry Authority, backed up by sections in the 1981 Act giving the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food power to delegate such power to the SFIA and instruct it to process grants.
<P>
The Minister did not make clear why the law is deemed to contain a loophole. I have spoken to the SFIA, which, like its predecessor, the White Fish Authority, and the Herring Industry Board, believes that it is acting in good faith and within the law. Will the Minister explain why accounts plainly nominated as technical charges were not picked up earlier?
<P>
In 1996, MAFF told the SFIA to stop making those important charges. Since then, the SFIA has been processing grant applications and, presumably, has expended its own resources in examining those grants carefully, ensuring that applications are valid, and doing checks that are vital before public money is deployed.
<P>
Most people expect their grant applications to be examined in detail, whether they are applying for a mortgage on a house, a hire purchase agreement for a car or a Government grant. That is even truer when public money is at stake, and we all agree, that the technical charges were appropriate and necessary for making grant available and to prevent accusations that applications had not been made correctly.
<P>
Previously, it was appropriate for MAFF and the Minister to say that no more charges would be made. However, that has led to internal difficulties at the SFIA, which, in processing grant applications that were in the pipeline, has had to use its own resources to fund such charges. Now, of course, no grants are available. Last year, the Minister removed the last group of grants, for improving safety, and promises to reinstate have, as yet, not been forthcoming.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister attempted to explain the position on Second Reading. However, today, he has made no attempt to say when those safety grants will be reinstated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> That is out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is for the Chairman to decide, not the Minister.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are dropping the drift net here--we need to get back on line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I bow to your better judgment, Mr. Hancock.
<P>
It is important for the Minister to convince the Committee today that his legal advice on introducing the Bill is clear cut. He is also duty bound to explain why it took so long for this so-called loophole to be discovered. I hope that he will make it quite clear that there is no question that SFIA and its precursors acted in good faith or that any of those officers were in any way culpable of rewriting the law or cutting corners. We recognise that if there is a serious loophole, retrospective legislation, undesirable thought that is, is needed so that those people who were managing and running the SFIA will not be taken to court at some future date when we know that they acted entirely in good faith.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew George (St. Ives):</B> Let me start by saying what a pleasure it is to serve under your watchful eye, Mr. Hancock. I will do my best to keep within the narrow definition of the Bill and the clause. Our Second Reading debate ranged quite widely. The Minister clearly would not introduce primary legislation unless it was justified by legal advice. I am sure that the legislative timetable is so clogged at the moment that unnecessary additional legislation would not be welcome.
<P>
I have made inquiries at all levels in the industry and I concur with the Minister that there appears to be no opposition to the Bill. If he cannot publish the legal advice, could he publish a præcised version so that we could understand the basis more fully? I raised this on Second Reading, but it was not directly answered: why was the matter not referred to in the SFIA annual report? It was not considered sufficiently important to be mentioned there, yet it was considered important enough for the Government to seek to intervene and to introduce primary legislation. What conclusions does the Minister draw from that? Does he believe that the SFIA has not acted adequately or responded seriously enough to the identification of what is clearly a serious matter?
<P>
The clause refers to safety improvement grants. Without straying beyond the limitations of the clause, does the Bill provide an opportunity to review such matters? After all, the Minister has intimated that a statement will be made on safety improvement grants. If safety improvement grants are reinstated, will the financial implications of introducing a safety code for under-12m vessels and the problems of inadequate support for single-handed vessels be taken on board?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Bill is very narrow. He is drifting too far from the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I get your drift, Mr. Hancock. I beg your pardon and accept that I strayed a little, but you will understand that such matters are of great interest to the fishing industry. I am sure that the Minister will take them on board.
<P>
In conclusion, we do not oppose the clause or the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman did not suffer a three-hour interruption in his speech as he did on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Austin Mitchell (Great Grimsby):</B> I had not intended to speak in the debate because I have every faith in the sea fisheries, which are doing a splendid job, and even more faith in my hon. Friend the Minister, who is doing a superb job. He is much the best Minister that fishing has had for a couple of decades. Hearing the querulous tribe of quibblers on the Opposition Benches nitpicking about this necessary Bill has excited me to add a few querulous doubts of my own. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) says that he is concerned, but the Bill will effectively cancel a mistake made by the previous Government. Perhaps my hon. Friend should backdate the validation to May 1997 and no further, but that is a facetious suggestion.
<P>
First, my hon. Friend the Minister said that the Bill does not conflict with the European convention on human rights. However, retrospective legislation is not desirable in principle. Has the imposition of such charges been contested in the courts? If such questions have been raised in the courts, the people raising them would doubtless be aggrieved about the invalidation of their own position under retrospective legislation. That is the only way in which a conflict with the European convention could arise.
<P>
Secondly, what was the position of the previous body for sea fisheries--the White Fish Authority, which has been barely mentioned? The Herring Industry Board was one tributary source; the White Fish Authority, of happy memory, was the other, but it too imposed charges. Why are we validating the charges of the Herring Industry Board, not those of the White Fish Authority?
<P>
Thirdly, what is the basis of the charges? How will they be audited and made accountable to the industry? Our fishing industry is hung down with charges in a way in which its European competitors are not. We have light dues, inspection charges, charges for landing and dock charges, which are not imposed in Europe. There will be satellite charges.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is also tempted to stray from the debate. Can we please stick to the narrow confines of clause 1?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> It is a valid point that this is adding to the burden of charges on the industry, which wants to know how those charges are justified and the basis on which they will be levied. It is one of a series of charges affecting the competitive position of our industry in relation to our European competitors, as they do not face the same burden of charging.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes </B>(South Holland and The Deepings): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who is right to argue that despite the narrow focus of the Bill, it is appropriate to examine parallel circumstances in the charging regimes of our competitors. Accountability for charging regimes is often different, which makes for an entirely different relationship between the Government and the industry. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to draw attention to that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind hon. Members that we are debating a particular, narrowly drawn Bill. When interventions take us further and further away from it, we are heading for serious problems. Will members of the Committee try to stick to the Bill and not lead us astray?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I shall try to hold back most of the time, but I remain grateful for the intervention by the hon. Member for South Holland and the Deepings (Mr. Hayes). He and I both recognise that the Spanish fishing industry is effectively subsidised by its Government in a way that our industry is not.
<P>
However, to return to the provisions, what will be the basis of the charging regime for the services provided by the Sea Fish Industry Authority? In the case of the Environment Agency, costs must be recovered and might include massive overheads that the agency deems appropriate to carry on its work. Charges are made on behalf of Ministers, so what control do Ministers have over the charges and what accounts do they require to authorise them? Have they assessed the ability of the industry to pay the charges? That is a sensible question to ask on behalf of a fishing industry that is extremely hard pressed. The industry wants to know how the charges in the Bill are validated and it wants to ensure that they are fair, just and adequately controlled.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are talking about past charges, not future charges. We are debating a Bill that regularises what happened in the past. The comments that I am hearing now may have been appropriate on Second Reading--and perhaps will be appropriate on Report--but not here today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Let me change my phraseology. The industry wants to know that the charges levied on it in the past--perhaps illegally--were fair, just and appropriate, were audited by Ministers and took account of the industry's ability to pay, which was greater than it is now. The industry has recently faced severe economic difficulties. My question is about the control of retrospective charges: how were they authorised, what was their scale and did the industry receive good value for money when the charges were levied?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member has come through the smallest of nets.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Townend </B>(East Yorkshire): It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), whose views on what is necessary for the fishing industry often coincide with mine. I was surprised, however, when he referred to the best fishing Ministers in years--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not talking about that. It may be appropriate to another debate, but we are not going to debate it here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Townend:</B> I am only responding to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not in order today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Townend:</B> The fact that the fishing industry has demanded the Minister's resignation is important, Mr. Hancock. It is appropriate to the clause because we are talking about £7.25 million, which is a great deal of money to the fishing industry, especially when its safety grants have been taken away, its quotas have been slashed and the fishermen in the Irish sea cannot fish for cod--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must bring hon. Members back to our purpose today. We are not rehearsing arguments about fishing legislation. We are talking about a Bill that has a narrowly defined responsibility.
11 am
<P>
<B>Mr. Townend:</B> I shall endeavour to do so. I am not on my own here. Even before Second Reading, the Leader of the House said that the Bill would give hon. Members with fishing constituencies, who could not speak in the annual fishing debate because it was so short, an opportunity to discuss industry issues.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is trying my patience and that of the Committee. What went on on the Floor of the House is of no concern to the Committee. This is not the place to go over the ground again. We are looking for comments, both critical and appreciative, about clause 1 of a very narrow Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Townend:</B> Then I shall return to clause 1. My principal objection to the clause--and the matter was raised at some length by the Minister, so I am in order--is that this is retrospective legislation. I am opposed to retrospective legislation on all occasions, whatever Government are introducing it. The Minister was stretching it. He found only two examples of retrospective legislation over the past 30 years in connection with charging. It is likely that the charges to the individuals in those Bills were rather small. The charges here amount to £560 per case.
<P>
This retrospective legislation is especially unacceptable because the Minister says that a loophole has been found after 20-odd years, but will not disclose his legal advice. That is against the normal practice. From time to time the courts decide against what Parliament has legislated and they strike it down. That happens regularly in tax cases. Parliament then produces more legislation, but it is not retrospective. Retrospective legislation is dangerous.
<P>
An alternative to what the Government are proposing would be to repay the £7.3 million. It is no good the Government saying that they do not have the money and that it would have to come out of the education or the health budgets because we know that money is coming out of the Chancellor's ears. He will have a massive surplus this year. At a time when fishing is in crisis and on the point of destruction the repayment of that £7.3 million would at least be a gesture that the Government have some thought for people in the industry. That is an extremely relevant point. There is a difference between what happens in the public and private sectors. If the situation had arisen in the private sector and, for example, insurance companies--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order, I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was called during the Second Reading debate, but his contribution today is more suited to such a debate rather than to a debate in Committee. Can I ask him to stick to clause 1 of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Townend:</B>  Surely clause 1 is retrospective legislation to prevent people who were charged illegally from being refunded. Surely it is right to contrast the Government's attitude in this case in the public sector with what their attitude would be in a similar case in the private sector. If an insurance company or a building society had overcharged its customers illegally there would be massive public demand that the illegal charges should be repaid. Parliament would not retrospectively produce legislation as the Minister is now doing. I shall vote against the clause. I protest strongly at our being asked to accept the Bill when we have not been given the legal advice on which it is based. The problem continued for years, so it seems strange that it has arisen now. We are entitled to be told the full facts.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): You will be relieved to know, Mr. Hanock, that I will stick closely to the clause. I listened carefully to the Minister's Justification for the clause, but I still think that there are considerable gaps in his explanation of the advice that he has received about the necessity for these retrospective provisions. He has been more explicit today than on Second Reading, but the doubt arises on the narrow point of whether a Minister of the Crown had the powers that were delegated to the SFIA at the time. The first question that arises in my mind, and probably in the minds of other Committee members, is, on what basis and at what time during the passage of the original and subsequent legislation was the power of a Minister of the Crown considered, and what advice was received that the Minister had the power?
<P>
My next question is the obverse of that: in what way does current legal advice suggest that there is a gap in the Minister's powers in this single respect? The Minister would do well to share his advice--in whatever form--with the Committee, so that we can consider the Bill properly and advise colleagues in the House who will have to consider it in due course. If the Minister can justify the omission from previous legislation then certainly I and my right hon. Friend for St. Ives (Mr. George) have no problem with rectifying the situation. Our difficulty is that there is still a gap in our knowledge.
<P>
My second point relates to the sequence of events that brought the omission to light. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire rightly said that the SFIA acted in good faith. Neither the Minister nor anyone else suggested that the authority did not have the power to levy the charges. Nor was there an attempt to discuss the authority's accounts, which were seen by Ministers. I am not a great believer in monumental conspiracies over 20 years, nor do I believe that MAFF also suspected that the relevant Minister did not have powers to apply the charges. However, I am concerned by the fact that those accounts, like those of Government Departments and non-departmental public bodies, are subject to audit by the National Audit Office. One function of the NAO is to scutinise the probity and regularity of the accounts. This issue is quintessentially one of regularity. In my view, an auditor, or a succession of auditors, in not identifying a failure in regularity--if there was one--failed in their fiduciary duty to the House. That concerns me greatly. Can the Minister advice us whether the auditors ever raised any doubt about the regularity of the charges?
<P>
The third point was occasioned by a comment from my right hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives, to whom I am grateful. I refer to the absence of comment on the recent report and accounts of the SFIA, and, of course, the Herring Industry Board, although were I to stray into that we would be talking about clause 2 stand part. If those bodies were aware of the substantial potential liability, that should have been indicated in the report and accounts.
<P>
I am no lawyer, but I understand that if a company identified a substantial potential liability and did not report it in its annual report and accounts, it would be failing in its duty to shareholders--and this situation is analogous.
<P>
I am concerned that a public body can produce a report and accounts in which it does not make public to Ministers, to Parliament and to the country a potential £7 million shortfall that it has identified. I would be grateful if the Minister would address that issue. The most recent report and accounts were produced in the knowledge that concern about that matter has been expressed for a year or so, yet no reference was made to it. That seems a remarkable omission from the report and accounts in terms of regularity, almost to the point of being an omission in probity.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Townend) said that the Minister had been asked to resign. Asking the Minister responsible for fisheries to resign is the very minimum sanction--a mild rebuke from the fishing industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> It was milder than some that my predecessors received.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Indeed, it was much milder than the rebukes that some of his predecessors received from the industry. However, the Minister will be failing the Committee if he cannot take us a little further down his line of reasoning, and make some comment on information that has or has not been shared with the House and the British public.
<P>
<B>Dr. Godman:</B> It is a pity that the hon. Member for East Yorkshire could not speak on Second Reading. His contribution to that lively debate would have been welcome on both sides of the House, given his commitment to the industry. My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby complimented the Minister, and I echo that compliment. The Minister is as good as the late Alec Buchanan-Smith, a Tory Fisheries Minister who, like this Minister, was first class.
<P>
I would like to know how the sum of £7.3 million that we have been discussing compares with the total amount of money awarded under the grant schemes from 1981 to 1997. Did most of the grants detailed in clause 1 go to trawler companies in Hull, Aberdeen and Grimsby, or were they distributed evenly between trawler companies, which had a shocking record on the treatment of their crews, and what I call--traditionally and anachronistically perhaps--the inshore sector?
<P>
If we consider the grants specified in clause 1(2)(a) under the Fishing Vessels (Acquisition and Improvement) (Grants) Scheme 1976, we may find that most of them were awarded to trawler companies. The Minister may not be able to answer now, but I suspect that the sum of £7.3 million fades into insignificance--not in the minds of those who had to pay the charges but in comparison with the amount of money that some trawler owners received under the less than wise leadership of some Tory Fisheries Ministers. I exclude the estimable Alec Buchanan-Smith from that criticism.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We need to set the debate in the context of comparing the grants with the charges. In most cases, it was right and proper that they were made. However, over a period of years, the trawler companies, especially those on the north side of the Humber, did very well out of the grants and the decommissioning scheme.
<P>
If a skipper owner had a grievance about a recent charge, perhaps under the 1995 scheme, would he or she--I say "she" in deference to my hon. Friends; I do not know of many women skippers, although there are one or two in Cornwall and elsewhere--be able to take the authority to court under the Scottish and the English legal systems to right a legal grievance in connection with charges imposed under the later schemes? If the Minister cannot reply this morning, I ask him to write to me and to place a copy of his letter in the Library for the benefit of other hon. Members. Of course, the Committee may sit this afternoon. [Laughter.] I promised to be brief. I shall not be on my feet at 1 o'clock under your vigilant eye, Mr. Hancock.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We will not be here this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I was encouraged by comments made by the hon. Members for Great Grimsby and for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) to probe a little further the issue of previous legislation on the grants. Will the Minister confirm that under the previous Administration, an instruction went out to the SFIA in 1995-96 that there should be no further technical charges? The problem was therefore detected by the Department in 1995-96. Will the Minister tell the Committee how the matter came to light after 21 years? Did some official spot the problem in the accounts, or ask whether the charges were legal?
<P>
My second point also follows from something that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby said. Departments allocate grant money for all kinds of things, and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions was mentioned. Grant money is made available either directly from the Department or through non-departmental public bodies or quangos. The legislation is drafted so that the authority to make those grants and process the applications is vested legally in the NDPBs. If a loophole occurred in the legislation relating to the SFIA's grants, surely, given the consistency in drafting legislation, there must be loopholes in grants from other Departments; or perhaps the legislation is the same but no other Department sees the need for retrospective legislation to plug the loophole.
<P>
As I said earlier, all grant applications incur costs and charges when they are processed. Why, therefore, have not other Departments introduced retrospective legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I appreciate the support of the Opposition, and I shall try to answer their questions.
<P>
Several hon. Members asked about legal advice. It is a convention that Governments do not publish legal advice. That is how it has always been and that convention applies now. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked about the charging identified in 1995; there was much discussion of the complex legal issues and in 1996 it was decided that the charges would stop. The main problem occurred between 1981 and 1996. The hon. Gentleman asked why it took so long to identify the problem; as he is probably aware, incoming Governments do not see the advice given to previous Administrations. It is therefore difficult for me to say why the loophole was not spotted or what happened at the time, as the problem did not occur under this Government.
<P>
The 1981 Act gave the Sea Fish Industry Authority powers to levy charges, but they were delegated by Ministers under part III of that Act, and that is where the problem arose. There is doubt about whether Ministers ever had the power to delegate to the SFIA.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Section 16 of the 1981 Act allows the delegation of powers. How does it amend the Sea Fish Industry Act 1951? The 1981 Act mentions the original charges in the 1951 Act, but also refers to them as voluntary payments. The Bill gives details of the statutory instruments that followed that legislation; could they have been used to tighten and clarify the 1951 and 1981 Acts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The 1951 Act gave the White Fish Authority the power to make the charges, although there is doubt about the Herring Industry Board, which will be dealt with in clause 2. However, our legal advice is that there is a problem in the 1981 Act.
<P>
I am happy to confirm that the SFIA acted throughout in good faith; the problem is with the element of doubt about whether Ministers had the legal authority to delegate the powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Townend:</B> Will the Minister tell the Committee on what date the loophole or anomaly was drawn to his attention and on what date he received the legal advice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The matter was brought to my attention when the Government took office in May 1997 as one of a range of issues that had to be dealt with. The problem was identified in 1995 and an announcement was made in 1996 by the previous Government. On 5 November 1998 the Government announced in Parliament that the problem would be dealt with by retrospective legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Will the Minister confirm that when he took over his duties, advice from officials was already on the table that retrospective legislation would be needed to rectify the problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I can certainly confirm that, when I came into office, the advice from officials was that that was one way of dealing with such matters. Legal advice was still being taken and matters were still being considered, but the advice was that that was the best way to proceed. However, the time had to be found in which to introduce a Bill. As soon as the decision was taken, it was announced to the House in 1998.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby referred to administration charges. When those charges stopped in 1996, the costs were covered by grants to the sea fish industry. I assure him that we do not propose reintroduce such charges. Those charges have been ended.
<P>
Such charges depend on the legislation under which the Department, public authority or agency operates. In some cases, the legislation is clear and delegated responsibility from Ministers is not an issue, but I am sure that each Department's legal advisers have checked such matters carefully in all cases, and no doubt, they will continue to do so in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> On the issue raised by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, when I spoke to SFIA, my understanding was that technical charges were covered from 1996 to the present as the grant applications were processed, but that the SFIA received no additional grant aid from the Government; it gained its income from a levy on the fishing industry, from which it covered the costs of the charges. Will the Minister confirm that this is the case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Although the bulk of the money comes from the levy, the SFIA receives a grant from the Government. Those arrangements were made under the previous Administration, not the current one.
<P>
On the points made by the hon. Member for St. Ives, I am not unsympathetic to the idea of issuing a precis of the legal advice that we have received, but I emphasise that long-established Parliamentary conventions exist on the publication of legal advice. Those conventions go back many years and many Administrations. Speaking personally, I do not object to the Government being as transparent as possible within the rules that apply. I am more than willing to ask officials to consider whether Members could be given a precis of the legal advice on which the decision has been based.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to safety improvement grant schemes. Those schemes are outside the scope of the Bill, so all I can say is that we take such matters seriously and are discussing them with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, which has the lead responsibility for fishing vessel safety. We need to take a cross-Government approach and consider how to work with the industry, which also has a responsibility in dealing with safety, to foster a safety culture in it. The evidence from some recent tragedies shows that equipment has not been used or maintained properly. There is little point in paying for equipment if it is not used properly. Perhaps it would be better to concentrate on training and the safety culture in the industry. We must involve the industry in discussing those matters.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby made a point about retrospective legislation. I accept that such legislation is undesirable. We do not want to introduce retrospective legislation, but this is not a problem of our making; nevertheless, it has to be dealt with. I confirm that no complaint has ever been made about the charges levied and no attempt has been made to take such an issue to court. The charges were always considered to be reasonable and proportionate in their application. All the bodies were audited in the normal way. The industry has representatives on the SFIA board, as it had on those of its predecessor bodies, so the industry is part of it. That is only right and proper given that the industry pays a levy towards the costs.
<P>
I accept the points that my hon. Friend makes about charges. We must consider the charges levied on the industry in a competitive context. I hope that I have reassured him that we do not intend to reinstate the charges that were applied. Other countries have various charges for the administration of schemes that we do not have. There is a wide variation in business costs between member states, and costs in our country are often much lower than those of our competitor countries. That is worth remembering.
<P>
11.30 am
<P>
The hon. Member for East Yorkshire raised points about retrospective legislation. I accept that it is not desirable to introduce such legislation, but the problem is not of our making--we are dealing with an inherited situation. I have given the hon. Gentleman two examples that are comparable in relation to the charges, but he might also like to know that the Finance Act 1991 was a major retrospective measure that dealt with substantial charges relating to complaints from building societies. That was perhaps one of the biggest retrospective Acts introduced by any Government. It would be interesting to know whether the hon. Gentleman voted against it, as he is so concerned about such legislation.
<P>
If repaying the £7 million raised is so desirable, why did the hon. Gentleman's own Administration not repay it when they identified it in 1995? It seems a bit much to ask us to repay money for a mistake made by his Government. No one has actually asked for the money to be repaid. The industry itself recognises that the charges were fair and proportionate; that is not an issue. I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would be pleased that the Government are dealing with the problems. Fortunately, we do not have a surcharge, as exists in local government--some of his friends might be slightly worried about such issues. We have introduced the Bill to deal with the problem.
<P>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome asked--not unreasonably--why the announcement about ending the charge was not made in the Sea Fish Industry Authority's annual report and accounts. My understanding is that the authority considered referring to its potential liability, as it did when the matter was raised in 1996 when the previous Government identified it as a major problem. However, it was not thought appropriate to make any reference to it, as no decision had been made at that time about how to deal with the issue. The legal issues had to be examined. Subsequently, our Administration decided to legislate to ensure that the potential loophole was closed and that there was no argument about it. As soon as the Government made that decision in 1998, it was announced to the House, so it was in the public domain and people knew exactly which measures we intended to take.
<P>
The Sea Fish Industry Authority is not responsible for the problem; it is a problem for the Government, and we are trying to solve it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Townend:</B> Surely the Minister must accept that although the final legal advice was not available when the accounts were produced, there was a contingent liability. Whether that came to fruition is immaterial. Good audit practice suggests that it should have been noted in the accounts as a contingent liability. The hon. Gentleman raised an important point and the Minister has not given a satisfactory answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I repeat that the decision was made in 1996. I had no part in it, so I do not have full information about it. Under the rules of Parliament, I am not allowed to see the papers that were sent to Ministers at the time, so it is difficult for me to take responsibility for what happened. My information is that the matter was considered, but it was not thought appropriate to mention it in the accounts, because no decision had been taken about how to deal with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Townend:</B> I accept that the Minister is not responsible, but there is a question mark over the auditors at the time--I speak with some professional knowledge. They have not acted correctly, and it should be investigated why, when they knew that the potential liability was an issue, they did not record it in the accounts as a contingent liability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I am not an expert on auditors, so I bow to the hon. Gentleman's knowledge. However, I would have thought that the auditors would deal with finances and that their main responsiblity involved accounts. I would guess that in 1996 there was some uncertainty about the scale of the problem and potential liability. It would therefore be difficult for auditors to make an announcement without knowing exactly what the liability was.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful for that explanation, which demonstrates the importance of indicating a contingent liability in accounts. The Minister is not at fault because the matter relates to events before his time. However, it would be helpful for the Ministry and the Committee if the apparent deficit in the account were drawn to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General. I would welcome the Minister's comments on whether it is true to say that, at that time, the authority's accounts did not draw attention to that potential liability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> We are getting into complex legal accounting methods. I shall therefore take advice on the matter and write to the hon. Gentlemen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Townend:</B> Who were the auditors?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister has given an undertaking that he will write to the hon. Gentlemen, addressing the points that they raised. He is unable to give detailed answers this morning, but has promised to address the matter. Will the Minister stick to winding up debate on clause 1 and will hon. Members restrict their interventions to matters relating to it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Thank you, Mr. Hancock. It is important that we keep to the Bill's narrow remit.
<P>
Finally, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Dr. Godman), the total amount of grant paid for adaptations and safety in that period was £88.7 million. Technical charges relating to that were £7.3 million for the total period. Of course, those charges were different from decommissioning schemes, as my hon. Friend knows from his great experience. He made the point that there was some criticism of some decommissioning charges. Indeed, the National Audit Office produced a critical report on the matter.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Validation of certain charges made by the Herring Industry Board</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> As we have had a detailed discussion of the essence of the Bill, I shall be brief
<P>
Clause 2 is designed to bring the Herring Industry Board within the scope of the Bill. It is being incorporated because it raised charges on the same basis as the SFIA. Therefore, although the matters concerned took place a long time ago, retrospective legislation should include all possibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The only question that I wish to ask on the clause is whether the Herring Industry Board is treated differently from the White Fish Authority, which became the SFIA.
<P>
The 1981 Act covered the Herring Industry Board. In 1981, why did MAFF not move provisions covering the White Fish Authority into that Act? The Minister has already confirmed that the authority had powers to make technical charges. So was there a glaring oversight at the time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome commented on clause 1. I could sum up our thoughts on clause 2 by saying "as above".
<P>
The Minister promised to investigate the possibility of furnishing us with a precis of legal advice relating to clause 1. In responding to my hon. Friend's question about the SFIA's accounting responsibilities, will he furnish similar materials relating to the Herring Industry Board?
<P>
<B>Dr. Godman:</B> Was it not the case that the Herring Industry Board disappeared many years ago and that clause 2 is a purely technical matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I can certainly confirm that clause 2 is a technical matter, but it is also about making the Herring Industry Board consistent with the SFIA. The White Fish Authority has powers to levy charges, but when it was amalgamated with the SFIA in 1981, new provisions applied. The charges relating to these technicalities were levied through part III of the 1981 Act on the basis of delegated powers from Ministers.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Citation, application and extent</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Clause 3 deals with citation of the Bill. No charges were levied for the administration work after 3 May 1996 and clause 3(2) is necessary to make it clear that the Bill does not facilitate their re-introduction after that date--a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde. Subsection (3) is necessary to establish that the Bill extends to the whole United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland. The Scottish Executive has been consulted and supports that. The charges were originally levied on a UK basis, so the Bill has the same basis.
<P>
<B>Dr. Godman:</B> Very quickly, my hon. Friend the Minister mentioned the Scottish Executive and I know that there is a concordat on these matters between it and the Minister's Department. My hon. Friend may not be able to answer immediately, but what proportion of the £80 million went to Scottish fishing vessel owners?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I cannot answer that now, but I shall write to him with the information.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Bill to be reported, without amendment.
