<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000276"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I welcome our witnesses who are changing places:
having been part of the Committee questioning witnesses in the earlier
sessions, they are now to be subject to questions from other members of
the Committee. I welcome particularly Vernon Coaker, the Minister for
Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, Alan Campbell, the
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, and Jim Fitzpatrick,
the Under-Secretary of State for Transport.</div>
<a name="090129105000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are going
to take the various sections separately. The first will be policing,
the second airport security, the third prostitution, the fourth
alcohol, the fifth proceeds of crime, and the final one extradition. We
have agreed to spend a certain amount of time on each one, and we will
start with questions on policing from the spokesman for Her
Majesty&#146;s
Opposition.</div><a name="090129105000010"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
162</b><a name="090129105000277"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): Thank you, Sir
Nicholas. My questions are addressed to the Minister of State in the
spirit of honest inquiry that we have had on so many
occasions&#151;not always, but most of the time. On the issue of
collaboration, I think there is one thing we can agree on. We all heard
the evidence from Sir Norman Bettison on how mandation would be looked
at by any Home Secretary or Minister from whichever political party. He
suggested&#151;I put the idea into his head&#151;that Ministers in
the Home Office should draw up a map dividing up England and Wales and
say that those regions or sub-regions will collaborate on five issues
that will be mandated across those forces. He suggested that that was
at the hard end of the collaboration procedure that is provided for in
the Bill. My question is a straight, practical one and it is not in any
sense party political, as I am sure you will concede. Is it in the mind
of the Home Office to do what I have suggested, to divide up England
and Wales and have a structured programme of mandation, with specific
forces for specific
activities?</div><a name="090129105000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> Good afternoon, Sir Nicholas, and members of
Committee. In answer to that question I wish to make the point, as
Mr. Ruffley did, that we have constructive engagement. I say
that at the beginning of every meeting, but it is important to put it
on the record. Given that this is an evidence session rather than a
regular Committee sitting in which it sometimes becomes a bit more them
versus us, I will try to engage in the constructive way that he
suggests.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div><a name="090129105000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
thing to say is that the mergers debate was about closing a gap that
everybody accepted existed. If that was not the correct route and the
Government withdrew from proposing the mergers because of the
resistance, the problem of what to do about protective services and
serious and organised crime was not necessarily resolved. That
fundamentally goes to the heart of the question, because if you are not
going to sort this by mergers, how will you? How will you deal with
serious and organised crime, cross-border issues and all those types of
things?</div><a name="090129105000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
approach over the past few years, and our approach, has always been
that we need to encourage collaboration. I am sure that if members of
the Committee thought about it they could point to really good examples
in their own areas of when their police forces have collaborated with
other police forces to tackle problems. Certainly our view, in line
with what Sir Norman said, is that the best way forward is to bring
about that collaboration by voluntary means&#151;by agreement.
Alongside that, work is going on to look at what decisions are best
made to help inform the choice that local police forces will make. For
example Denis O&#146;Connor, the acting chief inspector, has under a
letter from me been asked to consider at what level decisions are best
taken, so that we get the subsidiarity debate out into the open and
looked at. So work is going on, in the first instance to inform the
debate about whether a decision should be taken at the local, regional
or national level. We are not looking at a master plan, but we are
looking at the best way to ensure
collaboration.</div><a name="090129105000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Bill we have given some certainty to the legislative framework
because police authorities and police forces tell us that it is not
clear. That is the reason for many of the clauses. We have tried to be
clear in the Bill that mandation is not a first resort. It is something
that we need to consider when it is clearly in the public interest and
when there just seems to be obstruction to something that everyone
agrees would be of benefit to not only those police forces but the
local areas. It is a last resort, based on an informed choice at a
local level, rather than being some sort of great master plan that is
sent
down.</div><a name="090129105000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
163</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000278"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> In using the words &#147;master plan&#148; I
was not luring you into a trap, Minister. I did not mean to be
pejorative. I wanted to ask whether there was something more structured
than just the voluntary ad hoc collaboration arrangements that we have
had up to now. Behind these clauses is the recognition by the Home
Office and the observation of outsiders that voluntary collaboration
does not work. It does not get enough collaboration quickly enough. You
are speeding that up and facilitating it. It therefore follows
logically that if the voluntary arrangements are not satisfactory after
the strategic merger debate&#151;and they have not been&#151;the
Home Office might want to force the pace. In my view, it would be right
to do that. I think that you have answered the question, but I want to
know whether you are aware of any work that seeks to mandate a master
plan or a structured plan for England and
Wales.</div><a name="090129105000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> No. To tease this issue
out, we talk about protective services and serious and
organised crime as if they are the same thing. When you are looking at
collaboration, you are talking about serious and organised
crime&#151;whatever that means&#151;but you are also talking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>about IT systems, transport systems, horses and
dogs, things that are related to murder investigations and protecting
people from the most serious offenders. Some of those issues require
different approaches from others. Serious and organised crime might
need a more regional focus, whereas two or three forces might be
involved in the issue of how many police forces have a mounted section.
It is important to think about what is appropriate at a local level
alongside the national
parameters.</div><a name="090129105000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
164</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000279"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> May I ask again how these clauses will help the
police service in practice? I have in mind clause 11 and related
clauses, which firm up the powers of direction for Ministers. To make
this real for people who are following the debate, the clauses give
more centralised powers to Ministers. That need not of itself be a bad
thing. I am not saying that all centralisation is bad because it
clearly is
not.</div><a name="090129105000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
it be fair to say that you could use these powers to mandate what Sir
Ronnie Flanagan correctly said in his interim report&#151;not so much
in the final report&#151;that there should be a national suite of
forms for the most frequently committed offences that officers can use
with minimum reporting requirements? As you will recall, in the interim
report, Sir Ronnie said that he expected the national suite of forms
that would save police time to be drafted by the Association of Chief
Police Officers and the National Police Improvement Network by July
2008. That has not happened. Would the powers in clause 11 and related
clauses tempt you to mandate a national suite of forms and similar
time-saving measures, which need an element of
centralisation?</div><a name="090129105000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> You can clearly use them
for the purposes that you think
appropriate.</div><a name="090129105000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
165</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000280"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Would the national suite of reforms be such an
example?</div><a name="090129105000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> If you wanted to use the powers to introduce
that, you could. However, we do not think that we will need to. There
will be announcements from Jan Berry in the next few weeks that will
deal with some of the issues with bureaucracy. Sir David
Normington&#146;s report into reducing the annual data requirement
will also be released soon. There will be a number of measures that do
not require the compilation of templates for a national suite of forms
that could be mandated. The purpose of clause 11 is to inject a sense
of momentum, urgency and pace into the procedures and processes. It is
correct that there has been progress. We want to enhance that progress
and push it further. We will mandate where necessary, but that will be
a last
resort.</div><a name="090129105000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
166</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000281"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I gave the example of the national suite of
forms, which you have discounted. Just so that these clauses are
brought to life, will you give the Committee a couple of examples of
how this power might be used? In what areas of policy would you seek to
use these powers to direct and mandate in ways that the Home Office
does not already? I would like real-life practical
examples.</div><a name="090129105000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> You could mandate the IT systems and software
that are used by some
forces.</div><a name="090129105000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
167</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000282"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Have you contemplated mandating
IT solutions?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div><a name="090129105000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> If anybody looked at police forces across the
country, they would have to be persuaded that having 43 IT solutions to
a problem was for the best.</div>
<a name="090129105000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000283"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I happen to agree with you.</div>
<a name="090129105000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> I know.</div>
<a name="090129105000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
168</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000284"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> So, IT is a real-life example.</div>
<a name="090129105000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> IT could certainly be
looked at and there are other operational things that we can do. If you
look, as I know you have done, at some of the clauses dealing with
collaboration, you will see that they try to address some of the
practical problems of, for example, police moving across borders and
issues of direction and control. It is about trying to come to an
agreement voluntarily and looking to see what needs to be mandated
where necessary.</div>
<a name="090129105000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
169</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000285"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> So, not forms but maybe IT. That is very
interesting.</div><a name="090129105000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
seeking to make a party political point, but my final question is about
the very detailed proposals that were in the Green Paper that do not
appear in the Bill about direct elections of crime and policing
representatives. I am sure that others will want to pick up on that.
Instead, in clause 1 there is
a</div><a name="090129105000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requirement to have
regard to the
views&#148;</div><a name="090129105000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">of
the public on policing. Can you give an indication of where the Green
Paper proposals stand? Should we expect them to be enacted after David
Blunkett&#146;s report? Although they are not in the Bill, I
understand that they are still alive in some netherworld. What is the
status of those Green Paper proposals?</div>
<a name="090129105000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> Clearly, as you say, they
are not in the Bill; we took them out for the reasons that you and I
have rehearsed. We worried about the politicisation that could result
from direct elections of that type and, frankly, about the lack of
consensus. I am not trying to make a party political point, but you
know from different authorities across the country how controversial
they are. In a sense, all three Front Benches of the major political
parties were completely at odds with their local parties and their
local authorities. We have moved to what we think is a more sensible
approach to police
authorities.</div><a name="090129105000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
asked about David Blunkett&#146;s review and the issue of direct
elections. The proposal will not be brought back in the near future
and, clearly, there will be a general election before they could be
brought back, so we will see what happens after that. The Home
Secretary has asked David Blunkett to look at direct elections and see
whether we, within the Labour party, can move from complete hostility
towards a model that will meet the concerns people have raised about
politicisation and the election of minority or extremist groups to
police authorities. You are aware of many of the
arguments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
170</b><a name="090129105000286"></a><b class="B">Lynda
Waltho</b> (Stourbridge) (Lab): My question
concerns collaboration. What has the reaction of the police been to the
proposed measures? What reaction have local authorities and the crime
partnerships had over how their role will change and how important they
will still be?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div><a name="090129105000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> There may be the odd bit or
a particular element in a clause that ACPO and the Association of
Police Authorities do not agree with, but, generally, they welcomed the
clauses about collaboration because they have been asking for them.
They have been concerned about the lack of legislative clarity about
what they can and cannot do in terms of sharing services and resources,
and moving officers between forces.</div>
<a name="090129105000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also gave
the example of direction and control. If an officer from my
constituency in Nottinghamshire on mutual aid duties goes to
Derbyshire, they fall under the direction and control of the Derbyshire
force. However, if they are doing a drugs raid, for example, there is a
lack of clarity over who directs and controls the operation. Where
there is agreement, the Bill seeks to resolve
that.</div><a name="090129105000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
respect to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000,
cross-authorisation is another matter that police officers have come to
us with and said is a complete nonsense, because in different
circumstances they are required to get many different authorisations
because they are moving between areas. The clauses try to deal with
some of those problems practically. They have generally been welcomed,
and we have responded to what people have to say.</div>
<a name="090129105000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">You asked
about crime and disorder reduction partnerships at local level. Again,
our focus is to say that we have got the police authority and police
force levels, at which we seek to collaborate, and that within those
levels we have local basic command units and local structures, which
will continue to be as important as they have been in all our
constituencies.</div><a name="090129105000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
171</b><a name="090129105000287"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): Clause 1 talks about the new
duty on police authorities</div>
<a name="090129105000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to have regard to the
views&#148;</div><a name="090129105000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">of the local
community or the public. What exactly does that mean? How will it take
effect or be
enforced?</div><a name="090129105000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> It strengthens the current
duty, under the Police Act 1996. Instead of saying that police
authorities have to take into account the views of the public, or
whatever the phraseology is, saying that they must &#147;have regard
to&#148; views means that they will have to go out and proactively
seek the opinions and views of people across the whole community. I
expect that to include not only the people who normally turn up at
meetings. I expect police authorities to demonstrate that they have
gone out to seek the views of residents associations, community
members, businesses and voluntary organisations&#151;all those
different people who make up the community. We will make that clear
when we negotiate the inspection arrangements with Her Majesty&#146;s
inspectorate of constabulary.</div>
<a name="090129105000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Ruffley made a
valid point, and sometimes it is important to read these things into
the record. I do not want misunderstanding of what &#147;have regard
to&#148; means. It will not be acceptable for a police authority to
try to demonstrate that it has had regard to the public by saying,
&#147;We gave a leaflet out.&#148; It needs to be a proactive
attempt to engage with local communities, businesses, voluntary
organisations, schools and so on. The key is that
police authorities will have to be able to prove to HMIC, on
inspection, that they have done that.</div>
<a name="090129105000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer Mr.
Ruffley, I think that that gives us a way of addressing the fact that
police authorities can be anonymous to people. That is not always the
case, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>but, sometimes&#151;I am trying to be
fair&#151;if people were asked who the members of their police
authority were, they would not know. This will give police authorities
a much better opportunity to be known, to be held to account for what
they do, and to demonstrate not only to HMIC, but, more important, to
the public, that the views that the public have expressed to them have
influenced policing in their area. That can be
demonstrated.</div><a name="090129105000045"></a>

First, you seem to be saying that the clause does not so much create a
new duty &#147;to have regard to&#148; as beef up the existing
requirement on police authorities to consult. I had assumed that they
did that anyway&#151;or perhaps we in Derbyshire are just very lucky
and ours does that more than others.</div>
<a name="090129105000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> &#147;Have regard to&#148; is much
stronger than the previous wording, which I cannot remember exactly, in
the Police Act. The new wording will make a significant difference to
the way in which police authorities are inspected. I know that yours is
the Derbyshire police authority, and there are examples of good police
authorities across the country that do that, but we are saying that it
is not good enough for some to be good, some to be okay, and some to be
not good. We need to have a way of driving forward to ensure that we
bring all police authorities up to the standard of the best. Different
people here will have different views on their police authorities and
whether they are good, bad or patchy. The provision is a significant
strengthening on the requirement on police authorities to consult the
public and seek out their
views.</div><a name="090129105000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
173</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000289"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Liberty suggested that an unforeseen consequence
of the stronger wording might be that community groups will bring
judicial review cases, saying, &#147;Our local authority has not had
regard to what we
said.&#148;</div><a name="090129105000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> In the end, if you look at
police authorities in the broadest sense, it will be a matter for HMIC
to check whether there is any substance to people&#146;s complaints,
in any area, about their views not being taken into account. That
brings us back to Mr. Ruffley&#146;s point, and we start
arguing about the measure and mechanism that we have put in the Bill to
try to ensure that people have more say on how their areas are policed.
There are other ways of doing that&#151;for example, the Liberal
Democrats have proposed forms of direct election, and the Conservatives
have proposed the abolition of police authorities. There are different
approaches. We are saying that we are moving away from direct election
for the time being to give us more time to actually look at what that
is. However, this measure is a significant strengthening of those
powers and the ability to hold police authorities to
account.</div><a name="090129105000049"></a>

Holmes:</b> In terms of the clauses giving the Minister power
to direct certain forces to do certain things, Bob Jones, representing
the Association of Police Authorities, told the Committee on Tuesday
that that is an unnecessary level of
mandation&#151;ignoring the police authority and giving a direct
instruction to a chief constable. I presume that you do not agree with
that?</div><a name="090129105000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> No, I do not agree with that. The APA does
not agree with any of the mandation parts of the Bill, but I think that
mandation is a necessary part of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>the powers that the Bill contains. It should be
available where it is clearly and patently in the public interest and
the general interest of the area to move on that collaboration, not as
the first resort but as the last
resort.</div><a name="090129105000051"></a>

is passed, there will be a new situation&#151;which
takes precedence if the police authority and the chief constable say,
&#147;We are having regard to our local community consultation and
they want us to do this, but the Minister has mandated that we do the
opposite.&#148;? Which one has
precedence?</div><a name="090129105000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> That is why we have an
inspectorate. Part of it is to say to HMIC that we will be
responsible for what happens in a local area and will take its advice.
That happens now, without mandation&#151;we get asked about all sorts
of things that are going on in forces. Sometimes there is a
disagreement between a force and the authority, and we take the advice
of HMIC and make a judgment. I cannot categorically say,
without actual examples, who would be right in a specific
circumstance&#151;the chief constable or the police authority. It
would depend on what was actually happening in the
area.</div><a name="090129105000053"></a>

when the police authorities&#151;as we know, they will be inspected
from this April&#151;are specifically inspected according to the new
duty that we are placing upon them. If it was only the first clause, or
the first part of the clause, Bob Jones might be able to say,
&#147;It will not make a difference&#151;show us what difference it
will make.&#148; But HMIC will inspect the authorities and we will
hold them to account on the basis of HMIC&#146;s findings. Let us be
frank&#151;I will hurry up, Sir Nicholas&#151;the police
authorities did not like direct elections because they felt that they
had good partnerships, worked well in their local areas, represented
their views and influenced policing. They should
not be afraid of inspection now that we have taken away direct
elections and placed a specific duty upon them. They should be
welcoming inspection so that they can demonstrate to HMIC how well they
are
doing.</div><a name="090129105000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000294"></a>The
Chairman:</b> A Back Bencher on the
Committee has caught my eye: Ian Cawsey. Be brief. I remind colleagues,
we are allocated specific time for the various duties of the Committee
and we are already exceeding it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div><a name="090129105000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
178</b><a name="090129105000295"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Ian Cawsey</b> (Brigg and Goole) (Lab): I
would like to ask a couple of quick questions about
police authorities and collaboration. First, is the intention of the
Bill that police authorities should be more visible within their
communities, play a stronger role in what the police do, or be more
accountable for what they do now, which perhaps people do not
understand? Or is it a combination of all of
those?</div><a name="090129105000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> It is a combination of all
of that. As I was saying to Mr. Holmes earlier, the aim is
to raise the standards of some up to the standards of the best. In some
areas&#151;we can point to examples across the country&#151;the
police authority is visible and people have some knowledge of who the
chair of the authority is, and perhaps one or two other members, in
their area. Members of the authority go out, they organise meetings,
they have regular public-facing events and they demonstrate how they
work with the police; in other areas, that is not the case. It is about
having greater visibility for the police authority, so that people are
more aware of who is on it, but it is also about ensuring that the
public have more influence, through the authority, on how their area
is policed.</div>
<a name="090129105000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
179</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000296"></a>Mr.
Cawsey:</b> Can I move on to collaboration?
You obviously want to push collaboration as part of all of this. I
chaired a police authority for four years; then, collaboration mainly
took place on a number of informal, operation-based issues, or, more
formally, through regional crime squads. Regional crime squads would in
turn have a regional crime squad committee, which would usually
comprise the chairmen of the police authorities that served that area,
but it would be stretching the truth to say that there was very much
input from the regional crime squad. We would go to Durham once a
quarter and hear about all the operations, and there was no
accountability through that. If police authorities are to be pushed
more to the front on accountability and deciding what happens on the
one hand, and on the other hand there is going to be more inter-force
collaboration, how will you square that
circle?</div><a name="090129105000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> In a sense, police authorities are starting
to do that themselves. If you look at the situation
five or 10 years ago, when we had the mergers debate, everyone fought
for their own area. I think that the debate has become much more mature
and that police authorities themselves are now saying, &#147;We need
to work better with each other if we&#146;re going to solve some of
the problems that we have.&#148; Many of these
measures&#151;notwithstanding the mandating part&#151;are at the
request of the police authorities and police forces. They do not like
the mandating part, because they say, &#147;We want to do this, and
we can do it because things have changed.&#148; I think things have
moved on.</div>
<a name="090129105000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also think, again in the spirit of the Committee, that whatever the
public spending round, we are not going to have bonuses of billions of
pounds of additional money. People can also see that not only is it
sensible to collaborate, but money can be saved&#151;not to go back
to the Treasury, but to be reinvested in front-line services, such as
murder squads, drugs squads or wherever is appropriate. Not only is an
operational imperative pushing this on, but people are also saying that
we can make significant savings, which will allow us to reinvest in
other areas and to reprioritise. Squaring the circle is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>about not just what we are doing centrally, but about a change in the
way in which police authorities look at the way they
work.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000298"></a>Mr.

181</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000302"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Yes, Mr. Fitzpatrick&#151;always a
pleasure.</div>
<a name="090129105000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard
evidence to the effect that the proposed legislation is a
one-size-fits-all affair. What practical measures have you worked up
with your Home Office colleagues, to prevent onerous financial burdens
being put on the smaller airports and
aerodromes?</div><a name="090129105000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b></i> We recognise that there are airports
which at the moment are not contributing to the policing of their
establishments, but which are going to be required to do so in due
course. However, it has been clearly demonstrated, by those airports
that are paying for it, that it can be done. We have created a
structure where each airport can devise a security plan that fits its
needs, which will mean that there will not be a one-size-fits-all
system; it will be a flexible arrangement that is adequate for those
airports.</div><a name="090129105000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be a 15-month introductory period between the Bill being passed
and the requirement to pay, so there will be some time for the airport
to make arrangements with its customers, passengers, operators and
retailers regarding how that money is gathered. Although there will be
a financial payment to be made, we do not think that it will be beyond
airports to make it, and we think that there is enough flexibility in
the system to ensure that the required security arrangements will be
commensurate with the needs of the
airport.</div><a name="090129105000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
182</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000303"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> So your response to the critique that a
one-size-fits-all approach will be to the disadvantage of the smaller
airports and aerodromes is basically to say that
the arrangements will be proportionate and that that will be a matter
of common sense in the negotiations, so we do not need to worry that
the clause will be applied to the smaller airports
heavy-handedly?</div><a name="090129105000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b></i> Indeed, and we will produce guidance for
airports to be able to apply. By creating a mandatory
framework&#151;at the moment, this is voluntary and does 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>not happen in some instances&#151;we will ensure an application across
the country that is acknowledged and identified as appropriate. We are
introducing an appeals procedure to the Secretary of State in the event
of disputes, but we do not anticipate many disputes arising. As the
guidance is digested by airports and as the application for each
airport is identified, we believe that agreements will be reached
between the police in that area and the airports, so we think that it
is a very positive way
forward.</div><a name="090129105000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
183</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000304"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I have a final question, to which the Minister of
State might want to contribute, about police time and resources. Let us
take the example of aerodromes and airports at which, to be frank,
little policing is done. Under the arrangements before us, a local
force will have to provide&#151;admittedly for cash&#151;resources
and assets to police the airport. What assessment has been made of the
capacity of local forces to deliver that? It is a bit too simplistic to
say, &#147;The private sector will cough up the money, so that the
chief constable of force X can employ more officers and kit to deliver
policing at that airport.&#148; Logically, that is easy, but in
practice it is not like that, is it Minister? What discussions have
been had with local forces about how they will provide those extra
assets and police time, even though they are getting paid for
it?</div><a name="090129105000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> The measures in the Bill have been drawn up
in collaboration with the police, so those capacity issues and the very
real concerns that you raise&#151;they are genuine points&#151;were
part of the discussions that took place. As I said, the police believe
that, in the context of the new arrangements for airport policing, and
with the resources to be made available and so on, they can police the
airports
appropriately.</div><a name="090129105000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
184</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000305"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> They are quite satisfied with it and have done
their planning and are thinking ahead of the game. Training and further
recruitment will be necessary&#151;all that has been sorted, has
it?</div><a name="090129105000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> All that is part of what will need to be
sorted out for the plan to be put together and made effective, when the
Bill becomes
law.</div><a name="090129105000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b></i> In terms of bringing airports into
mainstream policing, we do not anticipate that the numbers or pressures
will be that great. Our dispute on Tuesday about Prestwick was about
whether there should be four and a half or nine officers at a
relatively big airport. We are not talking about massive numbers that
will impinge on any chief constable&#146;s ability to perform his
statutory
duties.</div><a name="090129105000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>The point has been made that,
with additional and more effective airport policing, we could reduce,
or put off, some harmful criminality coming in through
airports.</div><a name="090129105000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b></i> In many instances, the police are there
already undertaking such duties, but they are not being paid for by the
airport operators. They are already in situ, and they have already been
recruited and trained to do the
job.</div><a name="090129105000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
185</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000306"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> The two witnesses from the Airport Operators
Association suggested that an alternative offering financial economies
of scale was to let the British Transport police take on the job. Does
that idea have any merit? Has that been considered?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div><a name="090129105000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b></i> It has been considered and dismissed as
inappropriate, for a number of reasons. Some simple ones are: in the
event of a demonstration at an airport, the British Transport police
would police the airport and the local constabulary would have to be
outside. Furthermore, the British Transport police have no armed
capability, so if you need armed officers within the airport you would
need to train BTP officers, which would mean bringing in a whole new
capacity. Where there was a requirement for the local force to come in
to supplement security because of a particular threat you might have a
command and control conflict, because you would have two different
forces serving the airport. The idea has been looked at, but it was
felt that what we needed was mainstream policing and the chief
constable to be involved with the local risk assessment and the local
airport. It was not considered appropriate but it has been
considered.</div><a name="090129105000086"></a>

186</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000307"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> The AOA witnesses also expressed concern about
every airport having to have armed police. To me the terrorist
potential of a crowded airport lobby would suggest that you need armed
police. What are your
thoughts?</div><a name="090129105000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b></i> We do not think that is an obligatory or
mandatory requirement. We do think that having the risk assessment
group review the needs of each airport will determine what is required
at each airport. We do not think it obligatory for every airport to
have an armed detachment. It will be for the senior managers of the
airport and the local constabulary to make an assessment and then work
out what is appropriate for
them.</div><a name="090129105000088"></a>

proportionately the shortest amount of time because I have only two
questions for the Minister of
State.</div><a name="090129105000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first picks up on what Shami Chakrabarti said in this morning&#146;s
session, which was that strict liability is a blunt tool. She said that
an alternative way of clamping down on this abhorrent trade of
trafficking females was to have an offence with intent imported into
it&#151;she suggested recklessness or negligence. On the strict
liability drafting, did you, with your officials and legal advisers,
give consideration to what Ms Chakrabarti said was possible, that is,
an element of intent? If not, why
not?</div><a name="090129105000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> My colleague, Alan Campbell, will say some
things on prostitution but Mr. Ruffley asks me directly so I
will respond to this question.</div>
<a name="090129105000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
taking too much of the Committee&#146;s time, it is necessary to say
that the legislation we are proposing marks a fundamental shift in the
way we try to tackle this problem. That is what I said to Ms
Chakrabarti this morning. It is not about banning prostitution. It is
about trying to turn it around and say, let us stop for ever talking
about the women&#151;as much as we need to in terms of improving
services, trying to prevent them entering prostitution in the first
place, and so on. Let us for a complete change focus on men and the
responsibility they have in this area. I am not ignoring the question
that was directly asked; I shall come to
it.</div><a name="090129105000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
we have started to debate the issue in that way without being laughed
out of court. I make that point everywhere I go. You can argue that if
two, four, six, eight, 10 or whatever number of years ago, we had
started to say that we need to look at the male side of the problem,
people would have trashed it and said, &#147;This is ridiculous.
Prostitution has existed for centuries, you are not going to change
anything,&#148; and so on. I think that there has been a shift in the
debate, and to be fair to the shadow Policing Minister, he and his
Front-Bench colleagues have said that they are considering their
response. That is a change, too&#151;all of us are now wrestling with
the problem.</div>
<a name="090129105000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next
question is, what sort of offence do you create if you are talking
about the men? In a sense, you are trying to change the current dynamic
whereby a man purchasing sex in most instances&#151;most, not all; I
do not want to decry everybody&#151;thinks, &#147;I&#146;ll
purchase the sex.&#148; They do not think, &#147;Is this somebody
who is exploited?&#148; We have talked about trafficking, but we are
also talking about women who are exploited, used, controlled and forced
by violent partners. In no sense can that be regarded as a free
choice.</div>
<a name="090129105000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
then started to explore the matter and thought about how to create a
situation in which men, instead of acting with impunity, are put in a
position where, at the very least, they are concerned about the
consequences of their action. I am often told that there is no problem
and we should just prosecute them for rape, but how 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>many times has anybody been prosecuted for rape? Who
really believes that the alternative to what has been
suggested&#151;I am not saying that Mr. Ruffley said
this&#151;is to prosecute them for rape? So, we thought in our
discussions that the strict liability offence was necessary.</div>
<a name="090129105000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Ruffley asked whether you need intent&#151;whether it is
recklessness.</div>
<a name="090129105000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
192</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000315"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Was that considered in policy
terms?</div><a name="090129105000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> All the various issues were
considered&#151;whether you just had an offence of having sex with a
trafficked woman, or with someone who was forced to work as a
prostitute. We thought that if we were really going to make a
difference, rather than introduce something cosmetic that made everyone
feel good but did not drive down to that particular interaction, we
would need something far stronger. That is why we have gone for the
strict liability offence. The point that Julie Kirkbride made this
morning is the one that we in the Home Office have had a considerable
debate about. Clearly, the difference between lawyers is on how you
define &#147;controlled for gain&#148;. We will need to consider
that point in Committee, but that is how we arrived at the strict
liability
offence.</div>
<a name="090129105000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
193</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000316"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> We can agree on the aim, but, at the Joint
Committee on Human Rights, we had an exchange about how you deal with
men, when I asked whether the Government were considering something
similar to the scheme in Italy, where there is a hotline for punters to
report abuses. They are encouraged to do so, and, to make it work, they
do not criminalise; they think that you will get better harm reduction
and more convictions by that method. You may recall that we had an
exchange when the Committee showed evidence from our visit that there
are 100 times more prosecutions for trafficking and 100 times more
women are saved&#151;on the raw figures. People have considered the
demand side and how men can be approached, but to what extent did you
consider that option when formulating your policy? There is not much
reference to it in the &#147;Tackling Demand for Prostitution&#148;
review document.</div>
<a name="090129105000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> We considered it. At the JCHR Committee we
had a number of exchanges, but we certainly had a constructive
exchange. I have been to Sweden and the Netherlands, we have done a
literature review, and we looked at research and evidence&#151;I know
you were raising that point the other day, and had considered different
studies&#151;and all those different things. At the end of the day,
if you are ever in government, you will make judgments about what you
consider to be the most appropriate. That is what it comes down to in
the end. You have all of those options, you consider them, and you make
a judgment about what you think will have an effect.</div>
<a name="090129105000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
there is the argument that, if you have a strict liability offence, it
will affect the fact that there are all these men queuing up to phone
in and let the police know that they think that there is somebody being
trafficked or exploited. It is not just
trafficking; it is people who are forced into it through violence and a
dependence on drugs. All of those sorts of things are also examples of
somebody being exploited and who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>cannot, in any sense of the word, be expected or
considered to have made a free choice. So, we have considered all of
these things, and, in the end, it comes back to what I said to
Mr. Ruffley: if you really want to make a difference, rather
than have something which is cosmetic and makes everyone feel good, you
have to get down there and drive into
that.</div><a name="090129105000111"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000317"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That is my point exactly. If you have to make a
judgment&#151;</div><a name="090129105000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> We
have.</div><a name="090129105000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
194</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000318"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Yes, you have to make a judgment. Would the
judgment not be based on evidence? You said that you looked at the
evidence in your review, but, actually, the review of the evidence has
not, as I understand it, even been published
yet.</div><a name="090129105000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> No, it has not been published
yet.</div><a name="090129105000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
195</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000319"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> So, here we are considering making laws, and you
are asserting that you are making what I assume is an evidence-based
decision. We cannot see that evidence. On the contrary, we have had
suggestions, from the Royal College of Nursing and, in particular, NHS
workers, that the evidence suggests that what you are doing, though
well intentioned, would be counter-productive in terms of reporting and
harm reduction. Does that not give you pause, at
least?</div><a name="090129105000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> We are looking at publishing the evidence. As
I say, and I will let Alan come in now as this is his policy area, you
pick the evidence which, in the end, backs your argument. If you listen
to what the Poppy Project said, it was the complete opposite. That is
what I am saying about judgments. You consider what you think is the
best way to tackle the problem, and that is what we have
done.</div><a name="090129105000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> There is wide discussion about the effect
that this offence would have on men who might come across women whom
they believe have been, or have evidence that they have been,
trafficked. It might deter them from coming forward.</div>
<a name="090129105000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked
officials to look into that and they could not find any concrete
example of where that is the case. However, in answer to the very first
point that you made, I am genuinely interested in how this could be
facilitated, perhaps through an anonymous hotline. It would be
difficult to say that someone, who came forward after having been to a
prostitute that had been trafficked, would be treated and dealt with
differently within the law because they then furnished the evidence or
the suggestion that the woman&#151;predominantly, it is a
woman&#151;had been trafficked. So, I am open to the suggestion of
some anonymous
line.</div><a name="090129105000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
struck me out of all the evidence that we have taken or listened to
over the last few days, Sir Nicholas, was the point from the Poppy
Project. They said that they had evidence of men who brought forward,
or, at least, pushed in their direction, women whom they believed had
been trafficked. There were 22 such cases, but in each of the cases the
men, either believing or knowing that the women had been trafficked,
still had sex with them.</div>
<a name="090129105000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">That will
probably be the thing which I will take away from these sessions more
than anything else. It goes back to what my colleague has said. There
is an unfairness in the situation where raids have taken place around 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>trafficking, which is not just an international
issue but a domestic issue, too&#151;it happens within countries as
well as between countries. We know where the law stands on traffickers
and what will happen to women in those circumstances. But there is a
gap in the law. What happens to the man who has been there? We have
decided&#151;after, I can assure you, a very long and thorough
consideration&#151;that we are in the right place on strict
liability. Difficult though it is, we are in the right
place.</div><a name="090129105000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
196</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000320"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Did you do any research asking men, through, for
example, punters&#146; websites or indeed outreach work? It is
possible to reach men; the NHS does it all of the time because they are
reaching prostitutes. Did you do any research, published or otherwise,
that suggested whether men were more likely either to desist or to
report under each of the regimes: the status quo, the proposed regime,
or a different regime whereby you would fund a hotline, outreach work
and exit strategies for women whom the men knew they could then
help?</div><a name="090129105000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> As I say, we keep our options open on a
hotline and funding. We would certainly look at examples from elsewhere
to see how it would help. Of course, we test each of the propositions
against as much evidence as we can collect. The evidence from some
countries is that where, for example, there is a similar measure to the
one we are proposing, it has a deterrent effect. It has a deterrent
effect in the first place. Of course, we have to consider whether, in
the case of men who are closely involved with prostitutes and have been
to prostitutes, that will colour their decision about bringing forward
evidence. What we are after is something that is also important, which
is to deter them in the first place by putting it into their minds that
unless they are absolutely sure, then they should not do
it.</div><a name="090129105000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
197</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000321"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b><b class="B"> </b>I do not want to labour this point and this
is my last question on this issue. Is it not appropriate and good
practice to publish the evidence upon which you base a policy which you
then claim has evidence behind it? Otherwise, it is mere assertion and
your assertion is as good as my assertion. Yours is probably better
than mine on
this.</div><a name="090129105000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> We have had the demand review, which was a
long and lengthy process. There was a collection of evidence, which has
now been collated. It was not a formal consultation. We never said that
the evidence we collected would be published. We are collating it now.
If we decide to publish it then we will do so in due course, but we
should not read too much into the fact that the evidence has not been
published. It does not mean that it contradicts the propositions that
the Government are bringing
forward.</div><a name="090129105000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
198</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000322"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> May I probe a little further what Mr.
Coaker said in respect of what was raised this morning by Julie
Kirkbride and myself? Would a definition of &#147;controlled for
gain&#148; be better if it was different according to the nature of
the crime that is involved? So child pornography controlling for gain
could be wider than pimping might be, and wider than the strict
liability offence of having sex with someone who is controlled
for gain. At the moment, as I understand it, that
definition is only that provided by the case law, most recently the
Court of Appeal in
Massey.</div><a name="090129105000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> There will be a debate as we go through
Committee about the definition of &#147;controlled for gain&#148;.
If we can get that right, which I think will be possible, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>then some of the concerns that some people have&#151;not everyone has
them&#151;will disappear to a certain extent. As I pointed out to Ms
Chakrabarti this morning, this is not a back-door way of trying to ban
prostitution; it is trying to get at exploitation. We all agree with
that. I do not suggest that anyone here is in favour of exploitation.
This is about trying to have public policy that addresses that. In
answer to Julie Kirkbride&#146;s question, Peter Lodder from the Bar
Council said that he would look at making a helpful suggestion here. We
can consider that. The problem with &#147;controlled for gain&#148;
is that, as I am told by other lawyers, the control aspect is the
ordinary, common-sense, dictionary understanding of the word. In the
case of R <i class="I">v. </i>Steven Massey in 2007, just to be lawyer-like Sir
Nicholas&#151;</div><a name="090129105000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000323"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> 4
December.</div><a name="090129105000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> Yes, 4 December. I am told that control
within the meaning of the Sexual Offences Act should be given its
ordinary dictionary meaning of directing a relevant activity that
included, but was not limited to, individuals who forced another to
carry out a relevant activity. That case law meets people&#146;s
concerns that control would mean something other than the ordinary
definition which we all understand. I am not a lawyer so, at the end of
the day, we will no doubt get Mr. Lodder&#146;s
suggestions and there will be other lawyers who say something
different. But the objective we all share is certainly along the lines
that we have been discussing and which Julie Kirkbride raised this
morning.</div>
<a name="090129105000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
199</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000324"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Were you concerned at all by what the support
workers association said? Many support workers are Government or
NHS-funded to publish their academic work on prostitutes. The
association, the Royal College of Nursing and the International Union
of Sex Workers talked about the possibility, arising from the series of
proposals in the Bill, that we will drive women further away from the
police and therefore integrate a risk. That is their view. I wondered
if that gave you any cause for
concern?</div><a name="090129105000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> There is no darker place to drive them if
they have been brought into&#151;trafficked&#151;this country for
sexual exploitation, so let us not in any way suggest that this is an
easy decision that does not require
action.</div><a name="090129105000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
200</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000325"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am sorry, I did not mean that group&#151;I
meant the group beyond that group. I absolutely share your view that
that position cannot be any
worse.</div><a name="090129105000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Yes, but we need to remain focused as far
as we can on the intent of what we are doing, which is to have
something in place to tackle the kind of exploitation&#151;whether
trafficked women, internally trafficked women or not&#151;that we all
agree is wrong. Our view is that our definition, &#147;controlled for
gain&#148;, does not apply outside the group we are trying to address
in the legislation. Therefore, many of the concerns raised by the
International Union of Sex Workers and others will prove to be
unfounded. It is not about whether someone can employ a maid, or employ
someone to give them greater protection and safety in what they
do. Our strong advice is that our proposal will not
affect that situation, unless there is clear and demonstrable evidence
of
control.</div><a name="090129105000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
201</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000326"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> What about a madam?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div><a name="090129105000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> We could get into every single different
example here. I know that we try to put them into different classes,
and it would rather depend on what she was. If she was keeping the
diary and providing cups of tea, it would be hard to suggest that she
was somehow controlling the prostitute. That is not what the case law
says that it ought to be about&#151;it ought to be about the
prostitutes being forced into it. It is the absence of free
will.</div><a name="090129105000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
202</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000327"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That is helpful, because that goes beyond the case
law, but we can come back to
it.</div><a name="090129105000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
as we heard in some of the oral and from the written evidence, the
law-enforcement approach is an incomplete one without funding and
mechanisms to provide outreach for exit work. It is one-handed, and it
might not work, according to that view, whereas many feel people
strongly&#151;although we recognise that some of them would benefit
from such funding&#151;that there would be enormous merit in
providing more of a funding stream for exit out of drugs and exit into
employment or different accommodation, such as shelters, refuges and so
forth.</div><a name="090129105000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> It is of course the Government&#146;s
policy to have a comprehensive approach, which is not just about the
enforcement of the law but about supporting women who want to get out
of prostitution. We have heard many different assessments of a
woman&#146;s motivation&#151;the reason why she might be involved
in prostitution&#151;from those who claim clearly that it is entirely
a matter of free will and has nothing to do with us, to those who say
that there are women out there who have no free will or choice in this
because they have been trafficked, while somewhere in the middle there
are women who feel that they have no alternative because of their
socio-economic, personal or family circumstances, and they choose to go
into prostitution on that basis. Our approach would not be defensible
unless we were prepared to say that there has to be that other
pillar.</div><a name="090129105000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the reasons for this, if we are reducing demand, is the expectation
that there would be fewer women involved in prostitution. So, what will
be in place for them? Briefly, three things, the first being that we
already fund a lot of work, not least through the POPPY
project&#151;some &#163;5.8 million&#151;but that is just part of
it. Also&#151;and this is perhaps where we might want to get to with
rehabilitation orders&#151;we have to access the other resources out
there. We heard&#151;I cannot remember from which witness&#151;a
list of housing, family income, education, all of those things. I
thought that we had things in place for every citizen on housing,
support for families, education and health care, so how can they better
access those services? However, I am not discounting the fact that
there may well be additional things that we would need to do for women
who had been involved in prostitution because they have a particular
set of circumstances and often very chaotic
lives.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000328"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We are already over time on this area of our
discussion, but there are three lady members of the Committee who wish
to put questions. Can I ask them to do so and
perhaps specify who they would like to reply? Would they also put the
questions together so that, if there is any overlap, they can all be
dealt with in one response by the relevant Minister? I am calling Lynda
Waltho first, then Julie Kirkbride and then Nadine
Dorries.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div><a name="090129105000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
203</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000329"></a>Lynda
Waltho:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. Strictly speaking, I
think it should be Alan Campbell who responds, although I think that
Vernon Coaker has been around the world to view different systems, so
it is up to them to decide. The lady who gave evidence for the English
Collective of Prostitutes suggested that we ought to look at complete
decriminalisation, which is the experience in New
Zealand.</div>
<a name="090129105000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
information from Debbie Baker, the manager of Streetreach, a support
service for street workers, in New Zealand. She says that</div>
<a name="090129105000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;although there
has been decriminalisation it hasn&#146;t really made a difference to
the average girl out on the street, except there is more competition
and the prices have gone down...We...have seen an increase in
underage children working in prostitution; there are girls under the
age of 18.&#148;</div>
<a name="090129105000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is obvious to me
that it has not worked in New Zealand, but what stopped you from going
for complete
decriminalisation?</div><a name="090129105000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
204</b><a name="090129105000330"></a><b class="B">Miss
Julie Kirkbride</b> (Bromsgrove) (Con): I would like to ask
two quick questions, if I may. The POPPY project wants the abolition of
prostitution. It thinks that prostitution should not be allowed,
period, and that you should not be allowed to sell your body for sex,
end of story. Why not just go for that? One of the other things that
the collective was saying was that, under the previous legislation, the
phrase &#147;controlling...for gain&#148; encouraged the
police to raid a variety of premises on the basis that there was a
madam there, because it fell within the definition of
&#147;controlling...for gain&#148; even if it did not fall
within the intent of the legislation. Given that that is its
experience, and that your catch-all provision would potentially
criminalise many people who are doing something which most of us think
is their right to do, if that is what they want, are you not worried
that previous experience of the legislation is that it is a big
catch-all under which the police have been carrying out raids which
were not necessarily the intention of the original
legislation?</div><a name="090129105000143"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
205</b><a name="090129105000331"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): I am not sure why
this part of the Bill is here at all. I do not believe that most men
who go to procure the services of a prostitute have a great
understanding of the law. They probably do not have a clue&#151;they
just decide to procure those services, and they go and do it because it
is so easily and readily available. I also think that society&#146;s
attitudes have changed towards that particular industry anyway. Given
that the evidence we have heard says that this Bill will categorically
make life considerably worse for some of the most vulnerable
people&#151;those prostitutes who are in the business as a result of
a need, whether drug use, poor circumstances, poor background, being
coerced into it, o whatever&#151;why are we doing
it?</div><a name="090129105000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> We have looked at a lot of different
examples. As Lynda Waltho said, Mr. Coaker knows more than I
about examples abroad. Even in this Committee, we have touched on the
very wide debate between those who say that we should decriminalise and
those who say we should criminalise prostitution.
Like Lynda Waltho, I have received a very mixed
picture from New Zealand, and I have heard that the law has had
unintended and horrific consequences. This part of the legislation is
quite specific. I repeat: we must remain focused on the intention,
which is to tackle the problems for trafficked women and, indeed,
others of sexual exploitation. We are not starting with the proposition

<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>that the Government say that prostitution should be illegal or legal. We
are focusing on a particular issue and in so doing we have to be
careful that we do not send out the wrong message about how we believe
society sees prostitution.</div>
<a name="090129105000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The raids on
brothels could not have taken place under these provisions because, of
course, the provisions are not yet law. I suspect that when we tease
out some of those examples, there are other reasons why those raids
took place and, indeed, why some of the closures took place. We want
this measure and existing legislation to be used proportionately. I do
not share the belief that the police set out to act other than in a
proportionate fashion, and I do not share the view that somehow the
police chose to do something that was outside the guidance that they
already had. They would certainly not choose to do something that is
outside the spirit of the
law.</div><a name="090129105000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> Nadine Dorries&#146;s point about men not
considering the law when they pay for sex is probably true because
nothing happens. That is the point I was trying to make at the
beginning. If we actually&#151;and this has been the whole focus of
the work that others and I have been doing over the past year or
so&#151;tackle the demand side of the issue, we have to look at how
you deal with that. As I said, you are quite right to say that the men
do not think about it, because nothing happens. Put a strict a
liability offence in
there.</div><a name="090129105000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
206</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000332"></a>Mrs.
Dorries:</b> Do you think they will
know?</div><a name="090129105000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> They will certainly know with a strict
liability offence, because they will know that they cannot excuse
themselves by saying, &#147;Hey, I&#146;d have phoned the police if
I&#146;d only known.&#148; We have put that element of doubt in
there so that people cannot act with impunity. I am not being rude
about people, but we have seen the pictures and we know what happens.
If people think they are going somewhere where there clearly is at
least a doubt about what is going on and they just carry on regardless,
a serious change to the law will make people stop and think twice. That
is an important public policy reform, which will mean that we can start
to try to tackle the exploitation that exists.</div>
<a name="090129105000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Julie
Kirkbride raised the question of why we did not go the whole hog and
make it completely illegal to pay for sex full stop. We thought that
that was impractical and was not based in the real world. When we went
to Sweden, it seemed&#151;again, there are doubts about this because
you get different evidence from people who are equally well
meaning&#151;that the issue had been driven away and gone
underground. Some people in Sweden disagree fundamentally with what I
have just said, but that is the conclusion that I
reached.</div><a name="090129105000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
207</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000333"></a>Miss
Kirkbride:</b> This is the real world in which the people to
whom we are rightly trying to reach are women who have been trafficked
and who are terrified of their pimp and everything else. Goodness
knows, but I suspect that the kind of people who go and visit those
women are not particularly cognisant of the law and possibly do not
even care about it. Who is going to shop them? The police should be
raiding these establishments anyway. How are we going to find such
people? Two days later, the DNA evidence of what they might have been
doing has gone. I do not understand how they are going to be
shopped.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div><a name="090129105000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see,
however, that the pensioner who goes along to see Mrs.
Bloggs occasionally and suddenly finds himself criminalised because
Mrs. Bloggs was running an establishment that was not
approved under the law will suddenly get a criminal offence and be
shamed in his community. On practical grounds, I worry whether the Bill
will really get the person who you are looking
for.</div><a name="090129105000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Let me make two points: first, there is an
information point about people being aware of the law. It is incumbent
on us, if there is a strict liability, to make people aware of that,
even though it is no defence for them to say that they did not know.
The pensioner who visits Mrs. Bloggs should be aware of
that, and we should make every effort to make them aware of it.
However, the issue of who Mrs. Bloggs has in her back
bedroom, where they have come from, and the reasons why they are being
forced to do what they are doing, is still there.</div>
<a name="090129105000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> Also, there is the fact that brothels up and
down the country in the cities that some of us represent are raided by
the police, but afterwards nothing happens. They go and rescue women,
some of whom are trafficked and some of whom, but not all, are forced
into prostitution in other ways. What responsibilities do the men have
who go there? That is the question that we are forcing on to the public
policy agenda to get people to confront. The answer up until now has
been a shrug of the shoulders. It has been, &#147;You can&#146;t do
anything about it.&#148; Prosecute them for rape if you are saying
there was no consent. Sometimes, that is totally unrealistic, as you
will know. Where a woman has been forced into that situation there is a
sort of consent because she does not say, &#147;No, you
can&#146;t,&#148; but she does not do so because she is terrified.
As lawyers have said to me: &#147;Prove it in court, then&#151;that
it&#146;s rape&#148; There was not really resistance, because
someone was terrified. There is an information issue, but it will
really change the dynamic in terms of how people react to, and think
about, that, and it will start to get at the
exploitation.</div><a name="090129105000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Lynda&#146;s point about decriminalisation, it is absolutely right
that the evidence is coming back from New Zealand, and, again,
different people say different things. However, the sort of evidence
that Lynda Waltho referred talks about increases in young people
involved in prostitution, increases in exploitation and increases in
the numbers involved. All those sorts of things are going on.</div>
<a name="090129105000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another argument, while we are discussing different models. I went to
Amsterdam: what are the Dutch Government doing? They are considering
reducing the numbers of controlled areas, because they are concerned
about the increase in the exploitation of young women, and about
serious and organised crime. There has been a fundamental reduction in
the number of the famous red light windows, because of the concern
about serious and organised crime and so on. That is in Holland, which
is always held up as an example&#151;&#147;Why don&#146;t we do
what Holland does?&#148;&#151;but it is having the same public
policy debate that we are having.</div>
<a name="090129105000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">You can tell
the seriousness of the situation, because in country after country
across the world, people are looking at what we should do about it. I
will finish with this, because it is such a fundamental point. You have
to change the dynamic of how the man thinks when he purchases the sex.
You can have a cosmetic offence,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>which will make no difference, or you can say,
&#147;I&#146;m going to make a real difference and try to change
that dynamic.&#148; That is the choice that people have
got.</div>
<a name="090129105000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000334"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. We must now move on to another part
of the Bill. The time allocated is going to have to be dramatically
reduced if we are going to get through all the subjects, as there are
three more. We begin with
alcohol.</div><a name="090129105000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
208</b><a name="090129105000335"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I
will be as brief and succinct as possible.</div>
<a name="090129105000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
two lines of questioning that I would like to pursue. The first relates
to the code of practice, and the two parts of the mandatory code. Will
Mr. Campbell, as the Minister responsible, tell us which
parts of the mandatory code that have already been published by the
Department of Health are likely to be included in the final
version?</div><a name="090129105000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> There are discussions taking place between
the relevant Departments. I understand that they have come to broad
agreements on which parts will be included and which not. We will bring
those forward, and will also deal with the question of whether or not
they will be part of the mandatory or the voluntary
code.</div>
<a name="090129105000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
209</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000336"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Will you give some clarification, because at
this stage none of us has seen the code provisions or their final form?
Are they likely to be materially different from the code that was
released? Whether it was for consultation or otherwise is a matter for
wider
debate.</div><a name="090129105000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> I have not seen the final form yet, because
it is under discussion. We are starting, probably as we speak, with
some preliminary discussions across the industry to make sure that
before we go to formal consultation we have the broad headings that
people can sign up to. I am not sure whether you are alluding to a
particular aspect, and asking me whether it is in or
out.</div><a name="090129105000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
210</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000337"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I suppose the point that I am trying to make
is that at this stage we can only, as a Committee, look at what has
been released to date. The Department of Health released the document.
You can argue as to whether that has been helpful or unhelpful in this
context, because all we can say is, &#147;Well, we can look at
that.&#148; Are there any specific issues that you would like to
mention to the Committee at the outset to help us consider the
provisions in the Bill, or are there any conditions that you believe
should be included in the code, albeit that they might need to be
drafted, finalised or
finessed?</div><a name="090129105000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> I can give some general guidance. We would
want to see some of the things that were discussed during the earlier
evidence sessions, including for example, provisions on vertical
drinking establishments; on &#147;buy as much as you want for however
much&#148; promotions; and on things that encourage people to drink
faster than a social activity would suggest&#151;in other words
things that go out of their way to encourage drunkenness and the
behaviour that goes with it. Those are the broad headings that we are
looking at.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div><a name="090129105000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
211</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000338"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Would they include, for example, introducing
Think 21 or Challenge 25 policies as a mandatory requirement under
these
provisions?</div><a name="090129105000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Think 21 and Challenge 25 are very good
examples of how we are working in partnership with the industry, which
is bringing forward these ideas. Challenge 21 or Think 21 would perhaps
be more applicable in these circumstances. My understanding is,
however, that it would be difficult to put them in a quasi-legal
situation, as it is not something you could hold people to account for.
You can hold them to account for being under-age or for selling to
people under 18. It is much more difficult to frame provisions dealing
with issues such as whether someone looks as if they are under 18, or
between 18 and 21. As you know, Challenge 25 came out because of the
difficulty of distinguishing 19, 20 and 21-year-olds from people who
are under 18.</div>
<a name="090129105000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
212</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000339"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Time is short and we can explore these issues
further in Committee, but some views have been expressed that some
licensing conditions are seeking to promote Think 21 or Challenge 25,
and people are concerned that you are creating two age-test
requirements. Do you recognise that as a
problem?</div><a name="090129105000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> It has been put to me by the industry that
Challenge 25 is a kind of gold standard. It is easier to do for some of
the big retailers than it is for some of the smaller and independent
retailers. We are encouraging people to adopt that. My advice is that
it would be extremely difficult to try to encompass that in some kind
of legal framework; in fact it would not be
possible.</div><a name="090129105000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
213</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000340"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> That is helpful. You mentioned small
businesses and I come back to the statement in the regulatory impact
assessment that</div>
<a name="090129105000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there is the
potential for significant transitional costs, including job losses and
the closure of small
businesses.&#148;</div><a name="090129105000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
heard evidence during the week that that might be quite significant,
particularly for smaller businesses. What discussions have you
undertaken with Ministers or officials in the Department for Business,
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform about the extent and nature of that,
and any
mitigation?</div><a name="090129105000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Not only have we had communication with
Ministers from those Departments but I have met and discussed the
matter with industry representatives as well. We are very conscious of
our obligations, particularly from an enforcement point of view for the
Home Office, and from a health point of view for the Department of
Health, with DBERR and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
bringing their own view to bear. It is part of the wider discussions.
The Government are very aware of the issues, some of which were raised
in an earlier session, particularly in the economic circumstances, but
not exclusively for those reasons. We certainly would not want to
impose a burden either on on-sales or off-sales. However, there has to
be, as I think there is, a growing recognition of a problem that is not
going away. Along with the right to be consulted and our
influence&#151;the burden that might be applied&#151;there is a
responsibility for everyone involved to make sure they are doing
everything they
can.</div>
<a name="090129105000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
214</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000341"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Let us come on to offences, namely the
creation of new offences and the strengthening of certain offences. In
principle, I have no objection to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>giving the police powers that they need. Which
things were not working as well as you had expected in order to require
these sorts of changes to take
place?</div><a name="090129105000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> I was struck by the evidence from the chief
constable in a previous session. He gave the impression, quite rightly,
that it is a case of building on what has gone before and making sure
that it works. You will be as aware as I am that when we draft and pass
legislation it does not always have the full effect that we intended.
Some of it is about balancing offences and penalties with what already
exists in other areas, for example what should happen if a person does
not leave and follow the direction of a police officer, and, therefore,
what is appropriate both as a deterrent but also as a
penalty.</div>
<a name="090129105000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
real difficulties relates to age difference and the fact that when
people buy alcohol under age, or have it bought for them, they are
often in mixed-age gangs&#151;it is possible for older people to buy
the drink and share it among the gang. If police are called to an
incident, it is not always possible to treat all of the people in that
gang, or group of people, similarly. For example, it might not be
possible to confiscate the alcohol from everybody or send them all
home, or whatever the punishment happens to be. It is a case of trying
to acknowledge the practical difficulties that the police are telling
us about&#151;which have been reiterated by the chief
constable&#151;that I think lies behind these
measures.</div>

215</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000342"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> One final question as we are pressed for
time. You will be aware of the advice given this morning by the
Government&#146;s chief medical officer who said that, in essence,
children under the age of 16 should not consume any alcohol. I refer to
the clause headed &#147;Offence of persistently possessing alcohol in
public place&#148;, under which alcohol possession &#147;without
reasonable excuse&#148; is in essence being prohibited. Are you
therefore saying that any consumption of alcohol in a public place by a
child under 16 is captured by the clause?</div>
<a name="090129105000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> No, what we are saying is that we need some
kind of measurement as to when the proposal should be brought in. It is
persistence that we are identifying here&#151;it is not acknowledging
that the first time nothing should be done. It is this idea of
persistence. I did not agree with a witness today who seemed to give
the impression that these things happen anyway and we should not be too
worried about a someone under age, with alcohol, for a third
offence.</div>
<a name="090129105000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
216</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000343"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Obviously, the persistence requires you to be
able to prove reasonable excuse in the first place. All I am suggesting
is that the language at the moment is so broad that it could almost
capture a child with their parent consuming
alcohol.</div><a name="090129105000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Unless you are telling me that somehow we
are going to move on from the advice of the chief medical officer today
and incorporate that in what we are saying, all I would say here is
that advisers advise and Government decide. The example that I prefer
is of a child helping a parent who has bought some wine or beer in a
supermarket to carry it to the car, although the child was not old
enough to have bought it. They will not be held accountable by a police
officer in a car park saying, &#147;This is the third time I have
seen you doing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>that.&#148; This is precisely not where we want to
be, but I do not think this is what we are discussing and it is not the
area that this offence is meant to address.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
217</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000344"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> As for the mandatory alcohol licensing
controls&#151;are you planning that these measures will, first, deal
with happy hours and all sorts of offers on licensed premises, and
secondly, with the price of loss-leading alcohol in supermarkets, as
well as cheap strong lagers and white ciders and so on, in
off-sales?</div><a name="090129105000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> It is a very contentious area, and all I
can say is that we do not have any plans to bring forward minimum
pricing at this stage, although whether that will be appropriate is
still being discussed. That is partly because of the evidence we have
commissioned, which suggests that it does not have the effect on
people&#146;s behaviour that one might think. It is not the kind of
lever which it is assumed to be. Of course, what we have to do is make
sure that this is proportionate and balanced. What we do not
want&#151;what I certainly do not want to do&#151;is to penalise a
hard-working person who goes to the supermarket to buy one or two
bottles of wine, which may be on offer, to enjoy socially with their
family over the weekend. That is precisely where we do not want to
be.</div>

for Alan Campbell. You mentioned a few times that you had discussions

Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, the British
Medical Association and the Police Federation, among others, also have
real concerns about this issue. Have you had discussions with them
about what might be in the mandatory
code?</div><a name="090129105000189"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> The point is that we have had extensive
discussions, but I assure you that we will continue to have such
discussions, because we are in the process of drawing up the kind of
areas we want to see in those codes. We will continue to have the
widest possible consultation, but the evidence suggests that the public
are absolutely convinced that we need a mandatory code. They may have a
different view of what they want in it, but there was overwhelming
evidence from the work we did to suggest that they want a mandatory
code.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
220</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000349"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> This is an issue about consultation. The
pre-consultation consultation, as it were&#151;the consultation about
what you are going to put forward&#151;is absolutely critical. A
large number of groups support minimum pricing, on which I had a
private Member&#146;s Bill, and action on in-store promotions, as
well as restrictions on clubs and on labelling. If the views on what
should be consulted on are taken predominantly from the
industry&#151;you have mentioned one and only one voluntary
group&#151;how will you ensure that the proposals that are consulted
on, which ultimately will shape the mandatory code, will actually
reflect the public anxiety over this?</div>
<a name="090129105000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> My point about consulting the industry was
in direct response to a question about the burden that might be imposed
on the industry, so to say that we were listening to them seemed to be
the obvious reassurance that I could give. We have consulted and
continue to consult with people, and there will be further consultation
on these matters. But we are, within Government, looking at the kind of
areas that we can get sign-up to between Departments, in the context
not only of discussions taking place within and between Departments,
but also of discussions that Departments have with others all the time.
We hope that it is a dynamic
process.</div><a name="090129105000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
221</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000350"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I come now to the impact of pricing on drinking
levels. I thought that it was the Department of Health that
commissioned the Sheffield review, which showed that price and
availability did have an impact on consumption. I just wonder why that
then has to be revisited. Were there some shortcomings within the
research, which I thought was very thorough in terms of the impact of
price and availability on consumption and responsible
consumption?</div><a name="090129105000193"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Yes, my recollection of this is that there
would have to be a very dramatic increase in price to affect
consumption in the way that we were talking about and, therefore, the
evidence supports the view that it is a fairly blunt lever. It is not
the only way forward by any means, and may not be the best way forward
to get the result we want. However, I am under no illusion at all that,
were we to bring forward a code that does not have minimum pricing in
it, there will not be those who will say, &#147;That is a terrible
thing. You ought to have done this.&#148; It does not matter how much
consultation we have
done.</div><a name="090129105000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
222</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000351"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> There are a couple of further
points.</div><a name="090129105000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000352"></a>The
Chairman:</b> There is not much time
left.</div><a name="090129105000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000353"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I will be quick. First, will you accept an
invitation to launch an online consultation? You need not answer now; I
am just putting down a marker. Secondly, do you
accept that a number of the other recommendations in the legislation
are about dealing with problem drinking by young people in public
places, some of which is driven by the cheapest and most disgusting
drinks going, like the white cider stuff, and that minimum pricing
would do something about managing those incredibly problematic
products? It might not deal with quite a lot of drinking, but the point
is to tackle the worst offenders and deal with the public disorder
consequences.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div><a name="090129105000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> I understand that, but there are other
things that need to be taken into consideration too. For example, the
problem is not just about price; it is about volume. It is about offers
that create the circumstances in which people might purchase and
consume more than they otherwise would. There is also the much wider
issue of access for under-age drinkers in the first place. Whatever the
price, what can we do to prevent sales to under-age people&#151;full
stop?</div>
<a name="090129105000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
223</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000354"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Okay; and the
invitation?</div><a name="090129105000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> I shall certainly consider it
carefully.</div><a name="090129105000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000355"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Three people have indicated that they want to
ask questions on this subject; I shall take all three together and if
they are for Mr. Campbell he can, I hope, deal with them
quite quickly. The members are Simon Burns, Lynda Waltho, who indicated
earlier that she wanted to come in on this subject, and Ian
Cawsey.</div>
<a name="090129105000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
224</b><a name="090129105000356"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford) (Con): Does Mr.
Campbell agree that using the pricing mechanism is not the simple
panacea that some people think, because of course successive
Chancellors under a series of Governments have used that policy on
cigarette pricing, and there has been not a dramatic reduction in the
number of people smoking but a significant increase in a smuggling
problem that did not exist
before?</div><a name="090129105000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
225</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000357"></a>Mr.
Cawsey:</b> I have two very quick questions. First, I would be
interested to know what the view of the Association of Chief Police
Officers has been on the proposals. Secondly&#151;I do not know
whether the Minister wants to come back to me on this
later&#151;schedule 4 introduces general licence conditions relating
to alcohol, and it is very specific about the use of the word
&#147;alcohol&#148;. However, in the schedule a number of general
conditions are introduced for licensing authorities to bring into
effect. The Minister said earlier that sometimes laws bring unintended
effects. I have had contact with a few colleagues in the music business
and live entertainment, and they want to be assured that the provisions
in a part of the Bill that is supposed to relate to alcohol do not
inadvertently make it possible to clamp down on live entertainment and
music in our local
neighbourhoods.</div><a name="090129105000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
226</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000358"></a>Lynda
Waltho:</b> Most of the matters that I am concerned about have
been covered, except for one, which is the need for a central register
of licensees, which I brought up in my speech originally. It is
entirely possible and highly likely that licensees who lose their
licence in one authority will just pop up in another, and that there
will be no co-ordination.</div>
<a name="090129105000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Campbell:</b></i> Briefly, in answer to Mr.
Burns&#146;s point, I was saying that that was the general conclusion
that the university of Sheffield had come to, which is why we keep the
matter under consideration, but we have not made a
decision on that. Of course pricing is part of the success that we have
had on smoking, but it is only part of it. I accept that. I am not sure
you can draw a direct comparison between the pricing of cigarettes and
the pricing of alcohol, but I am sure that there are some related
areas.</div>
<a name="090129105000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">ACPO&#146;s
view was set out clearly by Mr. Craik in the earlier
sitting, when he said that it supports the broad approach that includes
both mandatory and voluntary elements. I am sure we will continue to
have discussions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>with them on the detail. I have never heard the point&#151;although I
am sure I will as the Bill progresses&#151;about the possible impact
on music. All I know from previous legislation is that those concerned
are extraordinarily good at campaigning on this issue, so I am sure we
will hear from them.</div>
<a name="090129105000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
interested in the central register of licensees, with the proviso that
we do not over-regulate and overburden the
industry.</div><a name="090129105000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000359"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I congratulate the Minister on his succinctness
in replying. We are very grateful. I think that I shall take the next
two areas together, as I know that Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition
spokesman wishes to deal with proceeds of crime and extradition
together. I shall then call Paul, and any other member of the Committee
who wants to ask a question, but we must finish at 3 o&#146;clock.
People now know exactly what time we have
left.</div>
<a name="090129105000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
227</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000360"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Some of the controversial elements of the
proceeds of crime provisions relate to changes in judicial oversight
or, for example, with respect to the forfeiture without court order
elements, the complete removal of judicial oversight. What has driven
that approach?</div>
<a name="090129105000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> The whole approach has been driven by a
desire to balance judicial oversight, practical policing and the policy
objective of ensuring that we prevent individuals dissipating
assets&#151;trying to get rid of their criminal gain. I know that
Mr. Brokenshire will agree. Essentially, it is about
responding to what the police have said, whereby people in a number of
cases get around the law because they get rid of the assets before a
restraining order can be
applied.</div>
<a name="090129105000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
228</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000361"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> But I am sure you will appreciate that in
many circumstances, obtaining a warrant or an order requires judicial
involvement. Therefore, why was the decision taken in this case not to
proceed down that route? In doing so, are you not setting yourself up
for potential problems under the Human Rights Act 1998?</div>
<a name="090129105000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> I do not think so. The public policy
objective is that we believe we can get more criminally gained assets
off somebody if we make the retention of those assets possible. To
obtain the order, most of the time you will seek prior judicial
approval; you will have to get approval beyond 48 hours; conditions are
attached and in the Bill; and alongside it, there is a code of
practice. All those things exist. When we talked about human rights and
the new powers in the Bill, interestingly, the Bar Council said that,
generally, it did not think that the provisions were contrary
to article 1 of the 1998 Act.</div>
<a name="090129105000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
229</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000362"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> But it said that there was some
complexity.</div>
<a name="090129105000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> It did not think that the provisions were
contrary to article 1&#151;except when there was undue delay. In
other words, you could say that article 1 would be interfered with if,
as a consequence of the new provisions, it took too long to get the
case to court, where the person could prove their innocence, or
otherwise. I looked that up, because I thought it a reasonable point 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>to make. I looked, too, at the provisions in the Bill, and pages 33 and
34 outline a person&#146;s ability to go back to court to argue for
the discharge, variation or lapse of a detention order, so, if they
think that there is undue delay, they can go back and argue their case.
That helps with respect to human rights legislation, and the Bill also
states:</div>
<a name="090129105000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
an application is made...in relation to an order the following
persons may appeal to the Crown
Court&#148;</div><a name="090129105000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">for
its discharge. So, there are protections in respect of the new order
and a person&#146;s ability to ensure that their human rights are not
adversely impacted on to the extent that we would breach our
obligations.</div>

that, as the evidence suggested this morning, but we will come to that
later in Committee.</div>
<a name="090129105000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
extradition, do you agree with the potential problem or challenge that
was identified by the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and the police
in evidence on the increasing number of European arrest warrants and
what that might mean?</div>

may arise?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
231</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000364"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Yes. They suggested that numbers were
escalating almost exponentially.</div>
<a name="090129105000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> I do not know about exponentially, but there
would be an increase once we became part of the Schengen information
system. Part of that membership, however, is to ensure that we have
better access to the system&#146;s alerts and information. As you
know, currently, all the warrants that SOCA certifies are the
responsibility of the Metropolitan police, and Commander Gibson said
that that creates issues for him. From April, however, it will be the
responsibility not only of the Met, but of the regions. There will be
issues about that, too, but do I agree that there are issues about how
we practically manage, first, the situation from April? Yes, I do. Do I
believe that when we join SIS II and receive an increase in the number
of European arrest warrants, there will be practical implications in
respect of managing and dealing with that? Yes, there will be, and we
will have to deal with it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
232</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000365"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> On Liberty&#146;s key point about returning
people to the jurisdiction from which they have been extradited to, in
essence, serve their sentence, is the intention for it to apply to UK
nationals or simply to overseas
nationals?</div><a name="090129105000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> No, it could apply to UK
nationals. Again, it is clearly laid out in the Bill. The judicial
process obviously has to be consistent with human rights obligations.
It says on page 70 that, should the Secretary of State be involved
through the other route of people being returned, she can only act in a
way compatible with convention rights. As you know, if the Home
Secretary does not do that, it is open to judicial
review. I think that there are safeguards. I would
like to put an important point on the record that Shami Chakrabarti
made, which is that she does not see this as a titanic battle or as a
really fundamental clash of principles. It is actually trying to ensure
that the changes being made are consistent with our human rights
obligations, and, of course, we want to do
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div><a name="090129105000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000366"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Sir Nicholas, we can obviously return to this
in Committee.</div>
<a name="090129105000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
233</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000367"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> To follow on from that question, I think that
Liberty&#146;s point is that simply saying that everyone must act
within the convention is not the same as specific safeguards being
written into the legislation&#151;I suspect that the Joint Committee
on Human Rights will say something similar. You described it as a
backstop that applies to anything that could possibly be imagined: you
cannot say, &#147;Well, no one&#146;s going to break the Human
Rights Act because there will be a judicial review&#148;. I think
that Liberty is saying that you should write safeguards in, such as a
need for the Secretary of State to have a reasonableness test or some
evidence that removing someone to serve their sentence elsewhere might
lead to problems.</div>
<a name="090129105000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> May I respectfully suggest that, if
Dr. Harris was right in that assertion, why would Liberty
say that this is not a titanic battle? Why would it say that there are
not huge issues of principle at stake? I hope that I am not
misrepresenting what was said this morning, but I am sure that I am
right in saying that Shami Chakrabarti said that this is not a titanic
battle of principle.</div>
<a name="090129105000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
234</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000368"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I think that she thinks it is an obvious point.
You should not have a subjective requirement
that</div><a name="090129105000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Secretary of State is not satisfied that the return is
compatible&#148;</div><a name="090129105000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">with
the European convention on human rights. You should replace it with an
objective requirement.</div>
<a name="090129105000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> I understand the point that Dr. Harris is
trying to make. However, it is actually written into the Bill on page
17, proposed new section 153D, where is says that everything that the
Secretary of State does must be compatible with convention rights.
Rather than simply being assumed, it is laid out. That was the point.
We laid it out and tried to take account of that very sort of
objection. I will say again&#151;nobody is above the law, so if the
Secretary of State did not act in that way, there could be a judicial
review.</div>
<a name="090129105000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
235</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000369"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The specific provision that Liberty is suggesting
is that instead of the wording that you have pointed
to&#151;</div><a name="090129105000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
a case in which the Secretary of State is not satisfied that the return
is compatible&#148;&#151;</div>
<a name="090129105000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">the Bill should say,
&#147;if the return is not compatible&#148;, so that the discretion
and the subjective view of the Secretary of State is taken out, which
enables the case to be made more easily. I think that that is
Liberty&#146;s point, and I think that it is right to say that that
is not a titanic difference, but it is a substantive one.</div>
<a name="090129105000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> I do not know whether it is titanic or
substantive. My point was that we can argue and debate this, but if
there was a fundamental problem in terms of an attack on the individual
liberties and human rights of people of this country, we would have
heard it this morning and we did not.</div>
<a name="090129105000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
236</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000370"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> This morning the Bar Council and Liberty expressed
concern about extending the principle that you can seize goods,
property, cash, family heirlooms and so on, from people who may in the
long run be found to be not guilty, but who are deprived of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>that property. They were worried about abandoning the principle of
having to have some proof that the property constitutes ill-gotten
gains.</div><a name="090129105000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> They did mention those concerns; we all have
them. We do not want people who are completely innocent to have their
property detained. I do not have the transcript in front of me, but
interestingly the Bar Council did not say that it was opposed to the
provision. As you know, Mr. Holmes, you have a restraint
order and the items that you are concerned about stay in the possession
of the person you have concerns about. That is a big loophole,
particularly with low-value goods. It means that law enforcement
officers come to us and say that that gives people the opportunity to
squirrel the items away, to dissipate them. In the end, you do not have
the amount of criminally-gotten gain that you should be able to attack
when it comes to a confiscation order on conviction. So what we try to
do in the Bill is simply close that loophole in a proportionate way,
consistent with the principles that we have just talked about. The Bar
Council said that it understands what we are doing, but is concerned
about some of the
safeguards.</div><a name="090129105000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
237</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000371"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I forget the exact wording, but the Bar Council
specifically said that there is a shift away from being able to put up
cash instead of the possession. It said that that is a significant
shift, not just a tidying-up
amendment.</div><a name="090129105000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> It is a serious
tidying-up.</div><a name="090129105000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
238</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000372"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Or a substantive one even.</div>
<a name="090129105000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
I know the answer to my other question, given what the police said on
Tuesday about how relatively new a lot of this work is. You legislated
on the asset recovery regime in 2005 and again in 2007, and now, a year
and a couple of months later, you are legislating on it again. Why have
there been so many changes in such a short
time?</div><a name="090129105000237"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> In 2007-08, &#163;136 million was
recovered, and a further &#163;33 million or &#163;34 million was
recovered in the first few months of 2008-09. That is
progress&#151;the restraining, the courts and so on&#151;but is it
enough? No, it is not. Do we want to do more? Yes, we do. This is a
developing area of policy. We have moved considerably on the proceeds
of crime, taking ill-gotten gains off people, but I do not
think&#151;I will be blunt&#151;that we would have been able to get
through Parliament legislation such as we are now proposing, had that
been what we started with. But by acting bit by bit, step by step, we
have enabled the public to see working the changes to legislation that
enable us to take from people the ill-gotten gains that we do not want
them to benefit
from.</div><a name="090129105000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
low-value goods, the public themselves on my estates and yours, too, I
am sure, turn around and say, &#147;Why is it that somebody has been
arrested but is still driving around in their vehicle, still flaunting
their wealth, still being a terrible role model for young people? We
don&#146;t want that to happen. Why isn&#146;t the state doing
something about it?&#148; That is what we are trying to do in this
clause. There is a proper debate to be had about safeguards&#151;how
the measure should work and what should be done&#151;but the public
policy objective surely has to be that if somebody is trying to make
money from crime, we ought to do everything we can to stop 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>them and to stop them benefiting from it. That is what I would expect as
a citizen, that is what my constituents expect, and I am sure that it
is what all Members&#146; constituents
expect.</div><a name="090129105000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
239</b><b class="B"><a name="090129105000373"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Finally, based on the proportion of cases that
have failed, what sort of compensation bill do you
expect?</div><a name="090129105000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Coaker:</b></i> Shall I be honest? The answer is that I do
not know. Compensation arrangements are available in the Bill because a
consistent, proper, proportionate way is to ensure that the law works
effectively but, if the law does get it wrong, people should be
compensated.</div><a name="090129105000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129105000374"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It is appropriate that the Minister should have
the last word. It is now 3 o&#146;clock, so that brings us to the end
of this sitting. I thank Alan Campbell, Under-Secretary of State at the
Home Office; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>Jim Fitzpatrick, Under-Secretary of State for Transport; and Minister of
State Vernon Coaker for the helpful evidence they have given and the
way they have dealt with all the questions.</div>

Committee will in a moment be adjourned by me until next Tuesday at
10.30am when we will begin the clause-by-clause consideration of the

the Whip to move the motion, and I will give him the words so that he
