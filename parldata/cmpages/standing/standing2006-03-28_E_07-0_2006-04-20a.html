Mulholland</b> (Leeds, North-West) (LD): Welcome back to the

Chair after the Easter break,Mr.

Cook.</div><a name="06042045000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to

reiterate a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah

Teather) made absolutely clear when she spoke to our amendment, which

is that it is very much a probing amendment. We simply do not feel that

we have got any further forward in trying to establish suitable

criteria for the kind of organisations that will set up charitable

trusts in order to establish schools under the

Bill.</div><a name="06042045000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recently, we and

Conservative Front Benchers have moved probing amendments, and we were

all pleased that the Under-Secretary responded to them in the tone in

which they were presented. He provided the Committee with a lot of

useful information that led us to feel quite happy to withdraw them.

<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I remember that at Leeds city council we were

fined &#163;5 every time a mobile phone went off. Perhaps that is

something that you would like to consider for the Committee, Mr. Cook,

but of course it is a matter entirely for

you.</div><a name="06042045000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I really do not

understand why the Minister for Schools and the Government are being so

cagey about the issue. Surely it is perfectly reasonable for the

Government to provide an idea of the kind of organisations deemed

suitable to set up the charitable trusts to establish new schools.

Surely it is vital that we have that information, not only in this

Committee but in the public domain, so that there are no issues of

confidence, such as there are among the teaching professions&#151;as

I am sure the Minister for Schools is well aware&#151;and among

sections of the public about the kind of organisations that have been

linked to setting up charitable

trusts.</div><a name="06042045000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to ask

the Minister a question. Again, we are probing; all we want is to get

some idea about the matter. Are there no types of organisation that she

would deem unsuitable to set up a charitable trust to form a new

school? We have had mention of fast-food and tobacco companies, and

also a certain religious sect. The issue is so important because of the

influence that those companies have. That is not to say that private

companies should not be involved in setting up schools and should not

provide some funding; that is a different debate, and not one that we

are having now. However, given that the Bill means that they will have

influence, surely it is appropriate to specify firm criteria for the

kind of organisations that should be

involved.</div><a name="06042045000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is

also a question about the charitable trusts themselves. There is a lack

of confidence that the position of trustees is sufficiently watertight

in respect of the people having involvement in schools. It is possible

for someone to be a trustee of a charity when they have spent

convictions or are a former bankrupt. Can we have some reassurance

about that issue? We need to create a framework to ensure that people

who set up charitable trusts to run schools are the kind of people that

we would all want to run schools.</div>

<a name="06042045000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister will be well aware

of the case brought to our attention by the <i class="I">Daily Mirror</i> in

which a convicted paedophile set up a charitable trust, so there are

issues relating to the Charity Commission. Will she examine the matter

and reassure us that the kind of people who set up charitable trusts to

run schools are 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>those whom we would want to be involved in our schools? Will she give us

some information on that point? Will she give us an idea about what she

deems to be suitability, above and beyond what is necessary to become a

trustee of a charitable trust? That provision is not sufficient to give

people confidence that the organisations that will be bidding to set up

new schools involve the kind of people that we want to run our

schools.</div><a name="06042045000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042045000239"></a><b class="B">Annette

Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I was too late

to intervene on my hon. Friend, so I shall make some brief comments on

one or two of the amendments in this group&#151;and I shall speak up,

Mr. Cook.</div><a name="06042045000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 24 is an incredibly blunt instrument. It would mean that even more

power would be taken away from local authorities. It is blunt because

we know that the value-added measure is far from perfect. Its rigidity

means that, as with many targets that we have experienced, which all of

us criticise, there would be ways of working around it. That might be

to its detriment.</div>

<a name="06042045000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 179 proposes that

a notice be triggered if 50 parents petition. We have rehearsed well

the arguments about 50 being too small a number. What sort of cost

would the measure impose on the local authority? Where 50 parents

signed a petition the local authority would have a great deal of work

to do. The idea of putting such extra burdens on local authorities and

diverting them from what their real jobs should be is

worrying.</div><a name="06042045000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042045000240"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): Would

the hon. Lady regard it as an inconvenience to an elected local

authority if 50 of its constituents or ward members were to write to it

about another issue, for example road sweeping? Would she regard having

to respond to those constituents&#146; concerns as a darned

inconvenience to the local authority?</div>

<a name="06042045000027"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000241"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> The hon. Gentleman misunderstands my point. I am

suggesting that we are not talking necessarily about a call for a

locally delivered service to which one would expect an instantaneous

response. The proposal would mean a great deal of expense for a local

authority. It is not the same as ensuring that the refuse lorry goes

down someone&#146;s street next week. The proposal represents a lot

of work for the principals involved. As my hon. Friend the Member for

Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) said, we think that it is an

interesting concept for the local authority to have to review some of

its processes or perhaps to convene a committee. However, to start

triggering the whole process of setting up a new school is an

administrative burden that is a few steps too far.</div>

<a name="06042045000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to be brief. I

was moving on from that point and I think that I am delaying the

Committee. On the Liberal Democrats&#146; probing amendment, I should

like to convey our real concerns, as we move further through the Bill,

about the governance of schools being taken away from the local

community. I believe in local decision making. We do not even know 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>how far the governance will be taken and in what direction, but it is

pertinent, in respect of this clause, to know who will be able to set

up a trust foundation and take on the valuable assets of the local

authority and the community. As far as we can see, looking at the

potential for trustees, there could be mismanagement of those valuable

community assets, yet later in the Bill we will see the power to

control those taken away from the local community. I want to underline

why we have the greatest concerns about the proposals for trust

schools.</div><a name="06042045000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042045000242"></a><b class="B">Mr.

James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): May I warmly&#151;and

loudly&#151;welcome you to the Chair this morning, Mr. Cook? I shall

speak in support of the amendment ably moved by my hon. Friend the

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) on Tuesday

afternoon. The Conservative amendments are good in their own way, and I

hope that my hon. Friend will seriously consider pressing them and at

least give the Minister the opportunity to reply, because they were

tabled in the spirit in which we have given qualified support to the

Bill. Even if my hon. Friend chooses not to press the amendment to a

vote, it will enable a good debate to take place. I look forward to

hearing the Minister&#146;s

response.</div><a name="06042045000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not

follow the same path as the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West. It is

fair to ask questions, as he did this morning, about the character and

nature of the people who will run the trusts schools to be established

under the clause. Those are reasonable questions, but I am not sure

about the background to the Liberal Democrats&#146; approach to this

issue. The hon. Gentleman asked whether there was anybody the

Government would exclude from running the new schools to be established

under the clause&#151;and as a result of the amendments moved by my

hon. Friend. The real question for the Liberal Democrats, which they

have not yet answered, is whether there is anybody they would allow to

run such a

school.</div><a name="06042045000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042045000243"></a><b class="B">Sarah

Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): The question is not about who

we would or would not exclude, but about the model within which they

would be included. We would not include people in a model where a trust

could take over the whole governing body, or had freedom over

admissions. We will be dealing with such issues later in the Bill and I

am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be able to learn something

then.</div><a name="06042045000032"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000244"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> That does not answer the point about whether,

even if there was the model that the hon. Lady sought, there would be

anybody of any character whom the Liberal Democrats would be prepared

to accept. However, we will no doubt deal with that later in the Bill

and see whether they have anything constructive to offer on this

subject.</div><a name="06042045000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Conservative amendments are good, and they are in the spirit of our

support for the Bill: they seek to put power into the hands of parents,

especially when schools are underperforming. It is always possible to

quibble with Opposition amendments and ask what is the magic in a

particular figure. The hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) asked

what was the magic in the figure of 35 per cent. of places in

underperforming schools, which is in amendment 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>No. 24, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis

and Littlehampton. No doubt, the hon. Gentleman will produce some

academic research about that in due course. He asked what research my

hon. Friend had seen&#151;my hon. Friend may care to reply. However,

I bet my bottom dollar, without any research whatsoever, that there is

no magic for the children, or the parents of those children, with

places in those schools. If we are to be conscientious about the Bill

and to give children, especially those in underperforming schools, a

chance, we must consider seriously amendments such as

this.</div>

<a name="06042045000206"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

am</div><a name="06042045000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">If children,

and their parents, are stuck, with no way out of an underperforming

school, their prospects will be blighted for life. It may occur to the

hon. Gentleman that many such children come from low-income families in

the less well advantaged parts of the country; their parents may not

have the incomes or opportunities to enable them to escape. My hon.

Friend has done a service in highlighting this subject and I make no

bones about the fact that it is good for those of us on the

Conservative Benches to consider the prospects of children stuck in

underperforming schools. I have no qualms about putting power into

parents&#146;

hands.</div><a name="06042045000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

for Bury, North says, &#147;Ah yes, but what about local authorities?

Should we not leave such decisions to the local community?&#148; Let

us speak frankly about things as they are, rather than in terms of

strict sociological theory. As the hon. Gentleman should know from his

experience in the north of England, many parts of that and other areas

have strong traditions of local governance that have been associated

with control by one party of local authorities in which there have been

large numbers of underperforming schools.</div>

<a name="06042045000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents in such areas have been

left with no way out. The Under-Secretary chortles. I shall not go into

the issue on a party political basis, but if he wants I shall name and

shame local authorities, long in the hands of one party, with numbers

of underperforming schools that have continued to underperform. In some

cases, parents with the opportunity have taken flight, but many

children have been stuck in those schools. That is the reality. Some

parts of the country are stuck under a certain political control; that

goes for all parties.</div>

<a name="06042045000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment offers a way out

for children and parents. It is entirely right for my hon. Friend the

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to table amendments that

consider ways to assist children in underperforming schools. Clause 3,

under which local authorities will have a duty to consider parental

representations, has already gone some way towards achieving the spirit

of the amendment. If putting power into parents&#146; hands is to

have the sort of dire consequences suggested by the hon. Member for

Bury, North, one wonders how some elements have been able to support

clause 3, which is not a million miles from the amendment tabled by my

hon. Friend.</div> <a name="06042045000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder

whether there is not some giant misunderstanding about the Bill in some

quarters of the Labour party. The amendment enables us to debate 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>the issues and reconcile any misunderstanding. Through it, we

Conservatives have planted our flag in favour of giving parents

opportunities and considering closely giving parents the chance to do

something about situations in which schools are underperforming. I make

no apologies for supporting my hon. Friend&#146;s

amendment.</div><a name="06042045000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042045000245"></a><b class="B">Mrs.

Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): I, too, support

the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and

Littlehampton. Who will be more concerned about what type of education

is provided for children&#151;50 sets of parents who live in a

community and whose children attend a school, or a local education

authority officer?</div>

<a name="06042045000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill leaves the decision

whether to publish the invitation entirely in the hands of the LEA; it

is not to be determined by local parents or local need. The amendment

would take ownership of that decision from the LEA and put it back into

parents&#146; hands. It proposes a mechanism or trigger that would

kick in a process in which parents or local need could

decide.</div> <a name="06042045000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not as

though the concept of taking decisions from an LEA is entirely new.

After all, the White Paper&#151;not the Bill, which is a hybrid

including what was initially the White Paper&#151;proposed to remove

power from LEAs and give more of it to parents, schools and governing

bodies. There can be only one glaringly obvious reason for doing that,

and it is why the Prime Minister knew that he would face such

opposition&#151;LEAs are letting local education down. On that basis,

an amendment that would provide children in underperforming schools

with a safety net seems infinitely sensible, as does the figure of 35

per cent.</div><a name="06042045000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.

Friend pointed out when he referred to the National Audit Office

reports, more than 1 million children are in underperforming schools,

and probably another 1 million are in coasting schools. On Tuesday

afternoon, the Minister shouted across the room to me from a sedentary

position that &#147;underperforming&#148; was not Ofsted

terminology. Maybe not, but it is NAO terminology, and that is good

enough for me. The NAO states that 1 million children are in

underperforming schools. Who allows that situation to continue? It is

the LEAs, the same LEAs to whom clause 7 will give the responsibility

of deciding whether new provision is needed in their local

communities.</div><a name="06042045000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">If 50

sets of parents cannot decide&#151;if they cannot pull the lever to

trigger the process in areas with underperforming schools&#151;who

can? Who will pull that lever? What will make an LEA decide to publish

the notice inviting proposals for the establishment of a new school?

Will it automatically do so when it finds that about 35 per cent. of

places in its area are in underperforming schools, as probably happens

at the moment? Will it want to make the statement that schools in its

area are failing so badly, or will it coast on that decision? Will it

put it off and put off publishing the invitation, hoping that things

will get better? If so, who will be failed? It will be the children in

those underperforming

schools.</div><a name="06042045000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Tuesday I

mentioned the first Hindu school established in the UK. How many

parents were the prime motivators behind that much-welcomed school? 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>Fewer than 20. How many individuals are the motivators behind the

establishment of any school, including faith schools? Fewer than a

handful, in most cases. How many people were the prime motivators

behind Microsoft, one of the most ardent supporters of the proposals in

the Prime Minister&#146;s White Paper? Just one.</div>

<a name="06042045000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the Minister really saying,

like the hon. Member for Bury, North, that 50 is an insignificant

number of parents in an area where schools are underperforming? How

many parents does the Minister think will join the parent councils to

plan and run new trust schools? If each new school had 50 actively

involved sets of parent, she would be delighted. Suddenly, 50 parents

would become a fantastic figure, not a derisory one. After all, that is

as good as a full complement of staff in an average-size comprehensive

school.</div> <a name="06042045000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fifty nurses

can man 12 active, fully occupied 30-bed surgical wards on a busy

operation day. Why cannot 50 parents decide that a proposal for a new

school is needed? Six nurses can run an average accident and emergency

department on a Saturday night in a busy city centre, so why is 50 such

a derisory number when it applies to parents deciding the future of a

school?</div><a name="06042045000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate a

point that I made on Tuesday. If a school is in a community where

average house prices are low or house prices do not exist&#151;they

did not in the community where I grew up&#151;the socio-economic

grouping is low, unemployment and crime are high and the community

itself is failing, is it not the fact that if 50 parents come forward,

that is as good as double that number in an area where average house

prices are high? Should not those parents be given greater consent and

interest than parents in another

area?</div><a name="06042045000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my

hon. Friend will pursue the amendments. If the Minister does not think

that 50 is an adequate figure, perhaps she could amend the amendment to

give areas of social deprivation with underperforming schools some

leeway so that if 50 parents come forward in those areas, they will be

listened to and given

consideration.</div><a name="06042045000049"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000246"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> My hon. Friend is making a very good point.

Would it not be some help if the Minister&#151;without setting a

target, as she says that she is not prepared to do that&#151;could

give us some indication of the number of schools that she expects will

receive trust status as a result of the processes put in place by the

Bill?</div><a name="06042045000050"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000247"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. I wonder how

many trust schools the Minister thinks will be in areas of the greatest

deprivation.</div><a name="06042045000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is

not acceptable for 50 parents to instigate an invitation, who will be

the innovators? Who will identify the need? How will potential

providers know that the opportunity to provide a new school exists, and

that there is a genuine need for one? Would not the parents be the

first people to identify that need? If that is left to the LEAs,

mediocrity may remain the norm, and we may never be in a position where

all children in state schools receive the same level of education as

those in independent schools. That is what we all want, and it is why

the aims and objectives of the White Paper are so far removed from

those in the Bill.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div><a name="06042045000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042045000248"></a><b class="B">Mr.

John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): I shall

be brief, because this subject has been well covered. However, I wish

to make three points.</div>

<a name="06042045000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister must have some

notion of where she expects these schools to have their

genesis&#151;of where she expects the first of them to emerge. This

project lies at the heart of the Bill, and if it is to have real life

it is important that those schools emerge in the areas of greatest

need. As this is central to the White Paper and a key intention of the

Bill, it is absolutely right that the Minister should explain to the

Committee how she expects the process to germinate. What will the

trigger be&#151;to borrow the phrase of my hon. Friend the Member for

Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries)? It would be a sad situation if these

schools were concentrated in one part of the country and entirely

absent from others. This concept has legs only if there is a real

chance that it will rejuvenate the educational opportunities of some of

the disadvantaged students in some of the most disadvantaged areas, as

my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison)

says.</div><a name="06042045000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to my

second point. It is right that there should be a balance between the

role of local authorities, which are properly involved in

education&#151;I have no prejudice in respect of the role of local

authorities in education&#151;and the role of parents. That balance

lies at the heart of the White Paper and the Bill. However, in striking

that balance one must appreciate that at present the weight of power

clearly rests with LEAs, not with ordinary people. It does not rest

with parents who may be unsure about their capacity and ability to

challenge what they see as the local orthodoxy&#151;the conventional

thinking in their locality. I am unsure whether the Bill in its current

form gets that balance right. The amendments would adjust that balance

and frame the intent of the White Paper in the

Bill.</div><a name="06042045000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third point

is that there is clearly a need to take on board the view articulated

by my hon. Friends the Members for Hertsmere and for Mid-Bedfordshire,

which scotches the arguments of the Liberal Democrats. Liberal Democrat

Members say that there are only a few people who should be involved in

education, and that many people should be prohibited from involvement

because they are unsuitable&#151;they are not of adequate character

or well intentioned. I do not believe that that view pervades the

thinking of the current Government, and it certainly does not pervade

the view of the official Opposition. I also do not think that it is in

keeping with the spirit of the legislation.</div>

<a name="06042045000056"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000249"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> I am fascinated by the obsession that certain

Conservative Members have with the fact that we Liberal Democrats are

trying to ask questions. They are merely setting up a straw man. We are

simply trying to establish some criteria for the kinds of organisations

that will be involved. The hon. Member for Hertsmere made it clear that

that was perfectly legitimate. Does the hon. Member for South Holland

and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) think there is anything wrong in doing

that?</div><a name="06042045000057"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000250"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right; of course

the Committee should ask questions. Questions are asked by Committee

members of all 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>parties&#151;not just by Members from the minor parties, but by

Government Members and by the official Opposition. The purpose of a

Committee is to scrutinise and question, but those questions must be

based on some sort of rationale, and it seems to me that the rationale

of the Liberal Democrats is that narrow, short-sighted, rather

prejudiced view of the way that schools should be organised, funded and

run, which has done so much damage and led to the need for the White

Paper and this

legislation.</div><a name="06042045000207"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

am</div><a name="06042045000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I think

has happened is that the party of Government has grudgingly and

falteringly come to a position that we adopted long ago, but the

Liberal Democrats are lost. They have been left behind; they are still

in a quagmire. That is well illustrated&#151;indeed

personified&#151;by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole

(Annette Brooke). Her views represent the worst and most myopic

understanding of education, which the Government have stepped beyond in

the wake of the official Opposition, who led them to this more

enlightened view of how schools can be run, how parents should have

influence in them, and how outside organisations can help to stimulate

and fund them.</div> <a name="06042045000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I

said, my third point is that I hope the Minister will, in answering the

questions she has been asked, reassure the Committee about the criteria

we will use to judge the sort of people who will be involved. However,

let us not, for heaven&#146;s sake, rule out before we begin all that

extra energy, enterprise and initiative that can come from involving

people who thus far have not been involved in the business of funding

and supporting education. Of course there should be checks and

balances, and of course there should be restrictions if people do not

do the job properly, but we must understand that these organisations

will be charitable trusts. Therefore, they are, by definition, limited

in terms of their ambitions, and they are also unlikely to be the kind

of wicked and monstrous organisations that the party on my left, in

every sense&#151;the Liberal Democrats&#151;seems to think they

might

be.</div><a name="06042045000060"></a>

in the name of a convicted

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000252"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The hon. Gentleman is doing himself no favours,

because of course no member of this Committee would want inappropriate

people to be supporting, sponsoring or running schools. I know that the

hon. Gentleman is a new Member of Parliament, and I do not usually

resort to this kind of sentiment, Mr. Cook, but he really ought to grow

up. All Members who serve on Committees that consider these kinds of

Bills have the best interests of the children of this country at heart.

All of us want there to be good opportunities for people to prosper and

to achieve their educational potential. All of us understand that the

people who teach, run, fund and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div>govern schools have to be right and proper people. The hon. Gentleman is

right to challenge and question, but, for heaven&#146;s sake, let us

not go into the realms of fantasy and

assume&#151;</div><a name="06042045000062"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000253"></a>Greg

way?</div><a name="06042045000063"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000254"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> No, because the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last

comment was facile. We should keep this debate in the realms of common

sense. It is important that we understand that the Bill provides an

opportunity for additional resources, skill and energy to be brought

into the education system through the activity and ambitions of

parents, and through the organisations that might be persuaded to

support education and have yet not

done.</div><a name="06042045000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having made my

three points, I want to state my strong support for the amendments

tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.

In striking the balances I have described, they would be useful

additions to the Bill and in keeping with the spirit of the White

Paper. They are designed to improve the legislation, and I look forward

to hearing the Minister&#146;s remarks, but unless she says something

very persuasive, I, like my hon. Friends, will want to take the matter

further.</div>

<a name="06042045000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042045000255"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Edward Leigh</b> (Gainsborough) (Con): The Minister&#146;s

speech today will be particularly important, because it will give us an

opportunity to find out exactly how the new schools will germinate. We

can lay aside party politics for the moment, because both Conservative

and Labour parties have a lot to answer for as a result of their time

in government.</div> <a name="06042045000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

have been references to the National Audit Office report. Why is it

that there are 1 million children in underperforming schools in this

country? We have to stand back for a moment, forget all the brickbats

that we throw at each other, and ask why our schools are

underperforming, particularly when we benchmark them against those in

France, Germany and Italy, our competitor and partner countries. Why is

our education system apparently not delivering the goods in so many

areas? Is it something to do with the way in which we frame legislation

in this House, or is it to do with the structure of education on the

ground? We have to ask ourselves seriously whether some of the blame

lies with local education authorities, which are perhaps not proactive,

visionary or creative enough. That question, I presume, is what

motivated the Prime Minister and his closest colleagues to bring

forward this Bill, in the face of great opposition. That is all very

well, and we all accept that.</div>

<a name="06042045000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister will say that she

believes in choice and diversity and, no doubt, that interest has been

expressed in setting up the new schools. The fact is that when the last

Conservative Government tried to create grant-maintained schools in

certain areas they were very popular. The Minister will say that the

schools that we are discussing are nothing like grant-maintained

schools, but there are similarities&#151;let us be honest about it. I

understand that about a fifth of secondary schools in those areas

became grant maintained. However, in other areas, such as Scotland,

there were virtually none; in fact, that was a matter of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>pride in Scotland, was it not? I can remember when Lord Forsyth was

Secretary of State, and despite his best efforts, such was the power of

the establishment in Scotland that for a long time there was not a

single grant-maintained school in Scotland. By the end of the

Conservative period in office, there were perhaps one or two.</div>

<a name="06042045000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Presumably the Minister

believes in the concept that we are discussing and wants it to be a

success. However, as a result of pressure that has been placed on her,

is she not giving those in local authorities who are opposed to the

concept too much power to prevent the new schools from germinating?

That is a question that we have to ask. She may now come along with

cleverly devised speaking notes that will rubbish the proposal made so

ably by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton,

but the Opposition have a right to probe and to ask questions. We do

not know whether the mechanism suggested by my hon. Friend is exactly

the right one; all that we are trying to get out of the Minister is how

we are to encourage the process, against enormous resistance, so that

the new schools can germinate. Otherwise, in many areas of our country,

the concept will be

stillborn.</div><a name="06042045000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will

be some areas where there are active local authorities committed to

what the Minister is trying to do, or active sets of parents, schools,

institutions or other bodies coming in from outside; we do not know.

However, the Minister must recognise that there will be many other

areas&#151;precisely those where most of the problems

occur&#151;where nothing will happen. So it is not good enough for

the Minister to say to us, in general terms, &#147;I have had 10 or

20 proposals.&#148; We are talking about thousands of schools. What

we want to hear from the Minister is how she will ensure that her idea

takes root in the ground and flowers, precisely in the areas where most

of the problems

are.</div><a name="06042045000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042045000256"></a><b class="B">Ms

Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): Does not

the hon. Gentleman recognise that in many of the most deprived areas of

the country, Labour authorities do indeed have invitations to establish

city academies? It is not true that LEAs are blocking the development

of diversity in the

system.</div><a name="06042045000071"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000257"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Good. That is very helpful. When the Minister

replies, she can refer to particular areas where there are city

academies. She can convince the Committee that despite all the

difficulties that there have been in the Labour party about the issue,

and despite all the opposition from the NUT, the education

establishment, many local authorities and many Labour Members of

Parliament, the proposal will turn out like city academies; local

authorities will not be able to block it. She can convince us that we

will have not just a couple of dozen of these new schools, but perhaps

hundreds, and that this will be an important Bill that makes a big

difference; something akin to what we achieved in 1944, or another of

the great landmarks in education. If what we are talking about is just

a few schools&#151;there have not been that many city

academies&#151;</div><a name="06042045000072"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000258"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> Twenty.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div><a name="06042045000073"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000259"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> My hon. Friend says 20. There are some 3,500

secondary schools in England and there are 20 city academies. Has the

establishment of city academies actually made a great deal of

difference to most kids in most parts of the country? The answer must

be no. We are worried that the same will happen in this case. We made a

great mistake when we were in power; we should have ensured that every

school became grant maintained, but that was opposed in the Department

and in the House of Lords. Many of the problems that the Labour party

cites in opposition to grant-maintained schools, such as cherry picking

and getting better funding than other schools, stemmed directly from

the fact that not all schools became grant maintained. If all schools

had freed themselves from the shackles of control, we could really have

revived education in this country.</div>

<a name="06042045000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The independent sector is more

successful not just because it has more resources but because it has

freedom to manage. The Minister recognises that. Her vision for these

new schools is that they will be creative and will have more freedom to

manage. What concerns us is that there will be too few of

them.</div>

<a name="06042045000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042045000260"></a><b class="B">Anne

Snelgrove</b> (South Swindon) (Lab): The grant-maintained

school system depended on those schools taking a disproportionate

amount of money out of the local education system. Therefore, I should

be interested to know how the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Government would

have funded all the secondary schools going grant maintained. I was

heavily involved in education at that time, so I can tell him for a

fact that there would not have been enough money in the

system.</div>

<a name="06042045000076"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000261"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I know that the attack that is constantly made on

grant-maintained schools is that they got better revenue support than

other schools. However, the hon. Lady has ignored the point that I was

making. I accepted that the main charge made by the Labour party

against grant-maintained schools was that they got better funding. That

is a controversial view&#151;some agree, some do not&#151;but I

accepted it for the sake of argument. If all schools had become grant

maintained, that charge would not have held water. That is the lesson

that we must learn as we develop our policies in opposition for the

next period of Conservative Government, whenever that might

be.</div>

<a name="06042045000077"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000262"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Of course, that is now the Government&#146;s

policy. Paragraph 2.5 on page 24 of the White Paper

says:</div><a name="06042045000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We will

encourage all primary and secondary schools to be self-governing and to

acquire a Trust&#148;,</div><a name="06042045000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">so the

Government have learned from mistakes made in the earlier

Administration.</div>

<a name="06042045000079"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000263"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Yes, I think that they have learned. I have a lot

of time for the Minister, who is part of the forces of light in the

argument; she is trying to push the stone up a difficult hill. However,

I suspect&#151;in fact, I pretty well know, and she would not be in

her position if she had not accepted this&#151;that she wants to move

towards precisely what the Prime Minister wants. She wants schools to

become increasingly independent of local 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>authorities. I fear, though, that she is falling into the same hole that

we fell into. Because she cannot get the measures through her own

party, the House of Lords or the education establishment, she is

allowing too many checks and balances to prevent these excellent new

schools from forming.</div>

<a name="06042045000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we consider the issue

again, in the next education Bill, under the next Government in four or

five years&#146; time, we will find that there are 20, 30, 40, 50 or

perhaps even 100 or 200 foundation schools. That will be an

insignificant proportion of the number of schools in England and Wales?

How many are there? Is it 20,000? The Minister can tell us the exact

number off the top of her head. Even if there are 200 foundation

schools, all the time that we have spent on this Bill will have been

wasted. Let us hear from the Minister, and let her now assure us that

that there will not be just a few score of schools but many hundreds,

and that she has developed mechanisms to create new life in our

education system.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000264"></a>The

Minister for Schools (Jacqui Smith):</b> The debate has ranged

pretty widely this morning. Let us remind ourselves that clause 7

provides that a local authority in England can publish a notice

inviting proposals for a new school, including an academy. The effect

of the clause&#151;together with the other clauses in this part and

schedule 3&#151;is that proposals for new maintained schools may be

published only as part of a competition unless, on a case-by-case

basis, the Secretary of State gives consent to publication outside of a

competition. We will come to those circumstances when we discuss clause

9.</div> <a name="06042045000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked specifically about section 66

of the Education Act 2005, which extended the competition provisions.

During the passage of the Act, we made it clear that there would be

consultation on regulations introduced under it, as all hon. Members

would expect there to be. We are currently consulting on those

regulations, and the consultation will finish in May, after which the

provisions will come into force.</div>

<a name="06042045000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us turn, however, to the

detail of the amendments. The Opposition amendments, in particular,

seem to be intended to widen the scope of competitions. Amendment No.

24 would require local authorities to hold a competition for new

schools when </div><a name="06042045000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;35 per

cent or more of school places are in schools that are

underperforming.&#148;</div><a name="06042045000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

term &#147;underperforming&#148; is defined in amendment No.

193.</div> <a name="06042045000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be

completely clear: everybody on the Committee shares the ambition that

every pupil should be in a good school. The Government take that matter

seriously, which is why a major purpose of this part, and of the Bill

as a whole, is to increase the range and quality of provision so that

parents have more good schools to choose from. My problem with the

amendment is that although competitions, which the clause is about, are

important, they are not the answer to all the problems of

underperformance. In their role as the champion of parents and the

quality assurer of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>provision, local authorities need to deploy a range of measures not only

to attract new schools or expand good ones, but to turn around weak

schools and encourage ambition in coasting ones. That is why we are

raising the bar on schools&#146; performance in a range of

ways.</div>

<a name="06042045000086"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000265"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> Will the Minister give

way?</div>

<a name="06042045000087"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000266"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> No. May I just say that I will not be giving way to

any hon. Members during my response? [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.

Members:</span> &#147;Oh.&#148;] Well, every single Liberal

Democrat and all but one of the speaking Members on the Conservative

Benches has had their say, and it is important that we make a bit of

progress.</div> <a name="06042045000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,

since September 2005, our expectation has been that schools should no

longer be content to be satisfactory, but should strive to be good or

outstanding. Secondly, as we discussed on Tuesday, we are rolling out

school improvement partners to provide all schools with the appropriate

support and challenge so that every school continually strives for

further improvement. Thirdly, through the proposals to extend the

warning notice to underperforming schools, which we shall discuss later

in the Bill, we are looking for local authorities to take a more

proactive role in school improvement at an early stage, before problems

result in formal school failure. Local authority intervention powers

will be available should underperforming schools resist making the

necessary changes to improve their performance.</div>

<a name="06042045000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those proposals, along with the

investment that we are making in developing and recruiting head

teachers and middle managers, are the best way to secure sustainable

improvements in schools, year on year. However, we have made it clear

that if a school is judged to be failing, local authorities should

intervene immediately to secure effective improvements. In some

circumstances, that may be done by running a competition for a

replacement school, and that might be an important and appropriate way

forward, but the question is whether it should be the only way forward

in all circumstances. It is for the local authority, in its role as the

commissioner of school places and guarantor of standards, to take a

view on the best way forward in a particular case.</div>

<a name="06042045000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that hon. Members agree

that we need to advance on a range of fronts to improve our schools. In

itself, a competition would not effect the desired change in all cases.

Indeed, that is why clause 9 provides for proposals to be introduced

outside a competition with the consent of the Secretary of State,

particularly where we need quickly to restart a failing school. I

therefore urge the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to

withdraw the amendment.

</div><a name="06042045000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 179

would require a local authority to publish a notice inviting proposals

from promoters to establish a new school where it had received

representations from 50 or more parents. As we have discussed, the

Government are committed to creating a school system that is shaped

more by parents than the current system is. That is why, in clauses 2

and 3, we are placing new duties on local authorities to promote

diversity, increase opportunities for parental choice and respond to

specific representations from parents. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>We had a good discussion on amendments to those clauses about how we

expect those duties to work. Local authorities should respond to all

representations from parents and consider how best to meet their needs

in light of local circumstances.</div>

<a name="06042045000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a significant number of

parents in an area asked for a new school, a competition would be one

way forward. A request by fewer than 50 parents could justify a local

authority in running a competition. The draft guidance on

responsiveness to parental concerns, which we have made available and

discussed, suggests that as an option, but it would not be the only

valid response to parental representations. Parents might be seeking a

particular kind of school, in which case the appropriate response would

be for the local authority to explore their needs further and advise

them on the options for making their own proposals, perhaps outside a

competition, under the regime that we propose in clause 9.

Alternatively, the local authority may identify a suitable partner to

work with the parents to develop proposals in line with their

wishes.</div> <a name="06042045000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may

also be occasions on which the appropriate course of action is not to

make proposals for a new school, but for the local authority to bear on

an existing local school to raise its standards, or to propose that a

popular local school be able to expand. Depending on the nature and

level of parental demand, parents could bring pressure to bear on

failing or coasting schools to increase standards, encourage schools to

federate to improve or encourage popular schools to expand. In every

case, and in every response, it would mean local authorities actively

seeking to address parental concerns and to increase the opportunity

for parental choice by improving the stock of good schools. We need

local authorities, under the duties outlined in clauses 2 and 3, to

respond flexibly in light of local circumstances every time there are

parental representations, rather than impose a single solution by means

of a trigger such as that proposed by Opposition

Members.</div><a name="06042045000094"></a>

time.</div><a name="06042045000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

mentioned clause 9 as one of the alternatives. I had understood that

clause 9 was to be used only in exceptional circumstances and not as a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000272"></a>Jacqui

right.</div><a name="06042045000101"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000273"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. We will discuss clause 9 when we get to

it.</div><a name="06042045000102"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000274"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> As I have said, clause 7 and the competition

proposals in the Bill and in the 2005 Act 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>should be the norm for the development of new and replacement schools.

That is our position on clause 9, which I will leave for

now.</div><a name="06042045000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the

Committee that we do not dismiss out of hand suggestions to improve the

Bill and achieve our objectives. In drawing up our provisions, we

thought about the pros and cons of specifying a hard and fast

threshold. I think that debates today and on Tuesday have proved that

we were right to conclude that a specific trigger and an automatic

local authority response would not achieve what we want: local

authorities throughout the whole range of their activities being, and

by law having to be, responsive to parental representations however and

from wherever they

come.</div><a name="06042045000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 25

would require the deadline set by local authorities for the submission

of proposals in a competition to be &#147;reasonable.&#148; Of

course we would all agree that the deadline should be reasonable. We

would also agree that the date should allow proposals properly to be

prepared, but that it should not extend the period unduly and frustrate

the competition procedure. The hon. Gentleman rightly made the point

that we must get that balance right. While I share his desire that the

period allowed should provide the best possible balance between a

speedy competition process and adequate time to prepare proposals, I do

not agree that we need this additional wording in the Bill.</div>

<a name="06042045000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Gentleman said,

illustrative regulations that we have made available to the Committee

say that we intend promoters to have four months to prepare their

proposals. The period for additional secondary school competitions was

originally half that, but we considered that additional time would be

needed, particularly for some of the non-traditional promoters who

might come forward through the competitions. I reiterate that we are

currently consulting on regulations under the 2005 Act which extend

that period to four months. Of course, that will give us the

opportunity to hear from those who might want to promote proposals in

competitions if they think that that is an appropriate time scale.

Under our plans, promoters will be able to access independent

consultancy advice funded by the Department, which is currently planned

to be up to three days for each promoter, but we will want to consult

on the sort of help that they will find most useful.</div>

<a name="06042045000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked specifically about

the capital pot that we have set aside for new promoters and priorities

in the White Paper. We have set aside &#163;150 million until 2008.

However, given the pervasive nature of the reform that we want to see,

we will expect local authorities to use their own funding from

&#147;building schools for the future&#148;, formula capital and

targeted capital funds first, and this capital fund will be a last

resort.</div><a name="06042045000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked

how we can ensure that the opportunities that will be opened up,

particularly by new trust schools, will be focused in disadvantaged

areas. &#147;Building schools for the future&#148;, which is an

important capital route for local authorities when considering

reorganisations, has started in the most deprived areas. As my hon.

Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith) said, we have

also focused academies on those most deprived

areas.</div>

<a name="06042045000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042045000275"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Rob Wilson</b> (Reading, East) (Con): Will the Minister give

way?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div><a name="06042045000109"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000276"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> As the hon. Gentleman did not speak, I will give

way to

him.</div><a name="06042045000110"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000277"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. Is this a new

ministerial way of proceeding, that one can intervene on the Minister

only if one has not

spoken?</div><a name="06042045000111"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000278"></a>The

Chairman:</b> The hon. Gentleman has been here for a number of

years&#151;almost as many as I have; we have probably been here for

equal terms&#151;and he knows full well that a Member who has the

Floor may give way or not as they so

choose.</div><a name="06042045000112"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000279"></a>Mr.

Wilson:</b> I thank the Minister for giving way. I seek

clarification regarding the &#163;150 million that she says she has

for the capital building programme. Is that specifically for trusts, or

will it be spent mainly on the academies programme? I believe that

there is a target of moving from the current 20 to

200.</div><a name="06042045000113"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000280"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> It will not be spent on the academies programme

because we have set aside significant capital investment for that.

Neither will it be spent solely on trusts, because trust schools might

well be existing schools that choose to develop relationships with

trusts. It will be spent on supporting the sort of priorities that are

spelt out in the White Paper, including schools that might come forward

when promoters actively promote them through either a competition or

the provisions under clause 9. However, I reiterate that the new system

should not depend on a central pot. Through the considerable additional

capital that we are making available to them, all local authorities

should support the development of precisely that sort of new

provision.</div> <a name="06042045000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to

probing amendment No. 65, which would add an extra layer of

requirements for promoters of new schools to meet. There is a need to

ensure that there are adequate safeguards in the system to prevent

unsuitable partners from being involved in running schools, but I am

confident that the provisions in the Bill are adequate. The amendment

would simply introduce additional

bureaucracy.</div>

<a name="06042045000209"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

am</div><a name="06042045000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be

clear: where a local authority invites proposals in a competition for a

new school&#151;that is what we are discussing&#151;some, but not

necessarily all, of the proposals might be for schools supported by a

trust. There might be all sorts of other ways in which schools emerge

in a competition. The local authority will publish a notice including

certain information set out in clause 7 and in regulations. Proposals

in response to the notice could be submitted by parents, voluntary

groups or potential trusts. The notice inviting proposals will need to

specify, for example, the possible site of the school, the date by

which proposals must be submitted, the size of the school, and the

community that it is intended to serve. Proposals made in response to

the notice will have to provide evidence of any relevant experience in

education held by the proposers.</div>

<a name="06042045000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked specifically about

protections that we are providing in respect of trusts, and I shall

reiterate those protections. We have spelled out the first on numerous 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>occasions, but I am, of course, willing to reassure Liberal Democrat

Members. After a time, however, asking questions and seeking

reassurances becomes a questioning of the policy itself.</div>

<a name="06042045000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 31 requires all trusts

to be incorporated charities and therefore subject to charity law. No

charity can make a profit. If there are concerns, the Charity

Commission will be able to intervene. Regulations made under clause 31,

which I circulated to Committee members yesterday, will require each

trust&#146;s charitable objects to include the advancement of the

education of the school&#146;s pupils and the advancement of

community cohesion. In addition, trusts will be under a duty to promote

good race relations. Clause 31 also allows the Secretary of State to

disqualify certain categories of individuals from being trustees and

gives the Secretary of State a reserve power, by direction, to remove

and appoint trustees where there is concern about an ongoing

relationship. The draft illustrative Education (Requirements as to

Foundations) (England) Regulations list the categories of individuals

who will be disqualified from being trustees&#151;that addresses the

point raised by the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West. The categories

include those prevented by education legislation from working with

children or young persons, and people who at any time have been

convicted of any offence and have had passed on them a sentence of

imprisonment for a period of not less than five years.</div>

<a name="06042045000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we discuss clauses 17 and

18, which are about the process through which the acquisition of a

trust would be achieved, I shall be happy to go into detail and to

provide for the Committee further guidance on the process that we will

expect decision-makers to go through in order to acquire a trust. That

will involve criteria that they will have to bear in mind when deciding

on their relationship with a trust. That will further respond to some

of the points made by hon. Members.</div>

<a name="06042045000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the correct approach to

safeguards: it is clear and consistent. The safeguards are in the Bill,

in the regulations and in the guidance which I shall ensure the

Committee has an opportunity to scrutinise. Allowing each local

authority to set its own conditions and criteria and to make judgments

about what qualifications are needed to run a school is far less

transparent and would tend to lead to a fragmented system with no

consistent standards for trusts. On that basis, I hope that hon.

Members will not press their amendments.</div>

<a name="06042045000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not feel that I need to

address amendment No. 27 at great length, not least because the hon.

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton acknowledged that whereas he

had identified two months in respect of the local authority publishing

the results of a competition, we have already set out in our

regulations that the period should be three weeks. I hope that he is

reassured by that.</div><a name="06042045000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our

proposals to increase the diversity of provision form an essential part

of the new relationship between parents, schools and local authorities.

As I said, the provisions in the Bill are the right way forward. They

supply the appropriate protections, and I hope that all hon. Members

who tabled amendments in this group will agree not to press

them.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div><a name="06042045000122"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042045000281"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> This has been a very interesting debate. I do not

apologise for the fact that some time has been spent debating this

group of amendments. Many Opposition Members wished to speak to the

amendments. Clause 7 is a pivotal part of the Bill and the three groups

of amendments to the clause should be debated in

full.</div><a name="06042045000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">In her

contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire made the

useful suggestion that if the Minister could not accept amendment No.

179, perhaps she could suggest an alternative that gives certain groups

of parents&#151;say, in deprived areas&#151;the kind of rights that

we suggest ought to apply across the country. That is a good suggestion

to which we might return on Report. My hon. Friend the Member for

Hertsmere made the important point that amendment No. 179 is not a

million miles away from the principle enshrined in clause 3, except

that it is more specific and would give parents the extra right, under

clause 7, to insist on a

competition.</div><a name="06042045000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend the Member for Gainsborough(Mr. Leigh) hit the nail on

the head when he summed up&#151;perhaps inadvertently&#151;my own

personal credo on education policy. The problem in British state

education goes beyond party politics. Both Labour and Conservative

Governments since the mid 1960s have played a part in creating the

plight that we face today, wherein 23 per cent. of adults are unable to

read the dosage on an aspirin bottle, and one million children are

languishing in underperforming schools. The answer to our problems is

for both main parties together to confront the underlying problems and

the philosophy that leads to those problems that have caused the poor

quality of state education&#151;we hope that one day the Liberals

will be included in that consensus.</div>

<a name="06042045000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the Minister

for responding in full to our specific questions. When I moved the

amendment I asked why section 66 of the Education Act 2005 still had

not come into force. She explained&#151;quite properly&#151;that

the Government are still consulting on the provision; that consultation

will finish in May and the provision will then come into force. It

seems that we are dealing with overlapping education Bills and Acts,

with consultation on a previous piece of legislation still under way

while we debate the next piece. That is a strange way to conduct

business. We need a more long-term vision for how we reform and

restructure our education

system.</div><a name="06042045000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

said that a competition is not the whole story&#151;that a range of

other methods should be, and are, part of the Bill and should be taken

into account when considering how to raise standards. Of course, we

agree with that statement and with those other methods. That is why we

support the Bill fully. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for

Gainsborough pointed out, the Minister will be, and is, under pressure

to put obstacles in the way of initiating competitions and encouraging

trust schools. Our amendments are designed to reduce those obstacles

and to help her to achieve the objectives set out in the White Paper.

In opposing our amendment, the Minister appears to be downplaying the

importance of the key provision of the Bill, saying that competitions

are not the be-all and end-all of raising standards, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>whereas we think that they are a key method of raising standards in our

educational

system.</div><a name="06042045000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

accepted that the provisions of amendment No. 179 were similar to the

procedures in clause 3. Her opposition seems to be based on a

bureaucratic argument that there might well be other methods, outside

of the competition provisions, by which the local authority could

respond to parents&#146; concerns. Again, that response appears to

confirm my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns that the education

establishment will seek to scupper those competitions, and take a

high-handed attitude to parents&#146;

concerns.</div><a name="06042045000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want the

Bill to succeed, not only in the letter, but in the spirit. We are

concerned that, under the clause 3 arrangements by which a local

authority must consider representations, at the end of the day, the

local authority could simply say, &#147;No&#148;. That is our

concern.</div><a name="06042045000129"></a>

areconsequential amendments. As Members will know, sub-paragraph (ii) wasintroduced <div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>as a concession to the Labour rebels. It was never part of the originalvision of the White Paper or for the Bill.</div><a name="06042045000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his speech on 24October, the day before the publication of the White Paper, the PrimeMinistersaid:</div><a name="06042045000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We needto see every local authority moving from provider to commissioner, sothat the system acquires a local dynamism responsive to the needs oftheir communities and open to change and new forms of schoolprovision.</div> <a name="06042045000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">This willliberate local authorities from too often feeling the need to defendthe status quo, so that instead they become the champions of innovationand diversity, and the partner of local parents in driving continuousimprovement.&#148;</div><a name="06042045000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who coulddisagree with that? That is the correct vision&#151;the vision thatwe support and the one that we believe will most effectively ensurethat the objectives of the White Paper and the Bill aredelivered.</div><a name="06042045000210"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15am</div><a name="06042045000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleasedthat that was the vision that appeared in paragraph 9.3, on page 104 ofthe White Paper, whichstates:</div><a name="06042045000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Wewill support local authorities in playing a new commissioning role inrelation to a new school system, at the heart of their localcommunities, and responsive to the needs of parents and pupils. Theywill support new schools and new provision where there is real demandor where existing provision is poor. This is a very different role fromacting as a direct provider of school places. We recognise that in manyways it is more challenging. But it also offers the scope to ensurethat communities receive the education they deserve and aspireto.&#148;</div><a name="06042045000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is reconfirmedon the last page of the White Paper, page 116, whichsays:</div><a name="06042045000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We willalso remove the right for local authorities to publish their ownproposals for the establishment of new communityschools.&#148;</div><a name="06042045000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is allvery clear and reflects the judgment of the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State&#151;and, no doubt, the Minister for Schools aswell&#151;that that approach is the best way to improve standards inour schools. That is the approach that they believe is in the bestinterests of our country, and as such it is an approach that theConservative partysupports.</div><a name="06042045000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then camethe intervention of Lord Kinnock and Lady Morris and the brewing Labourparty rebellion, and with it the alternative White Paper, which made itclearthat:</div><a name="06042045000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Localauthorities should retain the power to decide whether to functionsolely as commissioners, and not providers, of education. There shouldbe no outright ban on new schools being developed as local authoritycommunity schools.&#148;</div><a name="06042045000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thatwas followed by the Secretary of State&#146;s letter of6February to the Chairman of the Education and Skills Committee, whichannounced the climbdown that led to the insertion of subsection(5)(b)(ii). At the bottom of page 4 of the letter, the Secretary ofState says that</div><a name="06042045000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;theremay be occasions where a community school might best meet local needs.In such cases, if a local authority wished to enter a community schoolin a competition&#151;and the Secretary of State felt that there wasmerit in such a proposal&#151;the competition would be judged by theAdjudicator rather than the local authority. In judging thecompetition, the Adjudicator would take into account the track recordof the local authority in terms of educational performance, the degreeof diversity in the local school system and parentalpreference.&#148;</div><div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div><a name="06042045000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that concession failed toconvince a majority of the original signatories to the early-day motionthat made manifest the extent of the discontent. Some 52 Labour Membersvoted against the Bill&#146;s Second Reading and a substantial numberabstained.</div> <a name="06042045000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">None theless, the Bill commanded the support of the overwhelming majority ofMembers of the House. The majority for the Bill was 343&#151;458Members voted aye and 115 voted no. A new coalition had emerged, theviews of which were not represented by the Labour rebels. As theConservative contingent of that vote of 458 Members, we did not wantthat concession allowing local authorities to propose community schoolsto be made. The Minister did not originally want that concession to bemade and, judging by the failure of all but 100 Labour Members to signthe early-day motion, I believe that the overwhelming majority ofLabour Members did not want it to be made either.</div><a name="06042045000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the Minister&#146;sjudgment and that of the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister thatwhat is best for the education of our children is that localauthorities should not be able to propose community schools. What willhelp to drive up standards is greater diversity in provision and typesof school. To achieve that objective it is important that we do notestablish any more schools of the type that currently make up theoverwhelming majority of schools.</div><a name="06042045000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to any sensiblereading of the view of Members of the House, the overwhelming majorityagrees with the Minister&#146;s and the Secretary of State&#146;soriginal judgment that local authorities should not be permitted toestablish new community schools. Of course in democratic politics onesometimes has to compromise to get proposals through, but it was alwaysclear that Conservative Members were going to support theBill&#151;that is certainly clear now that we have had thevote&#151;so there was never any question of the Government needingto compromise to get the Bill through the House of Commons. It is clearthat the reason for the compromise was simply Labour party management.It was not about genuinely reflectingthe opinion of the Houseof Commons or what the Government believed was in the best interests ofthe country.</div><a name="06042045000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">AmendmentNo. 26 would remove the compromise from the Bill by deleting subsection(5)(b)(ii), thereby restoring to the Bill a key element of the visionexpressed in the Prime Minister&#146;s speech of 24 October and thekey vision of the White Paper that preceded the Bill. Given that thecompromise failed to convince the Labour rebels anyway, I urge theMinister to use this opportunity to restore the Bill so that itdelivers reform in tune with what her own judgment tells her is in thebest interests of thecountry.</div><a name="06042045000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.76 is proposed as a fall-back position in the extreme circumstance ofthe Government failing to accept amendment No. 26. It would ensure thatcommunity schools could be <div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>established only if their establishment would lead to better academicresults and higher standards.</div><a name="06042045000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its report on the WhitePaper, the Education and Skills Committee&#151;or rather, the Labourmembers of the Committee; I do not want to drag my two hon. Friendswho are members of that Committee into this conclusion&#151; arguedthat it saw</div><a name="06042045000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no reasonwhy a local authority should not put forward a proposal for a newcommunity school when a competition for a new school is to beheld.&#148;</div><a name="06042045000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">In their responseto the Committee&#146;s report, the Government accepted thatconclusion,stating:</div><a name="06042045000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Weaccept the Select Committee&#146;s view that there may, in somecircumstances, be a case for a new community school based on parentalviews, track record and other relevant practicalissues.&#148;</div><a name="06042045000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The responsewent on to say that the Secretary of State&#146;s consent would berequired, butthat</div><a name="06042045000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where alocal authority with a good track record in education proposes acommunity school that will command the support of parents, theSecretary of State will not normallyintervene.&#148;</div><a name="06042045000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given thatGovernment response, the amendment would provide substance to thefactors that the Secretary of State needs to take into account whenreaching a decision on whether to allow a local authority to establisha new community school.</div><a name="06042045000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the data, it is clear thatfoundation schools outperform community schools on every measure. In2004-05, 38 per cent. of pupils in community schools achieved five ormore GCSEs, including in English and Maths, at grades A* to C, comparedwith 44.2 per cent. of pupils in foundation schools. I could quote alot more statistics, but the evidence is overwhelming that foundationschools outperform community schools. I cannot conceive ofcircumstances in which the Secretary of State would want to giveconsent, even as the Bill is currently drafted.</div><a name="06042045000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 21 is consequentto amendment No. 26. I want to say a few brief words on amendment No.66, tabled by the Liberal Democrats. It seeks to take out the necessityfor the Secretary of State&#146;s consent when a local authoritywishes to establish a new community school. The amendment is consistentwith the Liberal Democrat party&#146;s approach to the Bill, which isto take the side of the Labour rebels and confirm that the LiberalDemocrat position on education issues, as on so much else, is firmly tothe left of the Labour party. I still hope that under their newleadership, the Liberal Democrats will begin to move away from thatextreme position to a more moderateone.</div><a name="06042045000189"></a></td></tr></table><a name="end"><table width=90%><tr valign=top><td colspan=2>&nbsp;<br><page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/e/st060420/am/60420s06.htm"/>
