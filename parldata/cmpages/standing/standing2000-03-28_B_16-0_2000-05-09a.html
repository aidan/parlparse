<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the remainder of the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses 32 to 42, Schedule 4, Clauses 43 to 47, Schedule 5, Clause 48, Clauses 53 to 59, Schedule 8, Clauses 60 and 61, Clauses 49 and 50, Schedule 6, Clause 51, Schedule 7, Clause 52, Clause 62, Schedule 9, Clause 63, Schedule 10, Clauses 64 to 67, Schedule 11, Clauses 68 to 72, Schedule 12, Clauses 73 and 74, new Clauses, new Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I have suggested a change to the order of consideration, which I hope is agreeable to the Committee. Clauses 49 to 52 contain provisions dealing with the creation, stopping up and diversion of rights of way. Clauses 50 and 51 give effect to schedules 6 and 7 to the Bill, which introduce a right for land managers to apply for footpaths and bridleways to be closed or diverted under existing legislation, and to appeal against a refusal. They also introduce new powers for the closure or diversion of rights of way to prevent crime in certain urban areas and to protect children and teachers in schools. We are tabling amendments to refine those detailed provisions, to introduce provisions enabling schools to apply for orders and to provide those who are refused orders with a right to appeal to the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales. In addition, we are tabling amendments introducing provisions for the diversion of rights of way to protect sites of special scientific interest. That will require schedules 6 and 7 to be replaced with one combined schedule including the new provisions.

<P>
Those amendments are in line with commitments that we have already given. However, the Committee should have adequate time to consider the extensive and detailed amendments, particularly because of the difference that they may make to amendments already tabled to schedules 6 and 7. We therefore suggest that they be discussed after clause 61.

<P>
I hope that that explanation will assist the Committee, that all parties will have a full opportunity to examine the new single combined schedule and that the Committee will agree to postpone consideration of it until we have discussed clause 61.

<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I thank the Minister for the Environment for giving us advance notice of the motion and the reaaons for it. We agree that the clauses and schedules that the Minister wants to move back for consideration are important to the Bill's practical application. We had already noted that they were profoundly imperfect, and we had tabled many amendments in an effort to improve them.

<P>
We welcome the onset of light on the Government Front Bench and the Minister's desire to change parts of the Bill. The Government's effort may be slightly belated, but we always welcome belated conversions. I hope that their approach presages things to come-they may feel that they can make radical improvements that match the improvements that we have proposed in Committee. We welcome the motion.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I regret that I cannot express my gratitude for having been given advance notice of the motion or the reasons for it, but I welcome it. I said on Second Reading that the Government would need further to amend the relevant clauses and schedules. My only regret is that those amendments are still limited in number-related parts of the Bill would benefit from the Government's further attention. No doubt we shall explore that further in later debates.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 32</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation of Chapter III</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Ms Chris McCafferty </B>(Calder Valley): I beg to move amendment No. 520, in page 18, line 16, at end add-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) a way leading to any access land'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Means of access are vital to the Bill's purpose. If people cannot legally gain access to access land, they cannot enjoy it, and if they cannot legally gain access to access land, they will become frustrated and angry. On means of access, the Bill does not go far enough. The definition of means of access is restricted to situations in which the access land is adjacent to a highway or another place to which the public have a right of access. The clause refers to a way through
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a wall, fence  or steps  or  any bridge.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If a means of access is provided, it is useless unless people can legally reach that point.

<P>
The amendment would extend the definition of means of access to include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a way leading to any access land.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Government have already adopted that phrase-it is used in clause 14(1)(b), which makes it an offence to display misleading information
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on or near a way leading to access land.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That ``way'' need not be a definitive right of way-it might be a path or track which, with the access authority's agreement under chapter III, will be kept unobstructed as a means of access.

<P>
The Under-Secretary is likely to respond by saying that clause 52 already allows countryside bodies to apply to the Secretary of State for a path-creating order to be made-

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> Yes.

<P>
<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> I obviously have more access to the Under-Secretary's way of thinking than I thought I had. Clause 52 is welcome, but it is insufficient. Creation orders take time and they will be subject to compensation payments and, if there are objections, to a public inquiry. Path-creation orders under section 26 of the Highways Act 1980 are subject to compensation. It would surely be better if the access authority could reach agreement with landowners about the provision of a means of access along the way leading to access land. I ask hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to consider this sensible amendment as a means of avoiding the difficulties that I have mentioned.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): This is a particularly unhelpful amendment, from the point of view of the Bill and those of us who want to encourage as much access as possible to the countryside. In that context, I had a useful series of meetings with the Ramblers Association in my constituency on Saturday. It and the landowners are beginning to operate a worthwhile modus vivendi in Wiltshire, which I hope will prove an exemplar to other areas. As I have said on previous occasions, the Bill should seek to avoid confrontation between landowners and those who seek access to the countryside.

<P>
The clause seeks to clarify how people will gain access to access land, which is welcome. It says that if there are stairs, a gate, a stile, or any of the other things specified in paragraphs (a) to (c) that provide access to land, that is reasonable, and we have not tried to change that. That seems a sensible provision to include in a Bill that we have said is unacceptable for other reasons.

<P>
I have two objections to the amendment. First, it is meaningless. The word ``way'' has no technical definition. The hon. Member for Calder Valley (Ms McCafferty) says that it is used elsewhere in the Bill, but, where it is-the Minister may want to clarify this point-it is specifically used as a general term for the means by which one gains access to access land. By contrast, the hon. Lady is not using a general term but is being specific about what she wants to make available.

<P>
Secondly, as I understand it, the hon. Lady means that a track or a path may lead across private land-non-access land-into access land, although, interestingly, she did not give any precise examples. There are three possibilities for such a track. First, it may be a public right of way anyhow. Most people who know the countryside would say that most tracks into moor, downland and heathland would have a right of way on them, in which case there is no need for it to be specified in the Bill. Secondly, it may be a private track. There is no reason why there should be access along a private track. Someone's front drive may fall into that category. Access land may be behind a house, or behind a council house, and there may be a track down the side of the house towards it. Is the hon. Lady really suggesting that the public should be given a right of access down the drive of someone's council house to achieve the access land behind it? I can think of an example in Corsham in my constituency, where there is access land behind some small private houses. The amendment would allow access as of right down people's front drives to achieve access to land.

<P>
The third possibility would be equally unhelpful. As the amendment is drafted, people could gain access to access land down a way-it is an ill-defined term-whether or not there was another means of getting to that access land. The hon. Lady is not saying, ``If this access land is totally inaccessible, but there is one track into it, that track will become an access track,'' but ``If there is any way on to this access land, it must become an access track''. I can think of a number of examples around the country where a large piece of what will now become access land has a road on to it, where people can park and gain access perfectly sensibly through a gate or across a stile, but where other tracks leading into that access land are not open to the public. The hon. Lady is saying that, no matter where the track is and how many other tracks there may be on to the access land, the public must have the right to use it. That would be unacceptable, especially in the case of a private track crossing someone's land-for example, their front drive, as I mentioned earlier-that gave access to land that might anyway have other access to it. It would be an unreasonable intrusion on the privacy of the individual and on the rights of private land ownership to suggest that people could, willy-nilly, go down any track as long as it terminated on a piece of access land.

<P>
The amendment is quite unnecessary, because the Bill already deals with the matter. Proper access will be given to access land; that is the whole point of the Bill. Taken at face value, the amendment would create a further unnecessary intrusion into the rights of private individuals. Rather than leading to the co-operation that is happening very satisfactorily in Wiltshire, as I have described, it would be likely to lead to greater confrontation. I therefore suggest that the Committee should not accept the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley and I understand the objective underlying her amendment. It would allow access authorities to take action to safeguard or create routes leading to access land, even though those routes were not on the access land. Therein lies the difficulty. The amendment refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a way leading to any access land<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
which would, by definition, not be on access land but on cultivated farm land, forestry or other land, such as the driveways of private houses mentioned by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray). It would not be on land to which the new right of access will apply.

<P>
We have often said that the consequences of increased access to our open countryside will be minimal, and that the new statutory right will be compatible with the continued use of the land for other purposes, such as farming and sporting activities. We cannot make the same general assurance in respect of other types of land. The amendment would, for example, allow access authorities to establish paths across intensively farmed land, solely on the basis that the way was necessary to provide reasonable access to the access land beyond. That might be a useful tool in the authority's armoury, but it would be unreasonable. As the hon. Member for North Wiltshire said, it would lead to unreasonable intrusion. Hon. Members have, throughout the Committee's deliberations, been at pains to stress the greater potential impacts of access on the improved, more intensively used lands below the moorland wall, and we understand and respect those concerns.

<P>
We recognise that there will be some areas of access land to which there is inadequate or no access. In such cases, it will be open to access authorities to negotiate access through the creation of permissive paths or new rights of way. In default of agreement, they may seek to create a new public path using their powers under section 26 of the Highways Act 1980. As my hon. Friend rightly predicted, clause 52 provides for the countryside bodies to be able to apply to the Secretary of State, or to the National Assembly for Wales, for a public path creation order under the 1980 Act, precisely for this purpose. That legislation provides for a proper assessment of the merits of the case for a new path. In addition, the woodland grant scheme and the countryside stewardship scheme-Tir Gofal in Wales-already include options for permissive access which could be used to provide links to new access land.

<P>
Where existing public rights of way leading to access land are obstructed, highway authorities have no need of recourse to chapter III. They will be able to apply the existing remedies available to them under highways legislation and common law, which will be considerably enhanced by the improvements effected by part II, to which we shall shortly turn our attention.

<P>
In conclusion, I regret that the amendment, while attractive, goes further than we can accept, and I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> I shall do my best to be gracious in my response.

<P>
Given the problems that are likely to arise in this respect, I should have preferred the Bill to be more precise and definitive. However, I accept my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary's assurance that clause 52 and path creation orders under section 26 of the Highways Act 1980 can be used to alleviate those problems. I am also pleased that common law and the highways legislation can be used to remove obstructions, because that may be necessary in circumstances where landowners are unhappy about the possibility of access.

<P>
In the light of my hon. Friend's assurances that measures are in place to protect ramblers and other users of the land, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 32 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 33</center></H4>
<H4><center>Agreements with respect to means of access</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 483, in page 18, line 21, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) the erection or maintenance of any signs or notices associated with a means of access.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I am confident that the spirit of the amendment will secure agreement from the Ministers, given their attitude to other parts of the Bill. The amendment would ensure that where a new means of access is secured for a piece of access land, people know where it is and how to get to it. That would clearly be sensible, but I am not sure whether the Bill gives the access authorities the power to ensure that it happens. If not, there are three possible ways in which it could be achieved. The first of those would be through the amendment. The second option would be through an interpretation of clause 32. Paragraph (a) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>other works for regulating passage through the opening.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If those words could be construed to include signs that indicate the location of the opening and the means of getting there, the problem would be solved. However, I assume that that would be at the extreme end of a sensible interpretation.

<P>
The third possibility returns us to our discussions on clause 19, when Ministers said that they would be prepared to consider tabling amendments for a general competence on access authorities to provide signage providing helpful information to people who seek access to land. However, that approach could cause difficulties in circumstances where it was necessary to secure access without agreement from the landowner. In such cases, there will be far greater legal pressures to ensure that the authority is acting within a strictly interpreted view of its rights under the Bill. The omission from the clause of any reference to signs and notices means that there is a possibility that that could be challenged.

<P>
If the Under-Secretary can assure me that another part of the Bill contains a means by which signs and notices can be erected under such circumstances, I shall be satisfied. If there is any doubt in his mind that that is the case, he should accept the amendment or table an alternative that would achieve the same end and allow the Bill to do what we all want it to do.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) suggested, we have already discussed clause 19, which will empower access authorities to erect and maintain notices for various purposes. We agreed to consider amendment No. 474, which was tabled by the hon. Gentleman. It would enable access authorities to erect signs dealing with other information, including, we envisage, information on means of access. Access authorities will be able to erect such notices, or agree with landowners and others to pay for, or contribute to, their cost.

<P>
We do not envisage a problem in respect of clause 19, and perhaps we can return to this debate when the Government amendment to it is tabled. In the light of our decision to consider the hon. Gentleman's earlier amendment, I do not believe that there is a need for this amendment, so I hope that he will withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I anticipated such a response from the Under-Secretary, given his helpful intervention on the previous clause. I hope that I am not out of order, Mr. Malins, in saying that, if we do not discuss the matter at this stage, we may need to do so during the clause 35 stand part debate. I am concerned that the access authority should be able to insist for explicit reasons that work to provide access on privately-owned land is carried out. Failure to provide signs or notices could prove a legal obstacle, irrespective of the general power that clause 19 will provide. Under that clause, the power will not be applied to land controlled by the access authority. Moreover, the power will be applied not with the landowner's permission, but in defiance of his or her wishes. That seems a potential obstacle. If the Under-Secretary were to intervene now, we could avoid the need for a discussion during the clause 35 stand part debate, but I note that the Under-Secretary is not seeking to do so. Therefore, we may return to this issue when we consider clause 35, but for the time being, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 428, in page 18, line 31, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The access authority shall have regard to the effect of the carrying out and use of the works or the imposition of the restriction upon the management and viability of the access land and adjoining land in determining whether to exercise its powers under this section'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 429, in page 18, line 31, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The access authority shall have regard to the desirability of preserving and enhancing hedges and dry stone walls in determining whether to exercise its powers under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 401, in clause 35, page 19, line 48, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) The access authority shall have regard to the desirability of preserving and enhancing hedges and dry stone walls in determining whether to exercise its powers under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Amendment No. 428 would establish that it is important that access authorities understand the impact on land management of the creation of the means of access to which chapter III refers. Ministers have frequently said that it is important to understand the role of land management, and, in respect of access land, we have debated that issue in depth and at length. Although not all our amendments have been accepted, we have at least raised and discussed the relevant issues, and I shall not raise again all the issues relating to land management.

<P>
However, as the Under-Secretary said in response to an earlier amendment, the land in question could be cropped land, private land or fenced grazing land, so we need to understand the impact of access on land management. The clause refers to the creation and maintenance of stiles, openings in hedges and gates, and many other matters, but the issue that immediately comes to my mind is stock management. It may be argued that anyone who is considering creating a means of access over land on which livestock may graze will, obviously, ensure that it does not interfere with stock control, and will put in stiles or whatever else is necessary along that line of access. However, that should be stated in the Bill, and amendment No. 428 would require that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The access authority shall have regard to the effect of the carrying out and use of the works  upon the management and viability of the access land and adjoining land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the access authority would ensure that what it proposes is not detrimental to the commercial activity that will be taking place on land across which access to open country is to be provided.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendments Nos. 429 and 401 deal with the need to have regard to hedges and dry stone walls. We have discussed that issue many times. Both features are important and both are at risk from all sorts of threats, so it is essential that the Bill stipulates that the access authority has regard to the desirability of preserving and enhancing those features when deciding how to exercise the powers in the clause. Dry stone walls are in every state of repair, from those that have, unfortunately, tumbled into complete disuse to those that are in pristine condition. It would be tragic if those that are in good condition were to be damaged by an authority's failure to take their existence into account. However much we might wish that those who will exercise their new rights will do so benignly-that will, of course, apply to the vast majority-the sad fact is that there are likely to be some users who will have different intentions. As in every other walk of life, there will be a group of people who will be less desirable, and I do not want to see people using their rights of access as a means of furnishing their garden with materials taken from dry stone walls. That does happen, and we should not kid ourselves that it does not. The need to have regard to the maintenance of the walls should be in the Bill.

<P>
The amendments are not intended to be restrictive, but to ensure that the access authority takes into account all the necessary factors, when deciding how and where to place routes of access to open country.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am no lawyer, but it seems that a single word is central to the clause-perhaps, the lawyers who advise the Government will improve on my inadequate knowledge. The word is ``agreement''. The whole nature of the Bill is to seek agreement between interested parties, as we have said frequently, and the clause deals specifically with an agreement. It does not say that the access authority will have the right to impose anything on the landowner; it merely says that if the access authority believes that access may be necessary, it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may enter into an agreement<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
with the landowner. The clause is permissive, not prescriptive.

<P>
My interpretation is that an agreement is, in straightforward English, a contract, to which there are two parties. If either party does not agree to something, it will not happen. It would be perfectly reasonable for
a landowner to say, ``Thank you for coming along,
Mr. Access Authority. I am grateful to you for raising the difficulty that you see with giving people access to my land, but, I am sorry to say, I do not agree with the conditions that you have suggested. There is no agreement. You may not have access.'' My understanding of the word ``agreement'' is that it is a contract that will be entered into only with the full agreement of both parties to it. I am confident that landowners and access authorities will usually enter into suitable agreements, but it is sensible that the Bill should state as clearly as possible the various matters that might be considered during negotiation of such agreements or contracts between two interested parties.

<P>
I support the amendments because they would require the Bill to specify that, when entering negotiations, which will be the basis of the agreement, consideration should also be given to the management of access land and land adjacent to it. It is important for a farm manager or farmer to be able to say of land that he is sorry, but there is livestock or a dangerous bull on it, or that he is considering what to do with it next year because it is part of a crop rotation system, and so on. It is reasonable that such considerations should form part of the discussions with the access authority.

<P>
I have served on the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs which recently concluded a worrying report on field boundaries. Hedges and dry stone walls are being damaged and destroyed throughout the nation, but especially in England, and it is important that landowners should be able to say that it may not be a good idea to drive access through a wall that has existed for thousands of years or an ancient hedge.

<P>
A farmer in my constituency recently raised an interesting problem with me concerning a right of way. There was apparently an ancient right of way across his fields and one day he discovered that county workmen were chopping a hole in the hedge round a field containing a herd of cows that had recently been taken from the milking parlour after milking. He asked the workmen what they were doing and was told that they were opening up the right of way. He asked what they would do with the gap and they said that they would leave it because it was a right of way. The farmer said, ``What about the cows?'' and the foreman said that they were not his problem. The farmer said that he would put up a fence and was told that he could not do that because it would be on a right of way. The foreman then offered to go back to county hall in Trowbridge and discuss the matter with Wiltshire county council and said that he would return the following week or the week after, but in the meantime would leave the gap in the hedge. That was foolish and I am delighted that Conservative-controlled Wiltshire county council wrote to the farmer and apologised for the ridiculous behaviour of those workmen. None the less, that is an example of what could happen if, when negotiating agreements, proper attention is not given to hedges, dry stone walls and so on. If there are to be negotiated agreements-I should be grateful for clarification of that-it is reasonable to put as much as possible in the Bill with some guidelines to the interested parties entering into the complex negotiations on the sort of areas that they might wish to discuss. I strongly support the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> There is general agreement on the objective underlying the amendments. I am sure that we all agree that the installation of a stile or gate should not have a detrimental effect on the good management of land. Similarly, we would not want work to provide means of access to result in damage to hedges or walls of any sort, including dry stone walls, of course. However, the amendments are unnecessary. Access usually exists already because landowners need access and creating access does not always mean making a hole in something. A stile ladder can provide access over a dry stone wall without touching it.

<P>
Amendment No. 428 would require that, when entering into an agreement with the owner or occupier of access land to secure a means of access, the access authority shall have regard to the effect on the management and viability of the land and adjoining land. As the hon. Member for North Wiltshire said, the key word is ``agreement'': the owner or occupier will presumably enter into an agreement only if they are content with its terms. I should add one rider to that. The access authority is also entitled to say what is reasonable. It is not just a matter for the owner to determine; there must be agreement about what is reasonable. I would expect one of the main issues that they will wish to take into account when considering whether to enter into an agreement to be the effect of a means of access on land management. Indeed, they will be best placed to judge any such effect.

<P>
Amendment No. 429 fulfils a similar purpose in relation to the impact of access on hedges and dry stone walls. I would expect the access authorities to take full account of the possible impact on hedges and walls of creating or improving a means of access, but it is hard to see why the installation of a stile or small gate would have a significant, detrimental effect on hedges or walls. Indeed, walkers would be only too happy to use a clear means of access instead of having to negotiate something that might not be very easy to negotiate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Under-Secretary has skated over the question of providing access over a stone wall or a hedge, suggesting that it would be a simple thing to do. He might like to come and look at one or two hedges in my constituency or that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), where a hedge may be 10 ft high and 12 ft wide, over which the biggest hunter that I could point at it would not consider jumping. Labour Members laugh. Unlike the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), who is so opposed to fox-hunting, I take an active part in hunts, so I know what hedges and walls in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire are like. Some of them are gigantic things over which it would be difficult to build a stile or gate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We have one or two high hedges in the north of England too, so the concept is not entirely unfamiliar to me, although, to judge from the previous debate, council houses in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire have longer drives than ours in Sunderland.

<P>
As I said, these are matters for negotiation between the landowner and the authority, and all reasonable people will recognise that they can be agreed if the will exists.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I realise that what I am about to say slightly undermines what my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire said, but the Bill is not entirely about agreement, because clause 35 gives the authority powers in the absence of an agreement. In other words, it has the power to impose. Therefore, the Bill must ensure, first, that, in the event of clause 35 being put into effect, matters of access land management, hedges and so on are taken into account and considered in the appeals process set out in clause 36.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that such matters will be taken into account. Clause 35 relates to cases where the landowner is thought by the access authority to be unreasonable, but where everybody concerned is being reasonable, there will not be a problem. Clause 35(3) provides for the authority to take into account the efficient management of the land, which will take care of the situation envisaged by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire.

<P>
As I think you know, Mr. Malins, I am in a slight difficulty here. In a moment, I have to go and reply to an Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall.

<P>
Amendment No. 401 would similarly extend clause 35 to include the preservation of hedges and walls. The clause provides that, when an access authority is unable to make an agreement with a landowner, it can serve a notice of intention to carry out work to secure a means of access. We shall say more about clause 35 when we come to the next group of amendments. As with the power to enter into agreements, it is difficult to imagine that an authority would serve a notice without first considering the impact of any works on boundary features. If the person on whom the notice was served believed that it would have a significant detrimental effect, there is provision for an appeal in clause 36, on the grounds that the means of access should be provided elsewhere.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I fully acknowledge the reasonableness of the objective of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, but the matter is catered for elsewhere in the Bill. The amendment is therefore unnecessary, and I should be grateful if he would withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I should like to place on record the fact that anything that enhances stone walls-I now have much experience of them-is worthwhile. Access authorities have a tendency to look at maps and to draw straight lines, but they should establish where the existing gaps are before creating new gaps in walls or hedges. If an existing gap is nearby, its use should be considered before a new gap is made.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I completely agree. In most circumstances, a means of access will be obvious to all reasonable people and no difficulty will arise. I assume that the amendment is directed at those few circumstances in which no obvious means of access exist and when negotiation is necessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> It would be churlish to give a long response to the debate-the Under-Secretary is clearly fidgety and wants to get on with his other duties. I sympathise with him-I shall be in the same position on Thursday, if we sit on Thursday afternoon.

<P>
I appreciate the Under-Secretary's comments. He was right to point out that land management is covered by clause 35, but it would be helpful to deal with it in clause 33-that way, chapter III would have been dealt with fully in one clause. The clause should simply cover examples involving the absence of an agreement.

<P>
On stock control and stock management, an access authority may propose putting a gate across an opening, but, sadly, gates can be-and are-left open accidentally, negligently or intentionally. A landowner may want, for land management reasons-to control his stock-to have a permanent barrier, such as a stile or kissing gate. The Under-Secretary said that good will exists in this context-I hope that that is right. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 430, in page 18, line 31, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The access authority shall defray costs incurred by the owner or occupier in carrying out any works which the agreement provides and pay consideration for the imposition of any restriction.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 431, in page 18, line 34, leave out from ``authority'' to end of line 39.

<P>
No. 402, in clause 35, page 19, line 48, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) The access authority shall compensate the owner or occupier of the land for any loss occasioned by the giving of a notice or copy of a notice under this section or the carrying out of works under subsection (4).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> This important group of amendments will test the Government's good faith, and it continues the debate that we had on the previous group of amendments, when we discussed the differences between the situation that arises when agreement is sought and reached between landowners and the access authority, and that which arises when an access authority is forced to impose a solution. We shall deal with the problems that may arise with such an imposition when we discuss amendments to clause 35.

<P>
This group of amendments would secure fairness when an agreement is reached. Amendment No. 430 would enable the access authority to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>defray costs incurred by the owner or occupier in carrying out any works which the agreement provides and pay consideration for the imposition of any restriction.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
During our deliberations, Ministers have told the Committee that they do not wish to appear anti-landowner or unbalanced in their treatment of landowners. That issue sometimes seems to have divided Ministers from some hon. Members sitting behind them. However, I accept that Ministers are acting in good faith when they say that they want a balanced Bill and an ideal of co-operation to continue to exist in the countryside.

<P>
If this part of the Bill will result in the imposition of new costs on landowners, it should be up to the access authority to pay them. Ministers appear partly to recognise that point. Amendment No. 431 would delete the last part of clause 33, because it would be replaced by amendment No. 430. Ministers admit that agreements could allow access authorities to make a contribution. Such contribution could, if I understand subsection (2)(b)(i) correctly, include the whole cost of any works that had to be carried out. If Ministers accept, in that part of the clause, that it would be right for some or all of the costs to be met by the access authority, we agree with that and propose that that should be the central point of the clause.

<P>
Ministers have repeatedly made the point, whenever potential problems have been brought up by Opposition Members, that the Bill makes provision for people to walk over open land, an activity that will create a relatively trivial disturbance. In most cases, that will certainly be true. Therefore, our case seems all the stronger in arguing that the cost incurred by these relatively trivial disturbances should be met by the access authority that is forcing owners to grant the access. If Ministers are right in their contention that very little disturbance will take place, presumably very little expense will be incurred.

<P>
Accepting the amendment would not, therefore, land Ministers in trouble with their Treasury colleagues, because it would not involve a massive increase in public expenditure. Have the Government given detailed thought to the kind of costs that might be incurred under the provisions? That will be of great interest to the owners and occupiers of the land, who will be making their own calculations-and aggregating them-as to the costs that might be incurred under the provisions. It would be interesting to obtain details of the Government's calculations.

<P>
The underlying point of this group of amendments is to promote fairness, and not to leave owners and occupiers of land feeling that they are being forced not only to allow access but to pay for that privilege. That would increase resentment of the Bill and, in the long run, cause a lack of co-operation and a less smooth introduction of its provisions. I have not spoken in detail on amendment No. 402, which addresses a similar point, in proposing compensation for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any loss occasioned by the giving of a notice  or the carrying out of works under subsection (4).<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is another way in which costs can be imposed on landowners.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will treat the amendments in the spirit in which they were tabled. They would remove a potential cause of resentment and lack of co-operation among those who will be at the sharp end.

<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I support the amendments, which are entirely reasonable. Again, the debate essentially concerns the use of ``may'' and ``shall''.

<P>
I should like to ask the Minister three questions. First, is giving the access authority the power to defray part of the expense meant to be a carrot to ensure agreement between the landowner and the authority? I ask that because there is no similar provision in clause 35, which refers to the access authority being unable to reach agreement and therefore going ahead and ordering the work to be done. As a fundamental principle, it is unreasonable for a landowner to have to spend hard-earned money to provide various forms of access, at the behest of a distant authority, if it is possible that none of it will be defrayed. I accept that expenditure may be necessary to allow for proper access. However, it surely follows, as day follows night, that the person who incurs the expenditure should have it defrayed in full, because it is a charge on his or her income.

<P>
Secondly, can the Minister tell the Committee what is meant by the imposition of any restriction? Are the Government acknowledging that the exercise of these rights will involve restrictions? If so, we are back to the debate about whether the landowner's rights will be curtailed, whether he should receive compensation, and whether his land has been devalued. That would be in stark contrast to what we are constantly told about the Bill being concerned merely with the right to traverse land, with no disturbance or restriction to animals and no effect on the landowner. Will the Minister give an exact definition of the word ``restriction''?

<P>
Thirdly, I echo what has been said about the costs involved. Can the Minister give an estimate of those costs?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> In my remarks on the previous group of amendments, I expressed warmth towards the Bill's use of the word ``agreement''-which I assumed meant that it would be possible for landowners and walkers not to reach an agreement-and the Minister nodded and smiled in assent. Unfortunately, my speaking notes were placed on top of clause 35, and it was only during the subsequent remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) that I realised that the word ``agreement'' in clause 33 is entirely misleading. If an agreement is not reached under clause 33, the access authority has the power to proceed anyway under clause 35. That is like pointing a large gun at someone's head and saying, ``Please give me your wallet. We can do this by mutual agreement, but if you don't agree, I reserve the right to blow your brains out.''

<P>
The amendment makes a great deal of sense. On the question of ``shall'' and ``may'', clause 33 requires that the access authority shall pay compensation for necessary work to be carried out. I shall not repeat the remarks that Committee members have made in support of that important principle, which we have discussed previously in respect of other parts of the Bill. However, I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to a conundrum that arises from the juxtaposition of clauses 33 and 35. If, under clause 33, no agreement were reached, and the landowner says, ``I will not do this work, and you may not have access, because no money has been proposed'', due notice would be given by the access authority within 28 days, in accordance with clause 35. The work would then be done, and the issue of who should pay would not be open to question: the access authority would pay.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Landowners are being told, ``Whatever you do, do not enter into a voluntary agreement with access authorities, because you may have to pay the cash.'' Unless the word ``shall'' is used, there may be such agreements, and the landowner may have to pay. Even if a landowner were content for, say, a gate or stile to be installed, he could refuse and invite the access authority to serve notice. As a result, within 28 days, the access authority would carry out that work free of charge. That seems a perverse incentive for the clauses to provide, and I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with it in his response.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want again to delve into the exact meaning of subsection (2)(b)(1), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a contribution towards, or for the purpose of defraying, costs incurred by the owner.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) wisely pointed out, implies that not all costs will be paid. Will immediate and future loss of income be paid for? Loss of income could result from the extra farming costs that the clause will incur, and one could cite many other such examples. When the Minister responds to our amendments, which I fully support, I should be grateful if he would enlarge on the meaning of subsection (2)(b)(1).

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I realise that the Opposition have tabled serious amendments that reflect a real concern about where the balance of costs should lie. As I have said, and as the hon. Member for Ashford acknowledged, we genuinely want to encourage constructive dialogue between landowners and access authorities on the need or desire for means of access, and the terms on which they are provided. An authority may well be prepared to offer to pay all costs associated with a new means of access. However, in practice, certain means of access will assist landowners' own purposes, and it is only fair for landowners to pay part of those costs in such circumstances.

<P>
If an access authority is not particularly concerned whether a means of access is installed, or is not convinced that facilities requested by the landowner are justified, it will be able to offer a contribution towards the costs. For example, if a landowner has requested a new five-bar gate, the authority could offer to pay for a stile. The landowner need not agree to that, but I should tell the hon. Member for North Wiltshire that reaching agreement wherever possible is important under the Bill. If the landowner does not agree, the authority would need to decide whether to serve a notice and carry out any necessary works itself.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 430 and 431 would change the focus of the clause and, with it, the thinking behind chapter III. The clause is intended to allow agreements to be made on terms that are satisfactory to both parties. As the hon. Member for North Wiltshire rightly said, agreements are made only if both parties agree. We envisage that in some cases where agreements are made the authority may choose to defray all the costs, but in other cases parties will agree to share the costs of a new or improved means of access.

<P>
I am not entirely sure about the purpose behind amendment No. 402. Under any notice served under clause 35, the authority would have to carry out any works involved and to pay any costs incurred, which was the point that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire was making. However, we do not believe that the provision of a means of access will itself give rise to any loss that merits compensation being paid. That appears to be the thrust of the amendment.

<P>
We fully accept that, when it is justified, all the costs will be defrayed by the authority, but as that will not always apply, provision should be made to ensure that costs are shared, when appropriate. I hope that that is acceptable.

<P>
<B>Several hon. Members:</B> rose-

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I can see that other hon. Members wish to intervene.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Minister confirm that if a genuine case for loss of income is made as a result of the clause, compensation will be paid?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> As I said, it depends on whether the loss of income is strictly and wholly necessary to achieve reasonable means of access. If it is for purposes that go beyond that and serve the landowner's interests, the landowner would be expected to make some contribution.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister, but I do not think that he has addressed the problem of the perverse incentive provided by clauses 33 and clause 35. Under clause 33 the landowner will agree to make a contribution only if he is asking for something greater than what the access authority wants-as the Minister rightly said, if it is a gate instead of a stile. The landowners will wish to enter into an agreement so that he can then make a contribution towards the gate. However, if the landowner has no interest in changing the appearance of his field-why should he, when he has had it for many years-and only the access authority wants the change, the Bill gives the landowner an incentive to say, ``Even if I am perfectly content to do it, I won't do it by agreement. There will be some benefit to me if I leave it to you lot to do it, because it will then be entirely free of charge and there need be no agreement. Carry on and do as you want.''

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks why the landowner should make an agreement in the first place. An agreement offers the landowner an opportunity to achieve some benefit from the installation of a means of access that he might not get from works carried out by a notice-for example, a gate where the authority would otherwise install a stile, which could be used for moving stock or equipment. Therefore, the landowner has an incentive to agree, if he thinks it is reasonable and in his interest.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> The right hon. Gentleman did not deal with the word ``restriction'' or, if he did, perhaps I missed it. Secondly, what is the Government's estimate of the overall cost of implementing the provision?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Yes, the hon. Gentleman raised those points, and I am sorry that I did not respond in my earlier comments.

<P>
First, the phrase ``the imposition of restrictions'' is intended to refer to restrictions on the prevention of use of a means of access-for example, not to provide a padlock for a gate or to remove a stile. It is not a restriction on use of the land. That is the key point.

<P>
The cost of providing means of access is, of course, provisional and, in the current spending round, the Department has made a bid for adequate resources to cover the requirements of the Bill. Consultants have estimated that the total cost to the public sector, including access authorities, will be between 2 million and 2.5 million a year, with one-off costs of 6.5 million. The costs include the provision of stiles and gates. That is as far as I can take it, at this stage. The figures are approximate-experience would suggest that they might turn out to be slightly different-but we see them as being of a reasonable order of magnitude.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Minister's response to my remarks on the relationship between clause 35 and clause 33 reveals the Government's curious understanding of how the Bill will work. He is now saying that, if it is to the advantage of the landowner, there should be an agreement. That is a perfectly sensible point. The Minister's point about the provision of gates, as opposed to stiles, is not unreasonable. If the landowner will gain from it, he might well see the advantage of having part of the cost of a five-bar gate paid by the access authority, in return for his granting access.

<P>
We must assume, however, that most owners will have been in possession of their land for many years and will already have in place the gates that they need for access for stock and other purposes. I do not know of many fields that do not have access for stock. It would, indeed, be a peculiar field into which a farmer was unable to get his livestock, his tractor or his combine harvester, but, if such a field exists, perhaps the Minister could tell us where it is. None the less, I accept the point that, if there is advantage to the landowner in so doing, there will be an agreement as envisaged in clause 33.

<P>
We must assume, however, that, in most cases, there will be no advantage to the landowner. The landowner may be content with his land as it is, but the Bill requires him to do something extra to provide access. There will be no advantage for him in doing so. In such cases, the landowner will be incentivised not to enter into an agreement, even if he would, otherwise, be content to do so. He will know that, unless the word ``may'' is changed to ``shall'' in clause 33, he can say, ``I will not agree to it. I shall tell you privately, over a pint, that I do not mind what you are proposing, you access authority gents, but there is a financial incentive for me to say that I do not want it and that I will not make an agreement, because I know that you will come back in 28 days' time and impose it. You will pay-100 per cent., VAT and everything else-no questions asked.'' The Minister is sending out a message to landowners throughout the country that, if they do not want to provide access, or if, for example, they do not really require an extra five-bar gate-although it might be useful in some circumstances-they need not, under any circumstances, enter into an agreement. There is a powerful financial incentive for them not to do so; they can ask the access authority to pay for it.

<P>
In a Bill that is supposed to be based on agreement and consensus, that is a peculiar situation. We can put it right by inserting the word ``shall'' into clause 33, in place of ``may''. That would mean that the access authorities could be told, ``You will do it. It is not a question of `may'-you will have to consider how to defray the costs borne by the landowner in providing access.'' The amendment would rectify what seems to me, if my reading of the Bill is correct, to be a curious imbalance in how it will work.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has read the Bill, but he has interpreted it mistakenly. The perverse incentive that he discussed does not exist. When an agreement is reached with a landowner, the access authority may agree to defray 100 per cent. of the cost. To that extent, the landowner has no incentive to refuse to come to an agreement or to insist that a clause 35 order be used. Our view is that there are circumstances in which the landowner will gain significantly. It is reasonable that, as part of an agreement, he should be expected to contribute some of the costs. If he does not agree, it is up to the authority to use a clause 35 order, in which case it is highly likely that it will cover all of the costs relating to the agreement or order. There is no incentive on the landowner to refuse to come to an agreement-he can achieve all that he is likely to gain through an agreement rather than by having an order imposed on him.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> That of course would be the case if the word ``shall'' rather than the word ``may'' were used. Local authorities are always under financial pressure, and they will attempt to reduce the amount of money that they spend on providing access. The only reason for using the word ``may'' is to let them do so. They will say, ``I shall provide access, which will be of benefit to you, although negotiations may be involved.''

<P>
The Bill says to landowners across the land, ``Whatever you do, don't enter into an agreement. Let the authority take action and pay for everything.'' The Under-Secretary displayed a rather curious use-or misuse-of language: he said that it is likely that under clause 35 the access authority will pay. Under that clause, the access authority will be required to-it is not ``likely'' to-pay all of the costs. It might pay for them under clause 33. The financial constraints from which authorities suffer mean that they are unlikely to comply willingly. They will seek to persuade the landowner that he will benefit from that approach.

<P>
I am grateful to Committee members for indulging us in our discussion of this curious conundrum. When landowners in my constituency ask me about the matter, I shall say, ``Whatever you do, do not enter into an agreement. Take the compulsory route under clause 35.''

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We have tilled or ploughed this subject to exhaustion. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that under clause 35 the authority will have to pay the full costs, but-I repeat-he is not right to say that there is an inbuilt or perverse incentive on landowners not to come to an agreement under clause 33. In most instances, they can still have all of the costs defrayed. In such instances, they have no incentive to refuse to come to an agreement or to provoke the access authority to impose an order.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Presumably, if a landowner enters into negotiation and is offered something, and the access authority says that it will pay half of the costs, it is in the landowner's interests to say, ``Okay, fine. If that is what you want, you pay for it. I shall not enter into an agreement.'' That is what my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire was arguing. Although I take the Minister's point that the landowner may want a gate and that an access authority may think that a stile is adequate, there will be circumstances in which the authority agrees on the appropriate mode of access. But as the Bill is drafted, there is therefore no incentive on the landowner to reach an agreement. The way in which the clause interacts with clause 35 may mean that the Government have built a perverse incentive into the Bill.

<P>
I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for the tone of his response and for his reassurance that the Government are seeking to co-operate as far as possible with those who live and work on the land. He will be aware that the terms of the engagement between landowners and access authorities will be key to establishing an atmosphere of co-operation. I was interested in his suggestion that some of the demands of access authorities will be helpful to landowners. One feels, that, if they were helpful, the landowners would be doing them anyway, rather than waiting for the access authority to come riding to the rescue. That image has not occurred in any conversation that I have had with landowners or their representatives while considering the Bill.

<P>
However, most serious is the slight slithering that I detect in what the Minister has said. Access authorities ``may'' do this and ``may'' do that, and they will be urged to defray costs when they feel that that is appropriate. The Minister will be aware, living in the real world as he does, that the authorities will be stretched and will not seek new ways to spend money. They are, therefore, unlikely to want to defray any more costs than they can get away with. That is how public bodies are run. The idea that agreements will, as a matter of habit, be reached in which 100 per cent. of the costs are defrayed by the authority is a chimera: it is unlikely to happen in practice.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that in circumstances in which no agreement can be reached, there should be a mechanism for determining the proportion of cost that should be borne by each side?

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed. I suspect that some kind of appeal mechanism or arbitration will need to be incorporated. That would create an added expense, in terms of time and money, for the authorities and landowners. A better way to spend that relatively small sum of money could be to accept the amendments, and eliminate the possibility of conflict in negotiation, arbitration and so on. It would be better to spend the money on improving access to the land.

<P>
Another interesting point in the Minister's reply related to the costings that he gave, which were those calculated for the public sector. I do not know whether his Department or any of its consultants have estimated the cost of the clause to the private sector. If so, we should be interested to hear it. If not, one might assume that the sum of a few million pounds, with rather larger one-off costs, could be replicated in the private sector.

<P>
In the light of the current state of the agricultural industry, such additional costs would be most unwelcome and could be the source of further conflict in the countryside. That would be a problem for the Government that need not keep Opposition Members awake at night. More seriously, it would be a genuine problem for those working on the land. The extra impositions being introduced by the Bill are ill-timed. The amendments raise important issues, to which we may wish to return at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) An appeal against a notice under section 34(1) may be brought on any of the following grounds-

<P>
(a) that the notice requires the carrying out of any works which are not required by the agreement,

<P>
(b) that any of the works have already been carried out,

<P>
(c) that the required time has not expired, and

<P>
(d) that the notice was not given as required under section 34.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Clause 34 begins to move into cases where agreement is not reached, and clauses 35 and 36 take that further. The amendments are designed to address points of concern relating to those clauses.

<P>
Amendment No. 432 is a narrow amendment to ensure that the person who is paying all or part of the costs of the items that we have just discussed will be given the notice under the clause, which is headed ``Failure to comply with the agreement''. I know that the Minister will say that the owner or occupier will have to receive the notice because he will almost certainly be the person who will pay. That will not always be so, although I accept that it will be in 99 per cent. of cases. For the sake of clarity, it would be sensible to insert the provision that the person who pays for the item must be served with the necessary notice.

<P>
Amendment No. 398 would require the notice served under clause 34 to contain a note explaining what the law is under these clauses and explaining the right of appeal under clause 36, if one exists. I shall return to that in a moment. The amendment is self-explanatory. It is designed to ensure that whoever is affected by one of the notices served under the clause is given the information. It is akin to the outcome of a planning applicant. If a planning application is refused-I know that it is not the same, but the results are the same-the council must not only give reasons for its refusal but set out the applicant's rights to appeal. Amendment No. 398 is designed to address that point.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 403, 404 and 405 are either consequential to or logically follow the others, but amendment No. 406 to clause 36 breaks new ground. It would add the right of appeal against a notice under clause 34(1). As drafted, the Bill provides for an appeal against clause 34(3), which relates to the failure to observe any restriction required by an agreement, and allows an appeal against clause 35(1), which relates to the provision of access by the access authority in the absence of agreement.

<P>
But clause 34(1) provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the owner or occupier of any access land fails to carry out within the required time any works which he is required  to carry out, the access authority, after giving not less than twenty-one days' notice of their intention to do so, may take all necessary steps for carrying out those works.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It seems odd that there is no right of appeal against that. Therefore, amendment No. 406 asks the Government why they are not providing grounds for appeal against that subsection, and sets out the four areas where we believe there are grounds for appeal. The key point is that it would establish the right of appeal under subsection (1).

<P>
Three of the amendments-amendments Nos. 432, 398 and 406-are of some significance, and the others follow on from those. If the Minister will not agree to the amendments, will he explain why the appeal is not as proposed in amendment No. 406 and explain the relatively minor issues contained in amendments
No. 432 and 398, which are key, if we are to achieve the good will between the access authority and owners and occupiers to which my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire and others have referred several times this morning?

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We have gone to considerable lengths to ensure that provisions in chapter III relating to the ability of access authorities to serve notice of an intention to carry out works are backed by reasonable appeal provisions. The hon. Gentleman spelled out clearly the rationale behind the amendments, and I commend his ingenuity in making it clear that there is no right of appeal under subsection (1). I shall try to explain why, and to respond positively to amendments Nos. 398 and 403.

<P>
As the hon. Gentleman implied, the clause deals with circumstances where an owner or occupier has failed to carry out works, as specified in an agreement, relating to the creation or improvement of a means of access. Under the clause, an access authority may serve a notice of its intention to take the steps necessary for carrying out the works. Amendment No. 432 would require that the notice be served on the person who would have incurred the cost of carrying out such works under the agreement. However, the Bill already provides that a notice should be served on the party who entered into the agreement and who would, therefore, incur the cost of the works. For that reason, amendment No. 432 is not necessary. In raising that issue, I am emphasising a point made by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 398 and 403 propose that any notice served under the clause should explain the provisions in chapter III and the provisions for appeal. As the hon. Gentleman noted, under the Bill, a notice must state the authority's intention to carry out works in not fewer than 21 days' time. As a matter of good practice, we would expect the authority to explain what the landowner must do if he wishes to appeal. Nevertheless, I accept that the amendments raise the legitimate question of whether, in serving notices under clauses 34 or 35, access authorities should be required to inform recipients of their right of appeal. As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire rightly said, such a requirement applies in respect of planning matters, and it would not be unreasonable to make a similar provision here. Although we cannot accept amendments Nos. 398 and 403 as they stand, I should like to consider them further. In other words, I am taking on board the point that was made and, subject to further consideration, we will bring forward our own proposals.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 404, 405 and 406 concern the lack of a provision for appeal against a notice served under subsection (1). I pay tribute to the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire for his attempts to probe, because it is not immediately clear why there is no such provision. The key point, which we have already discussed, is the nature of the agreements. Such agreements relate to the carrying out of specific works such as the erection of a certain means of access in a certain place. A notice of intention to carry out works to remedy a breach of the agreement could apply only in respect of works required by the original agreement. Any dispute can be resolved in the normal way, if necessary, through the civil courts. As such, it would be neither necessary nor appropriate for provision to be made for appeals to the Secretary of State or the National Assembly under subsection (1).

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman should listen to what I am about to say, because I am about to point out a significant difference.

<P>
By way of comparison, subsection (3) will give access authorities the power to serve notices on landowners who have failed to comply with a restriction to which they have previously agreed-for example, not to block a given means of access. If the means of access is subsequently blocked, the authority may have more than one course of action open to it. The works required may not be immediately obvious from the terms of the agreement. In those circumstances, it is right that the landowner should be able to appeal to the Secretary of State if he thinks that the action proposed by the authority is inappropriate. It is also right that there should be grounds for appeal where an authority proposes to carry out works in the absence of any agreement with the landowner.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire recognises the important difference between the circumstances that I have described.

<P>
<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): I might be missing something, but can the Minister explain the extent to which landowners, in reaching an agreement, will be consulted on the nature and extent of the work that is to be performed?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Their agreement with the access authority will be based on the action that needs to be taken to ensure a means of access, what that means of access shall be, and where it shall be placed, or on the need to remove any restrictions on a right of access. There is no question about that.

<P>
I hope that I have persuaded the hon. Gentleman that the provisions for appeal in relation to notices are reasonable. As I have explained, different circumstances will be involved. With the possible exception of requiring access authorities, under clauses 34 and 35, to inform recipients of their right of appeal, further provision for appeals is unnecessary. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I thank the Minister for his constructive approach to amendments Nos. 398 and 403. As I have said on countless occasions, we do not claim the wisdom of Solomon in drafting amendments. They may not, strictly speaking, be technically correct, but at least the Minister has accepted their underlying principle, and I welcome that. In respect of amendment No. 432, the Minister has explained his view that it is unnecessary.

<P>
The Minister undertook to explain the difference between subsections (1) and (3). I understand his point that the authority may require works that are unreasonable or unnecessary to be carried out to undo a failure to observe a restriction, and that therefore the right of appeal should exist. I accept the explanation, but still do not follow the logic. Under subsection (1), if the owner or occupier voluntarily makes an agreement to do something and fails to do it, they will have no appeal against the notice that is served as a result. Under subsection (3), if they fail to observe a restriction under an agreement, they are-rightly-given the right of appeal. It is illogical to say to someone, ``If you do not do what you have agreed to do, you will have the right to appeal, but if you fail to do it in another case, you will not have the right to appeal''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Is it not particularly illogical in view of our discussion on the previous group of amendments, which established that a landowner will enter into an agreement only if there is an advantage to him in doing so? He would therefore need to appeal only if, for some reason, the workings of the agreement appeared to go against his leave of appeal in the first place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The point is that the situation may change in the time between the making of the agreement and the carrying out of the works, or the end of the time scale, with the result that the landowner wants to change the agreement. I come back to the central issue: either a man's word is his bond, which I am happy with, although I accept the grounds for appeal in subsection (3), or it is not. It does not seem logical that in one case it is and in another it is not, which seems to be the gist of what the Minister was saying, although I accept that there is scope under subsection (3) for extra work and costs to be incurred that are not in subsection (1).

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think that I can assist the hon. Gentleman. There is a difference between the two cases. If there is an agreement between the access authority and the owner or occupier, it is for specific work to be done. If that specific work is not done, the matter can be resolved in the normal way through the courts. If, however, the agreement is breached in a way that enables not a single agreed course of action but several options for remedying the breach, that is a different situation, and the landowner should have a right of appeal if he believes that the option chosen by the access authority is unreasonable. Those two different situations show that there should not be a right of appeal in the first case but that in the second it is justified.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the matter further. I still think that there is some illogicality in an owner or occupier who has made an agreement to do something having to carry the can for failing to do so, whereas if they fail to observe the restrictions in subsection (3), with the inevitable consequences, which they should consider when they fail to observe the restriction, they will have the right of appeal.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> There may be good reasons why an owner or occupier, having made an agreement, fails to carry it out in the time specified-for example, if he is ill. In such circumstances there should be a right of appeal against the notice being served.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend adds another aspect, with which I entirely concur. However, it is clear that the Government have given the matter a great deal of thought, as the Minister said. I shall have to consider with my colleagues whether we believe that he has entirely convinced us, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 399, in page 19, line 32, leave out ``owner'' and insert ``owners''.

<P>
No. 400, in page 19, line 33, leave out ``occupier'' and insert ``occupiers''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The clause provides for a procedure whereby a means of access to access land can be directly secured or safeguarded by an access authority, where the owner or occupier is unwilling to enter into an agreement for this purpose.

<P>
Before an access authority can have recourse to the clause, paragraph (1)(b) requires that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the access authority are unable to make an agreement with the owner or occupier of the land.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It might be argued that the authority is prevented from taking action if the owner is willing to enter into any agreement, however inappropriate. For example, the owner might say, ``Yes, I will retain this gateway, if you pay me 10,000 a year''. Amendment No. 457 makes it clear that any such agreement must be on terms that appear to the authority to be reasonable. The drafting of the amendment is consistent with the wording of new section 281(2) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which is inserted by schedule 9, and provides that English Nature may not serve a management notice unless it has been unable to conclude an agreement with the owner or occupier on terms that appear to them to be reasonable. That is the rationale behind amendment No. 457. I shall leave it to the hon. Member for Ashford to speak to amendments Nos. 399 and 400.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Government amendment No. 457, addresses an important issue. I take the Minister's point that he was worried that any agreement, however apparently ludicrous, would be an agreement under the original wording and would therefore set in play the procedures covered by the clause, but the Government seem to have gone too far in the other direction and are making the authority judge and jury in its own case. Apart from anything else, to say that the authority can decide that the landowner is asking for too much money and then to set it up as the arbiter to decide whether the terms are reasonable clearly offends the canons of natural justice. If the Government wish to insert an arbitration procedure into the Bill, the amendment should propose that, but it does not do so. Therefore, the procedure will be longer and more legalistic.

<P>
If a landowner or occupier thinks that he or she is making a reasonable attempt at an agreement and has a straightforward disagreement with the authority, which will happen in practice, and then discovers that the authority has the power to declare ``No, no, we're being reasonable, so this agreement stands'', presumably he or she will have to have recourse to the courts to appeal against that.

<P>
Many of the more distinguished lawyers on the Committee are not present, and the Minister and I are in the happy position of not being among them, but the Government amendment seems to be a lawyers' charter. It will increase the confrontation that will come about if agreement cannot be reached and make the proceedings more legalistic. If the Government wish to insert an arbitration procedure between landowners and access authorities, they should draft one which is cheaper and simpler and does not weight the scales outrageously in one direction, as the amendment does, almost inevitably leading to greater recourse to the courts.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 399 and 400 raise the simple, practical point that there will be cases where there are joint owners or several occupiers of one piece of land. The amendments would make the clause more all-embracing and therefore more practical. They are simply attempts to tidy up the drafting of the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I want briefly to address the Government's amendment, because I share some of the reservations expressed by the hon. Member for Ashford, not that the Government have chosen to reword the original provision. I understand what the Minister said about the difficulty of interpreting the present arrangement and the opportunity that it gives to a recalcitrant landowner to state that an offer had been made, however unreasonable that offer might be. However, the amendment, which requires the authority itself to determine whether it is satisfied that the terms are reasonable, does not provide for an objective test that might provide the ground for an appeal under clause 36. If the Government want to make the amendment, they should ensure that it is possible to make such an appeal to the Secretary of State, on the basis that the authority had misdirected itself, either about the degree to which it is satisfied with the offer or about whether the offer is reasonable. Otherwise, the matter will, inevitably, end up in court for a judicial review. That is not the course that we should take.

<P>
Had the amendment been worded in such a way as to provide an objective test of whether the terms of the proposed agreement were reasonable-a district auditor could be brought in to do it-it would be a different matter. As it is, the access authority will have to decide whether it is satisfied and whether the terms on which it was unable to make an agreement were reasonable? Neither of those decisions can be challenged under clause 36. The drafting is inadequate, and the Minister should reconsider it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The more that we discuss clause 35, the more puzzled I am. I thought that we had established, in our discussion on clauses 33 and 35, that the only reason for a landowner to enter into an agreement was that he believed that he would be achieving something-some improvement to his land-that he would not otherwise achieve. That might be, for example, a contribution from the access authority towards the renewal of a gate. Incidentally, I suspect that most farmers will delay repairing gates until the legislation comes into effect. They have a huge incentive not to enter into an agreement and, thus, get the access authority to pay for the repair.

<P>
It is likely that landowners will see little advantage in entering into agreements and will be content to leave it to the authority to pay for means of access. If that is the case, and in the light of our discussion about the precise meaning of the word ``agreement'', in which the Minister agreed that it meant a contract freely entered into by two parties after negotiation, it will be reasonable for a landowner to say that he has no interest in entering into such an agreement. There is no requirement that he should do so. The word ``agreement'' implies that no party is making unreasonable demands. It would, of course, be unreasonable for me to say to someone that I wanted to go to bed with his wife and offer to pay him 1 in order to do so. If, however, I said that I would give him 1 million, that would, as Churchill remarked famously, be a different matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The principle would be established.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> As my hon. Friend says, the principle would be established. What I am saying is that, if either party makes an unreasonable demand, agreement will not be reached.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> For the purposes of historical accuracy and to defend the reputation of one of the most distinguished Prime Ministers in the history of this country, I must say that it was, I think, George Bernard Shaw who made that famous offer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for putting me right. However, I am confident that Churchill would have said it, had he thought of it first.

<P>
So, the point is established. The wording of subsection (1)(b) is clear. If the parties cannot come to an agreement, there will be no agreement, and the access authority will have to provide the access itself. I am puzzled about what lies behind the amendment. I might be thought cynical and curious for wondering whether the Government are thinking about a possible court case, in which it would fall to a judge to interpret the meaning of clause 35. The Government may wish to insert something to suggest that it is more incumbent on the landowner to reach an agreement than the Bill would suggest. To insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on terms appearing to them to be reasonable<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
is tautological. Agreement, by definition, means that the terms appear to be reasonable. If the terms do not appear to the parties to be reasonable, they will not reach agreement. The amendment is otiose and adds nothing to my interpretation of the clause, but perhaps the Government have another reason for wishing to insert those words. The only reason for it that I can imagine is that they have taken legal advice and that it suggests that if the interpretation of the clause came before the courts, those words might make the magistrate more inclined to find in favour of the access authority than the landowner.

<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would let us know the precise meaning of the word ``agreement'' and whether there can be an agreement under any circumstances, anywhere in the world, if both parties do not believe the terms to be reasonable. I do not have a dictionary with me, but my understanding is that an agreement, by definition, requires that. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether he has taken legal advice on how the clause might be interpreted were it to come before the courts?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I, too, find the amendment somewhat curious because it seems to disturb the delicate balance of reasonableness and a light-handed approach that the Minister has been so careful to portray throughout our discussion of the Bill. It would be best in normal circumstances if there were agreement and that is less likely with amendment No. 457. I cannot understand why the Government are making the access authority judge and jury in their own cause. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire may be right and that it concerns the possibility of loss of income if creating access causes an owner or occupier of land to manage that land differently-for example, being unable to keep a bull on a piece of access land. I wonder whether the reason for the amendment is that the Government are worried about claims for loss of income. It is incumbent on the Minister to explain why he is discouraging landowners and occupiers from coming to an agreement.

<P>
I am no lawyer, but the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome raised an interesting point. If the matter came to judicial review, the only grounds for the judge to consider would be not whether a claim for costs was reasonable, but whether the access authority had grounds for believing that it was reasonable to create the access. Those would be the only grounds that he could consider on judicial review. He would not be able to consider any representations from the owner, occupier or their agents representing him. The amendment is a sledgehammer to crack a nut and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman's final point that this is a relatively minor clarification. I do not know whether it is a sledgehammer to crack a nut, but I cannot help feeling that, unusually in our proceedings, a cloud of suspicion verging on paranoia is beginning to influence Opposition Members.

<P>
Before dealing with amendment No, 457, I shall not make hay, but I shall enjoy giving the explanation for rejecting amendments Nos. 399 and 400 because I find it amusing. The amendments would substitute for ``owner'' and ``occupier'' in clause 35(1)(b) the plural of the same. The hon. Gentleman may be interested to learn that, under the Interpretation Act 1978, no less, and paradoxical as it might seem, the singular can include the plural and the plural can include the singular. The amendments would therefore have no material consequence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> While the hon. Gentleman was temporarily away from his place, a great sigh of relief went round the Committee Room because no distinguished lawyers were present, and we made good progress. Does the hon. Gentleman want to discuss singularity and plurality?

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> No.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> When there is an occupier and a separate owner of the land in question, the access authority will need to negotiate with whoever is in a position to provide, maintain or safeguard the means of access. If the means of access is located on land and is in the ownership of different parties, it will need to negotiate with all of those parties.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Will the Minister confirm that for the purposes of the clause, male embraces female?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am happy to give that assurance. The gradual, steady and unstoppable rise of feminism during the previous 20 or 30 years is pre-dated by the terminology in some statutes, which has not yet caught up with modern parlance. The hon. Lady is unquestionably right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Clause 35(1)(b) begins: ``the access authority are'', which suggests that the authority is plural. Is that correct, or should the clause state: ``the access authority is''? If the plural is correct, we should consider clause 34(6), which begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>where the access authority carries.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That suggests that the authority is singular. Is it singular or plural, and if it is plural, is not the Bill inconsistent?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman's ingenuity knows no bounds. He is right-there appears to be an inconsistency. The verb following access authority appears in both the singular and the plural. However, the fact that either can reflect the other suggests that the hon. Gentleman's point does not really matter. Opposition Members have rather over-egged this point.

<P>
I turn to a more substantive matter. The provision amendment replicates language that was used in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 which was passed by a Conservative Administration. I do not say that in order to be polemical. Schedule 9 amends section 28 of the 1981 Act and new section 28I(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where it appears to the Nature Conservancy Council that  an owner or occupier of land is not giving effect to a provision of a management scheme  they may if they think fit serve a notice on him.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
New section 28I(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>They may not serve a management notice unless they are satisfied that they are unable to conclude, on terms appearing to them to be reasonable, an agreement with the owner or occupier as to the management of the land in accordance with the management scheme.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Similar provisions have been on the statute book for
20 years. To my knowledge, they have not caused any difficulty and are perfectly reasonable. The Bill simply replicates a phrase that exists in statute.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> Is that matter a proper consideration for appeal? If it is the basis on which a judgment is made, it should be subject to an appeal by the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall come to that, but before I do I must observe that, in our short debate on this matter, the hon. Gentleman said that the provision's wording was unfair to landowners, and the hon. Member for North Wiltshire said that it was a marvellous get-out for landowners. They cannot both be right-in fact, neither of them is. It is clearly implied that the authority will have to take a responsible view of any agreement. If the parties fail to reach an agreement, a notice may be served. However, as the hon. Member for North Wiltshire has rightly, and frequently, pointed out, the local authority must pay all costs, so there will be a financial disincentive for moving unnecessarily to the use of an order. Nevertheless, there is a constraint on the access authority, in that the landowner can appeal against the works involved. For that reason, I believe that the provision is fair and balanced.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister makes the precise point: the landowner may appeal against the works, but not the costs. Clearly, if he is not to be paid an adequate amount for doing the work, he will let the authority do it instead. That point has been made many times by my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> There is an appeal against the works-

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The cost.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We have already discussed that issue ad nauseam under the previous clause, and it is true that the access authority would be liable for the costs. However, the point that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire repeatedly made concerned a perverse incentive for the landowner to refuse to reach an agreement, so that costs would lie with the access authority. I took pains to point out that that will not be the case. The landowner has an interest in reaching an agreement because he will get a better deal. Were an order to be imposed on him, it might include terms that were extremely unhelpful in comparison with an agreement.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Minister's last statement is the crux of the matter. In respect of clause 35, clause 36 will not provide grounds for appeal on the basis that an agreement could have been reached. The landowner will not be able to say, ``There was a perfectly good agreement on the table that was to my and the access authority's advantage, but the authority acted unreasonably by saying that it was determined instead to carry out the works under its own terms.'' My point is simply that, if that is to constitute grounds for appeal on which the Secretary of State can arbitrate, the new provision in the Government amendment should be included under clause 36(3).

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I give way to the Minister.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am becoming confused about whether this is intervention or a speeach. I call Mr. Green.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I hate to cut off the Minister in his prime, but I am sure that he will get another chance. I thank him for his explanation of singularity and plurality. If for no other reason, it was worth attending this morning's debate to discover that there is an Interpretation Act 1978. That is today's fascinating fact.

<P>
The Minister says that the amendment simply replicates the wording of the 1981 Act. I do not find that reassuring, because the Bill's purpose is, in part, to improve the 1981 Act, which we all accept needs updating. More important, the context in which the wording was used in the 1981 Act is very different from that in which it is used in the Bill. In the latter context, agreement has been attempted and failed, and there is some form of conflict. In any case, there is no equivalent in the Bill of the individual agreements on access for which the 1981 Act provided; instead there is a general right of access to private land.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> We are constantly being told that the 1981 Act did not work very well in protecting SSSIs partly because the mechanism for coming to an agreement was cumbersome, yet that mechanism is repeated in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. It is curious for the Government to pray in aid the 1981 Act, given that they have repeatedly claimed over the past few years that the Bill is necessary because of the Act's inadequacies.

<P>
The Minister's contention that there is no reason to be suspicious about the motives of the access authorities may or may not be true, but it will not wash in the outside world when the provisions of the Bill are being implemented. He has not satisfactorily explained the Government's reasons for giving the clause a legalistic aspect that is liable to promote confrontation and drive such confrontation into expensive legal areas. They have got the amendment completely wrong, and I urge my hon. Friends and other members of the Committee to vote against it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In the light of what the hon. Gentleman has said, I wonder whether it is appropriate for the Committee to proceed to a vote on the amendment.

<P>
Under the amendment, an agreement has to appear to the authority to be reasonable. If the matter were to come before a court, it is extremely likely that that would be the basis on which it would take a view. All that we are seeking to do is to put that beyond doubt. The proposal is not one-sided, and it is the only sensible way in which to try to establish a view as to what is, or is not, a reasonable agreement.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister has not responded to my point. As far as I can tell, the Government amendment will allow a judge who is investigating a claim for judicial review to consider only whether the authority's actions in the matter are reasonable, not whether they are reasonable in relation to the landowner or occupier, who will have no chance to make representations. Will the Minister consider changing the wording of the amendment-especially in the light of the problems that have arisen under the 1981 Act?

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I continue to take the view that the amendment is perfectly proper, and am not persuaded that there is any justification for altering its drafting. However, having listened carefully to the strongly held and well expressed views of Opposition Members, I undertake to reconsider the matter. I am not making a commitment to redraft the amendment. In the quietness of our deliberations-as opposed to the hurly-burly of Committee-we shall consider the full implications in order to judge whether a different drafting is justified. If we conclude that it is not, we shall table the same amendment at a later stage. On that understanding, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 521, in page 19, line 48, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) In considering whether to give any notice under subsection (1) the access authority shall take into consideration any representations made to it by any person as to the non-existence or insufficiency of any means of access to the land.

<P>
(6) Regulations may make provision for means of access to be depicted on the draft or conclusive map (as the case may be).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The clause provides that the access authority may give notice to the owner or occupier of access land that it will take the necessary steps to carry out works to open up or improve means of access, where it considers that necessary to allow the public reasonable access to the land. However, no tests exist to enable the access authority to decide whether it should take action to secure means of access and no opportunity exists for users to apply to the access authority to act.

<P>
The amendment allows the public, the potential user of the land, to make representations that there is no, or insufficient, means of access to the land and requires the authority to take such representations into account. That would balance subsection (3), which says that, in exercising the power to give notice, the access authority
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall have regard to the requirements of efficient management of the land in deciding where the means of access is to be provided.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Equally, there is no provision in the Bill for showing means of access on the access maps. Although I believe that it will be the intention of the countryside bodies to do so, we must ensure that means of access are shown on maps, particularly as they may not be a definitive right of way, which would already be shown on the maps. That would also enable the access authority and the public to judge whether the means of access were sufficient.

<P>
Right of entry will not necessarily be a public right of way, as envisaged by clause 52. If it is, it will appear on the definitive map by way of a modification order, but if it is not, it will not be depicted on any official map, and a member of the public would not know how to gain entry to such access land: she or he could end up trespassing.

<P>
The amendments are designed to be helpful to both the Government and the public and would allow the Government at a later stage, should it prove necessary, to make regulations for means of access to be shown on the draft or conclusive map. I hope that the Minister will recognise that and accept the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The amendment makes some useful suggestions, but I hope that I can convince my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley that it is unnecessary.

<P>
The amendment proposes that access authorities should be required to take into account any representations made concerning the adequacy of means of access to the land when deciding whether to serve a notice under the clause. We want access authorities to do that, but there is no need to provide for it in legislation. Local authorities must take into account any representations made on any subject for which they have responsibility. We do not believe that there is any need to replicate this duty. As we have said, we believe that the local access forums will play an important role in this regard.

<P>
On my hon. Friend's second point, we wish to encourage the countryside bodies to provide relevant information about access opportunities that could be incorporated into maps and guides for use by members of the public. As we have said, information should be made easily available to the public about where the new access opportunities are, including means of access. The Countryside Agency and others are considering how that might best be achieved. We hope that the National Countryside Access Forum will offer useful advice. Bodies such as Ordnance Survey will play a valuable part and we must also make full use of all the recent advances in information technology. However, that should not be part of the statutory requirement on countryside bodies to map means of access. There are too many of them and their status is liable to change.

<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Will the Under-Secretary confirm that it is equally important to have points of egress? When the weather turns foul, for example, it is important that people know where to aim to get off the mountain or moor.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am happy to confirm that. People can come and go by way of a point of access. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and he is right.

<P>
It would be an almost impossible task if countryside bodies were under an obligation to map every point of entry to access land. If they mapped only means of access identified by agreements or notices concluded under this chapter, the vast majority would be omitted.

<P>
I welcome the opportunity afforded by my hon. Friend to reassure her and other hon. Members that we share their concern for the proper identification of means of access and egress. Chapter III provides a mechanism for the securement and safeguarding of means of access. More generally, we shall look to the countryside bodies to ensure that there is proper provision of practical information for walkers and others. I hope that, in the light of my explanation, my hon. Friend will withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for his reassurance on representation as well as access and egress. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I should like to return to the subject on which we had a brief discussion earlier in the hope that inspiration will have struck in the meantime. I hope not to bore the Committee rigid, but my point is narrow. We want access authorities to be able to erect signs and provide information to assist access. The amendment to clause 19 that the Government will table later will provide a general power for the authority to do that, so it will not be ultra vires for an authority to erect signs. The difficulty arises when an authority wants to do the same thing on private land without the agreement of the landowner-the exact circumstances that apply under clause 35.

<P>
If the access authority wishes to do that, it must rely on the precise terms that appear in clause 35 to do so. That refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the opening-up, improvement or repair of any means of access to the land.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Access to the land is defined fairly narrowly in clause 32 and that does not include the provision of signs or information other than in the loose sense of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>other works for regulating passage through the opening,<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
which cannot possibly be construed in that way. Any sensible authority will do that anyway, but the problem lies in the appeals procedure under clause 36. A specific ground for appeal is that the works are not necessary for giving the public reasonable access. My concern is that a particularly peristent landowner who wishes to avoid that happening on his land could latch on to those related paragraphs and say that the work is not specified in the Bill. It is, therefore, grounds for appeal, and the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales would be bound to uphold that appeal on the basis that there was no provision for that work to take place anywhere in the Bill. I do not want some clever legal argument to be pursued that prevents authorities from doing what we all want them to do by virtue of the fact that it is not included in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will consider the matter and return to it at a later stage if it cannot be dealt with now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think that the answer to the hon. Gentleman's point is that the authorities will be able either to reach an agreement with landowners or to put up signs without their agreement. Clause 19 is not limited to notices on access land. If I have understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, the measure will not prevent access authorities acting in a way that both he and I would wish.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The point is not that the access authority would be acting ultra vires in putting up signs. They would be challengeable not on that basis, but on appeal on clause 36 because the works could be defined as ``not necessary'' under the Bill. A landlord could, therefore, appeal on the basis that the works were ancillary rather than necessary and that, although the authority had the power to spend money in that way, it did not have the power to put signs on land in contravention of a landowner's wishes. That would give grounds for appeal. This is a narrow point and I do not wish to labour it further. However, the problem is not quite addressed by the permissive power under clause 19.

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hope that I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly. Clause 19 notices will not be subject to appeal under clause 36. Indeed, any challenge would have to be my judicial review. The hon. Gentleman has an eagle eye for these matters, but his concerns about this issue are unfounded. I will have another look at it, but I think that I have addressed this point.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 407, in page 20, line 9, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) that the notice was not given as required under section 34,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 408, in page 20, line 17, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) that the notice, or any copy of the notice, was not given as required under section 35,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 409, in page 20, line 17, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) that the access authority failed to take reasonable steps to make an agreement before giving notice under section 35,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Amendments Nos. 407 and 408 would add an extra ground of appeal-a minor but important one-which would be that a notice had not been properly served under clause 34 in the case of amendment No. 407, and under clause 35 in the case of amendment No. 408. It is a convention in the courts that there are grounds for an appeal if something has not been done properly. It would, therefore, be appropriate to include in the Bill the provision that failure properly to serve a notice should be a ground for appeal.

<P>
Amendment No. 409 is slightly different, in that it would add a ground for appeal if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the access authority failed to take reasonable steps to make an agreement.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I have no doubt that the goodwill to which both Ministers have often referred will mean that all reasonable steps to make an agreement will be taken. However, we must be honest with ourselves. There could be problems such as personality clashes. There could be problems because of an intransigent owner or occupier, or an intransigent officer of the authority. Such people exist, as anyone who has fulfilled public duties for some time will know.

<P>
In circumstances in which two immovable objects fail to reach an agreement, an owner or occupier should be able to go to appeal on the grounds that no real effort had been made to reach that agreement, and that the authority had been heavy handed in its approach. That should be a simple ground of appeal, which would require the owner or occupier to prove that reasonable steps had not been taken. It would address those situations in which a clash of personalities exists and in which an agreement cannot be reached.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Amendment No. 409 would mean that a landowner could appeal against a notice under clause 35 on the grounds that the authority did not first take reasonable steps to enter into an agreement. We have already had some discussion on this issue, to which I shall not return.

<P>
The steps required for an authority to be able to reach the view that it is unable to conclude an agreement on reasonable terms will vary from case to case. However, having come to that view, the authority, if it wishes to proceed, will have to serve a notice setting out the works that it proposes to carry out at its own cost. There will then be a right of appeal to the Secretary of State or to the National Assembly for Wales on whether the works are needed or where any new means of access should be situated.
