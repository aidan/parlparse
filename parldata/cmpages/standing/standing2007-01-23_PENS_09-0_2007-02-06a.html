							<a name="07020669000386"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Good morning, Mr. Gale. I
shall deal briefly with the amendments. May I say at the outset that
they are not at the epicentre of the Opposition&#146;s strategy on
the Bill, in case the Minister was worried? They deal with two small
points&#151;you might even say they were niggling if you were in a
churlish mood, Mr. Gale&#151;and probe the
Government&#146;s position on committees.</div>
					<a name="07020669000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course we accept that the
delivery authority will have committees, and possibly even
sub-committees. I cannot remember the Minister&#146;s exact phrase,
but he said in an earlier debate that the system would be &#147;lean
and mean&#148;. It will be a smallish, focused body if it does its
job properly, and it will have a relatively short life. It therefore
seems a little counter-intuitive for it to be weighed down by a system
of committees and sub-committees. The point behind amendment No. 16 is
therefore simple: the requirement that</div>
					<a name="07020669000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at least one person who is either
a member or an employee of the
Authority&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">serve on a
committee will not necessarily provide the control over burgeoning
bureaucracy that we seek. The probing amendment proposes that a
majority of committee members should be members or employees of the
authority, so that they can control matters and ensure that any
relevant outside expertise is drawn into the
committee.</div>
					<a name="07020669000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
10 would be removed by amendmentNo. 17, because committees are
one thing and sub-committees are quite another. We hope that the
authority will not become a burgeoning leviathan&#151;it should have
a short, focused life if it does its job
properly.</div>

						</b> May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, and to have a majority of the
Government Members in attendance to discuss amendments that could be
described as important or, indeed, niggling? As we have said a number
of times&#151;in fact, ad nauseam&#151;the Bill establishes an
advisory authority, bringing on board relevant knowledge and
professional expertise. Are visual aids allowed in the Committee,
Mr.
Gale?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000391"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> As a normal part of its governance arrangements,
the authority will set up audit, remuneration and nominations
committees. We are making provision, too, so that it can set up other
committees and sub-committees. The board needs maximum flexibility both
to draw on relevant skills and expertise and to set up committees when
it believes that it would be helpful to do so. The main purpose of
setting up the delivery authority is to bring in such skills, so
restricting the board&#146;s ability to set up committees and
sub-committees would reduce that
flexibility.</div>
					<a name="07020669000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
know what else I can say to reassure the hon. Member for Eastbourne. We
want to bring in advisers so that the authority can do its work, and
its normal work requires the establishment of committees and
sub-committees, including remuneration and audit sub-committees. Some
of them may not require a majority of people from the board; for
example, a committee on socially responsible investment may want to
advise the authority and would not necessarily need a majority of
people from the authority. The schedule provides the right level of
accountability by requiring at least one member to be appointed from
the authority. Unless the hon. Gentleman wishes me to give him further
comfort on specific matters, that is as much as I can say, so I urge
him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000395"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>These amendments, too, are relatively
modest, but there is a serious purpose behind them. They were tabled at
the behest of the Association of British Insurers, and with its
encouragement. Together, they are designed to tackle the possibility of
cross-subsidisation in the setting up of personal accounts.</div>
					<a name="07020669000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ABI says that it is vital
that there is a level playing field between personal accounts and
existing workplace provision. It points out the danger thatthe
Government could subsidise the setting up and administration costs of
personal accounts by omitting to impose strict limits on the funding
for the delivery authority. It argues, too, that Government subsidies
for personal accounts would undermine existing provisions and be unfair
on taxpayers, employers who provide good schemes and the workers who
pay in to them. I shall have more to say later this morning about the
effect of the proposals on existing pension provision, so I shall not
develop that argument now. The ABI says that the purposes for which
state funding to the delivery authority are used should be strictly
limited to policy functions in designing the shape and structure of
personal accounts.</div>
					<a name="07020669000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulatory impact assessment states that&#163;21 million has
been set aside for the delivery authority. Can the Minister confirm
that that is the limit of the taxpayer&#146;s commitment to the
delivery authority? If not, under what circumstances would it change
during the authority&#146;s relatively short life? The Bill gives the
Secretary of State the power to make grants to the authority, but it
does not set limits on what parts of its work can be funded by the
Government. The vast majority of the expenditure on setting up and
administering personal accounts will occur after the next Bill is
enacted in due course, but both the ABI, representing its many members,
and the Opposition would like the Minister to give a commitment today
that there will be no state subsidy of personal accounts.
</div>
					<a name="07020669000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 19
deals with the separate but related issue of the delivery authority
borrowing at commercial rates to cover set-up costs in the early years
of the scheme that are not covered by the charges. That is a fall-back
position, and I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee that, in
the absence of a wholly unexpected and unforeseen occurrence, the
&#163;21 million will adequately cover all the authority&#146;s
costs during its lifetime and that the ongoing cost of operating the
personal accounts system will be a matter for its successor body. I
hope that I have set out clearly the nature of the amendments which, as
the ABI says, are designed to produce a level playing field, and are
not gratuitous measures designed to make life difficult for the
delivery
authority.</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000396"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> This is an important debate, but it mostly
concerns the next stage in the development of the delivery authority.
At this stage, the authority will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 287</div>merely advise the Government, so the question of spending costs on
personal accounts is theoretical, not practical. It is important that
we debate this matter, however, and at the appropriate time, it is
important that the delivery authority and the personal accounts board
comply with state aid rules and measures laid down by the Treasury on
the use of public money in such situations so that they provide value
for money for the taxpayer.</div>
					<a name="07020669000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I can reassure the
hon. Member for Eastbourne that those matters will be looked at
properly after they are flagged up in the consultation on the White
Paper, and during consideration of the next Bill. However, in the
authority&#146;s current phase, the key issue is what kind of work it
does. It will give us advice, so it is right that that worked is funded
by grant in aid. The Government&#146;s intention is that in the long
term the operation of personal accounts should be self-financing. In
the short term, until revenue from scheme members&#146; contributions
is available to cover operational costs, the setting up of personal
accounts will need to be financed. Work is under way to evaluate which
costs should be charged to members, but at this stage, it would not be
inappropriate to use taxpayers&#146; money for the development of
personal accounts policy.</div>
					<a name="07020669000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to the amendments, the
authority&#146;s spending is solely on the delivery of advice, so it
is not necessary to classify grant payments as either policy or
operational&#151;I am not even sure that that is possible in
practice&#151;and it is not necessary, either, to calculate notional
interest charges on those payments. Given that that is the case, and
given the fact that it is normal and accepted Government accounting
practice, the delivery authority will be funded by a singular
grantin aid payment. The details of the
arrangementsfor the payments will be confirmed in a financial
memorandum to be agreed between the authority and the Department. Like
other non-departmental public bodies within the Department for Work and
Pensions, the delivery authority is required to report annually on its
performance and financial position, including coverage of the purposes
for which the singular grant in aid payments have been used. In its
stewardship role, the Department will regularly review the expenditure
and funding requirements for the delivery authority; annual accounts
will be laid before Parliament and will be open to scrutiny. The hon.
Gentleman makes a point that, like many of the points that we shall
debate this morning, is important to the next phase of personal
accounts. I hope that, with those assurances, he will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> I hope that I shall not test your legendary
patience, Mr. Gale, but there is a great deal in the
amendments that I should like to deal with in appropriate detail. The
good news is that this is the last clause that need detain us for a
significant time, but it raises major issues that must be addressed.
Anybody who doubts that need only look at the front page of the most
recent edition of <i class="I">Parliamentary Brief</i>, containing a very
unflattering set of photographs of the

							<a name="07020669000402"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> He obviously works night and day. Images of
Richard Nixon with a 5 o&#146;clock shadowdid for him. The
unfortunate headline reads: &#147;Would you buy a pension from this
man?&#148; I think it was Marilyn Monroe who said that any publicity
wasgood publicity, but there is a limit even to that
nostrum.</div>
					<a name="07020669000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this
group of amendments, we come on to much wider issues about the way in
which personal accounts function. The detailed stuff, as the Minister
will no doubt tell us at length, will be included in the next Bill.
However, by that time, the delivery authority will have spent a chunk
of its &#163;21 million and will havenailed down some of the
parameters of personal accounts. It is important to draw the
Ministerand the Government out on the key issues in the
development of personal accounts. I make no apology for doing so, but I
shall try to be succinct. I shall look in detail at the amendments
before making some general points.</div>
					<a name="07020669000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						To put
everything in context, it is important to consider the views of the
ABI, which expressed concern about two fundamental issues that we have
raised time and time again. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) and I raised them on Second Reading,
and I make no apology for doing so in Committee. First, the ABI said
that</div>
					<a name="07020669000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;the
Delivery Authority should be required to take account of the potential
impact on the existing pensions market...in the detailed design of
Personal
Accounts.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Government have not only failed to do so, but have taken a quantum leap
and increased the contribution cap. A few days ago, they announced
something of which we take an even more serious
view.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07020669000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
concern of the ABI is
that</div>
					<a name="07020669000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the authority
should have a duty to ensure that Personal Accounts are designed to
focus on the target market (of low and middle earners), with an overall
aim of increasing both the number of savers and the total amount
saved.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not some
semantic distinction. It is important, especially at this stage, to set
out what constitutes the success or failure of personal accounts. That
must be clearly understood before we embark on this great
adventure.</div>
					<a name="07020669000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
now turn to the amendments. Some of them are fairly minor; others are
more important. I shall begin with amendment No. 83. One might think
that it was only a slight change of words. The clause
says:</div>
					<a name="07020669000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Authority may do anything it thinks appropriate for preparing for the
implementation of, or for advising on the modification of, any relevant
proposals about personal
accounts.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
difficult to think of a more sweeping set of powers for the authority,
which is newly emboldened, with&#163;21 million burning a
hole in its corporate pocket. We want to turn down the volume a bit and
replace &#147;appropriate&#148; with &#147;strictly
necessary&#148;. The point of that is to ensure that those who run
the authority have a clear idea of what constitutes their
duties.</div>
					<a name="07020669000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
84 is a probing amendment.Clause 19(2) says that</div>
					<a name="07020669000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;relevant proposals about
personal accounts&#146; means proposals by the Secretary of State
(whether or not Parliament has given any approval on which their
implementation
depends)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
entirely happy about that. Parliament should have a role in the
proposals at the relevant time, although there may be some good,
practical reasons why the Minister wants to pursue a different
course.</div>
					<a name="07020669000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that

amendments.</div>
					<a name="07020669000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment deals with the duties and responsibilities of the authority.
It is intended to ensure that the delivery authority takes account of
existing regulators and does not interfere with existing provision. It
is supplied and sponsored by the ABI, which tells me that it is based
on provisions in the Office of Communications Act 2002, so there is a
precedent.</div>
					<a name="07020669000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 40, to which I meant to refer, has been tabled by the Liberal
Democrats. We think that they have seen some sense, but I am keen to
listen to what the hon. Member for Yeovil says about it. We have all
received a brief about it. It is sponsored by the Resolution
Foundation, which does some excellent work, especially on financial
capability.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 292</div>
					<a name="07020669000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 86 seeks to leave
out subsection (5). We are not entirely clear as to why the authority
should not be allowed to borrow money; clearly it would be obliged to
pay it back. Circumstances in which the authority would borrow money
may not arise in its relatively short life, but I would be keen to hear
what the justification for that is.</div>
					<a name="07020669000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 22 is again
designed to deal with any hidden subsidy or personal accounts. It is
intended to ensure that the authority does not make recommendations or
initiate work that would require the scheme to be subsidised by the
taxpayer. That is a perfectly laudable aspiration. Amendment No. 23 is
reasonably self-explanatory. It talks about the guidance to be issued
by the Secretary of State under subsection (6). It makes sure that the
Secretary of State will consult a variety of organisations such as
representatives of consumers, employees, employers, the financial
services industry and such persons as he considers appropriate to
consult in relation to the guidance.</div>
					<a name="07020669000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that this is another
of those instances when the Minister will say, &#147;Of course, we
are going to do this anyway so there is no need to put it in the
Bill.&#148; We will retort, &#147;Well, if that is the case, why
not put it in the Bill?&#148; Let us get over that now. If that is
precisely what the Government intend to do, it seems eminently sensible
simply to put it in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07020669000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return now to
amendment No. 21. In many ways, it is the key amendment in this group.
It is designed to hold the Government to account over the functions of
the personal accounts system. Page 84 of the White Paper,
&#147;Personal Accounts: a new way to save&#148;, sets out the
objectives of the scheme which will be set in statute. Amendment No. 21
sets out almost word for word most of those objectives. We have taken
some poetic liberties here and there, but by and large these are an
updated version of those objectives, which the Government have promised
to set in statute.</div>
					<a name="07020669000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Some of them
are beyond debate. They are perfectly obvious&#151;to set an
investment strategy; to minimise burdens on employers; to assure
security of administration; to govern in the best interests of members
and beneficiaries; to ensure that the board acts impartially and so on;
to deliver appropriate levels of choice; to achieve charges that are
fair and reasonable; to ensure that the funds are invested in the best
interest of the members.</div>
					<a name="07020669000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">None of those aims would
require any major debate. Where it gets more interesting is our
proposed paragraph
(a):</div>
					<a name="07020669000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ensuring that the
overall outcome, taking account of the impact on the existing market,
is an increase in the number of people saving and the overall amount
being saved&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important objective. If the Government are not prepared to accept it
with open arms, that is a major worry. It is perfectly possible to
envisage a scenario in which there are more savers but the amount of
savings overall has not increased significantly. Of course there will
be more savers, because there will be auto enrolment; many people will,
without making any conscious decision, be enrolled in the relevant
company scheme. We have long been in favour of the concept of auto
enrolment, but not in isolation.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 293</div>
					<a name="07020669000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will savings themselves
increase? The savings ratio has almost halved since 1997 and it is set
out in the Turner report and elsewhere how important it is to get the
11 million or so people who are not saving adequately for their
retirement into the savings habit. A clear litmus test for the success
or failure of personal accounts would be an increase not only in the
number of people saving but in the overall amount being saved. Proposed
paragraph (b)
reads:</div>
					<a name="07020669000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;optimising levels
of participation and contribution among the target
group&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
seem to have veered away from the target group recently, and we think
that it is important to bring them back to the original
concept.</div>
					<a name="07020669000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turner made
clear the people at whom we were aiming the reforms in terms of
personal saving for pensions. Page 48 of the White Paper
states,</div>
					<a name="07020669000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Personal
accounts are particularly targeted at the estimated7 million
people who may not be currently saving enough to give them an income in
retirement they are likely to consider
adequate&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is the
usual impressive array of charts. It goes on to specify a group that
tends to be younger, on moderate to low incomes, and also part-time
workers, all those who work for small employers and lower earners, a
high proportion of whom are women. That seems to us eminently sensible.
We made it clear on Second Reading and have repeated today that it is a
major concern of ours that we seem to be getting away from the target
group.</div>
					<a name="07020669000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
particularly draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the criterion in
(e), which is, &#147;minimising the impact on other high-quality
pension provision&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a significant change from the wording in the White Paper, which
talks about &#147;considering&#148; the impact on other
high-quality pension provision. We do not think that that is anything
like strong enough. There has to be a clear commitment to avoiding an
impact on generous existing provision.</div>
					<a name="07020669000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of the contribution
cap is fundamental for us and to the process of building consensus
about the personal accounts system. The ABI has had a great deal to say
about the change from the &#163;3,000 cap, which you remember,
Mr. Gale, was in the Turner report. Suddenly out of the blue
the Government produced a figure of &#163;5,000 in their White Paper.
I will explain why that matters a lot in a minute, but I would be
fascinated to hear from the Minister where the figure came from. The
form of words at the time was that it was as a result of consultation,
but we have searched high and low in the pensions and the wider
financial services industry and we have yet to find anyone who will
admit to having suggested increasing the cap so sharply to
&#163;5,000. It is a bit like trying to get people to admit to having
voted Labour at the last election, but I am not going to pursue that
argument.</div>
					<a name="07020669000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ABI
says,</div>
					<a name="07020669000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government should set the cap for annual contributions to Personal
Accounts at &#163;3,000&#151;as recommended by the Pensions
Commission&#151;instead of the minimum of &#163;5,000 suggested in
the White Paper.</div>
					<a name="07020669000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
Government should not compromise the targeting of Personal Accounts by
including savers who currently have good pension
provision&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 294</div>
					<a name="07020669000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to say that the personal
account is specifically aimed at the groups that I have already
mentioned&#151;in sum, adapted to the target group&#151;and in his
statement to the House on 12 December 2006, the Secretary of State said
that personal accounts should complement and not compete with existing
private pension provision. The Pensions Commission itself argued that
uncapped or higher levels of contributions to personal accounts could
distort investment markets and have damaging macro-economic effects. It
would be interesting to know whether the Minister has any concerns on
that
score.</div>
				
					<a name="07020669000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ABI goes on to say:</div>
					<a name="07020669000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The White Paper shows
that, with a &#163;3,000 cap, someone on the target income of
&#163;15,000 a year would be able to increase their savings by
&#163;2,200 pa above the minimum or default level of contribution.
Anyone on a salary of up to &#163;23,750 would be able to more than
double their contributions...A cap of &#163;5,000 would extend
Personal Accounts way beyond the target group&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree with that statement, which is
our major concern here.</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div>
					<a name="07020669000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ABI goes on
to say that</div>
					<a name="07020669000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this level
of cap would potentially extend Personal Accounts to nearly the entire
working population...ABI data from member companies suggest that a
cap of &#163;5,000 would potentially capture 93 per cent. of the
current market for employer-sponsored money-purchase
schemes&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
interested to know whether the Government challenge that figure of 93
per cent. Finally, the ABI
concludes:</div>
					<a name="07020669000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
the White Paper says, Personal Accounts should be&#145;a
valuable addition, rather than a competitor, to existing
employer-sponsored provision.&#146;&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am delighted that
the Minister has put on record his willingness to reconsider his
position. In a report in the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> on 17 January 2007,
he said that the Government would listen to argument if people thought
that the limit was too high. He said that they were very open to that.
At that same NAPF seminar, the Minister is reported as saying that the
delivery authority for the new system will be given &#147;a legal
objective&#148; to ensure that the impact on the existing market is
minimised. Well, we have done that for him with this elegantly drafted
legal objective, to which we hope he will sign up today.</div>
					<a name="07020669000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister should be under no
illusion about the concerns that this has stirred up, not just within
this Opposition Party&#151;and I suspect that I might speak for the
Liberal Democrats as well, as we shall hear&#151;but within the
industry itself. Stephen Haddrill, the ABI&#146;s director general,
talked about the measures extending the scope of personal accounts in
&#147;a rather stealthy way&#148;, at the expense of the current
savings market and, potentially, that of the taxpayer. His deputy,
Stephen Sklaroff, said:</div>
					<a name="07020669000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We hope the Government
is not deliberately trying to fix the system so more money flows into
personal accounts so it can keep down costs to artificially low levels.
The raising of the contribution cap to target higher earners is
completely inconsistent with earlier pledges to target people on lower
incomes. Our industry cannot be forced to compete with a subsidised
system&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
as the ripples of that announcement were beginning to dissipate,
something else slipped out only the other day that is causing just as
much concern. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 295</div>
						<i class="I">Money Marketing</i> reported on 1 February that at a Social Market
Foundation seminar in London&#151;where I was also pleased to be
present&#151;Mr. Robert Laslett, chief economist at the
DWP, was responding</div>
					<a name="07020669000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
concerns that low personal account contributions would become the norm
by suggesting the private sector could construct savings vehicles in
partnership with the scheme for people who want to save above the
contribution cap&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">ABI spokesman Jon French then
said:</div>
					<a name="07020669000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
provisions for such a policy have appeared in Government documents. Any
blurring of the line between existing private provision and personal
accounts risks undermining both markets&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, again, was that just policy making on
the hoof from Mr. Laslett, or does it represent deep-seated
views in the bowels of the DWP about how the personal accounts system
should operate? It would be interesting to know because my judgment is
that the industry is not going to play if it is the latter&#151;and,
perhaps just as importantly, neither will we.</div>
					<a name="07020669000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will explain why it is so
important that there is no &#147;mission creep&#148; in setting up
personal accounts. While they start off as a concept designed to target
those not saving at the moment, a point of view that we entirely agree
with and respect, we do not want to see a situation where some of the
best provision of private pensions in the world&#151;despite the
depredations made under this Government&#151;is itself undermined by
the law of unintended consequences which tends to run rampant through
attempts at pensions
reform.</div>
					<a name="07020669000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will now
refer to a research paper published by the ABI and prepared by
Deloittes on the issue of levelling down. For the uninitiated,
levelling down is the concern of people like me and many in the
industry that employers with existing generous pension schemes, looking
at significantly increased costs, based on auto enrolment, could with
some relief turn to the personal account system. We have seen 60,000 DB
schemes close already under this Government but we could
seemany more of them close on the basis that thereis
a Government-backed or Government-sponsored scheme which will do just
as well.</div>
					<a name="07020669000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is crucial
to bear in mind one simple truth. Although it is important&#151;in
fact essential&#151;to encourage non-savers into saving for their
retirement for all the right reasons, levels of contributions envisaged
in Turner and set out in the Government&#146;s personal accounts
proposals, as we have seen them so far, will not deliver a particularly
comfortable retirement for most people. For many employees currently in
schemes with relatively generous contributions and relatively generous
benefits it would be a step or more backwards to move to personal
accounts.</div>
					<a name="07020669000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stephen
Hadrill says in the introduction to the ABI research paper, prepared by
Deloittes:</div>
					<a name="07020669000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government has said it expects such levelling-down to be minimal but
the research presented in this report paints a very different picture.
One in four employers who currently contribute over 3 per cent of
earnings to employees pensions said they would introduce a new lower
rate of contribution. This represents reduced employer pension
provision for 2.4 million
employees.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
going into enormous detail, I would certainly commend this document to
the Committee. It makes certain key findings: that the average employer
contribution rate for existing members is 6.2 per cent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 296</div>and the average employee contribution rate is 3.8 per cent. Twenty-three
per cent of employers who have a pension scheme claim that their
response to the reform programme will be to close the scheme to all or
some employees, and 7 per cent. claim that they would reduce
contributions for new and/or existing staff. Some 30 per cent are as
yet unsure of their response. Of 24 per cent of employers who are
currently making contributions, over 3 per cent say they will offer a
lower contribution rate than the one that they offer their staff
generally in their open pension
schemes.</div>

							<b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): Does my hon.
Friend agree that it would have been useful had the author of this
Deloittes report been able to come and give evidence to this Committee,
so that we could tease out some of the very serious issues that this
report alludes to?</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000408"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I do not disagree with my hon. Friend and it
would have saved me from giving at second hand the views of the people
who have prepared these and other reports. We have already had a
discussion about oral evidence and written evidence&#151;not that I
have noticed a torrent of written evidence so far but no doubt some of
it is on the way&#151;but the key sentence is
this:</div>
					<a name="07020669000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
represents reduced provision for 2.4 million
employees.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been a lot of misinformation about levelling down. This is not a
concern about some Big Bang that from one day to the next people will
close schemes and move to personal accounts. It is put rather well in
the report when it
says:</div>
					<a name="07020669000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;And over
time job turnover is likely to increase the amountof
levelling-down. Employees who leave schemes with high contributions are
unlikely to be eligible to participate in schemes with such high
contribution rates at their new
employer.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the concern: a gradual erosion of existing provision over and above
that which has already happened and is happening as we speak.</div>
					<a name="07020669000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, on this particular
point, an excellent document produced by the National Association of
Pension Funds in December called &#147;More Savers, More
Saving?&#148; talks about some of the same issues as the Deloitte
report. The document talks about the need to encourage more people to
save, which is what the entire scheme is about, and about a worst-case
scenario, which could see a substantial reduction in
contributions:</div>
					<a name="07020669000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;total
employer and employee contributions could be almost&#163;10
billion higher if there is no levelling down compared to our worst case
scenario.&#148;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000409"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that neither
the NAPF nor the Government think that the worst-case scenario will
materialise? Even that worst-case scenario is a significant increase in
the amount of savings compared with today. More importantly, in that
document or another, the NAPF makes a number of recommendations to
prevent levelling down, all of which the Government are, I think,
looking to implement&#151;apart from one, a new form of tax relief
for the schemes. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the Conservative
party is committed to that extra tax
relief?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000410"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> No, I am not saying that. I am flagging up the
concerns of the industry. I am delighted to hear that the Minister is
on the case. When he has more time, in his own speech on the group, no
doubt he will tell us in more detail whether he accepts the concerns,
and if not, why not? Precisely what are the Government doing to avoid
the trap set out here? It is true that the NAPF set out some ideas, one
of which is the good pensions mark, which would distinguish existing
NAPF-type employer schemes&#151;generous current schemes&#151;from
others. That is an excellent idea, although more of the detail would be
interesting. The Minister might have something to say on
that.</div>
					<a name="07020669000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will quote one
other thing from the NAPF report, which ties in with amendment No.
21:</div>
					<a name="07020669000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Delivery Authority for Personal Accounts is officially tasked with
taking account of the impact of the new regime on existing provision in
its recommendations for the design of Personal Accounts to
Ministers&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07020669000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is what they are saying should happen and that is the point of the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07020669000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will move
on to deal with the more minor amendments, while making it absolutely
clear that, for us, the key amendment in the group is
amendmentNo. 21. Subject to what the Minister has to
say&#151;I appreciate that there are a lot of points to
cover&#151;we would like to see a clear commitment from the
Government, or we might feel obliged to press the amendment to a
vote.</div>
					<a name="07020669000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the sublime
to the ridiculous&#151;amendment No. 87 also talks about guidance,
which we say ought to be reported to Parliament by the Secretary of
State through an oral statement. We think that only reasonable. On
reflection, I am prepared to accept the Minister&#146;s assurance of
a written statement, perhaps, but I think that Parliament should be
kept abreast of things, if at all
possible.</div>
					<a name="07020669000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mean no
disrespect to the hon. Member for Yeovil if I touch on the Liberal
Democrat amendments only briefly&#151;as I know that he will not. I
think that the thrust of amendment No. 38 is not totally different from
that of some of the stuff that I have been saying, being concerned
about the effect of means-testing on the levels of saving, which I
shall say a little about in a moment. However, we will be having a
fairly substantial debate later in our deliberations, so I will leave a
lot until then. Amendment No. 39 and the gender impact
assessment&#151;who could disagree with that? Amendments Nos. 65 to
68&#151;publishing a strategy on anticipation of the system of
personal accounts is perhaps a different way of coming at the same sort
of issues that I have been tackling in my comments. Amendment No. 66
would require the preparation of a report to monitor the impact of the
new personal accounts, which again seems eminently sensible. Amendment
No. 67 is on IT and makes what seems a useful suggestion, and we have
no difficulty with amendment No. 68, on the target
audience.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07020669000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I
conclude I should say that I am emboldened because the NAPF supports
the principle behind amendment No. 23, which is an important amendment
on issuing guidance. I hope that that will make it more palatable to
the Minister. It also supports amendment No. 20.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 298</div>
					<a name="07020669000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to whether the scheme
will succeed. As avid readers of <i class="I">Parliamentary Brief </i>will know,
Mr. Steve Bee, who is quite an expert on such matters and
seems to be stalking the Minister in cyberspace through their
respective blogs, says, as the sub-headline puts it, &#147;Sorry,
Minister, but you just cannot sell a pension plan which comes with a 40
per cent. tax on savings&#148;. While I appreciate that there is some
difference between him and the Minister on how to define a tax, Steve
Bee says that under the pension credit system, some people will be left
just &#163;11.70 a week better off than someone who has not saved for
their retirement. He
writes:</div>
					<a name="07020669000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That
is slightly more than a 40 per cent. tax on saving and is exactly why
millions of people on modest earnings should be very wary indeed about
your proposals for a National Pensions Savings
Scheme.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to leave
means testing aside at this stage, because we can have a much wider
debate on it later under one of the new
clauses.</div>
					<a name="07020669000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Bee says that personal accounts will be an &#147;advice-free
zone.&#148; He
writes:</div>
					<a name="07020669000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Consumer
protection must be built into the thing just as it is within our
existing pension
system.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is another
concern, and one that we mentioned most recently on Second Reading.
There are consumer protections issues to consider. For example,
<i class="I">Which?</i> has been keen to brief the Committee about the possible
scrapping of rule 64 by the FSA in its current review. It states that
it</div>
					<a name="07020669000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;could lead to
consumers not having access to a low-cost pensions product in the
run-up to Personal Accounts which would disadvantage low to medium
income earners and potentially undermine trust in the pensions
system....The removal of rule 64 contradicts the government
objective of more people saving more for their retirement between now
and 2012. Consumers would not receive written justification from a
financial adviser concerning any recommendation for a pension<i class="I">
</i>product that is more expensive than a stakeholder
pension.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
concerns there and, although I appreciate that it is a Treasury matter,
the Minister might be able to tell us where people have got to on the
matter.</div>
					<a name="07020669000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally on
advice, we are pleased that Mr. Otto Thoresen of AEGON has
been appointed to run a financial capability taskforce, as I believe it
is called. That is important, because various groups are affected: the
target group, who must remain the focus, and people who would not be
well advised to enrol automatically into personal accounts. They might
have low income or high credit card debts that they would be much
better advised to pay off. The wonderful phrase &#147;generic
advice,&#148; which gets kicked around and is what I understand Otto
Thoresen will focus on, is an oxymoron. Generic advice cannot be given
to people who need the specific advice that they should not be
automatically enrolled as it would be to their disadvantage. That is an
issue that Mr. Bee deals
with.</div>
					<a name="07020669000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The central
issue is the cap and losing sight of the target group. We have been
doughty warriors in the battle for consensus on many issues, but this
is a sticking point for us. The proposals contain the potential for
mission creep. So I urge the Minister to confirm that, as has been
reported, he is willing to think again. Otherwise, those proposals
could well be the rock on which the good ship consensus finally
founders.</div>

								Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Mr. Gale, welcome back to the Chair. The
hon. Member for Eastbourne rightly took some time over his, and indeed
our, amendments. He mentioned a rock on which the consensus might
founder&#151;the rock that might hole the ship. I must say that there
are a number of different rocks on which that consensus might come into
trouble, all of which are related to clause 19. So, as he anticipated,
I shall take a little time over our seven amendments.</div>
					<a name="07020669000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the Minister would
not want me to gloss across my amendments. However, I shall make a deal
with him. If he gives me full time and very good answers, I promise to
whiz through, or not even speak to, the next 10 clauses. The more
helpful his answers, the quicker I shall be over the next 10
clauses&#151;that is quite a carrot. Already I can see notes being
passed to him&#151;no doubt people encouraging him to be as helpful
as possible.</div>
					<a name="07020669000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
tabled seven amendments to clause 19, and I want to describe them
briefly, but rapidly, in a logical order. Then I want to discuss some
of the important issues that sit behind them. Amendments Nos. 38 and 68
sit together to some extent. The former
reads:</div>
					<a name="07020669000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Prior
to Parliament&#146;s approval of proposals the Authority must
evaluate the effect of means testing on levels of saving in personal
accounts and its impact on returns in personal accounts
and...publish
evaluations&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 68 would require the Government, before 1 April 2008, to describe
what proportion of the target audience for personal accounts would
receive returns, and sets out target bands. I shall come back to why we
think that that is so
important.</div>
					<a name="07020669000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 40 deals with the important issue of the financial advice offered
to those intending to invest in personal accounts. The hon. Member for
Eastbourne has touched on that already. Amendment No. 39 would require
the authority to carry out a gender impact assessment of proposals for
personal accounts and participation. Participation is dealt with by
amendment No. 65 as well. Amendment No. 67 deals with the
Government&#146;s IT system and whether the computer can say yes to
the complexities of personal accounts or whether problems might arise
as a consequence of the sheer ambition of the project. Finally,
amendment No. 66 deals with the issue that the hon. Gentleman spoke
about for some time&#151;levelling down and the protection and
encouragement of existing occupational pension
provision.</div>
					<a name="07020669000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Minister is keen to leave until the debate on new clause 2 the
issue of means testing and returns on personal accounts, but I cannot
decouple them from a discussion on how the system of personal accounts
should be established. Unfortunately, we have not had the seminar on
means testing and returns that we were promised at the beginning of our
proceedings, and neither have we had an indication of when it will take
place&#151;I hope that we will have one this morning. Some of us had
hoped that it would be during the Committee&#146;s proceedings, but
it seems that it will run beyond
them.</div>
					<a name="07020669000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means,
unfortunately, that there is a great deal of disagreement over the
level of the means
testing.</div>

Notwithstanding the clarification of the date, we still do not have
much clarity about how many people will be means tested in future. That
is enormously important, because people&#146;s views about whether
they should invest in personal accounts will differ according to
whether they are likely to be subject to the types of withdrawal
touched on by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. As we know, the Pensions
Policy Institute has a much higher figure for the proportion of people
who are likely to be subject to means testing in future&#151;45 per
cent. or more in 2050&#151;and its band of prediction for the
proportion of people on means testing is very wide. It ranges
from50 to 55 per cent. in 2020 to 30 to 65 per cent. in 2030,
so there is an enormous band of
uncertainty.</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000416"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the PPI says
that the 65 per cent. figure is based on a collapse of private saving,
and therefore on a scenario in which the White Paper policy has
entirely failed, rather than on one in which it has
succeeded?</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000417"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Yes, of course those are the bounds. However, they
indicate that the PPI thinks that the Government&#146;s estimate of
about 30 per cent. or 28 per cent. is the absolute lowest that it could
be, and that the range of uncertainty means that the figure could be
much higher.</div>
					<a name="07020669000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other thing that I am keen to find out is whether the Government have
assessed what proportion of the personal accounts target audience will
be subject to means testing. Our assumption is that the figures that we
have cited are flattered by the inclusion of people such as Members of
Parliament and chairs of big private-sector industries who are never
going to be worried about means testing and will never come under it.
Perhaps we should expect that those who are likely to be auto enrolled
into personal accounts will be those on the lowest incomes, who might
be at the greatest risk of ending up on means testing in
retirement.</div>
					<a name="07020669000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would
like to find out not only what a credible consensus figure would be for
means testing but what proportion of the personal accounts target
audience is particularly at risk. That is important because Lord
Turner&#146;s intention was that people would have a powerful
incentive to save in the personal accounts, in that they would get
&#163;2 for every &#163;1 that they put in. That sounds rather like
an echo of the Liberal policy of 1911, which is obviously where the
Government have stolen this great idea from. I notice that Lloyd
George&#146;s version was rather more generous than two for one; it
was 9d for 4d. Hon. Members might be interested to know that employees
put in 4d, the employer added 3d and the state 2d, which goes to show
that people always get just a little bit more under a Liberal
Government. That also gave certainty about what the returns were going
to be. People had the security of knowing that if they put in a small
amount, it would turn into something much larger. That is very
attractive to those on low incomes and those with a great aversion to
risk&#151;they do not want to put all their money into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 301</div>Chinese equities, but they do want a powerful incentive to save. I agree
that getting &#163;2 for every &#163;1 put in is a powerful
incentive.</div>

in this discussion is the length of time involved? Doubling

time period is extremely important. But we will go on to demonstrate
that not only is the time period relevant to the return but other
characteristics are too. They include how much a person&#146;s time
in work is broken; how much time they end up taking off for caring work
or looking after their children; whether they are self-employed;
whether they are high or low earners and whether they will be renting
property in retirement and therefore affected by the withdrawal of
housing benefit if they are on low income. All of those factors will
affect their returns from personal accounts.
</div>
					<a name="07020669000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Very helpfully, the
Secretary of State, after the passing of one or two notes from the
officials&#146; box, got up again on Second Reading to clarify his
initially quite clear-cut statement that the vast majority of people
could expect this &#163;2 for &#163;1 return. He
said:</div>
					<a name="07020669000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Let me
clarify the issue. I am advised that a large majority of people with a
good work history, saving from the age of 25, can expect a payback of
about &#163;2 per &#163;1 in 2012. Of course, that crucially
depends on for how long they contribute to the scheme. ...these
figures are for illustrative purposes only.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official

					<a name="07020669000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">So suddenly, what had seemed to
be an assurance relevant to the vast majority of people, was relevant
only to a particular group of the vast majority who are expected to go
into personal accounts. What we have on the record from the Department
is something far less encouraging. Instead of the two for one pledge,
one for one is all that can be made. We also have the clarification
that it will be difficult for anybody to advise individuals on what the
returns will be prior to going into these accounts, because there will
be a lot of uncertainty about the factors that will determine the
return. That is made clear in the Government&#146;s paper.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 302</div>
					<a name="07020669000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Pensions Policy Institute,
as ever, has produced some incredibly helpful calculations based on a
whole series of different individuals from different income groups and
different caring and work experiences. It published them in a very good
paper entitled &#147;Are personal accounts suitable for all?&#148;
in November 2006. Some people will get quite good returns from personal
accounts. To take a random example, a woman aged 25 in the ninth top
decile of earnings with a full national insurance record and large
other savings, based on the investment returns that the PPI has used,
can expect to get a return of something like &#163;3.43 for every
&#163;1 invested. That does not seem a bad return at all. But going
to the other extreme, a woman aged 55 who is self-employed and in the
first income decile will get 5p back for every &#163;1 invested when
means-tested benefits are taken into
account.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000425"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> No, I am not proposing to abolish housing benefit. I
am suggesting that the cost of the Government not having the resources
to deliver a better basic state pension is a large number of people on
means-tested benefits. The Minister is entitled to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 303</div>point out to me that our proposals would be considerably more expensive
than his but I am entitled to point out to him that there is a cost to
his lack of financial generosity, which is to have a huge number of
people on means-tested benefits and therefore to have less clarity
about what the returns will be.</div>
					<a name="07020669000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have already seen that the
Secretary of State could not guarantee for the majority of people that
they were going to get a &#163;2 for &#163;1 return, because
although people will get their employee contribution paid in and their
employer contribution paid in, although they will receive an employer
contribution if they are in employment and not self-employed, and
although they will obtain tax relief they will also lose tax on the way
out. They will lose the charges. They may lose some of the means-tested
pensioner benefits. They may lose housing benefit and they may lose
council tax benefit, so they will go up one escalator and in some cases
they will go down another escalator. That is why many of the people in
the pensions industry and beyond are worried about the extended
means-testing.</div>
					<a name="07020669000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not want to quote him too often because he will get carried away by the
extent to which we rely on him in this Committee, but there is also an
excellent article by Mr. Steve Bee in yesterday&#146;s
edition of <i class="I">Pensions Week</i>, where he says at the
beginning:</div>
					<a name="07020669000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
was looking through the January issue of the Financial Services
Authority&#146;s newsletter for financial
advisers&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07020669000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">as we
all do&#151;</div>
					<a name="07020669000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;when I
noticed the reference made to means-tested benefits and the giving of
advice&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">He quotes an
extract from that advice from the Financial Services Authority to
financial advisers. It
says:</div>
					<a name="07020669000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Means-tested
state benefits factors that impact on the advice you give will vary
from product to product and customer to customer. However, one factor
that you may want to consider taking into account is whether a product
will affect the customer&#146;s entitlement for means-tested state
benefits. Principle nine imposes a broad requirement for a firm to take
reasonable care to ensure the suitability of its advice...You may
wish to consider the impact of your financial advice on means-tested
benefits in communicating with some of your
customers&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then Mr. Bee cites a
bad example of a firm that recommended a low-premium pension to someone
in their late 50s with no previous pension provision. The point that he
makes in his article
is:</div>
					<a name="07020669000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This does
beg the following questions about the care that will be taken as people
are auto-enrolled into pension saving by the legislation the government
is proposing:</div>
					<a name="07020669000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">Will
those auto-enrolled into saving in personal accounts be advised on the
impact on their entitlement to means-tested benefits? Will older people
with no previous pension provision be advised not to save in a personal
account?&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">He goes on to
cite another couple of considerations. He says in conclusion&#151;it
is worth quoting because the issue is
important:</div>
					<a name="07020669000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
fact, though, that this is important enough to be brought to the
attention of financial advisers by the regulator indicates it will
surely be even more important for the DWP to take great care when
distributing personal accounts to its target market of people on low to
medium levels of income. If, however, the government cannot give
assurances to those about to be swept into pension saving that the same
level of care will be taken in regard to the suitability issues that
are required of financial advisers, then perhaps people should be wary
about getting caught up in the
scheme&#148;.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 304</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000426"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s position that if
there is any means-testing in the system, automatic enrolment is not
justified?</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000427"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> No. The Minister knows that that is not our
position. It will be considerably more dangerous if, as may well
happen, 50 per cent. or more of the target audience for personal
accounts is subject to means-testing for the next three, four or five
decades, as there will be a rampant risk of mis-selling, which we
should be concerned about. That risk could be more easily contained and
financial advice could more easily be given if a much smaller group of
people were to be means-tested.</div>
					<a name="07020669000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister knows that the
proposals advanced by the PPI and others for a more generous universal
pension would involve means-tested levels south of10 per
cent., not north of 50 per cent. That is why the issue of financial
advice is so important. We know that the Government are ploughing on
with the scheme as it stands on the basis of a low basic state pension
that will not be indexed to earnings for many more years, and which
will therefore continue to shrivel in relation to average incomes. That
is why we tabled amendment No. 40, which the hon. Member for Eastbourne
was kind enough to mention, and which he indicated that his party
generally supported.</div>
					<a name="07020669000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment was suggested by
the Resolution Foundation, which encourages the provision of generic
financial advice. The foundation has been working closely with the
Treasury to establish mechanisms to ensure that there is generic
financial advice for people on low incomes in future. The amendment
would require the new Personal Accounts Delivery Authority to report on
how people can access generic financial advice in connection with
personal accounts.</div>
					<a name="07020669000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a helpful note to me setting out some of its concerns about the issue,
the foundation asked that Ministers clarify three points&#151;first,
that information alone about the impact of means-testing and returns in
personal accounts will not be enough. The foundation
said:</div>
					<a name="07020669000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ministers
should make a clear commitment that generic financial advice will be
available in connection with personal accounts in line with the
recommendations of the Work and Pensions Select Committee and of the
Treasury Select
Committee.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Government ensure that better generic financial advice is available to
people on low incomes for all their savings products? Obviously, the
more such advice is available the more it will reduce the risk of
people saving in personal accounts who should not be doing so, or doing
so only after very considerable
thought.</div>
					<a name="07020669000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
foundation
said:</div>
					<a name="07020669000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ministers
should also make clear that the provision of generic financial advice
will be one of the issues the Authority should consider during the
first phase of its work, and provide assurances that this will be
reflected in the executive powers and responsibilities due to be
outlined in the second Bill&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020669000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">That Bill is expected at the end of this
year.</div>
					<a name="07020669000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, the
foundation suggested, reasonably, that the delivery authority&#146;s
work should be closely linked to the work on financial advice that the
rest of the Government are undertaking.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 305</div>
					<a name="07020669000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 15 January, in a Treasury
document entitled &#147;Financial Capability: The Government&#146;s
long-term approach&#148;, the Government set out their aspiration to
provide high-quality generic financial advice and established the
feasibility study that the hon. Member for Eastbourne discussed
earlier. Could the Minister explain how those two things will lock
together and reassure us that they will lock together in time to
provide the relevant financial advice for people who are saving in
personal accounts? The Minister himself commented on the issue in his
speech to the Social Market Foundation on 30 October, when he
said:</div>
					<a name="07020669000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It would
be up to the individual to decide whether they remain in a personal
account. The test for
us&#151;</div>
					<a name="07020669000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is, the
Government&#151;</div>
					<a name="07020669000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
this will be whether we can give simple generic advice to people about
whether they should do
so.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
briefly to discuss two other issues. First, it would be useful to hear
the Minister&#146;s response to the amendments that deal with
participation, which is covered by the clause. That issue includes
people&#146;s perception of the returns from the accounts and the
impact of means-testing, but there will also be concerns about groups
that are liable to be left out and possible incentives for certain
employers to discourage certain groups from taking up personal
accounts. Just as there are concerns about people taking up accounts
who should not do so, there are concerns about people who may be left
out because of the way in which personal accounts are presented to
them. I hope that the Government will respond to
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="07020669000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
should like to mention levelling down, to which the hon. Member for
Eastbourne referred. He is right to make a big deal about the issue,
although there has been considerable falling down of contribution and
coverage levels for DC and DB pensions over the past few years. That is
the general background.</div>
					<a name="07020669000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">None of us wants personal
accounts to become the automatic route of choice for most employers in
this country, because they provide a basic minimum level of saving. The
evidence that was given to the Workand Pensions Committee on
17 May 2006 by Mr. Waddingham contained a powerful warning
against getting too obsessed with personal accounts at the expense of
other
provision:</div>
					<a name="07020669000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;NPSS
is a good idea, it will help many people, but I am terribly worried
that we might see a public sector with very good salary-related
pensions and a private sector just with a relatively low-level money
purchase NPSS, and I am saying, &#145;Please, could we not have help
to encourage the good employers to do something in the
middle?&#146;&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, we want to see priority given to including in second-tier
pension provision those individuals who are not included at the moment.
That is even more important for us than it is for the Government,
because we do not want a world in which the state is in second-tier
provision. It is particularly important that second-tier provision
works; otherwise, people will be reliant only on a basic state
pension.</div>
					<a name="07020669000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Weston-super-Mare pointed out the other day that there is
nothing intrinsic to DC schemes that means they give low returns; if
people make high contributions, they can have good returns. The sad
fact is, however, that the switch from DB to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 306</div>
						DC schemes has been associated with a decline in
contributions. It is easy to see why, because it is the final salary
element of DB schemes that derives high contributions. Moving away from
a final salary link can therefore lead to lower contribution
rates.</div>
					<a name="07020669000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">We risk ending
up with quite unequal pension coverage between the private and the
public sector, and perhaps also between the affluent and the less
affluent. I have noticed, not only in the public sector but in some of
the private sector schemes, that the people who are most affluent and
most capable of making decisions about investment risk are more likely
to be in defined-benefit schemes and have high employer contribution
rates. There is a slightly eccentric relationship, which is the
opposite of that which we might want, between high contributions and
high risk and the types of groups that are covered. Mr.
Waddingham is right to point out that many low and middle-income groups
might end up with a system of personal accounts where the total
contributions could be quite low, where the risk will be quite high in
relation to their understanding of the risk and where there will be no
great certainty about what the pot will realise on maturity. We only
have to look in the Sunday newspapers to see the scepticism among
people in the high-income groups about investing in
pensions&#151;with all the uncertainties there are perceived to be
and their desire to invest in housing instead&#151;to understand how
difficult it will be to get many people to invest in the personal
pension accounts.</div>
					<a name="07020669000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am interested to hear the Government&#146;s argument about levelling
down. In fairness to the Government, at Second Reading two different
positions were put from the Conservative Benches about the
&#163;5,000 cap. There was the position of the Front Bench, which is
clearly very uncomfortable with the &#163;5,000 cap, but there was
also the view of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford
(Mr. Davies), who pointed out that it was totally improper
for the Government to meddle in the freedom of people to invest however
much they wantin personal accounts. He thought this was
totally unnecessary Government interference in free
competition.</div>

							<a name="07020669000428"></a>Andrew

					<a name="07020669000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000429"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I quite agree with that, as I indicated in my
comments. He has been known for some time in the Conservative Party and
elsewhere for speaking his mind very candidly on issues that are not
always Conservative Front Bench policy. He did, however, raise an
interesting point, and one which might be an instinctively Conservative
point or distinctively Liberal point even, that giving people the
freedom to invest in their personal accounts as much as they want to
without excessive regulation might be a principle that we would also
want to think about.</div>
					<a name="07020669000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am interested to hear the
Government&#146;s views in relation to the &#163;5,000 cap. I am
interested to know whether they think there may be some people who
would want to make lumpy contributions in particular years and whether
they want to create the freedom for that. Perhaps more significantly,
the issue is whether it is the cap that is fundamental to encouraging
decent occupational provision in the future.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 307</div>
					<a name="07020669000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think what the Conservative
Party is saying is that, if you set that cap too high, it will be all
too easy for firms to simply dump their own pension scheme into the
personal accounts when they might otherwise have kept some other better
scheme. While I understand that point, it may be that those same
employers wouldhave chosen simply to downgrade their level of
contributions to the benchmark Government level, even if the pension
was not in the personal account itself.</div>
					<a name="07020669000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues that the National
Association of Pension Funds and Mr. Waddingham raise in
their evidence are rather more fundamental to trying to encourage and
incentivise businesses in the future to keep on with better schemes,
both DC schemes with higher contribution rates and DB schemes. In an
interesting section in his evidence, Mr. Waddingham talked
about whether we could make DB schemes in the private sector useful
again in the future, perhaps by having much lower accrual
rates&#151;perhaps 1 per cent of salary for each year of service;
whether we could make them career-average rather than final salary to
make them cheaper; whether there were things the Government could do to
encourage risk sharing between employees and employers. There are
already many private sector companies that are sharing the longevity
risk so that people who live longer will end up with a reduced pension

						</b> I do not know which bit the Minister was referring
to when he said that I said tax relief is not effective in encouraging
contributions. He may be anticipating a debate that we are going to
have on new clause 29 or something like that. I think as a whole tax
relief for employees is very effective in incentivising those in the
higher-income groups, perhaps not the lower-income groups. I would,
however, ask him to keep an open mind about any measures that he can
take to incentivise employers to stay in better-quality pension
provision, including DB, and to consider the cost that may be borne by
employers in introducing those schemes, including regulatory costs. I
would not want to see a system with an unlevel playing field against
the personal account. The Government should be seeking to do whatever
they can to keep good-quality employer schemes in place. That may be
about far more than whatever the level of the cap is, which might be an
issue of relatively low importance, although prominent in the
debate.</div>

either/or but not both. I do not think which makes a great deal of
difference to the satisfactory discussion of the Bill, save
this&#151;new clause 2 might fall to the guillotine on Thursday
afternoon. That matter is entirely in the hands of the Committee, not

particularly looking forward to him extending the debate on what the
short title of the Bill should be. We are now reversing that, and I am
making him an offer. If he progresses speedily, then he will be able to
get my argument in full. The point about incentives to save is
generally linked to the argument that I want to make about
means-testing. I have a genuinely substantive offer to make to him. I
hope that he will take the assurance that I will be returning to his
general points under new clause 2, although I will answer a couple of
specifics here.</div>

					<a name="07020669000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 19
provides for the delivery authority to advise the Government on

saying that the authority will not be making a bunch of decisions
without consulting the House, which is a guarantee&#151;or
safeguard&#151;that I hope the Opposition parties will accept. All
that the authority will be doing is advising us. If there are then

						</b> This is a mixture of procedural and substantive
amendments. I intend to go through the procedural ones first and then
deal with the others.</div>
					<a name="07020669000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first is amendment No. 84,
which would leave out the words that make it clear that
&#147;relevant proposals about personal accounts&#148; include
those that have not yet been approved by Parliament. We sought to
include those words for the avoidance of doubt, so that expenditure
conventions are not breached. The delivery authority has no
decision-making powers relating to the implementation of personal
accounts; it is to advise us on policy options. It would not,
therefore, be sensible to limit its advisory role to proposals that
Parliament has already approved. In fact, if the authority is to serve
its purpose, the Government need to take account of its advice, so that
we can ensure that our proposals have been properly scrutinised by it.
Given that the role of the delivery authority is to advise us on
proposals that we hope to bring to the Committee, and that the
amendment would vitiate the purpose of the authority, I hope that the
hon. Member for Eastbourne will be convinced that it would be sensible
to withdraw the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07020669000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Yeovil
introduced amendment No. 67 on IT by saying that it is to do with
concerns about the Government&#146;s computer&#151;but this will
not be run on the Government&#146;s computer. The whole point of
having a delivery authority and a personal accounts board is that
people will not buy a pension from me; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 310</div>they will get it from the personal accounts board and the providers that
it enlists. That applies also to the IT side of things.</div>
					<a name="07020669000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise that getting the
IT right will be a critical factor in the success of personal accounts.
Discussions with pension providers and administrators have made that
even clearer. It will be for the delivery authority, in due course, to
draw on its private sector expertise to make contracts for the personal
accounts scheme and to manage its delivery.</div>

other Department for Work and Pensions IT systems. If the Minister

DWP?</div>

							<a name="07020669000445"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> The projects at the heart of the DWP&#146;s
delivery of benefits and pension entitlements are things in respect of
which it is proper for us to take the lead on contracting and policy
delivery. Of course, we deliver most of those through the private
sector through a contractual relationship. The National Audit Office
recently complimented the Pension Service on its delivery of pension
credit. It is not true that all Government IT projects are disastrous.
With that final controversial statement, I shall turn back to the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07020669000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Which IT
systems are used to deliver personal accounts will be determined by
suppliers within their overall proposals, and proposals will follow
current best practice within IT. That includes reusing existing
equipment where possible and using commercial off-the-shelf packages,
although there will be a role for innovation there as well. The key
point is that it will be for the providers rather than the DWP to
decide and lead on that. We cannot be certain which IT solutions
providers will propose and which will represent the best value for
money. On current plans, we would not expect to select any suppliers
before autumn 2009. So, on the technical detail of the amendment it
would be premature to publish a report in April 2008, which could
prejudice our commercial proceedings. However, I think that the
amendment was probing rather than specifically intended.</div>
					<a name="07020669000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Eastbourne
has sought, through amendment No. 83, to restrict the
authority&#146;s ability to perform functions by replacing the word 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 311</div>&#147;appropriate&#148; with the words &#147;strictly
necessary&#148;. In the context of the advisory body that we seek to
establish, we are worried that this amendment would make it difficult
for the authority to decide whether it is permitted to offer advice to
the Government at all. If the advice would be, for example, merely
useful rather than &#147;strictly necessary&#148;&#151;and not
about something that we must do&#151;then the amendment would prevent
the authority from having the ability to advise us. That cannot be
right, and I am not sure that there is a burning concern about this
issue. The fact that they will be advising us and, again, that the
Department will be taking any decisions is, I hope, a sufficient
safeguard.</div>
					<a name="07020669000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment.
No 20 seeks a commitment on how the delivery authority will implement
the proposals on personal accounts. In particular, it asks that the
authority should take account of the Financial Services Authority and
the pensions regulator. Of course, it is quite right that personal
accounts should be properly regulated when they are delivered,
but&#151;without wanting to sound too much like a broken
record&#151;at this stage the issue is really between the Department
itself and the regulators. We have worked closely with the FSA and the
pensions regulator to develop policy in that area thus far; we will
continue to do so, while ensuring that the appropriate regulatory
structures are put in place at the right time.</div>
					<a name="07020669000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that context, Committee
members will know that we have established an independent review of
pensions institutions to examine how the functions of the FSA, the
pensions regulator and other bodies are aligned with our existing
pensions policy, reforms and market developments. The review will seek
to build consensus on the most efficient and effective way to arrange
those institutional functions; it will make recommendations in the
spring.</div>

							<a name="07020669000446"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> Just before we leave that point, I remember that
under the Pensions Act 2004, when we set up the Pension Protection Fund
and the regulator, there was some early stormy weather.
Ultimately,a protocol had to be agreed on the relative
responsibilities because of gaps in the legislation.Does the
Minister envisage similar protocols, or recommendations on them,
emerging from the review that he mentioned?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000447"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> We would not rule anything in or out at this
stage. It is for Paul Thornton to recommend on that. He is looking at
the general institutional landscape and&#151;in structural and
process terms&#151;whichever recommendations he makes are obviously
for him to make, rather than for us to pre-judge.</div>
					<a name="07020669000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments Nos. 23 and 87,
which are about the provision that enables the Secretary of State to
issue guidance from time to time to the authority, I want to reassure
the hon. Gentleman that we will be open and consultative in our work
with the delivery authority. We have tried, in the process of coming to
these proposals and those in the White Paper on personal accounts, to
involve him and the hon. Member for Yeovil and his colleagues in the
development of our policy. We will continue to do that, to hold a range
of seminars and to consult people widely. It would not, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 312</div>however, be appropriate to tie down the relationship between the
authority and Secretary of State in the detail that is envisaged here.
For example, much of the guidance could be fairly trivial and we do not
see a strong argument for requiring all of it to be published.
</div>
					<a name="07020669000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bigger concern is
about the requirement that such potentially ad hoc guidance be subject
to lengthy parliamentary consultation, which would impede the Secretary
of State&#146;s ability to offer timely guidance.The
relationship between the Government and the authority will be based
around policy advice&#151;we should not mistake it for a formal
relationship such as that which exists between regulators and the
Government. I can reassure the Committee that we will continue to be
open in our dealings with the authority, and I hope that that will be
enough to dissuade the hon. Member for Eastbourne from pressing the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07020669000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 22 and 87 would, I think, make it possible for the authority to
borrow money, which is slightly at odds with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s earlier amendment, which would restrict the way in
which it spends its money. We are trying to tread a path between the
two sets of amendments, because we do not think that borrowing money is
appropriate at this stage. Grant in aid will be the authority&#146;s
sole source of finance and we will set an amount to cover its costs in
full. However, at this stage, the authority&#146;s spending will be
solely on delivering advice.</div>
					<a name="07020669000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the first stage,
expenditure will not require Royal Assent to the second Bill, but will
be aimed at developing policy and the legislative requirements in that
Bill. In that first stage, the Department&#146;s ability to incur
expenditure will be consistent with existing powers. The proposed
second Bill will give the detailof our financing and charges
policy. We are still consulting on it as part of the White Paper and
look forward to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s views as well as those of
the hon. Member for Yeovil. However, we think that such matters are for
the White Paper and potential next Bill, rather than for the Bill
before us.</div>
					<a name="07020669000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have dealt with what might be described as the procedural amendments.
I shall now discuss the points of substance not relating to
means-testing, which I shall return to later. One of the key amendments
proposed by the hon. Member for Eastbourne would set down in
legislation the authority&#146;s objectives. At this stage, that
would be inappropriate because we are still consulting on them. Indeed,
the delivery authority may want to advise us on those objectives. So we
resist the precise intention of the amendment, although he may have
tabled it largely in order to debate the issues, which I am happy to
do.</div>
					<a name="07020669000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Different views
were expressed on Second Reading on the cap of &#163;5,000 or
&#163;3,000, as the hon. Member for Yeovil said,. The hon. Member for
Grantham and Stamford said that there should be no cap at all.
Opposition Front-Bench Members made it clear that our proposed cap was
too high. The hon. Member for Yeovil asked how we got to the current
position, so it may help if I explain. It was agreed that there should
be no transfers in or out of personal accounts, which meant that it
would be hard to combine, in one product, saving in a personal account
with saving in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 313</div>
						another pension, if someone wanted to contribute
above the minimum rate. We looked at figures suggesting that, for those
wanting a replacement rate of 67 per cent., the &#163;3,000 limit
would be insufficient for a proportion of our target group. He asked
for the evidence base for that. I can tell him that it is on page 113
of the December regulatory impact
assessment.</div>
					<a name="07020669000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">White
Papers are intended to be consultative. Our policy of ensuring that our
proposals target low and medium earners was set out for the first time
in the White Paper and we are open to other views on our argument over
contribution levels reaching the replacement rate. The hon. Gentleman
is arguing that we should return to a lower cap, but he needs to
consider the fact that if people in the target group want to get to a
replacement rate of, say, two thirds, they may have to save outside
personal accounts and have two pension
products.</div>

medium earner would get a 67 per cent. benchmark replacement rate about
75 per cent. of the time. At &#163;5,000 it would be closer to
certain that a medium earner could achieve the 67 per cent. replacement
rate. Those are some numbers, although not necessarily the calculation
that the hon. Gentleman asked for. If I can provide him with
information that is not on page 113 of the RIA, which I am sure he has
read, I will happily do so rather than risk another Dan Quayle moment
by trying to calculate rates of return in my
head.</div>
					<a name="07020669000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">To summarise the
matter of the &#163;5,000 or &#163;3,000 cap, I hope that I have
explained the genesis of our suggestion. It was about taking on board
the important point that people made to us&#151;that the automatic
enrolment level of contributions was just a minimum and that we should
consider encouraging people to contribute above it. Given that there
were to be no transfers in or out, that led to an argument for a higher
cap than was suggested by the Turner commission. Concerns have been
raised and we are happy to consider them as part of the White Paper
consultation
process.</div>

							<a name="07020669000456"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I can tell that the Minister&#146;s peroration
is coming on, but since he is trying hardto talk me out of
forcing a Division on amendmentNo. 21, which he has rightly
identified as the key amendment in the group, will he confirm that the
aim of the personal accounts system will be to increase not only the
number of people saving but the overall amount being saved? Does he
agree that that is a good yardstick of success or
failure?</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000457"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Yes, we do think there should be an increase in
the overall amount being saved and we think that automatic enrolment
will bring that about. We are reluctant to place specific targets on
that and, like his party, I think that there is a view that targets
will need to be looked at in a more flexible way in future. On that
general point I certainly
agree.</div>
					<a name="07020669000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment
No. 65, the hon. Member for Yeovil seeks to require the delivery
authority in this initial, advisory stage to produce a report on
maximising participation. He is quite right to say that maximising
participation is critical to the success of the personal accounts
scheme. A key conclusion of the Pensions Commission was that a
voluntary approach would not be sufficient to raise participation to
the levels that we all believe are necessary. Automatic enrolment and,
indeed, the compulsory employer contribution, are critical to raising
participation rates further. We do agree, however, that automatic
enrolment is not sufficient, and we think that issues such as
marketing, providing people with good information, running the scheme
competently, and launching it with confidence are all important as
well. I am not sure that writing a report is absolutely critical to
that. We do think, however, that the general issue of maximising
participation is important. In that context, people who use the word
&#147;mis-selling&#148; need to be careful about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 315</div>
						what they mean. We will have a chance to return
tothat debate later. We agree with the point
behindthe amendment that maximising participation is an
important part of the
policy.</div>
					<a name="07020669000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
debated levelling down a number of times outside this Committee, and
the hon. Member for Eastbourne knows that the starting point of the
policy is that it is levelling up. There is nothing in the current
legislative framework which requires companies to put any contributions
into people&#146;s pensions. By having a compulsory contribution of 3
per cent, we will be levelling up to 3 per cent and, for the first
time, all employees will have access to the kind of employer
contribution that only those with occupational schemes now
enjoy.</div>
					<a name="07020669000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
want to support good existing provision. I hope that I can deal with
this debate relatively quickly by saying yet again that we are pursuing
all of the suggestions that the NAPF has made, other than the
suggestion for a new and extended form of tax relief, which is a matter
not for this Bill but for the Treasury and general tax policy. In the
White Paper we proposed another range of measures, such as ensuring
that there is a simple exemption scheme, a ban on transfers in or out
and a deregulatory review, which will pick up the suggestions that the
hon. Member for Yeovil has made. We have not ruled anything in or ruled
anything out. There is also the possibility of a slightly longer
waiting period for schemes that are making much more generous
contributions.</div>
					<a name="07020669000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
accept the point that we need to do everything that we can to support
good employer provision, but at the end of the day it is for employers
to decide whether they want to make provision. We have researched why
employers provide schemes. They tell us that they do so as a way of
recruiting people and encouraging loyalty, and that they intend by and
large to continue to provide those pensions after the introduction of
personal
accounts.</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000458"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The Minister said that this is levelling up, not
levelling down. In saying that, he sounded a bit complacent about the
levelling-down risk. Am I not right in saying that Lord Turner&#146;s
commission indicated that this was one of the issues that Ministers
were particularly concerned about in discussions with the Pensions
Commission before settling on their
proposals.</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000459"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> That was before my time; I do not want to roam
into an area when I was not in post. I do not intend to sound
complacent. I am saying that we are looking in detail at a range of new
measures to encourage employers who are making contributions. We are
looking at a regulatory review, specific measures suggested by the NAPF
and a good pensions quality mark.</div>
					<a name="07020669000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are comparing the current
regime, in whichthere is no obligation for an employer to make
a contribution, to one in which there will be an obligation to make at
least a 3 per cent. contribution, if the employee is contributing. That
in itself will be a levelling up, to at least 3 per cent, and will
potentially help companies that are already providing company pensions,
because their competitors will have to make the same contributions.
However, beyond that, we want 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 316</div>
						to look at a wide range of other measures to support
employers in providing company pensions. At the end of the day,
companies will provide good company pensions if it helps them to
attract, retain and reward the people who work for them. That is the
fundamental reason why employers say that they intend to continue
providing good company pension
schemes.</div>
					<a name="07020669000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment
No. 39, on the gender impact assessment, the hon. Member for Yeovil
makes a good point of principle. We think that legally a gender impact
assessment will have to be carried out on the next Bill. We recognised
the point by doing a gender impact assessment for this Bill, before it
was legally necessary. We agree with the general principle, but we
think that the assessment should be done by the Department rather than
by the delivery
authority.</div>
					<a name="07020669000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Eastbourne raised a specific point in relation to
Mr. Bee&#146;s comments. My point was that taxes normally
take money away from people, whereas means-tested benefits give people
more money. If one gave individuals the choice between being on
&#163;120 a week with no means-testing or &#163;137.50 with
means-testing, most people would choose &#163;137.50. Our debates are
sometimes in danger of making it sound as if means-tested benefits
reduce the amount of money that people have, but actually they take
people out of poverty. That is something that we are very proud of
having
done.</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000460"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I can understand why the Minister accentuates
that part of the means-testing picture, but surely he accepts the
problem in this context, whether or not one calls it a tax. Let us not
call it a tax for the present purposes. There are two families, two
couples living side by side in identical houses; one family spend their
money on extra holidays or a boat or something, while the other save
for retirement. The ones who saved can be no better off at the end of
the day than the ones who have not saved at
all.</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000461"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> That would be true only if they were on 100 per
cent. withdrawal rates. As a consequence of the savings credit, the
proportion of people on 100 per cent. withdrawal rates has fallen
significantly&#151;I think that it is 50 per cent. of what it was
under the Conservative Government. If the hon. Gentleman accepts, as I
think he does, that there will be some safety net in the system, then
there are two basic options. One can either have a very quick
withdrawal, but with more people on 100 per cent. withdrawal rates, or
a slower withdrawal, but with more people affected by the shallower
withdrawal rate. It is a balance between those two issues. That is
exactly why we introduced the savings credit. The NIESR, for example,
has said that we have achieved the correct balance, or that it is done
pretty much optimally, through the regime of the guarantee credit, but
with the savings credit rewarding people for their savings. That is a
debate to which we shall return on new clause
2.</div>
					<a name="07020669000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s final points were on the comments of Mr.
Laslett, our economist in the area. All that he was saying, I
understand, was that the private sector should work closely with us to
help raise participation rates and that there may well be opportunities
for it to do so within personal accounts. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 317</div>That is one of the reasons why we were very keen to have branded funds,
for example. There may be potential
there.</div>

					<a name="07020669000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">On generic
advice, we are very happy to look at the points made by the Resolution
Foundation, and I will make sure that I draw them to the attention of
Mr. Otto Thoresen, who is leading the generic advice pilot.
One thing is worth saying about what is said by the PPI, by Steve Bee
in his article and by the Front-Bench spokesmen. The issue will be
resolved through the advice that we can give people in the real world
and the decisions that they can make about their saving. We think that
we will be able to give people good incentives to save because, as we
have made clear, they will be able to have good returns over their
working life. We will return to that debate at a later stage, but I
hope that the fact that we are providing a pilot to look at generic
advice will reassure hon. Members that we understand the points that
are being made here and are acting on
them.</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000462"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Is the Minister saying&#151;it would comfort me a
lot if he was&#151;that before personal accounts come in a system
will be introduced that will give free, generic financial advice to the
people who will invest in
them?</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000463"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> That is exactly the pilot that Otto Thoresen is
doing for us and the Treasury. It is an essential part of not just
making personal accounts work but helping people with their financial
planning overall. I am happy to arrange for the hon. Gentleman to meet
Mr. Thoresen so that he can discuss those points with him. I
do not want to make any specific commitments before the pilot reports,
but those are the areas that the pilot will look at. I hope that that
gives him the reassurance that he
seeks.</div>
					<a name="07020669000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Eastbourne raised the issue of RU64, which is really the
FSA&#146;s responsibility. It is an independent decision for it to
take. I understood the points that he made, but the FSA is an
independent regulator and it would not be appropriate for us to mandate
them from this Committee. I hope that that deals with the points that
have been made. It has been an important debate. We share the
objectives of most of the amendments. I hope that my comments have
reassured hon. Members and that they will not press their amendments.
If not, I will encourage my hon. Friends to resist
them.</div>

Waterson:
						</b> The lack of caffeine has momentarily spoilt my
concentration. I am grateful to the Minister who has laboured long and
hard to try to reassure us. I have nothing much more to say on all our
relatively minor amendments. The key issue is amendmentNo. 21.
I am delighted at the Minister&#146;s reassurance that he has an open
mind about the cap. I do not think that I could have left him under any
illusion as to how strongly we and others feel on this
subject.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 318</div>
					<a name="07020669000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister talked about
levelling down really being levelling up. We have heard this before at
one of the interminable seminars. I did not believe it then, and I
certainly do not believe it now. Yes, of course, there is nothing in
law at the moment that makes good employers or any employers make the
provisions that they do. I accept that. But they do, and that is
presumably for the right reasons or for hard-headed reasons of
attracting the right employees and keeping them in post in the long
run. Equally, there would be nothing to stop them from levelling down
in the way that we have described once these reforms come in. In fact
there will be a positive incentive.</div>
					<a name="07020669000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">One interesting survey of
companies&#151;perhaps the one to which the Minister referred&#151;
suggested that many employers would not make any changes. It
subsequently emerged that the human resources directors of those
companies had been surveyed, not the finance directors. I have a
feeling that all over the country finance directors are doing their
sums. On top of all the extra burdens and costs that have been heaped
on pension schemes in the lifetime of this Government, finance
directors are doing their sums on what may be a potential doubling in
the number of participants under auto
enrolment.</div>

						</b> We have looked into that point. We contacted the
chief executives and spoke to the human resources directors only when
specifically asked to do so by the company because they were the person
responsible for the issue. I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman
setting that out
again.</div>
					
					<a name="07020669000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000467"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> That would be very helpful. However, I do not
think that it deals with the genuine concerns expressed not just by the
Opposition Members but by people who know about these things in the
industry. A lot of research has been carried out by firms such as
Deloittes. I am pleased that the Minister will pursue the NAPF&#146;s
suggestions as to how we can deal with the
issue.</div>
					<a name="07020669000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have an
overriding concern, however, about what I call mission creep, and the
target group. I was not wholly convinced by what the Minister said
about having got that point entirely on board. We need to return to a
situation in which the target group is firmly within the
Government&#146;s sights, and in those of the delivery authority. I
am pleased with the clarification about what Mr. Laslett
said the other day. Of course, if that is what he meant, it is a
no-brainer; of course, the Government are going to need the help and
contribution of the private sector if the system is going to work. I
repeat what I said earlier about its being essentially a marketing
exercise.</div>
					<a name="07020669000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">On RU64, let
us see what the FSA produces. All that I would say on that is that I am
not going to press that amendment either, but it would be a somewhat
eccentric result of the reforms if consumers had less protection,
rather than more, at the end of the process.
</div>
					<a name="07020669000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to what I
said about the cap, which is an issue on which we see no need to
compromise. I will not, on this occasion, invite the Committee to vote
on amendment No. 21, but I urge the Minister to have it well in
mind&#151;as his mind continues to be open&#151;that consensus
matters because people need to know that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 319</div>any Government-in-waiting take broadly the same view of the reforms as
the Government of the day. If the impression that that is not the case
were to grow, it would be bound to have a serious effect on the likely
success of the reforms. I am delighted that the Minister has an open
mind, and hope that eventually it will become closed but in the right
direction. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

&#145;the Authority thinks appropriate&#146; and

					<a name="07020669000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a general point to be made here.
In his rather chirpy letter at the beginning of the Committee stage,
the Minister talked about producing draft regulations during the
Committee stage. Unless I have missed them, I have not seen any, and it
would be interesting to know whether we shall see any such regulations
for any clause of the Bill before we finish on Thursday this
week.</div>
					<a name="07020669000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that
the wording should be made a bit clearer and more obvious. We have said
that regulation would be one way of dealing with what the general
guidance might be. It seems that the authority would be able to pick
and choose, as it thinks appropriate according to the way that the
clause is worded, what general guidance it will be subject to and what
not.</div>
					<a name="07020669000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second part
of that subsection talks about generally accepted principles of good
corporate governance, and who can argue with that? However, we then
have subsection (2), which we would remove in its entirety by means of
amendment No. 80, and which qualifies even that expression. So there is
that obligation to follow &#147;good corporate governance&#148;
principles, but that obligation is</div>
					<a name="07020669000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject to guidance falling

only to the extent that the principles in question may reasonably be
regarded as applicable in relation to a statutory
corporation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if I
were not a lawyer, I think that I would recognise a wholly circular
argument when I saw one, and I shall be grateful if the Minister will
try to explain to us precisely what that gobbledegook means, or whether
he agrees with me that we could do a certain amount of judicious
pruning of clause 20.</div>

							<a name="07020669000471"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I shall try to reassure the hon.
Gentleman. We are trying to replicate the arrangements that have been
made for other bodies such as the Office of the Commissioner for Public
Appointments, a precedent that he helpfully cited earlier. It is normal
in legislation to ask an organisation to have regard both to general
principles of good governance&#151;the Higgs report and so
on&#151;and to specific guidance set out by Government. The piece of
gobbledegook, as the hon. Gentleman called it, is intended to state
that where governmental guidance conflicts with corporate governance
guidance or sets a higher standard of behaviour, the authority should
follow the rules appropriate to non-departmental public bodies rather
than the softer test of good corporate practice. I hope that that gives
the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he
wants.</div>
					<a name="07020669000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The general
guidance in question is the extensive guidance issued by the Cabinet
Office, the Treasury and the OCPA, which is intended to cover all
eventualities for every type of public body. Principles of good
corporate governance, on the other hand, include those outlined in the
Financial Reporting Council&#146;s combined code, which is based on
the Higgs report. It is aimed more widely to include private sector
organisations. Both sets of guidance outline extensive standards and
practices, many of which will be appropriate to the delivery
authority.</div>
					<a name="07020669000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, in some instances the principles of good corporate governance are
less strict than the guidance specifically for public bodies. An
example that comes to mind is the recruitment process for members of
the board. I understand that the combined code states that in certain
circumstances there need be no external publication of vacancies,
whereas the OCPA&#146;s code of practice requires all vacancies to be
advertised externally. The clause sets out the fact that the board will
have to obey the stricter test rather than the more general one of good
corporate
governance.</div>
					<a name="07020669000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Putting
the general guidelines into regulations would achieve nothing more than
the clause as it stands. Additionally, whenever the guidance was
changed we would have to haul the hon. Member for Eastbourne up to a
Committee Room and pass more regulations, which he would be able to
debate. That might give him a different incentive from that which it
gives the hon. Member for Yeovil, but I argue that it is not necessary.
I hope that I have reassured him that there is a proper control
framework, and that he will not press the
amendments.</div>

							<a name="07020669000474"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I wish to raise a specific matter on new clause
4, and some interesting issues arise from the mere existence of clause
21. I shall turn to them in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="07020669000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4
is, in a sense, the stake through heart of the delivery authority. It
may be overkill, which I am sure is what the Minister will say. It is
intended to ensure that there will be a moment when the delivery
authority stops and the board starts. I have made the point in other
contexts that we want to be sure that the delivery authority will not
slowly morph into the personal accounts board. The two bodies must
tackle distinct issues, different skill sets are needed and they will
have completely different roles. One will produce advice and consider
the whole design of the scheme and how it will be set up, and the other
will be in the business of running it capably and efficiently and
meeting the criteria that will presumably be stamped in the next Bill.
That was what we wished to deal with in amendment No.
21.</div>
					<a name="07020669000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is to make it
absolutely clear that the delivery authority will be wound up as soon
as its task has been performed, and no later than April 2012 in any
event. Prior to that, the chairman can certify that it has completed
its task and its role is at an end. That was in new clause 4.</div>
					<a name="07020669000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 21 is interesting in
that it is based on meeting the condition in subsection (3), which is
that</div>
					<a name="07020669000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as a result of the
abandonment or modification of any relevant proposals about personal
accounts, it appears to the Secretary of State that it is no longer
necessary for the Authority to continue to
exist.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020669000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">That has the feel
of some serious cold feet on the part of the Department. To go to such
lengths in a long clause to ensure that the concept of personal
accounts can be abandoned at some point in the
future&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>It is a very important clause. I
am keen to draw out from the Minister why the Government are being so
ultra-cautious.</div>
					<a name="07020669000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
push the issue of consensus drivers back to the Minister, it is
important that we should all try to present an image of confidence and
enthusiasm about the future of personal accounts if we are to
engagethe target audience&#151;or even the vast majority of
the population, as the Government now seem to be doing&#151;in them.
What have they in mind in using the words abandonment or modification?
It would have to be a pretty significant modification to require the
winding up of the delivery authority. Do they intend that it should be
taken over by some other body? Is it another example of the
Treasury&#146;s final control over whether this goes ahead? There
have been rumours for some time that the current Chancellor is less
than enthusiastic about personal accounts and might take a different
line as and when he becomes Prime Minister. I do not expect the
Minister to comment on that, but it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 322</div>important that he tell the Committee what the concerns are. Which issues
created the lack of confidence that produced subsection
(3)?</div>

							<a name="07020669000475"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman really does not need to worry.
The subsection is there only out of respect for the Opposition, in that
they might not support the personal accounts Bill that we are hoping to
introduce. If that Bill did not command the support of Parliament, we
would need to wind up the delivery authority, so this represents
prudence. We are not taking Parliament for granted&#151;which, as he
knows, we do not like to do&#151;but are including the measure so
that we will not have to legislate again in order to get rid of the
delivery authority.</div>
					<a name="07020669000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know whether that gives the hon. Gentleman sufficient
reassurance. He also made a more general point about the phasing of the
delivery authority. He and I might have slightly different views about
how the process will work, so let me set out how we see it. The first
of the three stages will be the advisory delivery authority, the second
will be for it to have the power of executive authority over certain
matters to be described and decided in the next Bill, and then we will
go over to the personal accounts board. As we said in the White Paper,
we do not plan to wind up the delivery authority until its job is done.
There might be some overlap between the authority and the personal
accounts board. It would be sensible to expect a large degree of
continuity between the delivery authority and the personal accounts
board. That does not mean that everybody who works for the authority
would work for the board, as different skills might be needed, but we
are keen to maintain the expertise of the authority during the
transition to the board. That might give it a good incentive to provide
us with
advice.</div>

							<a name="07020669000476"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I can see the argument for some overlap. After
the previous legislation, however, I remember that people who worked
for the old pensions regulator and moved to the new regulator found
that a different culture had been introduced through the 2004 Act. Does
the Minister envisage that employees of the new authority will be
TUPE&#146;d across to the board? In the instance to which I just
referred, there were concerns about people who had worked for the old
regulator having an approach that was different from what was needed
for the new, more aggressive
regulator.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020669000477"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I think that that issue will be addressed on a
case-by-case basis, but there should be some continuity between the
authority and the board. We will have plenty of opportunity to debate
the arrangement as part of the next Bill that we hope for.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 323</div>
					<a name="07020669000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have set out the
three stages that we expect. It is important that the Secretary of
State should wind up the authority, rather than the chairman having the
power to wind it up, as we are not sure that that would be the right
approach. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman the comfort that he
needs on that
amendment.</div>
