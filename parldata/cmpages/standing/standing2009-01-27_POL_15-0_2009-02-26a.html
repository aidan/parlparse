Chairman:</b> I have cut it rather fine this morning. I had a
particular problem that I will not go into with the Committee. We made
excellent progress on Tuesday and have arrived at clause 89, to which a
number of amendments have been tabled. I gather that the first group is
rather important. We have to break at 10.25 to get into the House for
Prayers and Question Time. I have no doubt that the arrangements made
through the usual channels will be met, although perhaps with some
difficulty and requiring some discipline on both sides of the
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000193"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Good morning, Sir Nicholas. We are pleased that
you have arrived safely and on time, even if it was a little touch and
go. Good morning to the
Committee.</div><a name="09022644000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
your opening, Sir Nicholas, you pointed out that this is an extremely
important group of proposals. I am sure that the hon. Members for
Hornchurch, for Chesterfield and for Oxford, West and Abingdon will
agree that there are important points that must be made. We have
managed to have lengthy debates in Committee when necessary, while
making progress. I think that we may spend some time discussing these
proposals and I see no problem with that. I am sure that other hon.
Members will agree. Quite frankly, I am sure that the public would
expect us to reflect on and debate the issue of gangs at some length,
given its
importance.</div><a name="09022644000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will make a few introductory remarks before reading for the record what
the provisions will do. I am sure that hon. Members will wish to
respond to that and I will respond to their points as we go
through.</div><a name="09022644000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said before, I believe that there are significant pieces of
social reform and public policy changes in the Bill. I will not go
through them all, but Committee members will agree that we have had
worthwhile and significant debates on alcohol, prostitution and police
collaboration, to name just three. The issue of gangs is as important
as any other that we have discussed. I am sure all Committee members
agree that the phenomenon of gangs is one of the big questions that
confronts us. It is easy to make populist remarks on how we should deal
with gangs and to produce throwaway headline solutions. Trying to
achieve something that deals with the issue is much more
difficult.</div><a name="09022644000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have looked at the Liberal Democrat amendments that were not selected
and at those tabled by the hon. Members for Bury St. Edmunds and for
Hornchurch 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column564" />Column number: 564</div>that were selected. It is clear that the amendments reflect deep thought
and consideration on this issue. The report by the right hon. Member
for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) was also
a valuable piece of work. Many other reports have been done on this,
and that is worth putting on the record as well.</div>
<a name="09022644000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be
clear what we are not talking about. We are not talking about a group
of kids at the end of a street. We are not talking about some young
people hanging around, and I will come to whether they are under 18 or
over 18 in a moment because there is an issue there. We are not talking
about people hanging around on a park bench. People often ask me,
&#147;Didn&#146;t you sit around outside on a park bench?&#148; I
was often near a telephone box. It was even push button A and push
button B, if hon. Members can remember that. That shows how long ago it
was.</div>
<a name="09022644000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
measures must not be looked at in the context of trying to criminalise
young people up to 23 or 24, or whatever. We can argue about the exact
age later. We are not trying to criminalise young people. These new
clauses are about tackling serious, violent, aggressive, dangerous
individuals. Those individuals have no regard for other members of
society. Frankly, they do not frighten other people, they terrorise
them. It would be remiss of this Committee and of this or any
Government not to reflect on what we do about that.</div>
<a name="09022644000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">This may be a
point that the hon. Members for Chesterfield and for Oxford, West and
Abingdon may raise, but if these people can be prosecuted through the
criminal justice system it should be the first option. Nobody disagrees
with that. Let us try to lay two myths: first, this is not about
teenagers or people slightly older than that hanging around. Secondly,
it is not about avoiding using the criminal justice system when that is
the best option. It is important to put that on the
record.</div><a name="09022644000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Public
policy with respect to gangs, as with respect to  all such
matters, is undermined by debate about whether one is a wishy-washy
liberal or a tough law enforcer, wanting either to hang and flog or to
hug everyone. This area of public policy is bedevilled by that schism.
No one who is of sound mind would argue that it is sufficient for
someone who is dangerous, is breaking the law and has done seriously
wrong, simply to say sorry. Tough law enforcement is the appropriate
and the first
approach.</div><a name="09022644000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alongside
that, we want a preventive approach and a diversionary approach as
well. I had the pleasure over the weekend of going out on Operation
Staysafe, which is about police and children&#146;s services working
together to try to get vulnerable young people off the streets,
particularly when they are under the influence of alcohol, taking them
to a place of safety, working with social workers and then engaging the
parents. The shadow Home Secretary was apparently trying to do
something similar on Monday
morning.</div><a name="09022644000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
introductory remarks are important. What are we trying to deal with
here? If they have not already done so, all members of the Committee
should have a look on the internet&#151;it is hard to know how to
describe this, without giving gangs the respect they crave&#151;to
see some of the musings and information about gangs. Anybody who says
that we are trying to deal with kids hanging around should go on the
internet and have a look. It is appalling. The most appalling thing
about the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column565" />Column number: 565</div>gang stuff on the internet is that it is put there, not by people
talking about things they do not do but by those actually boasting
about the things they do. It is a way of communicating and trying to
get at other gangs. Just Google &#147;gangs&#148;, &#147;street
gangs&#148; or &#147;violent street gangs&#148; in any major city
and see what comes up. That is what we are trying to wrestle with. This
is about serious street violence and trying to do something about
it.</div>
<a name="09022644000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">After my
introductory remarks I will read into the record what the new clauses
do. In looking at what to do, we saw the success of what happened in
Birmingham and then determined&#151;following the judgment in the
courts&#151;that we needed to correct and change the law. This
approach&#151;where people feel it appropriate and with the proper
judicial oversight&#151;could be used subject to two conditions:
first, that somebody had been engaged in or had encouraged or assisted
gang-related violence and, secondly, to prevent it in the
future.</div>
<a name="09022644000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
key new clauses&#151;I suggest members of the Committee read it
again&#151;includes some prohibitions and requirements. I will pick a
couple of the prohibitions to give a flavour to the Committee. For
example, somebody cannot go into a certain area. This is to try to
combat the territoriality&#151;the postcoding&#151;that gangs have.
There are people dying on our streets because they go into the wrong
postcode. That is how serious it is. There are young&#151;and
older&#151;people being shot, stabbed or attacked because they go
into the wrong postcode area. So there is an issue of
territoriality.</div>
<a name="09022644000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
issue I would draw attention to is that of wearing colours. Somebody
asked me about football supporters. I am not talking about football
supporters. One has to inject some common sense and realism into this.
I am not talking about somebody wearing a rosette or a scout badge.
That debases the debate. Anybody with an ounce of sense realises that.
We are talking about people who wear colours to display the gang they
belong to so that when they go into other areas people will know. It is
like a uniform. If we fail to recognise some of this, we will not be
able to tackle the scale of the issue. Before I, the hon. Member for
Hornchurch or others are attacked, I emphasise that I am not saying
that this applies to every young person or that it takes place in every
area of the country. Let us get that out of the way before we are
attacked for portraying everybody in that way. I am not. The vast
majority are law-abiding. I am talking about a serious problem in some
areas.</div>
<a name="09022644000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
a prohibition regarding the internet, which tackles something I was
talking about earlier. A further very disturbing issue is the use of
animals as weapons; the increasing use of dogs. We know what sort of
dogs we are talking about. They are used as status symbols but they are
also used to intimidate, attack and threaten. That is where we are with
some of this. That is what this measure tackles. Many of us have
visited police forces and communities, and the police increasingly say
that such use of animals is of growing concern. Before anybody starts,
I am not talking about poodles or pets, but about animals that are used
as weapons. I am labouring the point, but if we are not careful the
debate will move off sensible discussion about real problems and on to
concerns&#151;albeit, I suppose, legitimate&#151;that can undermine
the debate. So, the prohibitions are
important.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column566" />Column number: 566</div><a name="09022644000166"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09022644000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come now to the under-18s. The injunctions in Birmingham apply to
over-18s; injunctions for under-18s are difficult. Technically, the
injunctions can apply to under-18s. That is an important point, because
there will be a lot of discussion about who the injunctions apply to
and their impact on children. Injunctions, however, have to be
enforceable and it is unlikely that they would be enforceable for
somebody under 18: the court cannot fine someone who does not have a
source of income and most gang members would not have a legitimate
source. Nor can the court sentence someone under 18 to detention in a
young offenders institution&#151;the penalty for breaching one of
these orders&#151;for a civil contempt of
court.</div><a name="09022644000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Changing
the law to enable the courts to use injunctions for under-18s would
involve a major change in how civil law interacts with
minors&#151;under-18s. However, I recognise that a tool for managing
under-18s would be welcomed by those on the front line, seeking to
manage gangs, and by those communities most affected by gangs. This
area is very contentious and I will therefore try to involve others. I
have asked my officials to work with others across Government to see
whether we can amend how civil injunctions work to enable the provision
to be used for under-18s. I am progressing this with trepidation and
care and I shall try to involve as many people as
possible.</div><a name="09022644000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
injunctions are good, but as they are constituted there are problems
with under-18s. The hon. Member for Hornchurch is a lawyer and will
understand that better than I do. However, who has been arrested for
the recent murder in London? Who has been arrested for many of the
other murders, not only in London but across the country? It is not
people aged 19, 20 or 21, although it often is&#151;many of the
injunctions in Birmingham were against people of that age group. Those
arrested in these cases are aged 15, 16 or 17 and, as the hon. Member
for Hornchurch says, there are problems with even younger
people.</div><a name="09022644000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a difficult area. I do not mean this sarcastically, but it is a
shame that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is not here. I
can hear what the retort will be, as the Bill progresses through the
House, about using such injunctions against under-18s. But no one
standing where I am, with my responsibilities, could ignore what was
happening on the street. The public policy challenge&#151;the social
reform challenge&#151;is how to tackle that, given, as I said at the
beginning, that we would use the criminal law first and try to divert
people. But there are now 15, 16 and 17-year-olds and younger children
involved in serious violent gang activity, and 15, 16 and 17-year-olds
who are not involved in such activity but are now before the courts on
a murder charge. Our task is to see whether a civil preventive tool,
alongside everything else, would prevent that from happening in the
first place. We should find a way, no matter how difficult or
controversial, to legislate and create a civil preventive tool that
prevents a 16-year-old from going to an area, wearing colours,
associating with others or being used by people over 18 to do their
errands or dirty work, which is increasingly happening as 19, 20 and
21-year-olds use 11, 12 and 13-year-olds to do things for them. If we
can do that alongside the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column567" />Column number: 567</div>action that we are taking, as well as the measures that we need to take,
we will contribute to making our streets
safer.</div><a name="09022644000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
feel very passionate about the issue, because I chair a
cross-departmental group that is part of our tackling knives action
programme. The group examines events on a weekly basis and met
yesterday morning. No murders had been reported to it for a number of
weeks, but it was told of four murders at yesterday&#146;s meeting.
That is what we are about; we are trying to prevent those from
happening. Anyone can make jibes, but all will agree that we need to
prevent people from being murdered on the streets, wherever they may
be. The debate centres on how best to do
that.</div><a name="09022644000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise for detaining members of the Committee on this issue, but I
hope that those important remarks are helpful to them. I know that the
hon. Members for Hornchurch and for Chesterfield, and maybe other
members of the Committee, will have something to say on this crucial
and fundamental debate. I should also note that Government amendment
290 relates to England and
Wales.</div><a name="09022644000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will spend a few moments on further amendments. New clause 11 sets out
the two conditions that must be satisfied before a court may grant an
injunction. The first is that the court should be satisfied that the
respondent&#146;s past conduct has included engaging in, encouraging
or assisting gang-related violence. The court must consider evidence of
past behaviour to a civil standard on the balance of probabilities. The
second condition is that the injunction is necessary to prevent the
respondent in engaging, encouraging or assisting gang-related violence
and/or to protect the respondent from such violence. A court may make
such prohibitions or requirements as it considers appropriate, provided
that they are necessary either to prevent the respondent from engaging
in, encouraging or assisting gang-related violence, or to protect the
respondent from such violence. New clause 12 provides for
that in more
detail.</div><a name="09022644000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 11 also defines gang-related violence
as</div><a name="09022644000155"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;violence
or a threat of violence which occurs in the course of the activities of
a gang or is otherwise related to such
activities.&#148;.</div><a name="09022644000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause also stipulates that threats of violence should be included in
the definition. Whether violence or threats of violence are
gang-related will be a matter for the court to
decide.</div><a name="09022644000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 11(4) explains that a court may</div>
<a name="09022644000156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prohibit the
respondent from doing anything described in the
injunction&#148;</div><a name="09022644000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div><a name="09022644000157"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;require
the respondent to do anything described in the
injunction.&#148;</div><a name="09022644000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, a court must be satisfied that those prohibitions or
requirements are necessary in order to prevent gang-related violence as
per subsection (3) of the same
clause.</div><a name="09022644000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 12 gives examples of the effects that prohibitions or
requirements could have, and that a court could consider, including
effectively preventing gang-related violence. The Government have
learnt from Birmingham city council&#146;s use of injunctions that
exclusion zones and non-association prohibitions can be particularly
effective in disrupting gang-related violence. Our intention is that
courts should be confident in applying such restrictions, and they are
therefore provided for in subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b). The
clause&#146;s requirements include notifying the applicant of a
change of address, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column568" />Column number: 568</div>a curfew, or the need to participate in particular activities.
Requirements must have the effect of preventing gang-related
violence.</div><a name="09022644000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
types of activities that we envisage respondents being required to
participate in include community call-in or mentoring sessions. Such
activities give authorities and community leaders the opportunity to
engage with gang members, to explain the effects of gang-related
violence in their area, and to offer them opportunities to learn,
develop and exit the gang lifestyle. Committee members will also note
that we have included a specific safeguard&#151;that is really
important&#151;within the clause that prevents prohibitions or
requirements from interfering with religious beliefs, or the
respondent&#146;s work or education.
</div><a name="09022644000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 13 guides how courts should manage the length of the injunction.
It makes it clear that the injunction can be made for a fixed period,
or until further order of the court. It also allows the court to set a
review hearing, during the life of the injunction, to consider whether
it needs to be varied or
discharged.</div><a name="09022644000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022644000194"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Will my hon.
Friend clarify two points? The first point regards sanctions, which I
presume he will come on to. The second point is on the issue of what is
accepted as a religion, because that can be very important with young
people, for example, with Rastas. There are different religions that
might not be
recognised.</div><a name="09022644000068"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000195"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Unless I hear to the contrary, my understanding is
that religion is a matter for the courts to determine, but it might be
something that we need to include in the guidance. There is guidance,
which has to be published, about how the new clauses are implemented by
the courts. Maybe we should include something about religion in the
guidance to address the concern put by my hon.
Friend.</div><a name="09022644000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000196"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
clarification, but will there be any consultation about that? When
Rastafarianism was popular among young people, the conflict over what
people wore and what they carried&#151;badges and suchlike&#151;was
enormous, because the religion was not
recognised.</div><a name="09022644000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000197"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> There will be consultation about the code of
practice, but I take the point made by my hon. Friend, which is a good
one. I want the measure to be effective, so we need to reach a
consensus and clarify what constitutes a religious item, or religious
clothing, and we will do so within the code of practice.</div>
<a name="09022644000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend asked what sanctions are available. The initial order is made on
the balance of probability. Prohibitions attached to the order can be
subject to the power of arrest, although one can go to the court and
ask for a warrant to arrest someone if there is a belief that a
prohibition has been breached. Unlike an antisocial behaviour order, if
there is a breach of a prohibition, there is a civil penalty of up to
two years, which is available to the courts and, importantly, there is
not a criminal record for any breach.</div>
<a name="09022644000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a shame
that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is not here, because
I am sure that that would be one of his questions&#151;any breach has
to be proved to a criminal standard, not to the civil standard. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column569" />Column number: 569</div>The civil standard is for the granting of the order and with any
breach&#151;the court process that takes place after that&#151;but
any proof has to be to a criminal standard or &#147;beyond reasonable
doubt&#148;. I hope that that is helpful to my hon. Friend the Member
for Northampton,
North.</div><a name="09022644000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000198"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> If the order is breached, could someone get a
custodial sentence? It is really important that we do not get gangs
reforming in, for example, secure training centres and that arguments
do not continue there. I would be very concerned about
that.</div>
<a name="09022644000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000199"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Yes&#151;there can be custodial sentences. The
first one is for up to two years, so custodial sentences can be given.
As I have said, proof has to be to a criminal standard. The person
concerned does not get a criminal record, but my hon. Friend has made
an important point about
custody.</div><a name="09022644000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
injunctions are to be an effective tool for preventing gang violence,
the police must be able to take swift action. New clause 13 enables the
power of arrest to be attached to any of the prohibitions or to some of
the requirements of an injunction. That will enable the police to
arrest, without warrant, any individual suspected of breach. That is
dealt with further in new clauses 20 and 21.</div>
<a name="09022644000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 14
is a short clause, which simply sets out the fact that applications may
be made to the court by the police, including the British Transport
police, or a local authority. It is essential that local authorities
are able to apply for those injunctions, as they have shared
responsibility for managing crime and disorder, and have developed
skills and expertise in obtaining civil injunctions. The police are
often in a better position to obtain injunctions immediately,
particularly following critical incidents when intelligence suggests
that there might be an imminent reprisal. We know that gangs travel
from city to city, so it is important that the British Transport police
can obtain injunctions to protect users of the public transport
network.</div>
<a name="09022644000167"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="09022644000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 15 requires the applicant to consult other relevant authorities
before applying for an injunction. The hon. Member for Hornchurch has
tabled an amendment relating to the issue of who should be consulted,
so it might be helpful to mention that now rather than later. I urge
him to withdraw the amendment, but I will reflect on the issue it
raises, because there is a need to consider whether the consultation
should be broader than that set out in the new clause. His amendment
proposes that the primary care trust and various health agencies be
consulted, and I give him a commitment that we will reflect on that
proposal.</div><a name="09022644000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
applicant must consult any other local authority and chief officer of
police whom they consider it appropriate to consult. The purpose of
that provision is to encourage the two key agencies involved in
managing gangs to co-operate in formulating a co-ordinated approach to
enforcement and exit strategies for gang members.</div>
<a name="09022644000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 16
will make it possible for a court to grant an interim injunction in the
first instance without the presence of the respondent&#151;that is
known as an application without notice. Police can receive intelligence

<div class="Column"><a name="Column570" />Column number: 570</div>that a retaliation attack might occur, sometimes within 24 hours, so by
allowing the applicant local authority or police force to obtain an
interim injunction without giving notice to the respondent, that attack
can be prevented swiftly and effectively. I know that the hon. Member
for Hornchurch has visited Manchester, where it has been said that it
is essential that the police are able to act really quickly in some
cases to prevent serous violence. The applicant would not have to
consult relevant local authorities or police forces before making such
an application, as that would not be practical. They would, however, be
required to consult before the full hearing. As I have said, that
provision is absolutely necessary to allow the use of injunctions as a
preventive tool.</div>
<a name="09022644000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a court
cannot make full fines, or has to adjourn for further information
and/or evidence to be heard, it may make an interim injunction. New
clause 17 relates to an interim injunction made on notice to the
respondent. The test for granting such an interim injunction is that it
is &#147;just and convenient&#148; to do so. The court will not
have the power to grant a prohibition or requirement until there is a
further order of the court. The court would typically grant an interim
injunction when it needs to adjourn the hearing to a later
date.</div><a name="09022644000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 18 is similar to new clause 17, but it relates to interim
injunctions that have been granted without notice. All injunctions must
meet the conditions set out in new clause 11. New clause 18 provides an
additional safeguard for interim injunctions granted without notice and
requires the court to consider it necessary, rather than just and
convenient to do so. That makes it clear that if the application is not
urgent it should be made on notice to the
respondent.</div><a name="09022644000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government consider that it would be unfair for an interim injunction
made under those circumstances either to include prohibitions or
requirements to be in force until further order or to have the effect
of requiring the respondent to participate in particular activities.
Therefore, those have been specifically excluded. New clause 19 makes
provision for an injunction to be varied or discharged. That is
extremely important and makes the provision different from antisocial
behaviour orders. Such action could be taken on review or if an
application for variance or discharge is made either by the original
injunction application or by the respondent. The purpose of the review
set by the court is to examine whether the injunction&#146;s existing
provisions are appropriate, whether the respondent is complying and
whether it is necessary to add to, amend or discharge the
injunction.</div>
<a name="09022644000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have made
provision for the respondent to apply to the court for variation or
discharge, which allows them to put the case to a court that they have
changed their behaviour, which is what we want, and should no longer be
subject to such conditions. It also acts as a safeguard against unduly
punitive prohibitions or requirements. Before an application for
variance or discharge is made by the person who applied for the
injunction, they must notify anyone they consulted under new clause
15.</div><a name="09022644000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
of the Committee will recall that new clause 13(5) allows a
court to attach the power of arrest to prohibitions or certain
requirements, but that will not be available for a requirement that an
individual participate in positive activities. New clause 20 relates to
the making of such an arrest &#147;without warrant&#148;. It
provides that a constable &#147;may arrest&#148; someone who is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column571" />Column number: 571</div>suspected of being in breach of an injunction. If an arrest is made, the
constable must inform the person who applied for the injunction, and
ensure that the respondent is brought before a court within 24 hours.
That ensures that a suspected breach can be dealt with promptly and
that an individual can be remanded in custody if necessary&#151;a
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North. New
schedule 2 deals further with the power to
remand.</div><a name="09022644000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the power of arrest can be attached to most prohibitions or
requirements, it is possible that the court will not do so. If it were
suspected that a prohibition or requirement had been breached, and
there was no power of arrest attached, the respondent can only be
brought before the court on notice. This notice has to be 14 clear
days. New clause 21 allows the person who applied for an injunction to
apply to a relevant judge for a warrant of arrest if they consider that
any prohibition or requirement has been breached. The judge must have
&#147;reasonable grounds&#148; to believe that the respondent is in
breach before issuing a warrant. The purpose is to allow the applicant
to apply to the court for a warrant, which would enable them to deal
with a breach rapidly, particularly where there is no existing
provision to do so. If someone is brought before a court but the matter
is not disposed of, the court may remand that person, as set out in new
clause
20.</div><a name="09022644000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 22 provides that the respondent may be remanded for a medical
examination and report if the court &#147;has reason to
consider&#148; that that is necessary. This applies only to a
situation where a respondent has been brought before a relevant court
for a suspected breach, having been arrested. It is irrelevant whether
they have been arrested with or without a warrant. The relevant courts
do not have the power to remand individuals for medical examination,
unless specified. Therefore, this new clause is necessary to allow the
courts to ensure the physical and mental well-being of the
respondent.</div><a name="09022644000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 23 inserts new schedule 2, which makes provisions for remand in
relation to an arrest made under new clauses 20 and 21. New clause 24
provides that the Secretary of State
must</div><a name="09022644000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;issue
guidance relating to injunctions under this
Part.&#148;</div><a name="09022644000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State must also publish that guidance, which brings me to
another point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North
made. I want to consider the measure a little further, to decide
whether we should have to lay it before Parliament, and so on. I will
look at new clause 24, with respect to how we issue and publish the
guidance.</div><a name="09022644000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
guidance will provide detailed clarification on how various provisions
of the injunction should be used. It will set out the appropriate
situations in which an application to the courts could be made. It will
also explain how police and local authorities should consult and work
together to manage the injunction process. The Secretary of State will
be able to revise any guidance issued, but those revisions must be
published. Applicants must have regard to any
guidance.</div><a name="09022644000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 25 enables rules of court to provide that powers conferred on
county courts are exercisable by judges of the county court and
district judges. It also stipulates that rules of court may allow for
appeals to be made</div>
<a name="09022644000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;without giving
notice&#148;&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column572" />Column number: 572</div><a name="09022644000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is, notice of the
appeal&#151;</div><a name="09022644000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
the
respondent.&#148;</div><a name="09022644000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 26 clarifies the interpretation of particular terms used in the
new provision. New schedule 2 applies when the court has the power of
remand under new clauses 20 and 21. The court may remand the individual
in custody or on bail; a remand on bail may be on conditional bail. The
maximum period for which an individual may be remanded in custody is
eight clear days, unless both the individual and the applicant agree
otherwise. A court may further remand the individual. A court may order
the further remand in custody of an individual in their absence if the
individual is unable to attend court for their further remand hearing.
The court may order the taking of a recognisance before the individual
is released on
bail.</div><a name="09022644000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have mentioned the second amendment tabled by the hon. Member for
Hornchurch, and I will look at the issue of who should be consulted.
There is a real debate to be had about amendment (a) to new clause 11,
which deals with the issue of how a gang is defined. We have put a
definition in new clause 11, and we have said that it is for the courts
to decide whether violence is &#147;gang-related violence&#148;. In
his amendment, the hon. Gentleman is tries to define a gang. He talks
about &#147;a discernible group&#148;, which must be engaged in
organised &#147;criminal activity&#148;, and various other
features. I do not disagree with any of the points that he makes, nor
do I think that there is any point of difference between us on this
issue.</div>
<a name="09022644000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
possible, however, that something else may crop up in a year or two and
the court will not have the flexibility because we have defined it in
that way. In all honesty, I have tried to think of something that would
not come under one of those four headings, and it was difficult, but I
am reluctant to constrain the courts, then find in a year that
something has occurred that is beyond the definition. However, I do not
think that that is point of difference. I will slightly tease the hon.
Gentleman. I am the one who is often criticised by Liberty, but I could
not help noticing that it said:</div>
<a name="09022644000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do
not, however, believe that additional amendments proposed, introducing
a definition of &#145;gang&#146; are satisfactory. Those amendments
would still mean that any group of people that have an
&#147;identifying organisation feature&#148; would be captured by
this provision, which could include the local boxing
group.&#148;</div>
<a name="09022644000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that
that is true, because the court would not do such a
thing.</div><a name="09022644000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is interesting that in his report, the right hon. Member for Chingford
and Woodford Green said that all the conditions should be met. I note
that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hornchurch says that
just one of the conditions should be met. The debate on how to define a
gang, even for people who agree, is fraught with
difficulty.</div>
<a name="09022644000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022644000200"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): I welcome the
Minister&#146;s approach in explaining and setting out his case. I
understand the intention and the focus of the new clause on the violent
side of gang activity. The point that I come back to, which I will
develop further in my own comments, is that we need to ensure that the
powers that are being created are structured and focused, such that,
over time, they do not become applicable to people whom he and I would
not define as gangs in this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column573" />Column number: 573</div>debate. That is a cause for concern, and that is why I tabled the
probing amendments and advocated the suggested
changes.</div>
<a name="09022644000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000201"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I do not disagree with that, and I will reflect on
it. We are all trying to get at the serious individuals who are part of
an organised group, who wear colours, have territory, live according to
their own rules, do not care about society&#146;s rules and so on. My
initial thinking is that if we define it as &#147;gang-related
violence&#148;, the court, in its wisdom and sense, would do what is
implicit, but the hon. Gentleman is trying to make it explicit. I will
reflect on the matter and see whether we need to do more to ensure that
the issues that the hon. Gentleman is worried about do not
arise.</div>
<a name="09022644000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
finish where I started. I think that this is, if not the most important
discussion that we have had, certainly on a par with anything else.
Birmingham&#146;s experience of using the injunction shows that it
reduces violence. The mothers of gang members were asking for
injunctions to be placed on young people, because they saw their effect
in reducing violence and serious violence. I know that the courts took
the attitude that they did, which is why the clauses were late, and we
are taking the first opportunity to clarify the law, so that the
injunctions are available across the country to help to prevent the
most serious violence. The effect of the injunctions will be that
people who would have been killed or badly attacked, will not be and
that people who would have ended up in prison and had their lives
ruined, will not. I apologise to the Committee for taking so long, but
it is an important debate. I wanted to introduce it in that manner and
put in conclusions, as well as putting what the new clauses are about
on the
record.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000202"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am sure that the Committee is very grateful to
the Minister for the full, clear and transparent way in which he has
put forward these important
issues.</div><a name="09022644000168"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="09022644000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022644000203"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b><b class="B">:</b> May I say from the outset that the
Minister&#146;s analysis of the problems experienced in some
communities in this country should give huge cause for concern? He
spoke of the violence and of the fact that many people living in
certain areas are terrorised by small but hardened and pernicious
groups of individuals. We must explore all avenues to protect those
communities and to prevent such individuals from conducting their
appalling
acts.</div><a name="09022644000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been a growth in gang violence in recent years. It is linked to gun
crime and violent crime in certain areas of the country. I agree with
the Minister that it does not happen everywhere. However, I understand
from talking to the police in certain areas that it is clear that there
is a problem with organised gang activity. We must be careful in
framing and defining the measures that are thought appropriate or
necessary to address such unacceptable behaviour, with its links to
violence, murders, shootings and other horrendous activities. That is
the context in which we are having the debate. We must ensure that the
proposals address the concerns that are rightly held and that they are
not subsequently used in more general and inappropriate ways that are
not intended by the Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column574" />Column number: 574</div><a name="09022644000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should be
under no illusions; too many young lives are lost because of absurd
disputes over postcode territories or minor disagreements in which a
perverse notion of respect is seen to be challenged. The Minister was
right to identify the issue of structure and organisation, such as the
wearing of colours. Inadvertently wearing the wrong colour clothing in
a particular area can put one at risk of being attacked. It is
ridiculous and absurd when thought of in those simple terms, but that
is the reality in certain areas of our country. Simply by wearing a
particular colour in a particular area, a person can put themselves at
risk of being shot or attacked. Sadly, some recent cases have brought
that into stark
focus.</div><a name="09022644000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally,
simply living in a particular area can mean that one is deemed to be a
member of, or associated with, a particular gang. A person who is in no
way part of a gang can be at risk of being attacked or drawn into gang
violence simply because of the location of their home or family. What
angers me the most is that many innocent people are drawn into these
violent situations by the quirk of fate of where they live.</div>
<a name="09022644000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
often very clear identification. People know the names of the gangs and
who the gang members are. However, they are terrified and intimidated
and so will not come forward. We see the perverse situation that some
people who get drawn into the criminal justice system feel that they
need to affiliate with a gang for their own protection because of the
area they come from. This sense of organisation or structure is perhaps
not fully or properly appreciated in the context of the debates we have
about gang activity.</div>
<a name="09022644000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise a
huge amount of what the Minister has said in setting out the background
and laying the framework for the measures in these new clauses. We are
all sadly aware of the tragic number of teenagers who have lost their
lives in various parts of the country. The focus has obviously been on
London and the record number of people killed last year by a knife or
sharp instrument. Other acts of violence are equally applicable. I hear
clearly what the Minister has said about the use of dangerous dogs and
other actions taken by these criminal gangs.</div>
<a name="09022644000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The shocking
thing is that a lot of children are being denied their childhoods by
the activities of these appalling gangs. A recent report by
children&#146;s charity NCH Action for Children highlighted the
situation of young people growing up with the real fear of becoming a
victim of crime, particularly violent crime. That is something that we
cannot accept in a decent society.</div>
<a name="09022644000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
and I&#151;and, I am sure, other hon. Members&#151;have been to
events where a lot of these issues have been brought into stark focus.
The Minister will remember the people&#146;s march against knife
crime which we both attended on 20 September 2008, marching from
Kennington park to Hyde park for a rally. That was very powerful. It
always is when one meets families and friends who have lost loved ones
as a consequence of these appalling actions. It is difficult not to be
moved by their testimony. Listening to family, loved ones and close
friends as they speak about the situations they have been through, I am
always struck by their passion, humility and determination that others
should not suffer as they have done. That has left a strong impression
on me, as I am sure it has on the Minister and many other hon. Members
who have been touched or contacted by, or who have spoken to, those
affected by this sort of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column575" />Column number: 575</div>crime. It was important that there were a lot of young people at that
rally&#151;young people taking a stand and saying that they were not
all like that, that they were the ones affected, and that they were as
angry as the rest of the community and were prepared to take a stand.
That sends a positive statement about the role of young people in our
communities.</div>
<a name="09022644000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a great
credit to a large number of young people that they are not prepared
just to sit by and let this happen, and to see the things that they
have. They are prepared to take a stand and actively ensure that change
takes place. That is why I am pleased to support organisations such as
Kids Count, which I know that the Minister also supports. There are
other similar organisations seeking to give a voice to young people and
advocating change to prevent these appalling acts. I pay tribute to the
many organisations that seek to address and confront these issues in
their communities.</div>
<a name="09022644000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the
direct links to gang culture, activity and membership that make the
situation so serious. One of the most insidious aspects of the
organised criminal gang structure is that gangs often consciously focus
recruitment on some of the more vulnerable members of our communities,
such as those with poor educational attainment, weak family support
structures, addictions or mental illness and those who are unemployed.
Those people are often targeted for gang membership to deal drugs, to
get involved in criminal activity and to support the gang structure. As
I said to the Minister, the appalling fact recently reported by Trident
to the Home Affairs Committee is that those involved are getting
younger and younger. Sadly, in recent years, we have seen 13-year-olds
being involved in gun crime and linked to gang activity, which is why I
understand the Minister&#146;s desire for additional mechanisms to
address young people in particular. However, as I think he accepts,
there are complications and problems that I will come on to regarding
the Government new
clauses.</div><a name="09022644000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Gangs
often deliberately seek to undermine family and social structures,
drawing the individual away from traditional ideas of family
relationships with acts of sickening violence that are part of a
perverse rite of passage; people are encouraged to demonstrate their
affiliation to the gang in that way. It is horrendous that gangs seek
to undermine the family, which can be so important in preventing
someone from getting drawn down those paths. Gangs play on
people&#146;s fears and seek to get in the way of family structures.
Criminal gangs are so pernicious and their actions so appalling not
only because of what they do to communities and families but because of
how they draw individuals away from otherwise fulfilling lives. There
is also fear; intimidation prevents people from coming forward to the
police, and prevents law enforcement agencies from bringing
prosecutions. I agree with the Minister that the first port of call
should be to bring people to justice. That must be our focus and
objective, even though the fear and intimidation sometimes make it
difficult to
achieve.</div><a name="09022644000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Various
approaches have been taken to combat gang crime and pernicious gang
activity around the country, which reflects the fact that gangs in
different areas are different in structure and nature. It would be
wholly mistaken to think that the nature and structure of a gang in
London was the same as that of a gang in Manchester or Birmingham, or
on Merseyside. Some gangs are simply about territory, while others are
motivated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column576" />Column number: 576</div>by broader criminal intent and funding a criminal lifestyle, but they
all tend to have a sense of identity in common. They often use colours
to distinguish the gang, and ape some of the activities of gangs in the
United States. In the west midlands, injunctions were used to disrupt
gang activity, basing a claim on the nuisance caused by gangs and
seeking to bring that within the remit of section 222 of the Local
Government Act 1972. In many ways, that model is based on tools
developed in Boston and other parts of the US, where the injunction is
seen as an important mechanism available to law enforcement officers in
preventing gang activity and ensuring that communities are
protected.</div><a name="09022644000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its &#147;Going Ballistic&#148; report on dealing with guns, gangs
and knives, Policy Exchange
noted:</div><a name="09022644000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;West
Midlands police were able to use Section 222 to exclude dangerous
individuals from certain areas so that they could no longer exert
influence, trade drugs or intimidate residents there. It allowed them
to control dangerous gang members by enforcing non-association or
restraining orders, exclusion zones around certain areas (barring known
gang members from the area in which their gang operates) and specific
exclusions (buses or
parks).&#148;</div><a name="09022644000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is why I understand the Minister&#146;s focus. He seeks to tackle the
issues at that very serious end, based on that model. However, as the
Minister has said, in the case of Birmingham city council <i class="I">v.</i>
Marnie Shafi and Tyrone Ellis, such use of section 222 of the 1972 Act
was ruled inappropriate by Nottingham county court, and that decision
was upheld by the Court of Appeal last October. In essence, the court
said that except in exceptional circumstances, an injunction should not
be granted when an application for an antisocial behaviour order could
have been made. If it was granted, the evidence provided would have to
be proved to the criminal
standard.</div><a name="09022644000169"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09022644000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
the decision, it has been suggested that because the section 222
injunction is no longer available as a tool, gang violence in
Birmingham has increased. In that context, I understand why the
Government have thought it appropriate to introduce the proposals. I
recognise and endorse the Minister&#146;s point that prosecutions are
the preferred option but that they might not be appropriate in all
circumstances. A balance of proportionality and reasonableness must be
struck in the potential use of civil orders that might otherwise
protect communities from such criminal
activities.</div><a name="09022644000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister has accepted, the proposals differ from the
quasi-injunction provisions in ASBOs and serious crime prevention
orders and go much further than section 222 injunctions, which are
largely modelled on case law and the law of nuisance, although
Birmingham city council used them as it did until the court judgment.
Before a gang injunction can be made, the court must be satisfied that
the respondent has engaged in, encouraged or assisted gang-related
violence and that the order is necessary to prevent them from engaging
in further gang-related violence or to protect them from such
violence.</div><a name="09022644000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first test involves being satisfied on the balance of probabilities:
the civil test, as the Minister said. From our previous debates on
serious crime prevention orders and other matters, he will be aware of
the case of R <i class="I">v</i>. Manchester Crown court ex parte McCann. The
application 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column577" />Column number: 577</div>of the sliding scale of the civil test may equate at times to something
virtually indistinguishable from the criminal standard. The use of the
term &#147;balance of probabilities&#148; in the clause appears to
seek to deviate from that general case law in the application of civil
orders in what might be considered quasi-criminal issues. He will also
be aware of the fine distinction between a preventive order and a
punitive one, with all the issues that that may connote.</div>
<a name="09022644000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the
Minister satisfied that the use of the balance of probabilities test
for satisfying the court about what amounts to criminal conduct will
withstand challenge on the basis of existing relevant case law, which
might otherwise suggest a higher hurdle for the burden of proof? In
particular, is it intended that the order should deviate from the
McCann judgment? In the use of the balance of probabilities rather than
the civil standard of proof, is there a focused and deliberate
intention to say, &#147;Actually, for this sort of case, we
don&#146;t believe that McCann should apply,&#148; and that a lower
hurdle should be applicable in such situations?</div>
<a name="09022644000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, some
human rights issues might apply if the order is seen as punitive rather
than preventive. Again, will the Minister comment on what advice and
consideration he was given in framing the new clauses to ensure that
the orders are seen as preventive, not punitive? Otherwise, there will
be human rights issues. Does the Minister envisage that the order will
be used on a stand-alone basis, or is it intended to operate alongside
criminal conviction, for example? If so, what does the order add to a
serious crime prevention order or even an
ASBO?</div><a name="09022644000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
an application for an injunction to be successful, there must have been
violence in the course of the gang&#146;s activities, yet no
definition of a gang is provided. From everything that has been said, I
understand the Minister to mean one of the identifiable organised gangs
that officers from Excalibur, Trident or any of the specialised forces
dealing with gang activity can explain in disturbing detail. However,
given the context, all that we are left with is the requirement that
there should be gang-related violence. A group of young people who
simply hang out together might be considered by some to be a gang. But
as the Minister has said, and I agree with him, that is not what we
should be trying to get at. The focus should be on those identifiable
gangs engaged in gun, knife and other violent crime, rather than on
groups that some have referred to as loose affiliations of young
people. As Liberty has
asked:</div><a name="09022644000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Is
it simply a group of young people wearing
hoodies?&#148;</div><a name="09022644000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that that is the case, but one might get that impression
from reading the Bill. It might be useful to have some context to
assist the courts and those who might wish to use the power for the
protection of their own communities, especially given that it will not
be the court that immediately has to consider using the
injunction.</div>
<a name="09022644000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that he did not want to include lists, and in matters of drafting
I generally agree with him, but I am aware of no existing case law that
the courts, police forces or local authorities could look to for
defining a gang, which is the basis on which the provision is framed.
He has said that he will reflect on what guidance or assistance might
be offered, but clearly that would be non-statutory, so a court
interpreting what is meant by the provision would have to take the
actual words as the starting point. If it felt that the words were
clear, it could apply them accordingly, so it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 578</div>would be helpful to have a road map or some further definition to ensure
that the new clauses are applied in the way in which I believe they are
intended, focusing on the most serious crimes of violence. That is why
we have tabled the amendment suggesting that a definition of a gang
should be included.</div>
<a name="09022644000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
suggestion is modelled on the definition set out by the Centre for
Social Justice in its excellent report on gang activity, but as the
Minister has rightly said, it is not the same. I welcome his comments
accepting what is an important and ground-breaking report that puts in
context the reality of gang activity in this country. The CSJ rightly
makes the point that there are clearly identifiable factors for the
sorts of structured gang activity that are at the heart of the problem,
and I believe that that should be reflected in the drafting of the
clause.</div>
<a name="09022644000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have heard
what Liberty has said about the drafting of the amendment. The Minister
made a teasing comment about that, and I take it in the spirit in which
it was made. I take no pride in ownership of drafting; I am simply
seeking to address that important point. If there needs to be
refinement of the issues I have identified, I am prepared to work on
that and reflect on the comments that have been made.</div>
<a name="09022644000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
about boxing is that it relates back to the question of what will be
considered gang-related violence, and I do not think that that would
fall within that definition. I respect what Liberty has said about
trying to get that right and I think that we should all reflect on that
in ensuring that the focus and structure of the clause is
appropriate.</div><a name="09022644000126"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000204"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point
about ensuring that the powers will be used properly. Does he agree
that it might be appropriate for the report to which the Minister
referred to be presented to Parliament so that MPs can see how the
measures work in practice? That might overcome his concerns about those
issues, which, to an extent, I
share.</div><a name="09022644000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000205"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Lady has made a valid point for the
Committee to consider, and I am sure that the Minister will reflect on
it. Certainly, with regard to what might be considered as other
injunction-type orders, such as serious crime prevention orders, there
are mechanisms for formally reporting to Parliament how many are used
and the nature of their use. Given that those powers are wide ranging
and should not be used lightly, there might be some merit in such a
proposal. I am sure that the Minister will reflect on that, given that
new clauses have only recently been added to the Bill and that there
has been only a limited amount of time to consider all the relevant
aspects, their potential impact and what they actually mean. I hope
that suggestions such as the hon. Lady&#146;s and those from other
groups on where the focus should be and on what protections might
usefully be added will inform the debate as the provision is considered
in this and the other
place.</div><a name="09022644000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the child protection issues that are potentially at stake&#151;the
Minister spoke of his desire for such injunctions to be applicable to
under-18s as well&#151;and the Government&#146;s envisaged approach
of requiring compliance with certain conditions to address behavioural
or other issues, it is essential that those agencies with
responsibilities for providing such services are consulted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column579" />Column number: 579</div>at an early stage. We believe that it is appropriate for relevant NHS
bodies and probation youth offending teams to be engaged as early as
possible on the support services that might be available. That should
be reflected in the consultation provisions of the new clauses. I
welcome the Minister&#146;s comments that he will consider and
reflect on that&#151;it is important. If we seek to prevent and
change behaviour, other agencies must be engaged in that process. If we
are looking at issues of addiction, mental health and other associated
factors, the limited consultation requirements that we have at the
moment do not go far enough.</div>
<a name="09022644000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
more general points that the Committee might find helpful, and I hope
that the Minister will respond to them. In respect of the duration of
an injunction, is it envisaged that the requirements of an order could
remain in force in perpetuity? That is how the measure is framed,
although the Minister&#146;s comment about the review mechanism, and
that an application could be made by the applicant or the respondent
requesting consideration of whether an order remains appropriate, is
important.</div>
<a name="09022644000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
significant restrictions that could be placed on an
individual&#151;such as where they are at particular times of the day
and what activities they are required to participate in&#151;is the
Minister satisfied that the provisions will withstand challenge under
the relevant human rights provisions? Will he also confirm how many
injunctions he expects to be granted each year? From what he has said,
I imagine that the intention is for there to be a very limited number.
We do not have the benefit of a regulatory impact assessment on these
provisions because of the late stage at which they have been brought
up, but it would be helpful to get some sort of feel for
this.</div><a name="09022644000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000206"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Just to answer that point: 160 is the current
estimate, but it is a very rough
estimate.</div><a name="09022644000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000207"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister referred to a number of 160. Is
he suggesting that that would be an annualised
number?</div>
<a name="09022644000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000208"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Yes. Sorry&#151;I meant to say that that would
be for a
year.</div><a name="09022644000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000209"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister&#146;s clarification is
helpful, although I note that that is a higher number than the number
given for serious crime prevention orders, for example, which I recall
from our debates on that matter. Perhaps this power is even more wide
ranging that I had anticipated in terms of its application. I thank the
Minister for that clarification; the Committee will find it helpful and
it will assist in the further consideration of the scope and extent of
the
powers.</div><a name="09022644000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
provision has been introduced to make it an offence to breach an
injunction as stated in the Bill. The Minister has explained that that
is because a breach of an injunction would be dealt with in the same
way as a civil contempt of court. It would be the same as a breach of
any other injunction, with sanctions available to the court that could
include
imprisonment.</div><a name="09022644000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have touched on the issue of children in this context. Under the
current drafting of the Bill&#151;the Minister accepts this
point&#151;such cases would currently be dealt with in the High Court
or the county court, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column580" />Column number: 580</div>and not in a youth court, as would apply in situations where a young
person was subject to some form of criminal
sanction.</div><a name="09022644000170"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="09022644000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us look at the ASBO regime. A child will have an ASBO imposed by a
magistrates court, but if the order has been breached it becomes a
criminal offence and is dealt with by the youth courts using the range
of sanctions available in those circumstances. Those do not currently
seem to be available on the basis of the structure that has been
envisaged by the new clauses. The Minister specifically made reference
to that, and I therefore note that the way in which this could be
worked through is very much on his agenda. There are serious issues
that need to be considered carefully to ensure that, for young people
in particular, the use  of those orders is conducted in an
appropriate and effective
way.</div><a name="09022644000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000210"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is helpful. I think it is clear, in how the
new clauses are currently drafted, that they will not be used for
under-18s, for some of the reasons stated by the hon. Gentleman. I was
trying to say that there needs to be a debate about whether there
should be a measure for under-18s and the answer to that, I think, is
yes. We then need to have a big debate about what that measure should
be, because as the provision is drafted here, we could not, for some of
the reasons the hon. Gentleman has given, expect them to be used for
under-18s. In fact, I would not expect it to be used for under-18s as
it is drafted, but that leaves us with a public policy gap, and we need
to look at how we can fill
it.</div>
<a name="09022644000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000211"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister&#146;s comments about
under-18s were helpful. It was important that he said that he did not
expect the orders to be used for under-18s. It might well be that that
needs to be made more explicit in the Bill, if the new clauses are
accepted. A different regime might need to be thought through and
applied to under-18s, because I recognise that there is a public policy
issue for the reasons that I have identified. There is the question of
continuance&#151;the fact that one of the orders could potentially
remain in perpetuity. Let us apply that to the ASBO situation, for
example, because, even on that, the Government have rowed back from the
civil orders applying to a child automatically for two years, because
yearly reviews for children on ASBOs were introduced under section 123
of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. I think that the
Minister is saying that the envisaged structure is not fit for purpose
for under-18s. It is important to put that on record because it will
help to inform subsequent debates on these particular
provisions.</div>
<a name="09022644000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister explain why the order could impose conditions on the person,
subject to the injunction, for their own protection? If that were to
apply to under-18s, there would be existing child protection
legislation in place. I was struck by one case that highlighted the
need to act swiftly to protect the sibling of a gang member who was at
risk of becoming a victim of a tit-for-tat gang dispute. The local
authority and social services needed to act quickly to get a child out
of a particular address to ensure that their life was not put at risk.
I understand the real-time need&#151;and the Minister made reference
to this&#151;to act quickly in certain circumstances 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column581" />Column number: 581</div>to protect children. However, the new clauses would not have added
anything to existing child protection legislation, which give rise to a
question of why they would not necessarily apply to
that.</div><a name="09022644000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
does the Minister consider that those protective provisions are
appropriate for people over the age of 18? Liberty&#146;s briefing
note, which he will have read, describes that as an &#147;extremely
paternalistic approach&#148;, and Justice has noted that it
does</div><a name="09022644000142"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not
believe that adults outside the mental health or mental incapacity
context, should be the subject of compulsory protective interventions
of this
nature.&#148;</div><a name="09022644000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a fairly wide public policy issue that needs to be thought through.
When the Minister responds to the debate, I will be interested to hear
whether he can explain further why he thinks that such provisions are
appropriate and
necessary.</div><a name="09022644000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand and respect the Minister&#146;s desire to address the
issues highlighted in the case of Shafi and Ellis, but the provisions
are wide-ranging&#151;as he would accept&#151;and will require
further detailed scrutiny. Today&#146;s consideration in Committee is
simply the start of the process. Further detailed review is needed to
ensure that the provisions are appropriate and that they address the
understandable need to provide support to communities suffering
unacceptable gang-related violence.</div>

Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): The Minister rightly said that
this is one of the most important aspects of the Bill, so it is
regrettable that it was not in it initially. We could not discuss it on
Second Reading and the provisions were not available at the start of
the Committee&#146;s proceedings&#151;in fact, they were tabled
only at the start of recess week. That is regrettable given that, in
the Minister&#146;s words, this is such a major feature of the Bill.
Over the past month in Committee, it has been said several times that
one purpose of our proceedings is to put clarifications on record that
arise from questions asked of the Minister, probing amendments and
statements, so that when the police, lawyers and courts come to
implement the legislation, they will not be simply going on its bare
legalistic bones, but will have a clear statement from the Minister
about the intention of how certain measures will be
implemented.</div>
<a name="09022644000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier, the
Minister said that a breach of an injunction involving somebody under
18 would be taken to a youth court rather than a criminal
court. I thought that that was reassuring, but he went on to say that
he did not see that the injunctions would apply to under-18s at all,
which I found confusing in the light of his opening comments. He talked
very eloquently about the massive problem of gangs and pointed out, as
if to justify the measures, that a lot of the knife murders that
have  been so much in the news over the past year or
two  were carried out by 14, 15 and 16-year-olds.
Rather  than providing clarification, the Minister&#146;s
comments confused
me.</div><a name="09022644000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000213"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I apologise if I have confused the hon. Gentleman.
I will read the relevant paragraph again. There is a public policy gap.
Under-18s and gang-related 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column582" />Column number: 582</div>violence cannot be dealt with in the way that the injunctions will deal
with over-18s. I am sorry if this intervention becomes a little long,
Sir Nicholas, but please bear with me. I was trying to tell the
Committee that because the measure is contentious&#151;to say the
least&#151;I will seek, with officials in my Department and across
Government, to liaise with hon. Members to see whether there is a way
through this legal minefield that will not criminalise children and
that will consider their human rights and other things. Although, in
theory, someone could try to get an injunction, they are not applicable
to under-18s. I will read the legal opinion on
why:</div><a name="09022644000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this
injunction can apply to under 18s. However, injunctions must be
enforceable and it is unlikely in practice that this would be
enforceable for under 18s because the court cannot fine someone without
a source of income (and most gang members will not have a legitimate
source of income). Nor can it sentence an under 18 to detention in a
YOI for a civil contempt of
court.&#148;</div><a name="09022644000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
civil contempt of court is the sanction for breaching the injunction.
Effectively, we will not be able to use it because there is no
sanction. Which court it goes to is almost irrelevant because there is
no sanction and it will not go to court, so there is a gap. I was
saying that we need to look at that gap to come up with a solution that
meets our public policy objectives without undermining other
principles.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000214"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have used my discretion to allow the
Minister to intervene at some length. If the hon. Member for
Chesterfield wishes to press the matter further, I am sure that the
Minister can deal with it in his winding-up
speech.</div>
<a name="09022644000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000215"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I apologise, Sir
Nicholas.</div>
<a name="09022644000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000216"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. The Minister&#146;s
welcome intervention provided further clarification. However, I am
still a little confused by his opening comments and the huge emphasis
that he rightly placed on the tremendous problems of gangs and the
number of young people involved in murder, with 13, 14, 15 and
16-year-olds involved in stabbings. It seemed that that was being laid
out as the justification for the measures, but we were then told that
they were not meant to apply to that age group at all. In view of that
confusion&#151;what Justice and Liberty have read has certainly
confused them&#151;it seems that some tidying up is
needed.</div><a name="09022644000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022644000217"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. In a moment I shall adjourn the
Committee. However, as this is the last sitting in which I shall chair
the Committee, may I congratulate hon. Members on both sides of the
room on the constructive way in which they have dealt with a very
important Bill? I particularly congratulate the Front Benchers on the
mammoth task that they have undertaken. It has been a great pleasure to
be in the Chair and to see Parliament working at its
best.</div><a name="09022644000171"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
