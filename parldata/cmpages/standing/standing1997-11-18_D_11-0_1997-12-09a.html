<H4><center>Board of banking supervision</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment moved [this day]: No. 64, in page 11, line 29, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``until the date on which the Authority is given statutory effect.''.--[Mr. St. Aubyn.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 65, in page 11, line 37, leave out ``Chancellor of the Exchequer'' and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Governor of the Bank of England''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): When I was stopped in mid-flight this morning--or mid-depth, as some might describe it--we were discussing the amendments to clause 28. I was speaking to amendment No. 65, which would leave out from the clause the words ``Chancellor of the Exchequer'' and insert the words ``Governor of the Bank of England''. I was arguing that one of the difficulties with the Government's proposals is that they have politicised the role of supervisory chief by making the peak of the supervisory system the Chancellor of the Exchequer, rather than the Governor of the Bank of England. Given that politicians tend to exhaust their credit and credibility more quickly than Governors, that may have a detrimental effect on the role of the regulatory body.
<P>
Linked to that argument is the fact that we must consider the experience of the person who will be playing such a vital role. The present Governor of the Bank of England has spent his life in banking and there is no reason to suppose that his successors will be any different, given that his predecessors had banking careers. He has drawn on experience after experience of the problems in banking and the crises that occur and is therefore ideally suited to understanding the difficulties that will arise in banking supervision.
<P>
A Chancellor does not have the same experience as a Governor. For example, when the present Chancellor claimed to have experience of running a small business, his mother had to correct him. Furthermore, his contribution to economics is enshrined in the golden phrase, ``endogenous growth theory''.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): The phrase ``post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I fail to see how much a discussion arises from the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It demonstrates that the present Chancellor is not interested in banking supervision; he is far more interested in cultivating an esoteric reputation for incomprehensible language in the area of economic study.
<P>
Nevertheless, one of the factors that relates to the previous experience of a Chancellor or Governor when, clearly, the choice of the Governor is preferable, is that of continuity. We expect a Governor to be in post for five years but, because continuity is so important to the job, we hope that he will be in post for 10 years. No Chancellor of the Exchequer this century has been in post for as long as 10 years, although many have been in the post for fewer than five years. Therefore, the probability of crises in the banking system occurring when the Chancellor is new in post is far greater--as is the danger of such a situation being mishandled--than it would be if a Governor was new in post. In any event, a Governor would have emerged from the banking system and be immediately familiar with such problems if they arose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): The hon. Gentleman's flights of fancy have provoked me into asking a question. As he rightly anticipated at the outset of his remarks, the present legislation gives the Chancellor a role. What is the difference under the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Clearly, the Chancerllor has a role but, as I explained earlier--I know that it was a few hours ago--the Bill breaks the division of responsibility between the person who holds the purse strings and the person who is ultimately responsible for supervisory matters. Given that conflict of interests, the Chancellor will face temptations to make decisions that are not in the interests of the banking system or the taxpayer.
<P>
As we often hear from Labour Members, one of the arguments for allowing an independent Bank of England to set interest rates is that that will circumvent the defects of politicians. Yet who is being put in the equally important role of bank supervision but a defective politician?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The proposal is that the Chancellor and the chairman of the new authority will jointly make the appointment; under the clause, they have to agree. At present, the decision is made jointly by the Chancellor and the Governor. The functions are being transferred to a new regulatory authority, so I do not see the problem. It is not the major change that the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Very simply the role of the Governor, as the hon. Gentleman ably points out, is being completely undermined by the change; he is being deprived of any role whatever. As I said this morning, the amendment gives us the opportunity to debate the proposal that the Chancellor, not the Governor, should stand at the head of the supervisory structure. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that I have misunderstood the intention behind the proposals and that I am wrongly anticipating the changes to the regulatory bodies, I hope that the Economic Secretary will correct me and surprise me by saying that it is her intention that the Governor should continue in his role at the peak of authority in the regulatory process. Within the financial world, however, it is perceived that the Chancellor has taken that role unto himself.
<P>
Let me quote from the Bank's official response to the announcement. I refer to its press release of 20 May, which shows how ill judged is the transfer of responsibilities from the Governor. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``banks remain of special systemic importance, because of their unique role as providers of liquidity, to both depositors and borrowers . . . and because their resulting unsecured exposures to each other make them particularly vulnerable to contagion from elsewhere in the system.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The statement goes on to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it will continue to be important under the new arrangements that the central bank is able to monitor, through the new regulatory body, the financial condition of individual institutions, as well as that of the system as a whole.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will be of concern that, if the regulatory body is not performing its function properly, the Governor of the Bank of England, who retains the supreme role as lender of last resort to the banking system, will not have any say on who makes up the authority. A key lever of influence for the Governor is securing good performance from that body, on which he will most thoroughly depend, will be removed. That should concern us all.
<P>
We have asked Treasury Ministers on several occasions to elucidate core conflicts in the system and say how they propose to cope with them. We have so far failed to elicit a response on the conflict between the interest rate and exchange rate regimes--I hope that the Committee will receive some illumination before the end of its proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to be too hard on the hon. Gentleman, as he is a new Member of Parliament, but I have heard those arguments before, and we are discussing consequentials. I should be grateful if he would deal with the consequential rather than the principle aspects, which we have already considered, and which I have power under Standing Orders to deal with if he does not do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to you for your guidance, Mr. McWilliam, and I shall try to use the experience that I have gained in the six months that I have been here to keep on track.
<P>
The point that I was making is that there is another conflict, which the amendment goes to the heart of it. There is the problem of the Bank's supervisory role which may come into conflict with the Bank's interest rate policy. I am not sure that putting the Chancellor at the head of the supervisory role will assist in resolving that conflict.
<P>
The proposal is unsatisfactory and it has been criticised by a wide range of people. As I said, it was probably the main reason why the Governor considered resigning his post when the matter was first sprung on him. We deserve a full and thorough explanation from the Economic Secretary as to why it was decided that the key role in the appointments to the supervisory body should be given to the Chancellor, and the Governor's status reduced.
<P>
I am afraid that this afternoon, I am in a hot-desk situation as I am involved in a Select Committee as well. If I do not stay too long after having made my remarks, I hope that you will understand, Mr. McWilliam, that I do not intend any disrespect to you.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have all been in hot-desk situations before, so I do understand.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I support my hon. Friend's comments on the second of the two amendments in the group, which I shall perhaps return to when I have spoken to the first amendment--No. 64. It is an opportunity for the Economic Secretary to say something about her plans for the future of the Board of Banking Supervision.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I help the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee? The position is that we are speaking to both amendments together. The first has been moved and proposed, and the second may be proposed later. But nobody should be in any doubt that we are dealing with both amendments together, not separately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Thank you for that clarification, Mr. McWilliam. It might be convenient for the Committee if, nevertheless, my own remarks fall into two sections--the first being generally relevant to the question of a time limit for the authority, and then comments on some of the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn). It will be a seamless road, I am sure, by the time I have concluded my remarks.
<P>
The question of how long the Board of Banking Supervision should continue is relevant because the background to the Bill is that the Government and the FSA have brought forward plans for an alternative approach to banking supervision. A number of important policy initiatives are included in the consultation documents that have already been published. In future, there will be a high degree of practitioner involvement--I refer to page 27 of the FSA outline--and it has the admirable intention of including practitioners in setting policy and, possibly, authorisation and enforcement work. That is a considerable development beyond that which takes place in the Bank of England, and raises the question of how long the provisions will apply because a financial services reform Bill is to be brought forward next year.
<P>
It is therefore appropriate to include a time limit on the Board of Banking Supervision, otherwise someone reading the legislation could be misled into thinking that the Government intend it to have a permanent existence. We always seek to make our laws accessible and not misleading to lay readers so I ask the hon. Lady to consider whether it might not be appropriate to include a requirement that the board will cease to exist on the date on which the Financial Services Authority is given statutory effect, which we believe will be at the end of 1999. The Government seem to intend that the board will be overtaken by other regulatory provisions and it seems sensible to make that clear.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
To return to the well-expressed arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford about the issue of who appoints the members of the board--while it still exists--the clause gives further powers of appointment to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Over past weeks, we have debated how the Chancellor has awesome powers of appointment that go clean contrary to any suggestion that the Bank of England or its subsidiary bodies will somehow be free of political influence. Another point, which also picks up on my hon. Friend's comments, is that the Bank of England has much expertise in the area and continuing involvement in bank supervision. Although its day-to-day supervision will be removed, the Bank is very interested in banking stability and the health of the financial system generally, and will often be the first organisation to pick up tremors that could lead to bank failures or problems in the financial market, which is why the memorandum is an important part of the new structure. No one would deny that the Bank of England and the Governor know more about banking supervision than anyone in the Treasury--or the Chancellor himself. There are therefore good reasons why that expertise should be deployed in appointing, jointly with the Chairman of the authority, the independent members of the FSA. It would also have the advantage of removing the suggestion that political appointees are being put in, which we must avoid at all costs and be seen to avoid.
<P>
The question of confidence is also involved. It is crucial that the outside world sees that there is a separation of powers and that is best achieved by removing the Chancellor's power to make appointments that he does not have to make. It is absurd to suggest that by giving the power to joint appointment to the Governor one is in a sense weakening the authority or independence of the Board of Banking Supervision--quite the reverse. In fact, it would be bolstered by that. I therefore press the Economic Secretary to give close consideration to whether we can substitute the Governor for the Chancellor in that repsect, for all the reasons that I and my hon. Friend have given.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I endorse the comments of my right hon. and hon. Friends. If the Economic Secretary does not wish to accept the amendment and the subsection remains unamended, how long will the board continue in existence? What specific date does the hon. Lady have in mind? Will she also confirm that that date will be found in the forthcoming financial services reform Bill? If the amendment is not agreed to, the Committee should be told when the board will expire, because that date is important to our understanding of how the FSA will carry out its functions. Given the provisions of clause 28, the board will surely still be in existence. I hope that the Economic Secretary can answer those two specific questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I want to speak briefly about the board's background. It was established in 1987 by the previous Government--I commend them for establishing it--because it was thought necessary to have an independent body to monitor the operation of banking regulation. It was the result particularly of the Johnson Matthey affair, which was mentioned earlier. Unfortunately, the Opposition are muddying that concept.
<P>
Amendment No. 64 is spurious. I know that it was inspired by the British Bankers Association, but the BBA has completely misfired. The obvious intention was to deal with the operation of the board once the Financial Sevices Act 1986 had been revamped. The amendment seeks to put a time limit on the operation of the board. I see no purpose in that.
<P>
Amendment No. 65 muddies the lines of accountability. The Bill proposes the transfer of the responsibility for banking regulation to the new authority. It is therefore sensible that the new authority should have a say in the appointment of members of the board. That is all that the Bill does. The Chancellor at present has a say in those appointments and the appointments have to be made jointly. Clause 28 does nothing more than substitute the Chancellor for the Governor.
<P>
jf4ÝÌMr. RuffleyÌ: It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to say that that is how it is being done now, and that the Chancellor has a joint role in the appointment procedure. But is it not also the case--I should be glad to hear the hon. Gentleman's views--that we are in a new era? The Government are introducing a new era of supervision; because it is a new era, they talk of arm's-length political independence. Given that, should not the power to appoint be with the Governor rather than the Chancellor? We should not refer to what went before: this is something new. Surely, substituting the Governor for the Chancellor, as suggested in amendment No. 65, would reinforce and underpin what you so clearly desire, which is a reputation for an independent system.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have no desires in that matter. Interventions should be just that--interventions, not additions to original speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> We are certainly in a new era. Conservative Members were soundly defeated on 1 May, and they are taking some time to get used to the fact.
<P>
We are in a new era, in that responsibility for banking regulation will be with the new Financial Services Authority. It is only natural that the Governor, who will no longer have responsibility for that, will be replaced by the chairman of the authority.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Helen Liddell): It is important to remember that clause 28 is about the consequential changes to the Board of Banking Supervision. It was not apparent that the hon. Member for Guildford recognised that we were discussing the Board of Banking Supervision. The consequential changes proposed in the Bill do not fundamentally alter the basis of supervision under the Banking Act 1987. As I have said on more occasions that I care to recount, the purpose of the Bill is to transfer existing supervision, with its existing mechanisms, from the Bank of England to the new FSA. Further legislation will follow next year to reform the entire structure of financial services regulation. The Bill will reverse banking supervision. Its consequential changes will allow the system to operate with clarity. People must be comfortable with its provisions.
<P>
It is fairly obvious that amendment No. 64 would abolish the Board of Banking Supervision when the full reforms are in place. That is jumping the gun. The FSA's outlines, which the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) mentioned, refer to the need for practitioner involvement. Indeed, in the early days of 1998, the FSA will consult on levels of practitioner involvement. To assume its conclusions is to pre-empt that consultation.
<P>
The amendment does not work. This consequential clause must take the form that it does to ensure the FSA, which is already a legal entity and which will assume statutory responsibility for the supervision of banks when the Bill comes into force, will still have access to the advisory capability of the Board of Banking Supervision. To enhance that practitioner expertise, we are taking the opportunity to reduce the number of ex officio members of the board. Two executive members are sufficient for a body that is intended to be a source of external expertise and advice on the banking sector.
<P>
Some Committee members got themselves into an awful froth about amendment No. 65. The Bill puts the Chancellor at the head of banking supervision. That situation applies now. The Chancellor of the Exchequer remains responsible for the whole regulatory framework. There is no change to that. Banking supervision--this is where I believe that the Opposition's misunderstanding, predictably picked up by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston), has arisen--will be transferred from the Bank to the FSA. The chairman of the FSA will assume the responsibility of the Governor of the Bank of England under the Banking Act 1987. That is the purpose of the clause. It is why the amendments are inappropriate. There is no reason to support amendment No. 65.
<P>
Many things have been said about the Chancellor of the Exchequer which, I suspect, has the intention of inflaming members of the Government. We are used to such behaviour at this stage in the afternoon. The Bill's intention is to enshrine the Chancellor's accountability to Parliament. The House cannot call the Governor of the Bank of England, the chairman of the FSA or, indeed, chairman of Manchester City football club to account, but it can call the Chancellor of the Exchequer to account for his responsibilities.
<P>
As for the proposal in the clause, what could be simpler than to move responsibility for the Board of Banking Supervision from the Governor to the chairman of the Financial Services Authority? Opposition Members made much of the Governor's experience of the banking sector. The chairman of the Financial Services Authority was previously a deputy Governor of the Bank of England, and he is widely recognised as having appropriate experience of banking supervision.
<P>
It is important to recognise how skewed the situation has become. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) asked about the date on which the Board of Banking Supervision would cease to exist. We cannot say whether it will cease to exist, or on which date it may do so. As a responsible Government who operate with a responsible Financial Services Authority, we shall consult with practitioners, who will show us the best way forward.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells said that we must ensure that appointments are not political. I reiterate the fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is responsible to the House for any actions that he takes. We are changing the responsibilities of the Governor and of the chairman of the FSA, but not those of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and we are therefore discussing a situation that was created by the previous Government. In essence, Conservative Members have been arguing that the previous Government were responsible for making appointments of a political nature.
<P>
The amendments have been surrounded by a degree of confusion. Notwithstanding that fact, they would not improve the Bill and I therefore recommend that the Committee reject them.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
Clause 28 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 29 and 30 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 31</center></H4>
<H4><center>Qualifications of a designated agency</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 12, line 39, leave out `Secretary of State' and insert `Treasury'.
<P>
This technical amendment will ensure that, after the transfer of supervisory functions, appointments to a designated agency will be made by the Treasury alone. The clause, which relates to paragraph 1(2) of schedule 7 of the Financial Services Act 1986, currently refers to ``the Secretary of State'', but the amendment will replace that reference with the word ``Treasury''. The Secretary of State's functions in relation to that provision were transferred to the Treasury by the Transfer of Functions (Financial Services) Order 1992.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 31, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 32 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
