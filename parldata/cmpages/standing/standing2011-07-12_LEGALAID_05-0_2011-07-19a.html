Mr Sheridan. It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair. I have checked
my declaration of interest, and it still states that I am a barrister,
which I am—albeit non-practising. I declare that as an

that, in so doing, I might set off a fusillade of similar
declarations.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000019">&#160;</a>

wish to say how much I look forward to serving under your chairmanship,
Mr Sheridan, and that of your co-Chair, Mr Hollobone, for the seven
days of 14 sittings on which we are to discuss the Bill. Although it
was not my intention when making my declaration of interest to
illuminate the Committee with the array of talent that we have in the
room, the declarations have shown briefly and eloquently that we have
not only civil, but criminal law practitioners here—I have been
both in my time. I should follow the example of colleagues and say
that, unlike the Minister, I have received publicly funded fees in both
capacities over several years, although not since being elected to the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000037">&#160;</a>

also have people who have held very senior positions in the magistracy,
non-governmental organisations and other charitable bodies. It is not
uncommon to have some expertise, but we are very privileged, if not
uniquely so. I hope that that will inform our debates as we go through
the Bill, although, having heard how many lawyers there are, Mr
Sheridan, your plea for brevity might take some achieving, but we shall
see.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000038">&#160;</a>

so that the non-lawyers do not feel left out, that all members of the
Committee, as constituency MPs, will have had experience of the matters
that we shall discuss today and probably in September, after the summer
recess. I am sure that all MPs have experienced in their surgeries the
growing burden, and also the pleasure, of giving advice to
constituents. Those who attended the recent Citizens Advice annual
reception will have viewed the amount of advice available in their
constituencies, compared that with their own work loads and seen how
all Members of the House—and all members of the
Committee—fit into that pattern of advice. Although we are
clearly not entitled to give legal, financial or other advice, we can
nevertheless bring a great deal, through our professional or lay
experience, that will inform our

this important Bill, but the amendment paper issued on Thursday
included more than 100 amendments. Happily, they have been filleted, no

most, were clearly submitted by legal lobbying groups, which have so
far informed the Opposition’s position. I hope that, as we
scrutinise the Bill, we can have clearer, simpler and fewer amendments,
which are written by individual Members and by the Opposition rather
than the Law
Society.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000041">&#160;</a>

what he does in his constituency and it is all very good
stuff.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000042">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">If
the amendments put to us by lobby groups, legal or otherwise, had all

address the hon. Gentleman’s point about what he called
duplication—there is some overlap, but with good purpose. I
commend the Clerks for the clever grouping, but when we move on to
later groups of amendments, the hon. Gentleman will see that such
overlaps assist the debate, without delaying the Committee. He shows no
great respect to the Law Society, and I hope that he will not bash the
Law Society and the Bar Council, as he has already shown a propensity
to

appreciate the quality and sincerity of the briefings even if they do
not always agree with them. Perhaps because we are dealing on the whole

                  </strong> I will let that speak for itself. I will make
one more preliminary point and then move on. I do not ask the Minister
to respond now, unless he wishes to. My only caveat to the hopefully
open-handed attitude that the Opposition bring to the Committee is to
say that we have been given notice—officially or
unofficially—that there will be substantial further amendments
to the Bill in the autumn, which will include what I might call the
Prime Minister’s amendments. At his press conference, he
announced various amendments on indeterminate public protection
sentences, squatting, self-defence and time to be served for serious
offences. We have a consultation paper outstanding on solving disputes
in the county courts, and the issue of referral fees, on which I
believe there may be further amendments. We are therefore in the
unusual position of there being quite a lot of legislation about which
we do not know. I put that caveat on the record now, because if we are
surprised at a later stage, in September or October, by a series of new
clauses and amendments tabled by the Minister, we may have some protest
to make. However, I will take my cue from you, Mr Sheridan. Let us take
the Bill and the first group of amendments as we find
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
our approach to part 1, we will want to look in detail at specific
elements of scope. That will not surprise Government Members. This
morning we are dealing with the overriding principles of the
Bill—or their absence. In the excellent evidence sessions last
week, Roger Smith, the director of Justice and a very fine and
experienced witness, described the Bill as a dog’s dinner. It is
not for me to defend the Bill’s reputation, but while I think
that that is a fair description of part 3, and possibly part 2, I think
there is a clear strategy in part 1. We seek to explore and challenge
that strategy in the amendments that we have tabled to clause 1.
Although we strongly disagree on clause 1, as evidenced by 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>Government Members who took part in debates on this earlier this year
and last year, I hope that they will join in the debate in the spirit
of which it is intended. Without wanting to embarrass anyone, the hon.
Member for South Swindon is now almost the resident expert on legal
matters on the “Today” programme, and the hon. Member for
Broxtowe has a very good record of defending advice services in her
constituency, as I am sure many hon. Members have. I wish that the

leave my colleagues to speak to theirs, although I reserve my right to
come back if other matters arise. Bearing in mind the principle of the
Bill and what we aim to do, I shall discuss the amendments slightly out

with a financial provision and consider the legal consequences
thereafter. We do not resile in any way from the fact that savings must
be made in the legal aid budget or that finance is an important
determinant of the levels of service that can be operated. However, if,
as it appears, finance is the key point in the Lord Chancellor’s

               <p class="tabbed">Let us try to
get away from this argument, which we have rehearsed a hundred times,
have we not? The right hon. Gentleman says, “It’s your
fault that we’re having to make cuts; what would you
cut?” On legal aid, we can say, and we have said it before,
first, we would make alternative cuts instead of these; secondly, we
agree with some of the cuts that are being made; and thirdly, we
disagree with other cuts that are being made. All that will become
clear—[<span class="smallcaps">Hon. Members:</span> “Which
ones?]—as the Bill proceeds. I will not go through them clause
by clause, because we would spend the entire morning doing
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That said,
the Minister must remember that he is part of the Government. I
sometimes weary of Conservatives putting the onus on to the Opposition
to do their job for them. This is the Government’s Bill, and the
Government must justify the cuts that they are making. We say that
those cuts are excessive and the wrong ones to make. The second limb of
our argument relates not simply to how the Bill deals with cuts, but to
the Government’s purpose. We say that litigation is sometimes a
necessary step, and the availability of a legal remedy is an important
safeguard of decision making in equity for the rule of law and for free
expression. That is the principle of which the Government seem to have
lost sight in the Bill. We seek to remind them of it, and we seek their
support for this group of
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have choices and they have made them. The
Opposition’s principal job is to examine those choices and say
where we disagree or agree. The Government have limited their ability
to make those choices by voluntarily, as far as we can see, opting for
one of the highest levels of cuts of any Department: 23%. That already
limits choice. It is further limited by the Government’s last
minute changes, such as the change on sentencing policy, which has left
a £140 million black hole, and the promise of new
offences, tariffs and projects. There are also the effects of their
policies that we have already seen in the wider world, with crime
rising, which will put more pressure, burden and cost on the Ministry
of
Justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Those
are all problems of the Government’s own making. Within that,
they have made certain choices. They have chosen to focus cuts
primarily on civil rather than criminal legal aid. They have picked out
for particular treatment social welfare legal aid and family legal aid.
I do not know—I await illumination from the
Government—why those areas have come in for special treatment
and punishment under the Bill. I have read that the Government fear
they will be in breach of article 6 of the European convention on human
rights if they make more swingeing cuts in criminal legal aid. I have
also read that the Lord Chancellor and other members of the ministerial
team simply have a bias towards, or a better understanding of, the
purpose of criminal legal aid, and do not quite get the process of
social welfare legal aid in the way that Opposition Members clearly
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000065">&#160;</a>

reminded. The overwhelming majority of those in receipt of legal aid
are often the poorest: I think 80% come from the poorest 20% of the

because the Government’s approach to clinical negligence is not
clear. It is certainly not consistent. Legal aid for clinical
negligence has been withdrawn completely from scope. It is still
provided for the remaining part of personal injury litigation, in which
legal aid played an important role, albeit supplemented over the past
12 or 13 years by conditional fee agreements and no win, no fee
agreements. That has been withdrawn 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 167<a class="bkMark" name="Column167">&#160;</a>
                  </div>entirely from scope, against the expressed wishes and clear direction of
Lord Justice Jackson. The Jackson proposals on clinical negligence will
be introduced, and we now have a lukewarm and poorly articulated
attempt to say that something will be done to assist meritorious
clinical negligence cases getting into court. I hope that we will hear
more detail from the Minister—perhaps not today, but if he wants
to do it today, that is fine—about how the issue will be dealt
with. I suspect it is one of the key issues that we will

private funds. The Minister will be aware of what the NHS Litigation
Authority, which is the defendant in such cases, has said about the
issue. It very much regrets the withdrawal and believes that it will
both severely hamper access to justice and produce additional costs for

then put the discretion back on the judge. Is it not up to those on the

things clear during these debates, but if one issue cries out for
clarity and further attention, it is that of clinical negligence cases,
because what the Government have said on the subject is not clear, and
because they are, perhaps, the most compelling cases, involving
catastrophic injuries to adults as well as to children. There is a
prospect that meritorious cases—even those with a good chance of
success—will not be able to get into court, simply because the
cost of investigating them is too high and impossible to
raise.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000076">&#160;</a>

we inherited it from the previous Government, there are people on very
low and modest means who would not be able to prosecute cases through
the courts, especially in the family courts, whereas those on no means
at all can do so for many years at a time. There is already an
inconsistency that this Government are trying to sort out, and which
the previous Government did not address.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000086">&#160;</a>

admit, because I was a practising member of the Bar at the time, that
there was some consternation in the legal profession when CFAs were
introduced in the 1990s. One thing that I find amusing—that is
probably the right word—looking back at the proceedings of the
Access to Justice Act, was the doom foretold by the Conservative party
about withdrawing legal aid, and substituting CFAs for
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000088">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Ipswich raised a real problem about getting the balance
right and ensuring that there is reasonable access to justice. I do not
resile from that. I am against some of the instincts and expressions of
foreboding of both politicians and the legal profession, because CFAs
have worked quite well for people on moderate means. If one looks at
the profile of those who benefit from CFAs—the typical person
subject to a CFA—it is not Naomi Campbell or El Hadji Diouf,
despite what the MOJ press office or the central press office puts into
<em>The Mail on Sunday</em>. The average person benefiting from a CFA
earns around £19,000 or £20,000 if they are a woman or
around £25,000 if they are a man: hard-working citizens who do
not currently qualify for legal aid but who can take a case to court
using a no win, no fee agreement. They would not be able to do that
without that provision. I will not go into the detail now, because we
will come to it later in our proceedings, but they will not be able to
do that under the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000091">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman has cleverly and barristerially
moved around my question, specifically on access to family courts. He
made an important point, drawn from the original consultation on legal
aid, when he said that not only those on low income but those on low
and modest incomes should be eligible for legal aid. In the family
courts, there are many people on very low incomes who cannot prosecute
a case through the courts, because they are not eligible, when those on
no income can. Is the hon. Gentleman proposing that we extend the
eligibility of legal aid in the family courts, so that those who
currently cannot afford to go to court would be covered by the
eligibility
criteria?<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000092">&#160;</a>

while—everyone has to make a living somehow—and then, and
more recently, when I talked to family practitioners, which we did a
lot in preparation for the Bill, that was not the problem that was
usually brought up. The problem was usually the inequality of arms
between someone who can afford to pay privately, which is often the man
in a failed relationship, and someone who cannot. I am not saying that
there is not an issue in what the hon. Gentleman said, but it is not
necessarily the central issue. If he is saying that the Bill is
designed to tackle that problem, he is using a sledgehammer to crack a

will look at them more closely when we come to social welfare legal
aid. We have concerns on family legal aid and we still have concerns
over the definition of domestic violence and the treatment of children
in relationships. If we are looking for where people will suffer most
because of the Bill, it is not in relation to private family law; it is
in relation to social welfare legal aid. I do not want to set up some
hierarchy of suffering or oppression, but I want to put that on the

distressing cases when the litigation eats up the matrimonial assets
entirely, and the state has to cover in a number of cases. If the hon.
Lady is asking, “Should those who have the means to pay,
pay?” I do not see that there is necessarily a problem. I
thought the question that she was going to put to me, which is actually
what the Bill says, was, “Should we forgo litigation altogether
and rely on mediation?” However, that was not her question, so I

               <p>That
goes back to my previous point, which is that civil legal aid, and
social welfare law in particular, has long been the poor relation in
the system. I pay tribute to the previous Labour Government and, as I
will on other occasions, to Lord Bach, who was a Minister and is now a
shadow Justice Minister in the Lords. One of the things that he is
rightly most proud of is the fact that when the size and growth of the
legal aid budget had to be addressed, which it was under the previous
Labour Government, it was done by protecting and, in some cases,
expanding civil legal aid, particularly in the area of social welfare,
and looking for savings in the then far larger criminal legal aid
budget.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000099">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">One point that
I did not deal with under finance was the bogus economics of cutting
services that may end up costing the taxpayer, let alone the litigant,
more in the long run. That was hopefully in the wise Labour
Government’s mind when they looked at the public purse, but I
suspect that they also had in mind the fact that we have a wider duty
to people who are in need and in difficulty in all the areas covered by
social welfare legal aid. The provision of legal aid—legal help,
for example, as well as legal advice and representation—is part
of a construct of which my hon. Friend was part when, as she said
earlier, she was the chief executive of a citizens advice
bureau.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
problem that the Bill sets up is the dismantling of the integrity of a
system that protects people from the time that they have a worry or
concern when walking into their CAB to the time when, if necessary,
they have a lawyer, whom they would not otherwise be able to afford,
representing them in courts, and even in the appellate courts. We are
losing much of that system under the proposals, and I will return to
that later, but I am trying to focus on the fact that there
are—however one looks at it—competing needs between civil
and criminal legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Generally,
with the possible exception of the past five to 10 years,
criminal legal aid has won out. That is not because there is
a competition and one is good and one is bad, but civil legal aid has
often been the poor relation. That may be because it is easier for
everyone—the public included—to understand the need for
representation when one’s liberty or reputation is at stake. It
may be because criminal legal aid is more established as a
constitutional principle. It may be because people do not
understand—this Government certainly do not
understand—the absolute need for civil legal aid not just in a
reactive sense and not just for the person who may be losing their home
or whose landlord is seeking to unlawfully evict them, but also where
someone has a positive case where they are denied rights and wish to
seek those rights. For that reason we put an emphasis in new clause 1
on the equality of civil and criminal legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000104">&#160;</a>

               <p>I am sure that the hon.
Member for Ipswich, the scourge of the professions, would agree with
that paragraph, if with none other. Up to 1998 the Law Society
administered legal aid. The significant change that came about in the
Access to Justice Act, as well as the creation of the Legal Services
Commission, was that legal aid policy then needed to be determined by
the users of legally aided advice services. That is why we set up the
community legal service to ascertain need and to plan
accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000106">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
was the second significant step in the history of legal aid. After its
creation under Rushcliffe, the reforms introduced in the AJA were very
significant. The Bill is the third piece of legislation in the history
of legal aid that will be seen as significant. That is why I began my
remarks by saying that I disagreed with Mr Smith that it was a
dog’s dinner. Although part 1 has a central financial motivation
as well as some policy motivation, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 172<a class="bkMark" name="Column172">&#160;</a>
                  </div>it is a significant and organised attempt to reform legal aid, but it is
a reform that is very unwelcome, unlike the 1949 and 1999 Acts. If we

do not think anyone would disagree. Legal aid was first established at
the beginning of the last century for criminal cases as it was
increasingly recognised that legal representation was essential to
guarantee a fair trial. Criminal legal aid is under pressure due to the
numerous changes in the law and the administration of justice. The
Government apparently fail to realise that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000109">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Today, or
more likely at some future date, we will be looking at clause 12. It
sets out a proposition that many people involved in legal services
regard with horror, which is the idea that on arrest it will be
possible to make an assessment, based on means and the interests of
justice, as to whether someone receives legal advice and assistance. We
are wholly opposed to that. The Minister has already said that the
Government have no plans to implement that provision, and therefore at
the appropriate time we will ask why the clause is in the Bill at all.
That clause is a clear indication that the Government are nibbling in
very significant ways at a basic principle. I hope that members of the
Committee will not have a problem with any part of the new clause and
that they will all vote for it. I do not think that any of them will
have a problem with the wording of paragraph (d); if they do not, they

individual cases and ought to embrace a wider role in legal education

For members of the Committee who do not know what I am talking about,
there was a very good polemical article—it was called
“The Thunderer” was it not?—in <em>The Times
</em>headlined “Don’t pay heed to the wailing of the
bewigged Scargills”. The bewigged Scargills being the Law
Society and the Bar Council. The quote to which that refers, and I
think the hon. Gentleman is making the same point
now—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> I am responding to it,
although I am always grateful to the Minister’s Parliamentary
Private Secretary for keeping me on the right track. If he can manage
that as well as supporting the Minister, he has earned his money on the
Committee. The quote
is:<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000117">&#160;</a>

us be clear. We are not saying that finance should not be a
driver—a principal driver—as it is in all other areas of
public expenditure, which is the hon. Gentleman’s point. As we
heard in the House yesterday, for example, finance is the principal
driver of defence expenditure; but just as one would not say that
because money is tight, or because the Government wish to be efficient,
we should abandon defence of the realm, so too one should not say,
“Because we believe that money has to be saved at all objects
and the Lord Chancellor says that his role model is to cut almost a
quarter of the spending in his Department, that will be the driving
force and, therefore, we will live with the consequences for the
availability of legal services in this
country.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000121">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
are simply saying that—this is why the shadow Chancellor will
have no disturbed sleep at all—in setting budgets, the
Government cannot ignore the principles of policy. It is a simple and
straightforward point, and it does not matter whether we are talking
about defence,

is this. Why do his Government think that in this area of public
policy, it is possible to make such swingeing cuts that little may be
left of the civil legal aid system in this
country?<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000122">&#160;</a>

professions, merely the trade unions, which I think have done them a
disservice. To return to my original question, which is the point of my
intervention, has the hon. Gentleman had the shadow Chancellor’s
express approval for new clause
1(2)(f)?<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000123">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I do not know what sort of regime of fear is
run in the Conservative party if one can never speak without having
things stamped in triplicate. My answer is exactly as I gave it. The
new clause would not introduce any additional spending burden. Its
principle is that the provision of legal aid in the UK, although it
must be examined in a financial context, must also be
considered—this is not a difficult point to understand—in
terms of what service will be provided. We were asked about alternative
cuts earlier. Our alternative cuts would not create a system in which
the poorest and most vulnerable in this country could not get access to
basic legal advice and assistance. Before the hon. Gentleman votes on
the new clause, he should ask himself whether that is what he
wants.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000124">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Member for Ipswich opens an interesting
line of attack. Could the same be said of Front-Bench Members about
this issue? Is the whole Bill driven by the Chancellor’s wish to
make cuts as quickly and deeply as possible? Are the Government
ignoring the implications of the cuts because they have been instructed
by the Chancellor to make them?<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000125">&#160;</a>

another channel, albeit an important one, that we will sail down at
some point. It is about what we get for the money that we spend,
particularly on social welfare legal aid, which is a good deal, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield said. Are we cutting off our nose
to spite our face? Will we spend more money by making the cuts in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000128">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Also, if
there are villains, who are they? They are not, I suggest, constituents
of mine who go into Fulham CAB because they have problems with their
welfare benefits. In an overwhelming number of cases, they are the
Departments: that is, the Government, who are now not just running but
taking a scythe to the system and introducing major reforms of their
own. Time after time, Government bodies make bad and wrong decisions
that must then be challenged or appealed. Realistically, as I think
Government Members know, that can be done only with help and advice.
Sometimes that advice might be non-legal, although it often involves
legal 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>help. Sometimes it involves, if not representation, then at least
assistance in preparing a case for representation at tribunals. If that
is the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston
was making, I agree
entirely.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000129">&#160;</a>

a lot of money through the legal aid system at the moment rather than
dealing with issues through appeals processes and so on, which would
cost less? Is that not a result of the complexity of the welfare system
created by the previous Government? Has the hon. Gentleman conducted
any studies of what goes on overseas and the extent to which welfare
claims and counter-claims are supported by legal aid in other

complicated, and we all hope that they will be simpler. For example,
the Welfare Reform Bill and the introduction of universal credit were

               <p class="tabbed">I
declare an interest: I practised housing law for many years. I wish
that I had a pound for every time we were going to reform housing law,
which is notoriously complicated, with the different types of tenure
and the number of Housing Acts there have been. We have been asking for
many years, “Why don’t we get the Law Commission to have
a go at it and produce one or two types of tenancy and simplify
matters?” I absolutely agree—of course it would be
sensible to do that. However, it will not happen overnight. If the
Government put that forward, I am sure that the hon. Member for South
West Norfolk would have warm support. Also, unfortunately but
obviously, when one goes through major reform of complex legislation,
the process of change and the teething troubles of a new system create
problems. There is more need for advice and representation in a period
of great change than at any other
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000132">&#160;</a>

Norfolk does not take account of is that we have always had an
independent system within the social security institutional
arrangements in this country. At the moment, we have the social fund
commissioners and the Social Security Advisory Committee, which used to
be the supplementary benefits commission. It existed in the 1960s and
throughout the 18 years of the last Tory Government. The Conservative
party did nothing to remove it, quite rightly, because its function is
essential. We cannot pretend that legal aid is an alternative to the
checks and balances in the welfare
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000133">&#160;</a>

dealing with a very complex legal system in many areas of social
welfare. Welfare benefits are a good case in point. I know that some
Members represent their constituents in a lay capacity at tribunals,
which is diligent, although one has to be selective at immigration and
welfare benefits tribunals. I would not like to take on that
responsibility. I know that pro bono representation can be provided by
the free representation unit, and others can do that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000134">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I think my hon. Friend is right; that is why we
must proceed with caution. I will not follow the chairman of the Bar in
saying that there is no Moss Side in New Zealand, because I do not know
whether there is. I know that New Zealand has a system of no-fault
compensation, however, which would have a significant effect on the
legal aid budget if we had it here. I do not know the exact figures,
but I know that the volume of criminal cases per head of population is
lower in New Zealand, so I do not believe that we can read across in
that way. We can perhaps make detailed comparisons, particularly with
similar jurisdictions, but Citizens Advice and the Bar Council have
made the point that if we start comparing apples and
oranges—comparing the cost of particular types of legal aid with
those in a jurisdiction that has wholly different law, social make-up
and alternative provision—that will get us nowhere and will
mislead us and the wider public.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000142">&#160;</a>

one of the most interesting answers to the questions asked by the hon.
Member for South West Norfolk came from Julie Bishop of the Law Centres
Federation, who, as her accent betrayed, comes not from New Zealand,
but from Australia. She gave us an interesting account of how legal
advice provision works in Australia. It sounded like rather a good
system to me, and we may be able to learn from it.

about Canada, and I suspect that under the rather right-wing Government
that it has had on and off, it has seen a major retrenchment in the
provision of legal aid and advice. We were told that, yes, it is
cheaper, but it is rubbish, although I may be paraphrasing what was
said. All I would say is let us be careful when we use comparisons so
that we do not take them too far.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000144">&#160;</a>

explanation of new clause 1(2)(a) to (f) because I think we
will deal with those provisions later. I am sure that we will come back
to finance. I will return to paragraph (e), looking at education, and I
suspect that we will also come back to proper representation in
criminal cases when we deal with clause 12 and others. We will
certainly come back, when we debate clause 8 and schedule 1, to new
clause 1(2)(b) and the proper provision of civil legal aid
and social welfare legal aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000145">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My final
comments about new clause 1 concern paragraphs (a) and (c), which
encapsulate the two principles that have underlined the development of
legal aid in England and Wales since the Rushcliffe report of 1945, the
Legal Aid and Advice Act 1949, and the Access to Justice Act 1999. I
remind hon. Members that the Rushcliffe report said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000146">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the
total… of all the existing free facilities is inadequate to meet
the present demand…. there appears to be a consensus of opinion
that the great increase in legislation and the growing complexity of
modern life have created a situation in which increasing numbers of
people must have recourse to professional legal
assistance”.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000277">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
brings us back to the point that the hon. Member for South Swindon
made, and remember, it is 1945. The report also said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000147">&#160;</a>

fear that we are at the other end of that tube now. I suspect that most
hon. Members would agree that life is rather more complicated now than
it was in 1945. In the spirit of openness, I say that that and the
rising costs may be why the availability of legal aid has been
restricted to a lower percentage of the population, and that the
previous Government took steps to control costs and would have taken
steps to do so further. I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman’s
question and give him an exact percentage, but perhaps I can explain
why we are where we are.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000148">&#160;</a>

consternation at the proposals in part 2. They will mean that if they
have been let down by a supplier and have a meritorious case, but as a
small business do not have the free assets to take that case to the
county court or High Court, they will be in far more difficulty in
obtaining CFA consent. If they win, they will find that they pay
substantially for their damages. Therefore, yes, this does apply to
small businesses. They are concerned about it, but equally, as my hon.

straitened than now—and there were restrictions. Part of the

               <p class="hs_brev">“If

               <p>I
am not sure that we hear rhetoric like that in the Chamber today,
although it might not be far off in the case of some hon. Members. That
Bill set out principles that were then established, but which were
modified in 1999, as I shall explain. It set a template. Spending
varied—on the whole, it grew. Society changed; the law changed;
the provision of legal aid changed substantially over that time, but
the principle did not change. We are all familiar with the point that
was probably hackneyed at the time, but the then Attorney-General went
on to say that Her Majesty’s courts were open to all just as the
grill room at the Ritz was open to all. What is not so generally known
is that he went on to qualify that comment, perhaps rather ruefully,
when he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000162">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“I

suspect that that was due to rationing, but I have not fully researched
that point. I shall do that during our short adjournment. I shall end
my trip down memory lane with the other example used by the then
Attorney-General. It is not so well known, but in many ways it is a
better example of how dysfunctional the pre-legal aid system was. It
addresses complexity—a point that the hon. Lady made to me
earlier. He

going to law has always been expensive and that that would sometimes
cause injustice, which is why legal aid was introduced, but that,
equally, the cost meant that people paused before going to law and
considered alternative ways to resolve a dispute? Over time, the
proliferation of legal aid has caused people to rush to law, when it
would have been better to employ alternatives to resolve disputes. I
accept that it is a question of balance, but if nothing else, bringing
ourselves back to the system that the original Legal Aid Act 1949 tried
to achieve will mean that fewer people will rush to law, which is not
always the best way to resolve
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000173">&#160;</a>

particularly for her experience as a criminal practitioner, although I
do not know whether she is a civil practitioner as well. Whether
prosecuting or defending, the experience of the courts is slightly
different as a criminal practitioner, because the nature of the

regular criminal defendant—is somewhat different from the
litigants whom one tends to meet in the civil courts.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000174">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My experience
over 20 years has been that whether people are legally aided or making
a contribution and whether that contribution is de minimis or a
substantial amount of their own resources, they are reluctant to go to
court. One issue that we will undoubtedly debate is the proliferation
of litigants in person. That is a major concern for the judiciary, but
it should be a major concern for us all, not simply because it clogs
the courts and costs money, but because it will distort how justice is
delivered in this country. One thing that is said about litigants in
person is that they not only have difficulty understanding the law and
process, but find the atmosphere of the justice system intimidating,
alien and over-formalised. Sadly, it has to be that way. There are more
or less relaxed types of court. The Court of Appeal is not as relaxed
as an employment tribunal. Nevertheless, even in the most minor
tribunal, there is a formalised and serious process. Most people would
find that intimidating. I am not talking not about people with learning
difficulties or poor education or those who cannot read or write, but
about any citizen who is not conversant with the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000175">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The corollary
is that nobody goes willingly to law, or very few people do. I do not
accept the hon. Member for Broxtowe’s premise that people think
that they might as well give it a punt because it is all on legal aid.
I do accept the point that sometimes being against a legal-aided party
may cause an imbalance to the party paying their own costs. That is a
fact of life, to which we should pay attention, but it is a different
point and a poor Government defence of the Bill. I have heard the
phrase “skin in the game” used, and I find that quite an
insulting. The idea is to make people more responsible, think twice or
thrice, or simply not to go ahead with litigation at all. I do not
accept that the provision of legal aid, even when there is nil or low
contribution, acts as an inducement to take unnecessary litigation. I
am not saying that it never happens, but I do not think, as the
Government and media have tried to contend, that is a substantive part
of litigation in this
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000176">&#160;</a>

I am looking in my interesting bundle to find out what mediators say
about the Minister’s points. I do not think he can get away with
that. We all agree that he will find that there is consensus, as there
would be in all good mediation, about the role that mediation should
play and that that role should be increased. First, resolving matters
through mediation might not be cheaper. Professionally trained
mediators, of which there are not sufficient at the
moment—something else the Minister has probably not thought
of—do not mean justice on the cheap. Secondly, in reaching an
acceptable solution, mediation is the proper way to go, but mediators
say it is not the solution in every case, which is why they want the
availability of legal aid to continue. Those are the views of
Resolution, which is one of the major mediation organisations in the
country. It speaks up for mediators but makes two points: first, not
all cases are suitable and, secondly, being able to go to law, if
necessary, is part of the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000185">&#160;</a>

mediators being available, but it is not the be-all and end-all. It is

                  </strong> I thank the shadow Minister for giving way on
this point. To be clear, in many circumstances, mediation can be a
viable alternative. In many—not all—circumstances, it
should be an alternative. I say to the hon. Member for Hammersmith that
mediation is usually cheaper and faster, and it can be much less
stressful for those who use it, which is why I have been promoting it.
The measure is not a brainwave that I have come up with; I have looked
at the established facts of a system that
works.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000198">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I am reaching
the end of my comments on new clause 1, so I return to one of the few
things that I wrote down so that I would remember it. We challenge two
principles. First, finance should inform, not define legal advice and
assistance, which relates to what the hon. Member for Ipswich said
earlier. I think that is clear, and it might be the single most
important factor. At present, I entirely accept that the Government are
making savings in the legal aid budget—we would have done so
too, and our savings may well have been of the same order. We would
not, however, have made savings in that way; we would have had regard
to the fact that we must end up with a coherent and effective system
for providing legal aid. At the core of that, certainly as far as civil
legal aid is concerned, is ensuring that poor people and people of
moderate means have access to the courts. We must have equality of arms
and people must not be disfranchised simply by their lack of means,
either because they have to contribute themselves, or because lawyers
are not available or not commercially able to take cases on. Secondly,
litigation is sometimes a necessary step, and the availability of legal
remedy is an important safeguard of decision making, equity, the rule
of law and free expression.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My first
point on finance is the usual argument. The policy is being applied in
the Bill in a more than usually hamfisted and oppressive
way—even more so than in other Bills that have gone through or
are going through the House.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000201">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">I am
particularly concerned about the second point, which is why I have
spent some time looking at how legal aid has grown up in this country;
the principles behind it, which had all-party support 70 years ago,
and, notwithstanding the comments made by the Attorney-General, the
change that was introduced in the Access to Justice Act 1999. With all
due respect to him, the Attorney-General misunderstood in that
debate—I am sure that he does not misunderstand it
now—the intention of that Act. It was not intended to set some
sort of political template for access to legal services, but to begin
to look at the relationship between society and legal services, which,
of course, was already happening. It was happening through the law
centre movement, through not-for-profit organisations and through
Citizens Advice, which has a history going back to the second world
war. There was both a continuum and a varied response to
people’s levels of need for advice, representation and so forth.
As lawyers, we should not work in a vacuum, as may have been the case
previously; legal professionals should see themselves as part of a
process that delivers justice. That is why, whatever the changes in
resources that came about, the principle of the Access to Justice Act
1999 was as important as the principle of the Legal Aid and Advice Act
1949.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">Despite
the expansion of legal aid and the previous Government’s
attempts to control it, which were successful and which we would have
continued, we are now in a different ball game. It is one in which the
Government have decided that finance is not just a main motivating
factor, but the be-all and end-all in making decisions. The downside of
that—I say this with some regret—is that the Government
are either indifferent to or positively welcome that. I say that
because many of the Minister’s comments in public have been to
the effect that depressing litigation is an end in itself, that there
is too much litigation and that too many people go to the courts too 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 185<a class="bkMark" name="Column185">&#160;</a>
                  </div>readily. I do not think that that is the case. Even it were—this
will be recurring theme as we look at the Bill, particularly parts 1
and 2—it is a remedy too far. It is a remedy that kills the
patient.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000202">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
cumulative consequences of parts 1 and 2 will be that much of the
ability of individuals of all types and means—save the most
wealthy, but particularly the poorest—to receive redress and get
proper representation will be removed from the public realm. When
mistakes have been made, particularly by big organisations, whether
they be Departments, businesses or whatever, in all the situations for
which social welfare legal aid has grown up, that will no longer be a
recourse. That will be the case for CABs, law centres and private
practice through to preparation for trial and trial itself. That is the
significant
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000203">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">In
new clause 1—I do not imagine the Minister will support it, but
he may have had a change of heart—we seek to put back those
principles, which have been tried and tested over time. Sometimes, the
Government talk as though the ability to go and get advice on debt or
on housing benefit arrears is a luxury. The Government have several
answers to that. They say, “That is not a legal matter,”
or, “A volunteer or pro bono organisation can help you with
that,” or, “The people who have committed the wrong or
the tort in the first place can help you with that,” or,
“The tribunal can help you with that.” When one looks at
the Government’s alternatives to the current provision, one sees
how lame those answers are. I take exception to the idea that there is
some Shangri-La of free advice and representation in our constituencies
where one can walk off the street and immediately have all problems
sorted out at no cost or inconvenience. I do not believe that any
Member here—however prosperous their constituency, because all
constituencies have areas of need—actually believes that. From
our individual experience, we know that people are often reluctant to
seek advice and do not know how to do it. However, when they seek
advice, they are already in extremis or certainly unable to deal with
problems. In the past 10 years, we have tried to deal with that problem
by early intervention through such things as the financial inclusion
fund, and the expansion of law centres and AdviceUK networks across the
country.</p>

               <p class="tabbed">There
are already concerns. There were concerns under the previous Government
about advice deserts. The whole country will become an advice desert if
the proposals are introduced. That is why it is important, at the
beginning of the Bill, to set out and state the principles that have
defined legal aid, and from which we have learned lessons over 70
years. Radical reform of this kind, which is not constructive reform,
as in the two previous Acts, is destructive. The Government introduce
it at their peril because the consequences, as registered by the
equality impact assessment, will be a lack of social cohesion,
increased criminality and huge distress to people.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not know
what other hon. Members do, but I spend my Sunday mornings knocking on
doors, particularly in areas of need and areas where people will not
necessarily access services. In the 21st century, I am greatly shocked
by the conditions in which people live. I have found pensioners who had
not received their pensions for five 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 186<a class="bkMark" name="Column186">&#160;</a>
                  </div>years and people who live in uninhabitable conditions. Even after 25
years, it still shocks me to see the conditions in which people live.
Often, particularly in a constituency such as mine, those people will
be cheek by jowl with others who live lives of comparative luxury.
Those people will benefit from the services that have grown up around
legal aid and advice, particularly in the past 30 years, but
even before then. They will lose those services as a consequence of the
Bill. New clause 1 would tackle
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000205">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will deal with the amendments speedily because, as the hon. Member for
Ipswich so perspicaciously says, there is some overlap. However, the
intention is to help, rather than hinder the Committee. Amendment 60
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000206">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>I
confess that I cribbed part of that from the New Zealand Legal Services
Act 2011. There are some good things in New Zealand, not just
“Lord of the Rings” and so on. Section 3 of the Act is
called, “Purpose of Act”. What a revolutionary proposal
that is. Why did the Minister not think of that—putting the
purpose of the Act at the beginning? When he set out the Lord
Chancellor’s powers in clause 1, why did he not think to tell us
the purpose of the Act? Perhaps he was embarrassed about it for the
reasons that I have just given. Perhaps that is the real reason.
Nevertheless, he should have bitten the bullet and done so. The New
Zealand Act
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000207">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The

               <p>That
is not quite the same, but I think it does the same job. It is not as
flowery, elaborate or relevant to our past history as new clause 1, but
it does the job succinctly by being clear about the purpose of legal
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000208">&#160;</a>

that there were times when we could all get on terribly well together.
I promise the Committee that I had not seen it before we drafted the
amendment, but I was looking through the Access to Justice Bill Second

               <p class="tabbed">I
have found the amendment I was looking for. It was tabled and passed in
the House of Lords during consideration of the Access to Justice Bill.
It states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“persons

The Conservatives were keen to support that proposition in 1999, so I
see no reason why they should not support a similar provision this
year. I will not say any more about that. I think there was a question,

               <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of the amendment will partly be covered by my hon. Friend the
Member for Kingston upon Hull East when he speaks on his amendment. It
is to consider our concerns about the repeal of large parts of the
Access to Justice Act and the requirements that such an approach puts
on the Lord Chancellor in allowing him a much freer rein.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000216">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There are
dangers—we will consider them when we discuss clause 4—in
the abolition of the Legal Services Commission. That is not something
we oppose on principle; indeed, it is something we propose. However, we
want there to be proper safeguards. We also want there to be proper
duties on the Lord Chancellor, as I have indicated, and proper scrutiny
of the Lord Chancellor. In the Bill, particularly regarding the repeals
that it makes to the 1999 Act, the Lord Chancellor has far fewer
responsibilities and far more leeway.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 61

               <p>The
article guarantees the right to a fair hearing in civil and criminal
proceedings, and protects the right to take court proceedings to settle
a dispute. It may also give a right to legal aid if the dispute is very
complicated and if someone would be at a disadvantage when unable to
afford a lawyer; I am citing the explanatory notes as well as the text
of the article. For all the current air war over article 8 and other
matters to do with the convention and the Act, it is right for article
6 to be clearly in the mind of the Lord Chancellor when he makes
provision for legal aid. It is fundamental not only for criminal but
civil legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
proposed new subsection (7)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000223">&#160;</a>

               <p>The
definition of that strategy in proposed new subsection (8)
and the remaining two subsections of amendment 61 provide for
additional requirements and make everything sound bureaucratic.
However, the reason why we think that a legal aid strategy is important
is that the Bill gives the Lord Chancellor a great deal of leeway.
Under secondary legislation, he has the ability to remove matters from
scope—not to add them, but to remove them—and unless the
Minister enlightens us during our proceedings we do not yet know how
much secondary legislation we will get, what form it will take and
which areas it will cover. We already know that significant areas that,
frankly, we expected to be in the Bill are not. Even if the Minister
says that his advice is that that is not the requirement of primary
legislation, we would like to see where substantive changes are being
made to areas of law, so that we are clear about what we are debating
and what those changes are in the
round.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000224">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is an example in part 2, where we have the reservations on and
qualifications for conditional fee agreements; no recovery of success
fees, no ATE premium, recovery from claimants’ damages and
damage-based agreements are all there, but the mitigating factors are
not. I suspect that one of the reasons is that they are not ready. The
Minister has no more idea than I do about how QOCS—qualified
one-way costs shifting—will work, for example. It is a work in
progress, but I say that that is simply not good enough. We should not
be making major changes to civil litigation without knowing the package
in the round and without considering it in the context of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000225">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister might equally well have said—I am glad he has
not—that many of the scope changes would be outside the Bill and
dealt with by secondary legislation. Effectively, he is saying that is
what might happen in the future, by giving the power to change scope to
the Lord Chancellor. We are suspicious of that, in particular because
it is a one-way street further to reduce the scope of legal aid, rather
than any ability to increase it. I also suspect that the reason why the
Minister has put most of the scope changes into the Bill is not so much
to enlighten our debate as to fend off the possibility of judicial
review, which will be easier if provision is in primary rather than
secondary legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000226">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I will not use
“dog’s dinner” again, but a more precise phrase:
this is a very partial Bill. It deals with certain matters that the
Government want to deal with, and it promises to deal with other
matters, but it does not. Proper scrutiny is, therefore, important as
we progress. If the Bill is enacted in anything like its current form,
it will leave the Lord Chancellor in a powerful position in terms of
the type of civil legal system we have in this country in the future.
If he decides in a year or two that the savings have not been made, for
any of the reasons that I gave earlier, including the fact that many of
the cuts will cost the public purse more in the long run, and therefore
decides to make further scope changes to restrict it, it will be
difficult to keep an eye on that, other than through statutory
instrument

was some detail about how the system is going to work. Is it not a
practical problem that the Lord Chancellor will be able to use
discretion but that nobody has any idea about the parameters for it? It
could exclude or include people. Is it not up to Members on the
Government Front Bench to set out some general principles so that we
can at least understand what we are dealing with in the Bill? It seems
that the reason why it has been described as a dog’s breakfast
is that such an important detail has not been
included.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000232">&#160;</a>

underlying principle is. It is to eviscerate legal aid. It is as simple
as that. What we do not know—because I do not think that the
Government know—is exactly how that is going to happen. This is
such a radical reform and it will have a deleterious effect on the
advice and representation sector, so it is highly likely—I hope
I will be here to see whether this prediction comes true or
not—that what is set out in the Bill will not be the limit of
damage. Because so much is taken out of scope and because of the cuts
to remuneration for people who are already poorly paid, we will see the
disappearance not only of firms, agencies and the areas of scope that
we know about, but of whole areas of scope.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000233">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">I know that
the Minister will say at some point—probably when we discuss
schedule 1—that the Government have been careful to protect
those areas of legal aid that, for want of a better phrase, go to life
and limb, such as loss of a home and asylum, and that that represents a
filleting that has taken the necessary core out of the current
provision of legal aid, but I am afraid that that is not what it
represents at all. It is a PR effort. Getting rid of such things would
have been wholly indefensible, rather than just indefensible, and that
is the reason why they had to be left in. We have seen one or two minor
amendments in relation to special educational needs and a slight
widening of the provision for domestic violence, but otherwise there
has been no change at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000234">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Whereas
the Minister may say that he is presenting a different encapsulation of
legal aid, I say that he is not. The Government are, effectively,
ending provision—certainly of social welfare legal
aid—and what provision they have left will not be sustainable in
many cases. At the moment, we get a very good deal out of the providers
of legal aid in this country. I am not talking about top QCs or very
high-cost cases in the criminal courts, which take a sizeable chunk of
the money, but about legal aid solicitors and barristers, about CABs
with Legal Services Commission franchises and law centres, and what
comes with
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000235">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For
our money, we get people who earn low sums. I know how much is earned
by people who manage CABs, who manage lots of staff and volunteers and
by legal aid lawyers—I have been on the management board of a
law centre for more than 25 years—and we are not talking about
people who do it for the money. They do it, to use an old-fashioned
phrase, as a vocation, and they are generally passionate about what
they do. They also bring with them a whole panoply of other benefits.
CABs are partly run by volunteers, often in a ratio of four or
five—sometimes, even 10—to one ordinary member of
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000236">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is a symbiotic relationship between the legal aid practitioners and the
pro bono market. That is most obvious where legal aid is available for
preparation, but not for representation in tribunals. Frequently, even
after having assistance with preparation, people cannot represent
themselves, so they go to the Free Representation Unit or a City firm
that will put someone up to do the case, even if it lasts two or three
days, for nothing. However, that will not work if the Government get
rid of the infrastructure supporting it—the legal aid lawyers
and solicitors and the law centres—and it is fanciful for them
to say that the pro bono or free sector alone will deal with that work.
The consequences are therefore far greater than what we can read in the
Bill, as it is
drafted.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000237">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For
that reason, it is important to have not only regular review and
scrutiny from the professions and others—indeed, from MPs as
constituency MPs—but a formal process of reporting, so that,
whatever duties are set down for the Lord Chancellor, he will have to
report to Parliament on them once a year. That would not be an onerous
duty; it should be a requirement, and I hope it will receive
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000238">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other document that would be required is about the amount of
expenditure and whether there have been additional costs. We have
already discussed that matter, so I shall be brief, but additional
costs might arise in two ways. They arise if, as a consequence of not
receiving early advice or representation, someone falls back on 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 191<a class="bkMark" name="Column191">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the state, the most obvious and most expensive example being
homelessness. The Minister will say that legal aid will be available in
cases where homelessness is an issue. I speak from experience, however,
and the problems leading to homelessness are often cumulative and
complex. They come about through a variety of family
circumstances—getting into debt and not prioritising debts or a
failure to understand what is happening and the failure, typically of a
local authority, to supply housing benefit—so by the time that
legal aid becomes available, it is too late. The lawyer cannot do
anything, because the person is in debt and not paying their rent, and
the courts can do very little, particularly if there are statutory
grounds for
possession.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000239">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a waste of
money to focus only on the issue of homelessness and the problem of a
person losing their home if their other debts are still mounting up,
because the underlying problem will still remain and the person is
likely to find themselves in the same situation
again?<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000240">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Yes. All over the local authority and housing
association estates in my constituency, there are stentorian notices
saying, “Pay your rent at all costs.” They make it clear
that that is the priority. It does not matter whether people have to
deal with loan sharks, other debts, utilities bills and so forth; if
they do not pay their rent, they will not have a roof over their heads.
The financial pressures on local authorities these days mean that they
are much more assiduous in pursuing possession orders. If somebody has
got themselves into debt, and a not very nice man is knocking on their
door every day or ringing up 10 times a day to ask for what little
money they have, the approach my hon. Friend mentioned will not always
work. By the time a lawyer is engaged, they may not be able to do
anything.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000241">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, however, someone can go into Mary Ward legal centre or
Hammersmith and Fulham law centre and say, “I have problems with
housing benefit.” That could be an issue of general assistance.
People will often have tried to reason with the authority and they will
need somebody who understands regulations and what is going wrong and
who can find their way through the bureaucracy in a lay sense and a
legal sense. In that way, people can ensure that the authority deals
properly with them, pays their housing benefit and ensures that their
rent is not in arrears or at least that their debts become manageable.
That means that people will not end up in the situation we are talking
about. It is fatuous to say that simply providing legal advice and
assistance at the last moment will ensure that people do not become
homeless, that asylum seekers and refugees can live a family life or
that many of the other things we will no doubt consider will
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000242">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If we look at
this from a financial, rather than a humanitarian point of view, it is
clear that the cost of homelessness runs into tens of thousands of
pounds in each case. If a family qualifies as being in need under the
housing legislation, the local authority has an obligation to them.
Thus far, the Government have not repealed that legislation, although
nothing would surprise me. However, they have said that obligations can
be permanently discharged into the private sector, although far from
costing less, that often costs more. However, the overall 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 192<a class="bkMark" name="Column192">&#160;</a>
                  </div>cost of homelessness, which could involve family break-up, children
going into care, loss of employment and many other things—not
having a roof over their heads is hugely damaging to individuals and
families—will be several tens of thousands of pounds, not the
few hundred pounds that it would have cost to provide the legal advice
that has now been removed. That might be an extreme example, but we can
go through every area of social welfare law, as I am sure we will, and
come to the same conclusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000243">&#160;</a>

cost of early intervention, when all the debts are dealt with at a cost
of £200—that is how much people pay for a debt case under
legal aid—is much lower than even that of going for the first
possession proceeding, which is the first stage involved in someone
losing their home?<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000244">&#160;</a>

possession day and see lists running down the walls of people whose
homes are up for possession. Even that is still a relatively early
stage. The Minister has clarified that the service at that stage will
be preserved, and I am pleased about that, because it is essential.
Often that is the first contact people have with any professional
advice. As a consequence of that advice, they may find that their case
is adjourned or that they will not lose their home. Often, people even
find that they have a defence at that point, so a deal can be done. If
that is not the case, but the possession order is not granted, or a
suspended possession is granted, they have the opportunity to go away
and be put in touch with the infrastructure of advice in their
area—if it still exists.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000245">&#160;</a>

“Well, we’ve put extra money into those services,”
when they have removed massive amounts of money from local government
and other agencies, which have had to reduce or hold their funding of
Citizens Advice. The Government are not looking at it holistically. We

the Government are not finding resources for

                  </strong> Let us be fair. Subsection (9) would address
that point, so we should be even-handed about it. The Government have
done two things: first, they have extended the financial inclusion fund
for a year; and, secondly, the Lord Chancellor has announced
£20 million for the CAB. I do not know the details of
that scheme. I understand that the scheme is for this financial year,
but I do not know how, to whom or on what basis it is to be
distributed. Importantly, if both those sums expire at the end of the
financial year, what provision will there be for such advice services?
My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield eloquently said that advice
services are probably the most cost-effective way of catching things at
the earliest stage and ensuring that further costs to the public purse
and social costs do not build up.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000247">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It will be
helpful to know the answer, although it may not be the
Minister’s Department, which might be one of the problems. There
is a lot buck passing going on. When we hear the Minister or the Lord
Chancellor blaming local authorities for their cuts to CABs and law
centres, they are absolutely right—my law centre has lost 100%
of its local authority funding—but it is a consequence, at least
in part, of cuts to the budgets of the Departments for Communities and
Local Government and for Business, Innovation and Skills. Until the
last minute reprieve, the whole financial inclusion fund was also
going.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000248">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Yes,
we understand that there is extra money and, clearly, it is welcome. I
am glad the Government have provided the money in both cases, but it
does not compensate for the cuts this year. The money bears no relation
to the cuts set out in the Bill, and we do not have a clear indication
either of how the money will be administered and distributed or, more
importantly, of the future of additional
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000249">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
know the game that the Government are trying to play. It goes along
with their narrative that the advice is non-legal and that anyone can
go into a CAB and give it. I was going to say something that is
probably unfair to the CABs, which is that that is what they were like
50 years ago. Someone would go in to ask directions or to find out
where the police station was, or something of that kind. The Rushcliffe
report talks about CABs, and even back in the 1940s they were doing
extremely valuable and professional work. Now, partly because of the
LSC contract and partly because they are sophisticated organisations,
CABs can assess and give advice at different levels. Some of it may be
generalist advice, but much of it is legal or quasi-legal advice,
otherwise Citizens Advice would not qualify for LSC funding. Let us put
that myth to
bed.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000250">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are told that the Cabinet Office is looking in the round at the
provision of advice, which is a good thing provided that we do not end
up with a second-rate service that caters only for very basic levels of
advice and assistance. All our constituents need to have access to the
high degree of professional advice that is available at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000251">&#160;</a>

visit their local advice agencies, but I would advise going to the Mary
Ward centre in Holborn to see the service that is provided there. It
was a revelation to me, and I thought I was familiar with such
provision. I fear that the consequences will be greater than the
Government intend. I do not ascribe any adverse motives to the Bill; I
take it as it stands. I simply warn the Committee that there will be
consequences, even if they are unintended, from the collapse of the
advice sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000252">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> They do, and I praise the authorities that have
been able to protect advice centres. A very small minority have
prioritised them to the extent that budgets have increased by a small
amount, and I am sure that that is in response to the much greater
demand—let us not forget that other side of the
equation—that exists as a consequence of people being in
economically poor circumstances. That is looking at things with hazy
vision, however. The overwhelming impact of cuts so far, before we get
on to anything in the Bill, has been
horrific.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000254">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to be overly parochial, but two years ago, under a Labour
Government—certainly before that, when the area also had a
Labour local authority—Hammersmith had four superb generalist
advice services. We had an excellent citizens advice bureau. I am
pleased to say that that is still going, but it is having to do two or
three times as much work, it is being forced out of its original
premises and it is not receiving any assistance with its move to new
premises. We had a council-run, well-established advice agency that had
been in existence for 30 years, where I used to do my surgeries. One
day, I turned up to find that the staff and the equipment had gone, and
the agency had simply been closed overnight. We had a specialist
housing advice service called Threshold, which operates in a number of
London boroughs. That was forced to close by the withdrawal of all its
local authority funding, after it had been going for more than thirty
years, since 1978. We had the Hammersmith and Fulham law centre, which,
as the right hon. Gentleman has acknowledged, has lost 100% of its
local authority funding. It is surviving only through its own extremely
effective fundraising, which included myself and Baroness Hale doing
the London legal sponsored walk on its behalf. I am delighted that
Baroness Hale, a justice of the Supreme Court, is now the law
centre’s patron—as, indeed, Lord Bingham was before
her—because that gives it an additional profile and it shows the
esteem in which such organisations are held by the senior ranks of the
judiciary.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000255">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am old
enough to remember the last time that this all happened, in the early
1980s, when there was a studied campaign to remove funding from law
centres and advice agencies. Many of those in London—I am not
sure whether the right hon. Gentleman is old enough to remember this,
even though he is a privy councillor, on which I congratulate
him—hung on for a couple of years until Ken Livingstone found
the money to keep them going. This is not the first time that we have
been in crisis, although it is the first time in 30
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11071989000256">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“My
view is if these changes are to go through, there’s a case for

the
