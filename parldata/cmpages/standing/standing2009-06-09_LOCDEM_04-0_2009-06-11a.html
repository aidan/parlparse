Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): The Committee will have
noted that, in relation to all the clauses bar one, the official
Opposition have adopted what might be called a scorched-earth policy
towards the Bill. At first glance, we were inclined to take the same
view of the next two clauses. However, I have to confess that we have
looked at them again. They were introduced by Lord Graham in the upper
House and the Department allowed them a lot of leeway. Clause 27, in
particular, was welcomed by our noble Friend Lord Hanningfield. We have
no objection to the
clauses.</div><a name="0906124000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906124000512"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): I shall make one
important point. We are now dealing with references to freewomen and
freemen. Should the term not simply be &#147;a freeperson&#148;,
given the prevailing wisdom that now we have a chair, not a chairman,
and we talk about persons, not men and women? Should the term not be
&#147;a freeperson&#148;, or perhaps just &#147;a
free&#148;?</div><a name="0906124000447"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15

Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): It is a pleasure
to serve under your leadership&#151;chairmanship, not leadership,
Mr. Illsley, unless something more bizarre is going on.
Bearing in mind what has already happened in Committee today, I would
not be at all surprised if you had plans for world
domination.</div>
<a name="0906124000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make
some general comments about freedoms of cities and towns. It is
fantastic to recognise the hard work of citizens in such a way. It is a
valuable honour to bestow. But once again, why is it necessary to set
it down in primary legislation? I hope that the Minister will be able
to clarify that matter. I understand the problem&#151;some charters
laying down how freemen and freewomen of a city or town are elected
have become out of date and make it difficult to appoint
women&#151;but I am not entirely sure why that needs to be taken in
hand in primary
legislation.</div><a name="0906124000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that such laws need to be more easily amendable, but why not
free up the organisations on the ground to allow them to use their
discretion? Some of the provisions are eminently sensible. The
recognition of civil partners and spouses and the admission of women
are welcome, but I am not entirely sure why the Bill needs to deal with
whether we call them freemen or women.</div>
<a name="0906124000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend the Member for North Cornwall pointed out to me, some of the
qualifying resolutions require a majority of the existing freemen or
women to elect the people whose names will be added. I wonder, as those
people are often getting a little bit old, whether they might run out
of numbers. I am slightly worried that, if the requirement is for
freemen to nominate someone else to be given the freedom, there might
not be enough of them around to make that decision. I wonder whether
that issue needs to be addressed. It is an example of where we need to
give more flexibility on the ground, rather than specifying things
rigidly in primary legislation. However, everyone welcomes the
principle that the clause is trying to
achieve.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000514"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr. Illsley. I am
glad that there is a broad welcome from both Opposition parties to the
principles behind the clause. As the hon. Member for Wycombe pointed
out, it was fully welcomed in the other
place.</div><a name="0906124000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question of primary legislation, it is true that at least one guild
has been able to amend the rights of admission to include women, but
much depends on how the rights of admission were established&#151;if
in a charter, on what the charter says. Although some guilds have found
sufficient flexibility in their rules to enable them to admit women or
make other amendments to their admissions practices, others have not
been able to do so because the charters or other sources of law from
which their rules derive have no simple process for amendment. The
clause will make that easier and provide a framework to make changes in
the future. That is why it should appear in primary
legislation.</div><a name="0906124000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000515"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I understand that point, but looking back to
the broader thrust of the Bill, which the Government claim is trying to
engage people in democracy, could we not have much broader terms that
would allow some kind of public ballot or petition to prompt the
granting of the freedom of a city to individuals, rather than a
narrowly defined group of people? Would this not be an opportunity to
throw open the whole issue to more public engagement, rather than just
introducing some narrow changes that, while making improvements to make
it easier for women to be admitted, for example, do not address the
bigger
issue?</div><a name="0906124000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000516"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> This is enabling legislation, not compulsory
legislation. We are making it easier for guilds to broaden their scope,

part. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div>

Stewart Jackson</b> (Peterborough) (Con): It has been a long
day. This clause was the subject of some debate in another place,
particularly by Liberal Democrat peers. Those of us who were local
borough and district councillors or were involved in local government
in the 1980s and 1990s understand the background. The Widdecombe report
of 1986 correctly led to the decision to exclude certain officers based
on salary from serving in a representative capacity on other local
authorities under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989.</div>
<a name="0906124000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition
believe that the clause is incongruous. It is clear from the debate in
another place that there was no rationale for watering down the
Widdecombe proposals. The Minister may refer to the Councillors
Commission&#146;s decisions on political restrictions, but the clause
begins the process of undermining what eventually had a political
consensus when it was established. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>legislation defended the integrity and professionalism of officers and
reassured elected councillors that the advice that they received from
paid officers was both impartial and not the result of their political
allegiance. The clause, however, begins to undermine that by seeking to
disregard the responsibility and duty of the local authority to keep a
register of those affected by the 1989
Act.</div>
<a name="0906124000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis,
perhaps the Minister will explain the rationale for including the
clause in this part of the Bill. It seems to be a case of
micro-managing the affairs of local authorities who are perfectly
capable of interpreting correctly the prevailing legislation. Can the
Minister reassure us that this is not the beginning of the end of
ensuring that political partiality does not creep back into the
system?</div>
<a name="0906124000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000518"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Conservative Members think that the clause
will water down the Widdecombe rules, and I share some of their
concerns that it does appear to be a partial process: it will remove
the salary restrictions but will not seek to put anything else in its
place. Simply imposing an arbitrary wage level may not make sense,
because some posts with lower wages may be politically sensitive and
other posts that are above the threshold may not need to be politically
restrictive. I would like greater freedom for local authorities to
determine such things and to ensure that declarations of interest can
be registered for all employees using a clear system.</div>
<a name="0906124000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Speaking as
someone who was employed by a local council, I think that just because
someone is unable to be politically active does not necessarily mean
that their decisions are therefore impartial. Someone may not be able
to declare their views publicly, but that does not mean that their
private views might not cause similar difficulties. In this case, the
Government have a much bigger story to tell. They are nibbling away at
one aspect of it without necessarily giving people confidence that
there is a process further down the line that will keep partiality out
of key areas of government, as it rightly needs to
be.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000519"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> Before Report, I wonder whether the Minister could
give us a list of the number of people in one county who are
councillors on a different council. I wonder whether it is a real or a
mythical problem. I cannot think of a single person in North Yorkshire,
in the whole time that I have represented it, who has been an employee
of one authority and a councillor in another. People cannot leave their
political allegiance behind when they go in and out of the relative
town hall.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000520"></a>Julia

about standing for election, but about being able to express views
publicly in favour of a political party. It is not simply about
conflicts arising from individuals standing for public
office.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000521"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> No, I accept that, but the most high-profile way in
which someone might wish to express a political opinion is by standing
for election to a council, and there are a number of bodies that have a
political role to which people can be nominated. The Dales national
park is not entirely made up of councillors, for example. I wonder how
real the issue is. Quite frankly, why are we bothering with it? I think
that we have invented a problem, and I do not understand why we should
invent a solution to a non-problem.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000522"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b><b class="B"> </b>Hon. Members&#146; contributions
suggest that there might be some misunderstanding about what the clause
will actually do. It will merely remove the link between salary level
and the designation for local authority posts. The salary level is
currently a sum of money, not a scale for a post, and the sum of money
has not been updated for a number of years. We therefore continue to
support the policy behind the Widdecombe rules, which help to ensure
the political impartiality of local authority employees. The removal of
the link between salary and whether a post is considered politically
restricted will not undermine the impartiality.</div>
<a name="0906124000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
legislation is enacted, the following posts will remain politically
restricted: chief executive, chief officer, deputy chief officer,
monitoring officer, political assistant, and any person whose post is
specified in a list maintained by the local authority whose duties
involve giving advice to the authority on a regular basis and/or
speaking regularly to the media on behalf of the authority. In relation
to the last category, the ultimate test of whether an individual post
is politically sensitive will depend on the nature of the
duties that the post entails. Every officer falling within
that category may be entitled to exemption from political restriction
if the nature of the duties of that post does not require the post
holder to be politically neutral. Applications for exemption are
considered by the local authority standards
committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000523"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> Will the hon. Lady give me the assurance that
anyone involved in planning will be covered by the
restrictions?</div>
<a name="0906124000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000524"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> That would be up to the individual local
authority to determine. It would have to apply the rules that I have
set out and would be subject to the standards
committee.</div>
<a name="0906124000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000525"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I am trying to understand what process will
follow if the changes are adopted. Presumably, some posts are
automatically politically restricted at the moment because of the
salary level. If, after the proposals are put in place, some posts will
not be automatically restricted because of the salary level and a
judgment may be needed about whether or not they should be deemed to be
politically restricted, will every council therefore have to go through
a process of auditing those affected to ensure that positions are not
missed or added by mistake?</div>
<a name="0906124000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000526"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am perfectly happy to confirm that to the
hon. Lady. The clause will provide a more sensible way of going forward
than using an arbitrary sum of money or a salary
level.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000527"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I do not think that there was any confusion among
Conservative Members. We just want assurances from the Minister that
the Government are still committed to the enduring principles of the
Widdecombe report, which have lasted for 20 years. In fact, the Library
supporting documents state that the clause is not related to a monetary
sum but to spine point 44 on the national
scale.</div><a name="0906124000448"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="0906124000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000528"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I think that we are getting into specifics,
because it is a point on the scale of salaries, but it will be a
specific sum of money each year. I do not know whether the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point is the Opposition&#146;s position, but in
the other place Lord 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>Hanningfield certainly welcomed the provision, agreed that we should
look at the role played by the officer, rather than the salary, and
described the salary point as &#147;totally
outdated.&#148;</div><a name="0906124000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000529"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I still think that there are some serious
questions about the operation of the clause and suspect that, if it is
accepted, there will need to be a significant amount of secondary
legislation to support it, because of the number of elected councillors
who might be affected by it. Given the Minister&#146;s assurances,
which I think the Committee will find satisfactory, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0906124000097"></a>

Bill.</div><a name="0906124000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000532"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Our approach to clause 30 is, in a manner of
speaking, the opposite of our approach to clauses 28 and 29, which we
have just considered. When we originally looked at clauses 28 and 29,
we were inclined to be sceptical and looked at what happened in the
Lords, but we came to the conclusion that they should pass muster. We
have not tabled one of our repetitious and unselectable amendments in
an attempt to delete clause 30, because we want to give the Minister a
chance to justify it. Having said that, it did not have a friendly
reception in the other place, where both Lord Hanningfield and Baroness
Hanwee were extremely sceptical about it, drawing attention to the
difference between the present state of affairs, where there is a
monitoring officer, and a section 151 officer, and trying to get the
Minister in the Lords to explain where that post would slot into the
present arrangements. Indeed, Baroness Hanwee spoke of her opposition
to the
clause.</div><a name="0906124000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the risk of sounding like a broken gramophone record, we come back
again and again to the same question: bang in the middle of part 1 is
the word &#147;must&#148;. Must we have &#147;must&#148; in the
Bill? Need the statute book have such specific obligations placed on
local authorities? The Minister probably has some explanation up her
sleeve for why the finance officer, referred to in subsection 4(c), and
the monitoring officer and the head of the authority&#146;s paid
service, referred to in paragraphs (b) and (a) respectively, may not be
designated and why other posts may be, and I look forward to hearing
it.</div>
<a name="0906124000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary,
obviously the role of scrutinising what takes place in local councils
is extremely important. We on the official Opposition Benches say that
the correct balance must be struck between proper scrutiny and the need
not to overburden local authorities with so many scrutinising duties
from the centre that it makes it difficult for them to run their
affairs with flexibility. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>wait to hear what the Minster has to say, but we are far from convinced
that the clause, as drafted, should stand part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="0906124000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000533"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The key question is if this is the answer,
what is the question? Is there a concern that the current scrutiny
processes are not sufficient? Do we feel that the scrutiny procedures
are not scrutinised enough? If so, do we need to open up channels for
that to take place? I draw the Committee&#146;s mind back to some
comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall, who said
that if we are imposing this measure on all authorities, does it pass
the Isles of Scilly test? Will the Isles of Scilly, which has a very
small council, now be required to appoint another officer to undertake
scrutiny, when there are a relatively small number of officers to
scrutinise?</div><a name="0906124000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not clear why the duty that is outlined in this clause does not
apply</div>
<a name="0906124000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to a district
council for an area for which there is a county
council&#148;</div><a name="0906124000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
outlined in subsection (5). Surely if such a position is needed at
local authority level to ensure that overview and scrutiny committees
follow due process, then that should apply at any level of local
government. I do not see why it should just apply to the principal
authority in two-tier authorities. I share the scepticism that has been
expressed, and I look forward to the Minister explaining the question
to which this is the
answer.</div><a name="0906124000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000534"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am glad that we all agree that overview
and scrutiny is an important way of ensuring local accountability and
transparency. Moreover, it is an important tool for empowering
communities and enabling local people, through their democratically
elected representatives, to participate. However, we must ensure that
all lead councils rise to the standards of the best, and that all are
aware that this powerful tool is an effective means of driving
improvement.</div>
<a name="0906124000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">For effective
scrutiny, it is important that there is proper officer support and that
officer resources are in place to provide that support and advice. The
evaluation document, &#147;The New Council Constitutions: The
Outcomes and Impact of the Local Government Act 2000&#148;, made a
number of important points. First, less officer support is provided for
scrutiny compared with executive functions. Secondly, scrutiny works
best and is more robust in areas in which resources are committed.
Thirdly, scrutiny arrangements are not as robust as executive
arrangements. Moreover, we looked carefully at the Centre for Public
Scrutiny survey, which sought views from the local government sector on
the single element that would do most to improve the overview and
scrutiny function. One of the highest responses was to provide more
resources and
staff.</div><a name="0906124000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also consulted extensively on how to implement the proposals for
scrutiny and support set out in the White Paper, &#147;Communities in
control&#148;. The Centre for Public Scrutiny thought that that would
be essential, if scrutiny is to benefit from the new powers and
responsibilities outlined in the White Paper. We looked at three
corporate statutory posts, which, experience has shown, are the
foundation for ensuring that councils devote sufficient attention and
support to those key functions in a way that is appropriate to their
local circumstances.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div><a name="0906124000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have given careful consideration to views expressed in the
consultation, which make a compelling case for our proposal to replace
the requirement on lead councils to have a scrutiny officer who is
responsible for supporting the work of their overview and scrutiny
committee, which does not have to be their only role. We are not saying
that councils should have one person who only does that. We leave that
decision to local
councils.</div><a name="0906124000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000535"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Will the Minister clarify whether there will
be additional resources for such a function and that it will not be
just another job title for an officer to take on? Will there be
resources that enable the kind of support that she has talked
about?</div><a name="0906124000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000536"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I confirm that if this clause is passed, the
resources will be made available within the funding process to support
that role. I do not think that the approach we have set out is overly
prescriptive, which was the point made by the hon. Member for Wycombe.
It recognises the important role officer support plays in driving
effective scrutiny, but balances that with the need to allow local
flexibility. We have not attempted any complex prescription of the
scrutiny resources, and the clause provides scope for local authorities
to determine these detailed arrangements for
themselves.</div><a name="0906124000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been asked why we have excluded certain council officers from
becoming a scrutiny officer. Just as the scrutiny function is kept
separate from the executive function by ensuring that members of the
executive cannot serve on overview and scrutiny committees, it makes
sense that the scrutiny officer should not hold one of the key
corporate posts as head of paid services or chief financial officer.
The monitoring officer&#146;s role is to ensure that the authority
conducts its business lawfully and with propriety. The post carries
certain powers and duties. Although the role of scrutiny is to some
extent complementary in that it also provides checks and balances on
the exercise of executive functions, the role of the scrutiny officer
is to support scrutiny by members, and not to carry it out. Allowing
those two roles to be carried out by the same person could blur the
distinction between the two functions and lead to confusion.</div>
<a name="0906124000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Falmouth and Camborne asked why the requirements are not
applied to district councils. We are trying to ensure that the quality
of scrutiny in councils responsible for local area agreements is raised
to the standards of the current best, which is why we have confined
them to those authorities. On that basis, I hope that we can pass the
clause.</div><a name="0906124000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000552"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000553"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> The official Opposition, like other Opposition
parties, were not convinced by the Minister&#146;s explanation of
clause 30. She said that the view had generally been expressed that it
would be useful to have more resources and scrutiny and that
representations had been made to the Department for Communities and
Local Government, but it did not seem to us, on the basis of her
comments, that local authorities and others were knocking at the
Department&#146;s door saying that scrutiny in local authorities was
poor.</div><a name="0906124000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">And
that brings me directly to our amendments. Very often, amendments are
probing amendments designed to test the Government&#146;s intentions.
However, these amendments would give the clause sufficient flexibility
to make it just about bearable. Amendment 33 would remove the Secretary
of State&#146;s regulation-making power and give local authorities
the flexibility to make this provision, if they so wish. Amendment 34
would replace &#147;regulations&#148;&#151;again, made from the
centre&#151;with the more pliable word &#147;arrangements&#148;.
That is also the case with the next amendment. Perhaps we have taken a
rather severe view of any guidance issued by the Secretary of State in
amendment 36. However, together, our amendments would make the minimum
necessary changes to the clause to ensure that it does not place a
burden on local authorities that, on the basis of the Minister&#146;s
evidence, they should not have to
carry.</div><a name="0906124000449"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000554"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I think that everybody in the Committee
agrees that ensuring a strong scrutiny process is important in order
for people to have confidence that their councils are well run and
that, if there are any problems, a mechanism exists for investigating
them fully. The Liberal Democrats have no problem with the
establishment of joint overview and scrutiny committees. There are many
issues on which councils working together can be run more efficiently,
and we can see an improved process.</div>
<a name="0906124000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our problem is
that we cannot see why the process must be determined by the Secretary
of State. The concern is that it brings forward a background issue,
which is that the Government always presume the best intentions in the
Government and the worst in local authorities. The provisions are just
another example of that: clearly, local councils cannot be trusted to
come 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div>up with satisfactory arrangements; that will only be achieved if those
arrangements are specified, once again, in primary legislation. That
seems to be the theme of virtually every clause in the
Bill.</div><a name="0906124000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments presented by the hon. Member for Wycombe seem entirely
sensible. They would make it clear that it is not only the local
authority&#146;s right but its responsibility to ensure that the
process works effectively. For councils that might struggle to do so,
the regulations might be an additional burden that will make it more
difficult to fulfil those duties. Once again, the Government have no
business requiring all local authorities to act entirely in a specified
way. It is a matter for local authorities. It is depressing that we
continue to have discussions such as
this.</div><a name="0906124000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000555"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> If the Minister were to accept the amendments,
would it not be a good opportunity to put into practice the new

devolution?</div>
<a name="0906124000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000556"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The right hon. Gentleman makes a valid point.
This is called the Local Democracy Bill, and the White Paper that
informed much of it was all about putting communities back in control.
Exactly how will the Bill put communities back in control? Even looked
at in the most positive way, which is that it is about giving
communities a better service&#151;I am sure that the Government will
present it that way&#151;it certainly does not put them in control.
It puts power in the hands of one person only, and that person is the
Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="0906124000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000557"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Has the hon. Lady had a chance to read&#151;I
am sure that she has, as she is an assiduous chewer-through of
material&#151;a recent report called &#147;The balance of

Government, on which our parties do not have a majority? The conclusion
reads:</div><a name="0906124000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Central

Goldsworthy:</b><b class="B"> </b>It is a challenge for all political
parties. It is easy to use the rhetoric surrounding empowering
communities and pushing down resource, but it is an opportunity for the
Government to ensure that their actions confirm their words. At the
moment, they appear to be contradicting
them.</div><a name="0906124000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000559"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> Of course, the supervision of the Secretary of
State will be carried out by the regional office, so in practice, an
official will make a recommendation to the Secretary of State. The
practical decision could well be taken by somebody who is not
elected.</div><a name="0906124000150"></a>

Goldsworthy:</b> And then we are back into quangocracy and
bureaucracy, which will continue to be remote to so many people. I have
grave concerns about the clause. The amendments are an attempt to
restate that. I think that the Conservatives also have a long way to go
in persuading people that they are prepared to back up their rhetoric
with actions, so if the Government were to adopt the
amendments&#151;I am inclined to support them&#151;it might be an
opportunity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>to demonstrate on a cross-party basis that not only are all the parties

done&#151;</div><a name="0906124000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000562"></a>Mr.
Goodman</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="0906124000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000563"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman please leave me for a
moment? I simply want to make this point. If central Government do not
create a clear, legal framework under which it is absolutely clear to
local authorities that they can set up joint scrutiny committees, there
will inevitably be variations in interpretation of what is within their
power and what is not. This is where there is an absolute case for
central Government to set out the framework. It does not impose
obligation on local authorities: the powers are permissive. How they
set up their joint scrutiny committees will be for them to decide, as
will whether they set them up at all.</div>
<a name="0906124000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
Opposition parties are completely wide of the mark on this. They are
trying to see some kind of authoritarian, central Government diktat
where it does not apply at
all.</div><a name="0906124000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000564"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> If the right hon. Gentleman, to whose experience
I defer, wants a framework he can have one, but why should not that
framework say &#147;local authorities may&#148; rather than
&#147;the Secretary of State may&#148; by
regulations?</div><a name="0906124000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000565"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> For the very simple reason, as I just
explained, that some authorities may take a different interpretation of
the extent of the powers for some of the scrutiny bodies that may be
set up, not just with other authorities, but with other parties as
well. All the evidence of scrutiny&#151;the Minister referred to the
experience of the Centre for Public Scrutiny&#151;suggests that there
are huge benefits from cross-silo working by different authorities and
bodies in the public service. We should surely be encouraging this and
promoting a framework that makes it
possible.</div>
<a name="0906124000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000566"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> Like my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe, I
defer to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s interest in and passion for
this issue, but we are not talking about encouragement. The Bill is
effectively forcing local authorities to amalgamate their functions.
What is wrong with using the term &#147;may&#148; and giving more
authority and autonomy to local authorities, if they have issues
relating to social and economic commonality of
interest?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div><a name="0906124000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000567"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The hon. Gentleman is completely wrong. If he
reads the Bill, he will see that the relevant phrase
says:</div><a name="0906124000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by regulations make provision under which any
two or more local authorities in England may&#148;&#151;</div>
<a name="0906124000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It says
&#147;may&#148;, not &#147;must&#148;. It is permissive; it
helps local authorities; it gives clarity. It is Government acting
sensibly: acting in response to representations, made by many people
with experience of good scrutiny, that we should be encouraging
cross-border and cross-sector working to ensure a more joined-up
approach to the delivery of public services and better government at a
local level.</div>
<a name="0906124000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000568"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The right hon. Gentleman says that the
problem is that there have been variations in interpretation, but does
he not think that a good thing, which allows for the boundaries to be
pushed even further? Is it not also slightly risky to assume that joint
scrutiny processes will in every case help overcome some of the silo
thinking? I can think of a joint health and adult social care overview
scrutiny committee that, from the point of view of the public, has been
very confusing because it looks at decisions for which it has no
responsibility. In many cases, it has been criticised for decisions
that are entirely in the realm of health, and nothing to do with the
council it is responsible for scrutinising. So this provision is not
the only way of breaking down these silo
issues.</div><a name="0906124000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000569"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The hon. Lady makes two points, the first of
which is to leave it all to local authorities. I entirely concur with
the principle that the format of the joint scrutiny committees can
probably best be determined at a local level. The problem is that if
individual local authorities are advised by their lawyers that their
powers are perhaps limited, we may get different interpretations. One
authority could take the view that it has the power to set up such a
committee, and another might take a different view. That is why it is
sensible to have a national
framework.</div><a name="0906124000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady&#146;s second point was that joint scrutiny is not always a
good thing. Of course it is not always, and it can sometimes be done
badly, but there are huge gains from different organisations with
different perspectives working together. The experience of local
authority involvement in health scrutiny is an interesting issue. It
has helped local authorities, with their considerable social care
responsibilities, to have a much better understanding of the interface
between what they do and what the national health service does. That
must be a good
thing.</div><a name="0906124000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000570"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I have no doubt that it has helped to
encourage joint working, but this is the Local Democracy Bill and much
of what we have been considering is about aiding people&#146;s
understanding. I am not entirely convinced that in every case, these
joint committees help people to understand where the responsibilities,
and ultimately the budgets, also
lie.</div><a name="0906124000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000571"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> They may not have worked in every case, but
they have overwhelmingly been a force for good. I would have thought
that the hon. Lady and her party would support this as a way of
encouraging more joined-up working at local level, with the permissive
power to enable local authorities to take useful
initiatives.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div><a name="0906124000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000572"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I have a sense that we are travelling round
different perimeters of the circle to arrive at the same point. If
local authorities had to discover the boundaries of their powers
themselves, would not the tradition of best practice before very long
assert a common view of what was permitted? Would not that
process of experimentation in a sense be rather creative in the
process? Secondly, what the hell is the Local Government Association
for?</div>
<a name="0906124000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000573"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Probably, given its recent difficulties, it is
best to pass over that second question. On the first question, I give
the right hon. Gentleman three names to show why his assumption is a
bit optimistic. They are the names of local authorities with which I
had considerable dealings when I was Local Government Minister because
they were in an appalling mess: the London borough of Hackney, the
metropolitan borough of Walsall and the district of Rossendale. Those
are three different authorities under different political
control&#151;that is the reason why I mention them&#151;that were
not working well and where, despite the fact that this had been evident
for many years, there was little sign of any improvements.</div>
<a name="0906124000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes it
is necessary to give a little nudge and a little help in the right
direction. When that is done it can often produce rather remarkable
results. I am happy to say that all three of those local authorities
are now working very much better&#151;remarkably better than a decade
ago. There is evidence of the perfectibility of man, woman and local
government, but sometimes it requires a bit of a nudge. So just leaving
it to the automatic process, as the right hon. Gentleman suggests, may
not be the right approach. The clause is eminently sensible. I believe
that the Opposition&#146;s amendments are misconceived and I hope
that my hon. Friend the Minister will recommend the clause to the
Committee and that it will approve
it.</div><a name="0906124000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000574"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I thank my right hon. Friend for sharing his
considerable expertise and experience on this issue, and I entirely
concur with his remarks. Unfortunately, I do not entirely concur, as
might be expected, with the remarks of Opposition Members.</div>
<a name="0906124000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure the
Committee that we have not opted for this approach because we want to
prescribe the fine details of how local arrangements work. To reiterate
what my right hon. Friend said, the regulations simply ensure a broad
framework and flexibility to address key questions relating to area
scrutiny committees. This is an enabling power and a practical measure
that allows us to address matters of important detail in regulations,
to ensure that the various scrutiny provisions dovetail and work
effectively without causing duplication or unnecessary burdens. I
certainly see nothing unusual or sinister about making provision for
such matters through
regulation.</div><a name="0906124000450"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="0906124000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee might be aware that we recently consulted on proposals for
joint area scrutiny arrangements. Responses to that consultation
highlighted a number of practical considerations. For instance, there
were concerns about the need for full and fair representation of all
interests and proper governance arrangements, and there is clearly a
difficult but important balance to strike, and possibly quite complex
arrangements to make.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div><a name="0906124000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the proposal for any two or more authorities to appoint joint overview
and scrutiny committees is new, it is even more important that we
carefully consider those practical issues and work with key
stakeholders to ensure that the right balance is struck. By addressing
those detailed matters in regulations, we can ensure that the new
arrangements work to deliver real benefits for communities.</div>
<a name="0906124000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">On guidance,
Parliament agreed and recognised the need for a statutory
guidance-making power for the overview and scrutiny
provisions introduced by the Local Government and Public Involvement in
Health Act 2007, including those for joint overview and scrutiny
committees. Overview and scrutiny committees are already required to
have regard to a basic level of statutory guidance and there is no good
reason to treat joint overview and scrutiny committees differently.
However, I should like to reassure the Committee that wherever
possible, guidance should take the form of sector-led best practice
guidance. That is why we are working with the Centre for Public
Scrutiny to issue guidance to accompany the new overview and scrutiny
powers, thereby limiting the need for statutory guidance.</div>
<a name="0906124000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Gentleman is prepared to withdraw the amendment and support
the clause as it stands.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000575"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> It might be a reflection of what a sad individual
I am, but I have found this debate absolutely fascinating. It has been
fascinating not because of anything I said, or even, with due respect,
because of anything the Minister said&#151;after all, we are both
toiling workers in the vineyards respectively of the Leader of the
Opposition and the Prime Minister. The debate has not even been
fascinating because of the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, well
informed though she always is. It was compelling because of the
exchanges between those two old rivals and friends, my right hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000577"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Mastodons is the word. The right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich has been far more loyal this afternoon than he
was with those ridiculous petition clauses when he voted the wrong
way&#151;I should say the right way, by accident or design. Of
course, he meant what he said this
afternoon.</div><a name="0906124000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was a profound difference of philosophical approach that might
illustrate what will happen when we reach the general election,
whenever that is. On the one hand, my right hon. Friend says,
&#147;What&#146;s the LGA for? What&#146;s best practice for?
Leave councils to their own devices and standards will be driven up as
they look at what each other do. A thousand flowers will bloom and by
some organic and almost ecological process, all will turn out
well,&#148; to which the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
says, forcefully, and with every rhetorical device and all the
expertise at his command, which is a great deal, &#147;It
won&#146;t work. You need the benign hand on the tiller of central
Government.&#148; He is wise enough to know that the hand must not be
applied heavily, but his position is that we need the hand and for it
to be applied lightly&#151;we cannot simply
devolve.</div>
<a name="0906124000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the difference between the approaches of those two very experienced
parliamentarians, both of whom are very knowledgeable in their fields.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000580"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> It is interesting for the hon. Gentleman to
pose those diametrically opposed philosophical positions, but I am sure
that the electorate will cast its mind back to the track record of the
previous Conservative Government, and find that they probably did not
take exactly the approach he described. They might actually have
engaged in a small amount of centralisation of local authorities. Does
he agree that we should take with quite a large pinch of salt his

concede that the Liberal Democrats have never been in government, so
they do not have to take such decisions. We cannot automatically assume
that, had they been, they would not also have been tempted occasionally
to tread the primrose path to the hell of centralisation, so she ought
to have a little care. However, whether she thinks that such positions

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000608"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> This is a significant clause. Those members of
the Committee who do not possess any special expertise in Welsh
affairs&#151;of whom I have to confess I am one&#151;may be tempted
to let it slip by without debate. However, it is significant and it
gives rise to some questions.</div>
<a name="0906124000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has not risen to speak, so I shall say a word or two about what the
clause seems to do. It sets out a series of framework powers which
would extend the legislative competence of the Welsh Assembly by
inserting some new matters in field 12&#151;the powers that councils
in Wales are allowed to exercise. As the briefing from the Assembly
says:</div><a name="0906124000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill is an
opportunity for the Assembly Government to seek framework powers that
will enable it to bring forward proposals for legislation in respect of
governance and overview and
scrutiny.&#148;</div><a name="0906124000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
all, as the brief also
says:</div><a name="0906124000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Welsh Assembly Government can only go so far within the existing
legislative
framework.&#148;</div><a name="0906124000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
new powers mean new competencies. The brief sets out what those
are:</div><a name="0906124000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
effect, the Welsh Assembly Government wishes the Assembly to have
legislative competence in the areas covered by the provisions of Part
II of the Local Government Act 2000. This Act introduced different
models for executive arrangements, including the Mayor, Cabinet and
Leader and Cabinet models. The executive became responsible for most
local authority functions, working within a policy framework set by the
full council. The 2000 Act also brought about the creation of overview
and scrutiny
committees&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0906124000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
we have just been
considering&#151;</div><a name="0906124000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;made
up of non-executive (&#145;backbench&#146;) councillors, to
scrutinise the work of the executive as well as reviewing policy within
and without the council itself as they affected the local area. This
legislative competence would enable the Welsh Government to give effect
to its policies in this area following consideration of the Beecham
Review and the outcome of research commissioned into the role and
function of elected members in Welsh local
government.&#148;</div><a name="0906124000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think the key question that arises from this, which this Committee
ought to consider, and certainly should have an interest in, is what
powers the Welsh Assembly Government, or WAG&#151;not to be confused
with other WAGs&#151;wish to exercise. I should therefore like to ask
some questions about the intentions of the Assembly Government,
given&#151;and I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed
this&#151;that a Welsh Assembly Government Minister came to brief the
House informally on Tuesday on the measures that they wish to pass if
the clause is enacted. I am not aware&#151;and I have checked with
the other Opposition party and I believe that it also is not
aware&#151;of any briefing for this Committee. Will the Minister
outline how the process between the Assembly Government and this
Parliament is supposed to function and explain why&#151;if I am
correct, and I accept that I may have been misinformed&#151;no one
from this Committee was made aware of the
briefing.</div><a name="0906124000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apparently,
the Welsh Assembly Government, the WAG, wish to enact certain powers.
They wish to establish</div>
<a name="0906124000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;joint scrutiny
committees between neighbouring authorities&#148;,</div>
<a name="0906124000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">a
matter we have just been considering. Can the Minister confirm that
these committees will be made up of elected members only? The Welsh
Assembly Government wants to enable co-option of
&#147;representatives from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>third parties&#148; to these scrutiny committees. It looks as if they
will not be made up of elected members only, so I may have answered my
own question. How does this equate with the principle of
accountability, if these rights are handed over to people who are not
accountable to anyone? The Welsh Assembly Government have also said
that they wish to introduce &#147;a duty to scrutinise&#148; across
&#147;the whole public sector&#148;. Would the Minister say more
about what that means? Could they, for example, summon any Minister to
appear before a local government committee? If so, is there a case to
argue that the power has been drawn rather widely?</div>
<a name="0906124000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Welsh
Assembly Government would apparently like to abolish whipping in
scrutiny committees, although how that will be achieved is not clear.
Perhaps the Minister could provide an explanation. Could the Minister
explain what the Welsh Assembly Government intend to do with such
powers? If they are devolved in relation to the proposed redesign of
political structures, will local councils be, in some way, forced to
adopt structures set by the Welsh Assembly
Government?</div><a name="0906124000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then
there is a desire of the Welsh Assembly Government that is hard to
understand. They wish to strengthen</div>

would be grateful if the Minister provided some clarification, and, if
she cannot do any of that instantaneously, or if the necessary

Government to write to the hon. Gentleman. I personally have not met
any of their members. I understand that a briefing on a framework power
was held on Tuesday 9 June at 3 pm, and that it was publicised to hon.
Members when most of us would have been preparing for our afternoon
sitting. I can only apologise for that. The policy will be subject to
consultation with the Welsh Assembly Government. We intend to give them
the powers to decide their decision-making regime. As he will know, we
have specifically excluded from the Bill anything in respect of direct
elections to executives of county and county borough councils in Wales
or the creation of a form of executive requiring direct elections. I
can only say to the hon. Gentleman that I will write to him with the

requires.</div><a name="0906124000232"></a>

implemented under the Companies Acts to local authorities. It is
entirely sensible for there to be that mirror. This part of the Bill
seems largely uncontroversial and sensible. Speaking as an MP who
represents an area that has been covered by local government reform and
has been undergoing the boundary-making process, I think that the
proposals contain sensible amendments. I do not think that they would
have resolved all the problems that we experienced in Cornwall, but
they address some of the issues and are a big step forward towards a
process that will be more timely and will give people confidence in the
electoral process. We broadly welcome many of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000615"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Unlike many of the clauses being considered this
afternoon, new clause 4 concerns a request to the Local Government
Boundary Commission to advise on proposals for the amalgamation of
relevant principal councils. The request does not flow from the
Secretary of State, but comes up from the bottom, the councils
themselves, which is why we thought that it was worth tabling the new
clause. It is a relatively simple measure, and I commend it to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="0906124000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000616"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> We welcome the transfer of functions relating
to boundary changes from the Electoral Commission&#146;s boundary
committee to the Local Government Boundary Commission. Those are two
different jobs and it is important that they are separated. New clause
4 is self-explanatory, and we wish to see a bottom-up process. We
welcome variety in local government, and acknowledge that some places
will have different set-ups that will be more appropriate for them than
others would be. It is important that any review of the boundaries of
local government, or any amalgamation of authorities, should be driven
by what people want on the ground, rather than by a centralised
process. If the new clause is aimed at achieving that, we will be happy
to support it.</div>
<a name="0906124000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0906124000617"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley. It is the first time
that I have had the opportunity to address the Committee, but I will be
brief. I wish to emphasise that the new clause also stands in my name.
I draw that to the Committee&#146;s attention because I represent a
constituency that has just gone through a transition from a two-tier
structure to a unitary tier.</div>
<a name="0906124000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the process
of allocating the new unitary ward boundaries, in one part of my
constituency we found ourselves in the extraordinary position of not
having a single advocate for a particular two-member division that had
been proposed. The proposal appeared from nowhere and was imposed by
the Electoral Commission on the communities of Church Stretton and
Craven Arms in my constituency. It is one of the relatively few
two-member wards in my constituency, and within the county. Those two
communities have very little in common. They are united by the A49,
which is the only Highways Agency trunk road that passes through the
constituency. They are seven miles apart.</div>
<a name="0906124000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The community
of Church Stretton nestles in the Switzerland of Shropshire. For those
of you who do not know that area, it is as it is described. It has some
magnificent hills, which are famous for providing the best views
between there and the Urals. Travelling eastwards, one cannot get as
good a view as one can from the top of the Long Mynd until one hits the
Urals. Yet just to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>its south, in Craven Arms, nestling on the edge of the area of
outstanding natural beauty, people do not benefit from quite such
spectacular views, beautiful and attractive as the place is, and there
is relatively little that unites the two separate towns. Each has its
own town infrastructure, yet they have been lumped together in a single
ward. That caused intense frustration at every level in the community,
including among those wishing to stand for election to the town
councils in the respective areas, as well as a couple of the
villages that were lumped in with them.</div>
<a name="0906124000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
going on at some length and you have been very indulgent in allowing me
do so, Mr. Illsley. However, that example lends emphasis and
support to the purpose of the new clause: that if areas are going
through the fundamental change of a reorganisation of structure, the
views of the people on the ground should carry rather more weight than
the views of the bureaucratic organisation many miles away, probably in
London, seeking to impose some sort of arithmetic calculation to the
considerable distress of the local people affected by it. So I
encourage the Minister to consider accepting the new clause when she
sums
up.</div><a name="0906124000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000618"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The Chairman has been a little bit indulgent
because he recalls doing his geography A-level field course in Church
Stretton. He rises simply to explain to the Committee that we are
debating new clause 4 with clause 57 because the new clause fits into
that part of the Bill. We will not take a vote on new clause 4 until we
take votes on the new clauses.</div>
<a name="0906124000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000619"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The Government broadly support the
principles behind the new clause. We agree that it is right that it
should be open to local authorities to initiate reviews of their
boundaries and, if they consider it appropriate, mergers with
neighbouring councils. However, we legislated for such a process in the
Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. Section 8
of the 2007 Act, as amended by the Bill to include reference to the new
Boundary Commission, enables any local authority to make a request to
the Boundary Commission to conduct a boundary review. Such a review can
consider altering local government boundaries, and abolishing or
creating local government areas. It therefore provides a mechanism for
principal councils to request a review to consider whether two or more
local authorities should be amalgamated. The 2007 Act also enables a
review to be instigated by a request from the Secretary of State, or on
the initiative of the boundary committee.</div>
<a name="0906124000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 57
provides that those functions of the boundary committee will be
transferred to the new Local Government Boundary Commission. The new
clause is unnecessary as there is already provision to enable councils
to make requests for such reviews. In addition, the 2007 Act sets out
statutory criteria which the Boundary Commission will have to have
regard to when considering any boundary change. These are the need to
secure effective and convenient local government, and the need to
reflect the identities and interests of local communities. Those are
important requirements when any boundary change is being
considered.</div>
<a name="0906124000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 9 of
the 2007 Act provides that, where the Boundary Commission is
undertaking a review of local government areas, it must consult the
councils of those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>areas under review and other local authorities, parish councils, or
other persons it believes to have an interest. Those could include, for
example, local authorities, MPs and police authorities. Section 10 of
the 2007 Act allows the Secretary of State to implement, by order,
recommendations made by the boundary committee with or without
modification. Such an order would be subject to the approval of both
Houses. We believe that the statutory process that currently exists
provides statutory criteria and a full review process and meets the
objectives that the hon. Member for Wycombe has sought to achieve
through this clause. I hope that, in the knowledge that the provision
already exists, he will withdraw the new clause when we reach that
stage.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000620"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I beg to move amendment 60, in
clause 66, page 49, line 13, leave
out &#145;must&#146; and insert
&#145;may&#146;.</div><a name="0906124000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
address amendment 60 I must say a word or two in introduction to part 4
of the Bill, since neither Minister has risen to her feet to do so. We
are now approaching the heart of the Bill. The clause on local
authority economic assessment will provide space for many of the
arguments that you have already heard, Mr. Illsley, I am
afraid, in relation to other parts of the Bill, in particular about the
first three sets of duties.</div>
<a name="0906124000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">What members
of the Committee see before them is a proposal that
a</div><a name="0906124000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;principal

&#147;must&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0906124000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prepare

any part of it...at any
time&#148;.</div><a name="0906124000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
provision was introduced presumably in case subsection (1) proves in
practice to be even more inflexible than the clause looks as a
whole.</div><a name="0906124000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us pause for a moment and look at the whole business of economic
assessment. Obviously, any reasonably sized local authority worth its
salt will have an eye to the economic conditions of its area. In our
area, Wycombe district council, which is one of the larger district
councils in England, has all sorts of data available to it about the
economic conditions in the area as a whole and in the Thames
valley&#151;the information is easily accessible&#151;and it makes
assessments of the information that is in front of it. However, the
first question that the clause and its first two subsections give rise
to is, as ever, why that has to be on the statute book. We have asked
the question so many times that I shall not repeat it at length.
However, I will ask a variant of it. Why is it that Ministers believe
that it is important to put an economic
assessment&#151;only&#151;on the statute book?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div><a name="0906124000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any local
council worth its salt, such as Wycombe district council, does not only
prepare economic statistics; it also prepares social, housing and
education statistics and assessments. If one burrows through my local
council&#146;s website, one can find child poverty statistics. As it
is a feature of this clause, I am curious to know why so much stress is
placed on economic assessments of the workings of the economy and the
issue of prosperity only. Far be it from any member of the Conservative
party to take a view that seems sceptical of business&#151;we are not
doing that at all&#151;but it is curious that the Government have not
thought fit to put a social, environmental or sustainability assessment
in the Bill, given that they have thought fit to include an economic
assessment.</div>
<a name="0906124000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
always questions about the balance between growth and the environment,
between standard of living and quality of life and how the two
interact. The Minister will be aware that Opposition parties have
received representations arguing that in this Bill the Government have
become over-focused on growth. When the Bill was drawn up, I do not
know whether anyone anticipated the promotion of Lord Mandelson to
First Secretary of State and his Department&#146;s subsequent
swallowing-up of whole other areas of Government, but there seems to be
a case for arguing that the Government have put their eggs very
strongly in the basket of economic, rather than other forms of
assessment. That is a
curiosity.</div><a name="0906124000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the background. If hon. Members cast their eye down the clause, they
will see multiple instances of the word &#147;must&#148;&#151;I
have highlighted the word five times in my copy, and the clause even
starts with a &#147;must&#148;&#151;hence amendment 60. It is an
amendment, Mr. Illsley, of a type with which you will be
familiar. A moment ago I said that we have no objection to a local
authority carrying out economic assessments&#151;how could we? If
this clause must be on the statute book, we would prefer to take
&#147;must&#148; out and insert the word
&#147;may&#148;.</div>
<a name="0906124000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I obviously
cannot speak to the amendment that was tabled by a Member who was going
to be on the Committee, but no longer is; perhaps the Whips got him and
bound him in a dark
cupboard.</div><a name="0906124000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000621"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> Or a
lift.</div><a name="0906124000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000622"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Indeed. Amendment 60, as ever, seeks to tone down
the element of compulsion in this clause by inserting
&#147;may&#148; instead of &#147;must&#148;. That would allow
local authorities the freedom to conduct economic local area
assessments if they so wish. Yet again, we cannot see why it is
necessary to include such a restrictive term in the statute
book.</div><a name="0906124000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000623"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> On local authority economic assessments, in
part 4 of the Bill, it is understandable that during difficult economic
times the priority of the Government and local authorities is to focus
on understanding the nature of the problem and how it may best be
resolved. I share some of the concerns raised by the hon. Member for
Wycombe, in particular the reason for framing this measure as a
requirement on all local authorities. Most local authorities already
have a sustainability strategy, and one would hope that some
information might inform that. I wonder to what extent this provision
will underline work that already takes place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div><a name="0906124000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key thing
about assessments is that they should inform future actions; councils
should not be allowed simply to tick a box stating that they have done
one. My concern is about the next stage in the process. If the
Government think that the economic assessment is important, surely the
next stage is just as important, but the Bill does not really contain
anything about
that.</div><a name="0906124000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also have some concerns&#151;the Conservatives&#146; amendments
highlight these&#151;about the idea that economic assessments must
stick rigidly to the boundaries of a local authority, even thought they
might bear no relation to the boundaries of economic experience. Some
principal authorities might find that their economic circumstances are
very similar to those of a neighbouring authority, but within local
authorities there might be very different circumstances. It might be
difficult to reflect that in a single assessment. For example, I
imagine that the economic assessment of the council of the Isles of
Scilly would be very similar to that of west Cornwall, but the clause
would make it impossible for the council to produce a joint economic
assessment with west Cornwall. It requires the whole of Cornwall to
conduct one assessment and the Isles of Scilly to conduct another.
There is a danger of both duplication and of missing out some of the
variations within a local authority, because the clause is so
prescriptive in focusing on an economic assessment across a single
local authority
area.</div><a name="0906124000281"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000624"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The hon. Lady is making a strong point. Does she
agree that the prescriptive nature of the clause does not take into
account the relationship that many local authorities have with urban
regeneration companies and other regeneration partnerships? A
prescriptive requirement on authorities to prepare such assessments
could result in duplication, if an assessment has already been
prepared, perhaps on an agency or collaborative basis with an urban
regeneration company, for instance.</div>
<a name="0906124000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000625"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> That is one example of the danger of
duplication. Of course, however, that information might also help to
inform a principal authority&#146;s assessment. The clause lacks
flexibility. The assumption is that the boundaries in place already
will be the same as those of economic experience. No doubt we will have
a similar discussion on part 5, dealing with regional strategy. Just as
there might not be one economic experience in a principal authority, it
will be difficult to conduct one economic assessment for a single
region with several different economies. I am pre-empting a discussion
that we will no doubt have on later clauses.</div>
<a name="0906124000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned
about the lack of flexibility, including in the consideration of what
will have an economic influence. My attention is drawn to our
experiences in Cornwall with objective 1 funding. The history books
show that the primary problem for Cornwall when we tried to qualify for
objective 1 funding was that the previous boundaries lumped Devon and
Cornwall together as an economic entity. That meant that, despite the
fact that one falls of an economic cliff when crossing the Tamar
bridge, the poverty in Cornwall was not recognised. As much as anything
else, addressing those issues necessitated the realisation that the
boundaries were inadequate. After that, consideration had to be given
to what those funds were put towards. Although the objective was an
improvement in Cornwall&#146;s economy, much of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>the resource has been invested in education, infrastructure and all
kinds of different things. A narrow interpretation of an economic
assessment might exclude many of those
considerations.</div>
<a name="0906124000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we have
three broad concerns. First, the interpretation of what might impact on
a local area&#146;s economy is too narrow. Secondly, nothing is said
about what actions the strategy should inform. Thirdly, there is not
enough flexibility to allow the assessment to reflect how the economy
is functioning. It is not right to assume that every local authority
will have its own economy&#151;that is clearly not going to be the
case. Some authorities might require more than one economic assessment;
others might be better off working jointly with neighbouring
authorities.</div><a name="0906124000453"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000626"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I want to follow the hon. Lady by referring to my
neck of the woods, as she has to hers. North Yorkshire has a wide range
of authorities&#151;a county council, a unitary council in the shape
of York itself, eight district councils and two national
parks&#151;and it spreads almost coast to coast, from Bridlington,
Whitby down to Hull. The concerns are clear. One crosses the plain of
York, hits the Pennine range and goes towards the little bit of England
that is left over, which is called Lancashire. We have Cumbria at the
top left hand corner. It is practically a continent in itself. From the
Pennines one can see a long way further than the Urals.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> One can almost see
Bradford.</div>
<a name="0906124000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is
intended that the assessment should be county-wide, how does one bring
it together? The area includes Bentham, which is in a sense dependent
on Lancashire&#151;it looks towards Lancaster and that part of
Lancashire&#151;and, insofar as people commute, they tend to go north
or north-west. It also embraces the major population centre of York, a
unitary council, and has a series of scattered districts. It has
coastal areas with particular economic needs, dependent on not very
high quality tourism. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I mean that
in terms of how much people spend there; there are many day-trippers.
The tourism in my constituency is not very high in that many people do
not spend much money. We do not take as much money off them as we would
like because they come as hikers and cyclists.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> If the Minister looked at the
speech I gave in the House a couple of weeks ago on the problems facing
my constituency due to the sheer incompetence of the Learning and
Skills Council and the threats to Craven college, she would understand
how important it is to diversify the economy. The present tourist base
needs to offer more and better, in order to attract a wider range of
tourists and, quite frankly, take more money off them. That is the
important point I am making.</div>
<a name="0906124000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, in such
a diverse area how does one draw up an economic plan or report with any
real meaning? It is so diverse in character. There are, of course,
similarities but there are some specific needs: agriculture,
small-scale tourism&#151;I should say, rather than poor
quality&#151;and small-scale manufacturing. With the exception of one
or two big outfits such as the Skipton Building Society, it has
relatively small-scale business. Secondly, how narrowly do we define
the term &#147;economic&#148;? Do we introduce elements of
sustainability? We are supposed to marry sustainability into all our
ways of looking at the economy nowadays. In that case, how do we deal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>with acute issues&#151;not in my constituency, I am delighted to say,
praise the Lord&#151;such as the proposal for a large incinerator? If
anybody wishes to see popular democracy in action, they have only to
propose that someone put an incinerator or houses anywhere near. Houses
and incinerators have a particular capacity to get the entire
population enraged, at least in England. In Denmark people seem to
think that both of them are good ideas&#151;one is used to heat the
other. In England, however, we seem to take an entirely different view.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> In case my hon. Friend the Member
for Wycombe had any doubts about the direction of the economic inputs,
it is the incinerator that is used to heat the
house.</div><a name="0906124000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
wide does that assessment go? Does it take in issues such as skills?
The real problem in North Yorkshire is not that the education quality
is not good; it ought to be good given the sociology of such an area.
The level of skills, however, is often not very high. One needs to be
able to enhance that, which is why issues such as the future of the
further education colleges are crucial in the regeneration programmes
of North
Yorkshire.</div><a name="0906124000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
the hon. Lady mentioned an important issue: the correct geometry of the
economic report. Regarding North Yorkshire, one could almost say that
there is a part of what used to be North Riding that in many ways still
looks north for its services. At Masham in my constituency for example,
the hospital is at Northallerton, and beyond that the specialist
hospitals tend to be those in Middlesbrough, on Teesside. The old West
Riding of Yorkshire, which includes Ripon, which is next door to
Masham, and Craven, tends to look down towards Leeds. In one of the
Government&#146;s projects, the city region&#151;which I
support&#151;the Leeds city region includes the district councils of
Craven, Harrogate and Selby. We have already seen projects run on a
city region basis, and the sensible unit for economic planning is those
metropolitan areas, and the travel-to-work areas that depend on them.
In many ways that is a more real economic unit than North Yorkshire.
One could equally&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The
Minister shrugs her shoulders and says that it is not, but I am a
supporter of a city region area, and it is. She will have her turn in a
minute. I would defer to her on the affairs of Doncaster and South
Yorkshire, which as far as I am concerned is almost on the M25, and I
ask her to defer to my knowledge of North Yorkshire on these matters.
In the north part of the county, there is a great deal of logic in a
unit that is based more towards Teesside, a large part of which used to
be regarded as part of
Yorkshire.</div><a name="0906124000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
do these things fit together? How do we ensure that in producing an
assessment on a county-wide basis we are not getting in the way of,
multiplying, or having too much overlap with, assessments that might
relate to more natural units? At the moment, the travel-to-work area is
one of the most classic economic units for assessment right across the
industrial world. I would not want to lump together artificially areas
that have a natural affinity but in a geographical and sociological
sense. In an economic sense, those areas do not look towards each other
but towards other parts. If one takes Craven in my constituency, which
is
essentially&#151;</div><a name="0906124000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000627"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is making an
interesting point about city regions. The Government&#146;s agenda
has been to focus all kinds of policy and activity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>on a city region and it would make sense if the clause reflected that.
However, what the clause could also do, if it were framed in that
broader way, would be to allow a more rural alternative to the city
regions to develop. At the moment, we have clear policy for city
regions and a complete absence of policy for everything outside
them.</div><a name="0906124000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000628"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> The real criticism is that the Government have
produced the idea of city regions but have not yet intellectually
thought it through effectively. Yorkshire Forward, our regional
development agency, will be responsible for a large area, and we will
have a new body dealing with learning and skills issues, neither of
which body is congruent with the city region, which is one of the two
trial areas. Manchester and Leeds are the two trial city region areas.
The Government need to be more consistent in thinking it through. If
they intend to construct city regions and other bodies, perhaps they
need to deconstruct, or we will have too many competing authorities and
jurisdictions.</div><a name="0906124000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may simply be that, inevitably, all wording in the Bill is a sort of
shorthand and that the Minister will be able to explain it, but at the
moment, I am concerned that we are doing something that appears on the
surface to be eminently sensible but that is not as obviously practical
when one looks a bit below the surface. I would like her reassurance on
that
matter.</div><a name="0906124000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000629"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I rise briefly because the right hon. Member
for Skipton and Ripon has made some interesting points, and I want to
give the obverse perspective from London. Before I do so, though, I say
to him that I will not be goaded by his reference, which he made
knowing full well that I spent four happy days as a tourist in his area
between Christmas and the new year, and I do not consider myself
low-value tourism, but I will let it
pass.</div><a name="0906124000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">London,
the principal authority defined in the legislation, is a London borough
council. London has a Greater London authority, which has economic
development powers created by the Greater London Authority Acts. Those
powers are vested in the Mayor and the GLA. It is not clear from the
legislation how far the London boroughs, in framing the individual
economic assessment for their area, should take account of the wider
perspective set by the London economic development strategy produced by
the Mayor and the London Development Agency.</div>
<a name="0906124000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, that
is a different position from that of authorities in other parts of the
country who have no regional authorities to relate to, so there is a
specific issue with London. I am not clear how the legislation is
expected to work and how the potential for conflict will be avoided
between the city-wide authority, which has economic development
responsibilities, and the strategy developed by the individual London
borough. I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend the Minister
would respond.</div>
<a name="0906124000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000630"></a>The
Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination (Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> This is one of the most important parts of the
Bill. At the moment, particularly in the current economic downturn, all
public authorities&#151;particularly local government, which I know
as regional Minister for Yorkshire and the Humber&#151;are thinking
clearly about their effect as authorities that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>spend a lot of money in an area, have a key role in employing up to
thousands of people and whose policies can make a difference to local
businesses. Placing a duty on them to make an economic assessment is
vital for not only the present, but the future in terms of thinking
about how they consider the particular circumstances of their area.
What can they do as local authorities to support local businesses? What
can they do to support local people in acquiring skills, getting
training and attracting inward investment? At the moment, they
occasionally play a vital role in supporting businesses and individuals
who might be in particular difficulty. What we are doing in the Bill is
an absolute fit with much of the current economic thinking on the role
of national, regional and local government.</div>
<a name="0906124000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will deal
first with the points made by the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne. I am quite shocked. She is, again, simply going along with
Conservative Front-Bench assertions, which boil down to
&#147;Let&#146;s not do anything. Let&#146;s just allow the
recession to take its course.&#148; They do not believe that there is
any role for intervention in the economy. That is why they have opposed
what we have done at national and regional levels. Frankly, I am
surprised that she is falling for that trick. That exposes the paucity
of Liberal Democrat thought when it comes to implementing real policies
that will help local people, including in her
region.</div><a name="0906124000454"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="0906124000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition&#146;s policy is to oppose and abolish regional
development agencies. The economics suggest that about 5 million people
are needed in an area for an effective regional strategy to be
implemented. My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
took the Bill that established regional development agencies through
the legislative process. That legislation was built on a clear body of
evidence on what was needed to stimulate the economy at regional level,
and I think that regional development agencies have been extremely
effective.</div><a name="0906124000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000631"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I assure the Minister that my views are based
on facts and the experiences related to me by my constituents on the
ground, rather than on the legislation before us, which is sometimes
used by the Government as a proxy for action. She is about to defend
regional development agencies as the drivers of economic change. I will
give an example of the reason why I have defended the ability of
councils to decide for themselves what is best. This week, the South
West of England Regional Development Agency decided to cut back on
&#163;50 million-worth of projects, a large proportion of which would
have had an impact in my constituency. There is no accountability for
that. Regional development agencies are failing to do even what the
Government say they are
doing.</div><a name="0906124000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister should be careful in what she says because everybody in this
room is advocating the changes that they think will have the biggest
impact on the ground. We all have a duty to consider all the evidence,
not just what is put forward selectively in the
Bill.</div><a name="0906124000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000632"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Actually, the hon. Lady is quite wrong. The
evidence shows that for every pound invested by regional development
agencies, the growth back is about &#163;4.50. If she looks at how
many jobs have been created, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>she will see that regional development agencies have played a real role.
It is a bit rich for her to say that RDAs are unaccountable when she
will not participate in the Select Committees that scrutinise their
work.</div><a name="0906124000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000633"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="0906124000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000634"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are not going to have another debate
on Regional Select Committees. We must come back to the
amendment.</div><a name="0906124000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000635"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Thank you, Mr. Illsley. The right
hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon raised an interesting point about
what view the North Yorkshire councils would take of the kind of duty
we are discussing. As the Minister for Yorkshire and the Humber, I have
had a number of meetings with the leaders of those councils. I think
that they would be pretty horrified by the idea that tourism in their
area is of a poor quality. I think that those involved in
&#147;Welcome to Yorkshire&#148; would be quite upset to hear that
tourism in Yorkshire is considered to be substandard, or whatever the
words
were.</div><a name="0906124000306"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000636"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I do not want to again get into a 30 years war, as
the French would call it. Yorkshire must ensure that its tourism is
more diverse and has a greater range. The problem is that a large
volume of the people who come stay in bed and breakfasts and the take
is relatively small. That is why we need much better winter facilities
and a wider offer: we want to take more money off the individual
tourist. That is what I am talking about. If the Minister looks at the
regeneration strategy based on Skipton, she will find that I am
practically quoting it.</div>
<a name="0906124000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000637"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The right hon. Gentleman would, I hope,
acknowledge that the &#163;30 million invested by Yorkshire Forward
in &#147;Welcome to Yorkshire&#148; is having a huge effect on
tourism. It is a good example of how such regional intervention can
help to stimulate one of the key industries in our area at a very
difficult
time.</div><a name="0906124000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tourism
is worth something like &#163;6 billion to the Yorkshire and Humber
region and employs about 250,000 people. We are trying to stimulate it
through regional action. However, council leaders in North Yorkshire
have been anxious to ensure that when there is an economic focus,
through, for example, the city regions, they can put together an
economic case for their area as well. Areas such as Scarborough and
Bridlington have been what we call &#147;renaissance towns&#148; in
terms of investment from Yorkshire Forward to ensure that we are
getting high-quality tourism. The worry for councils is that it is
important that they have their &#147;economic stamp&#148; on the
plans, as well as the economic plans put forward through the city
region
pilots.</div><a name="0906124000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been a lot of support from councils of all political hues in the
fight for Leeds city region to become one of the pilots. That has been
welcomed. Taking an overview of Yorkshire and the Humber, it is exactly
the type of action that councils are supporting. They want to play a
role in economic development, but feel that consistency is
needed.</div>
<a name="0906124000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
with the Conservative amendment is that it actually says. &#147;You
can do it if you want to.&#148; The whole point of getting councils
together and emphasising 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>economic development is to ensure that they make the assessment needed
to get consistency that can be fed into the overall strategy on the
regional approach to stimulating the economy. That fit needs to be put
together to ensure that councils, which can have a huge effect on their
local economies, think clearly about what they need to do to support
local businesses, support people to get jobs and help new company
start-ups. I am surprised that the Opposition feel that it is better to
sit back and think, &#147;Fingers crossed, let&#146;s hope
something
happens.&#148;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000640"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> It is a shame that the Minister is having
recourse to a tub-thumping political attack. Her argument is predicated
on preparing an assessment being the same as taking action, but we have
seen over the past six months that they are not the same. In fact, she
is cogently making the same argument as my hon. Friend the Member for
Wycombe. She is giving many examples of the diversity and plurality of
local authorities&#146; actions to benefit their local areas
economically, socially and demographically. The clause is not needed if
those things are already
happening.</div><a name="0906124000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000641"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The hon. Gentleman is missing the point about
what local authorities are saying. They want notice to be taken of
their local economic assessment. The provision is a way to build it
into the everyday business of local authorities. That is hugely
important to local people.</div>
<a name="0906124000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman talked about being over-focused on growth, but I do not think
that we should deride a focus on growth. It is incredibly important
that we focus on how we can stimulate the local authorities and others
to help people through these difficult times, but beyond that we should
think about the future, when the economic downturn is over. What will
local areas look like, what skills will they need, which industries
will they want to attract into their area and which will they need to
help? Those questions are encompassed by introducing the duty for local
authorities. I am certain that if Opposition Members talked a little
more to their local councillors, they would get the same message, which
is about the role that they feel they can play now to help local
people.</div><a name="0906124000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000642"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I can see that, both at local level and from
central Government&#146;s perspective, it is necessary to see how all
the different economic experiences fit together to inform Government
policy, but does the Minister not understand that if central Government
dictate the shape and size of those jigsaw pieces, it undermines their
ability to understand what is going on the ground? We need a bottom-up
process to give central Government the best understanding of what is
going on, rather than a top-down
one.</div><a name="0906124000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000643"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> That is exactly why we give local authorities
the ability to join together through local area agreements if they
wish. Some local authorities may say that in some instances it is right
to widen the area covered, but in others, because of the employing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>power, the businesses in a particular local authority, colleges, schools
and so on, there will be a very clear fit within the boundaries of the
local authority. However, if there is desire to join
together&#151;for example, through local area agreements&#151;we
have said that it is for local authorities to come forward. There is
flexibility within that, but within the Bill there is obviously a clear
duty on the principal local authorities to do
that.</div><a name="0906124000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the counties and the relationship between the counties and the
districts, when drawing up any economic assessment the counties will
have to consult with the districts. If the districts wish to draw up
their own economic assessments, they can do so, but again that gives
the flexibility to achieve what feels right within individual areas.
That is an important caveat that perhaps has not been entirely clear.
That perhaps addresses some of the points made by the right hon.
Gentleman. Many districts within that North Yorkshire area will want to
make their needs clear, especially some of those coastal areas and
seaside towns.</div>
<a name="0906124000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000644"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I am sure the right hon. Lady understands that
nobody is suggesting that local authorities are not enthusiastic about
trying to address the economic needs of their areas&#151;of course
they need to recognise the different needs. One thing she said is very
important: the measure is not intended to be too prescriptive. My
concern is not that I do not want people to take action; I simply do
not want them to find themselves in a framework in which arrows are
pointing in different directions. Given the importance of a
sub-regional strategy, if we are now going to produce an over-layer of
a county strategy, which is not inconsistent with the provision, I do
not want there to be a huge problem in marrying both strategies
together. In that sense, I am reassured. I discuss all this with my
county councillors all the time, of course, and I will certainly

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000645"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> As have I. I have found quite a lot of support
for the idea of involving local authorities in stimulating their
economies. On the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich on the GLA strategy, I assure him that the
guidance will stress the need for boroughs to take account of mayoral
strategies and vice
versa.</div><a name="0906124000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that the duty is enshrined in local authority duties. The
duty is vital, now and for the future, to support local people and
businesses, and it has the right amount of flexibility to ensure that,
if local authorities want to join together over a wider area, they are
entirely free to do so, if that is what is felt to work best locally. I
hope that my arguments have absolutely persuaded the Opposition to
withdraw their amendment and that they recognise the importance of the
action that we are
taking.</div><a name="0906124000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000646"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> The Committee has had a wide-ranging debate in
which we have considered whether the assessment of economic conditions
is too narrow and whether such assessments should be more widely drawn.
We did not say that it is not important to do that at a time of
recession any more than the Minister said that it is not important to
assess sustainability. The Committee has also considered whether the
economic areas referred to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>in the clause are too narrowly drawn. We have been given two small tours
by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and by the
right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, who raised the point,
which my right hon. Friend summed up very well, about arrows pointing
in different directions, and how the duty will interact with other
local authority duties or assessments that are carried out in other
forms.</div>
<a name="0906124000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s response seemed to show very little confidence in the
Bill&#146;s content. I have not served opposite her for long and I do
not know her modus operandi well, but she clearly feels much happier in
her comfort zone attacking the Opposition for apparently doing nothing
while the Government do everything, which is reflected in their
successful results in the current polls. I could reply in a similar
vein. We could have a little bit of party political knockabout and
consider whether it is the Opposition or the Government who are doing
better out of their respective political approaches at
present.</div><a name="0906124000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would be an interesting debate, but it is more relevant to state that,
owing to her splendid piece of knockabout and her wielding of an
enormous cudgel in the direction of Falmouth and Camborne, I am not
actually sure whether the Minister has properly read the amendment or
the clause. She has painted a picture of the clause as a vital part of
a strategy that, to quote her, &#147;feeds into&#148; regional
strategies, so that the direction of movement is clearly upwards. We
understand her approach, but the clause does not state that at all. As
someone pointed out during the debate&#151;I think it was the hon.
Member for Falmouth and Camborne&#151;it only states that they
&#147;must prepare an assessment.&#148; It does not say that they
have to do anything with it, nor does it say that it must be fed up
into the great regional strategy, of which the Minister is so proud. I
am not sure that she has read her own legislation&#151;she is just
much happier doing the traditional Labour thing of seeing how well it
will serve them at the
polls.</div><a name="0906124000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
we on this side of the Committee do not propose to do nothing. All we
are doing is proposing to delete the prescriptive word
&#147;must&#148;&#151;it leads nowhere, because all it does is
compel the local authority to create a strategy without putting
anything else on the face of the Bill&#151;and insert the word
&#147;may&#148;, which will allow local authorities the freedom and
the flexibility to carry out the assessments for themselves. That is
the clear divide in the Committee, and we intend to press our amendment
to a
vote.</div><a name="0906124000326"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000660"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I beg to move amendment 61, in
clause 66, page 49, line 19, leave
out &#145;, other than a non-unitary district
council&#146;.</div>
<a name="0906124000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000661"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: amendment 62, in clause 66, page 49, line 27,
leave out from &#145;council&#146; to end of line 28 and
insert</div> <a name="09061235000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;it shall act in

63, in
clause 66, page 49, line 35, leave

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000662"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> In effect, we have just considered the first part
of the clause. We ought, for a moment, to consider further aspects of
the economic assessment, which will stand alone as a result of the
clause. If members of the Committee turn their eyes to
subsection (6), they will see, to their surprise,
that</div><a name="0906124000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
principal local authority must have regard to any guidance given by the
Secretary of
State&#151;</div><a name="0906124000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
as to what an assessment under this section should contain and how it
should be
prepared;&#148;.</div><a name="0906124000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a considerable role for the Secretary of State here, as other
paragraphs of the subsection make clear. If Members turn the page, they
will see that before giving the
guidance</div><a name="0906124000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Secretary of State must
consult&#151;</div><a name="0906124000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
such representatives of local government as the Secretary of State
considers
appropriate&#148;.</div><a name="0906124000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is an entirely circular process invented in the latter part of the
clause, which is why we sensibly propose to leave it out. The first
amendment seeks to explore that, and no doubt the Minister will tell us
why non-unitary district councils should be excluded&#151;she may
well have a persuasive argument to put
forward.</div><a name="0906124000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
62 seeks to stress partnership. We have been here many times before. We
have heard the approach from the Government side and from those on the
Opposition Benches. As I have said, we have this economic assessment,
which stands alone, and there are no further means on the statute book
of putting the measure into effect, which seems odd&#151;although not
as odd as putting it on the statute book without those means in the
first place. We look forward to hearing what other members of the
Committee have to
say.</div><a name="0906124000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000663"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> We have already outlined many of the ways in
which this section will work and the need for county councils to
consult district councils in drawing up an economic assessment. As we
have said, there is nothing to stop district councils doing their own
assessment, if they wish to. However, I find it a bit odd that, to a
certain extent, the Opposition are saying, &#147;You&#146;re making
everybody do this assessment,&#148; but then say, &#147;Well,
actually we want more people to do the assessment than is currently
required under the
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="0906124000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000664"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> We are not saying that at all. We are simply
trying to establish the Minister&#146;s rationale for forcing the
other councils to do things she does not seem to want to force district
councils to do.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000665"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> We have already talked about the need for an
economic assessment to take place. I addressed that when replying to
the remarks of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon about what
happens in an area such as North Yorkshire where, to a certain extent,
in terms of the economic assessment, there is an anxiety that if all
the economic focus is around the Leeds city region, some of the more
rural areas in that part of North Yorkshire will not have the same
amount of attention focused on them. That is exactly why there is a
duty at county council level to do so, which I believe is welcomed by
those authorities. However, there is also the ability to consult, first
of all, the district councils. If the district councils wish to make
their own economic assessment, there is absolutely no problem with
their doing so. I am finding it curious that, on the one hand, the
Opposition say that they do not think that the duty should exist, but
on the other hand, they want to put the duty on more councils. That is
why I am a little
puzzled.</div><a name="0906124000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also discussing amendment 63. I am not sure whether the hon. Member
for Wycombe addressed amendment 63 in his opening
remarks.</div><a name="0906124000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000666"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> When the Minister reads <i class="I">Hansard </i>tomorrow,
she will find that, in fact, the first part of my remarks was on
subsections (6) and
(7).</div><a name="0906124000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000667"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I understand that amendment 63 takes away the
requirement for local authorities to have regard to guidance issued by
the Secretary of State. Again, the issue here is that on the one hand,
the Opposition want us to be more specific about exactly what the
economic assessment will need to take into account, but on the other
hand, they seem to want local authorities not to take any notice of
that. I cannot quite marry those two positions
up.</div><a name="0906124000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
wish to consult local authority bodies and others about the detail of
the economic assessment and provide helpful guidance on how to draw it
up. However, it is important that there is a certain level of
consistency about that, so we wish to issue guidance and oppose the
Opposition
amendment.</div><a name="0906124000456"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="0906124000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000668"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Tomorrow, every member of the Committee will
peruse the <i class="I">Hansard </i>report of the debate&#151;we know that no
member can get enough of the proceedings&#151;and see that the
Minister clearly was not listening to my remarks when I moved the
amendment, because I opened by referring to subsections (6) and
(7).</div>
<a name="0906124000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">On her point
about guidance, it is perfectly true that we wish to give local
authorities the freedom not to follow the guidance, but as I said in my
introductory remarks, we would also remove from the Secretary of State
the requirement to consult representatives of local government before
the guidance is issued, thus saving everyone the circular process the
Minister has invented and put in the Bill. She seems to have given us
no reason not to press the
amendment.</div><a name="0906124000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
heard what the Minister said in relation to amendment 61,
which we tabled in a probing spirit. Were it possible for us to
withdraw that amendment, but put the other two to the vote, which is at
your discretion, Mr. Illsley, that is ideally what we would
do.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div><a name="0906124000360"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000669"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> Can I be clear about what the Minister said? She
said that there would be guidance, but if that guidance is to embrace
all the circumstances that prevail across England with regard to
economic needs, it seems to me that that has to be either prescriptive,
in which case it should not be done, or so flexible as to embrace every
single circumstance, in which case I cannot see the point of having the
guidance at all. Surely the sensible thing to do is let the units
producing the guidance determine their priorities. I am sure that she
will find that the danger of having some form of framework is that
people will feel obliged to tick boxes that might not be relevant in
their circumstances, which is
bothersome.</div><a name="0906124000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000670"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I do not accept that. It is important that we
can, for example, refer to the need to ensure that a local
community&#146;s skills are adequate for getting jobs in local
businesses or to look at the requirements with which local businesses
themselves come forward. There are some good examples of the work done
through skills boards in assessing local economic needs, ensuring local
education is geared towards meeting those needs and, looking to the
future, determining whether businesses are saying that they feel
investment or skills training is needed and how that fits into an
overall strategy. That must be done through consultation with
organisations by local authorities. It does not have to be overly
prescriptive, but it needs to set out some general areas that local
authorities might wish to take into account when drawing up an economic
assessment. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman knows the type of
areas that are likely to be covered, but it is important that we work
with local authority organisations to get their views on what will be
most helpful in guidance and on what the parameters from central
Government and regional government should be, which would also be
helpful.</div><a name="0906124000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000671"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I simply remark that it seems inconceivable that
any quarter-witted council would produce an economic strategy that did
not take into consideration the skills needs of local
business.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000700"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I beg to move amendment 64, in
clause 66, page 50, line 8, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) When
conducting an assessment under this Part, a principal local authority
must consider the impact on the social, environmental and economic
well-being of the authority&#146;s area, including where applicable
(but not limited to) the effect on ports, caused by non-domestic rating
revaluations.&#146;.</div><a name="0906124000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
takes us back to the start of the debate, so I will be brief. One of
the questions that we considered at the start was whether the
assessment should go wider than the economy and take into account other
factors, which is what this amendment
states.</div><a name="0906124000404"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000701"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I am sympathetic with what the amendment
tries to achieve, but I do not know whether it is necessary, given what
the clause already sets out. Clearly, port authorities are a very
important aspect of the local economy. However, given what the right
hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon has said about any council with half
a brain doing certain things, I think that any council that is taking
any process such as this seriously, regardless of whether or not it is
required to do so, would consider the impact on its port
authority,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>if it had one within its area. I am not entirely sure whether the
amendment is necessary or whether the hon. Gentleman will want to press
it.</div><a name="0906124000405"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000702"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I will match the commendable brevity of the
hon. Member for Wycombe by saying that the amendment is not
appropriate. Such matters, which should be addressed in local economic
assessments, should not be placed in the Bill, because it would
unnecessarily constrain local authorities and make it more difficult to
us to respond to changing economic priorities in the future. With that,
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0906124000703"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I have been so brief, the Minister has been so
brief and everyone has been so brief that I do not think that we can
press this matter to a vote. However, this is a matter to which we may
return at a later
stage.</div><a name="0906124000407"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
