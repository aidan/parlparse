<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000359"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good morning. I am sorry that we could not
secure a larger Committee Room, but we will have to make do with this
one. I remind Members that adequate notice should be given of
amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred
amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon

wish to do so.</div>

Mr. Conway. I welcome you to the Chair, and I welcome the
Clerk and other Officers of the House to the Committee as we debate
this important Bill and the motion before us. Mr. Conway, I
am sure that you will add your normal skill and customary guidance to
our deliberations. The room is cavernous, but as we know, size is no
indication of quality, and I am sure that you will keep us in order
during our sittings.</div>
<a name="07011885000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have been a number of
discussions through the usual channels on the programme motion. The
discussions have been full and comprehensive, and I understand that all
parts of the House have satisfactorily resolved that we have adequate
time to discuss the important clauses, if hon. Members so wish, and any
relevant amendments.</div>
<a name="07011885000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fair to say that, as a
matter of principle, the Bill is not controversial. It has support from
all parts of the House, and I am sure that hon. Members will wish only
to improve the content of the legislation before the Committee and the
House.</div>
<a name="07011885000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07011885000361"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Vaizey</b> (Wantage) (Con): I, too, welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Conway. As this is the first Public Bill
Committee that I have attended in my capacity as a Front-Bench
spokesman, you can imagine that I am incredibly nervous. It is
therefore reassuring to have a Chairman of your standing and experience
in the Chair. I hope that you will indulge me, as I am almost certain
to make a series of terrible faux pas and mistakes, and that you will
use your experience to guide me through the maze of
proceedings.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 4</div><a name="07011885000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
is correct: the Opposition believe that there is adequate time to
debate the Bill. However, I note, and my inexperience will now show
through, that on Thursday when the Committee is due to sit at
1 o&#146;clock, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport
will be making an important announcement on the licence
fee.</div>
<a name="07011885000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000362"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> Mr. Conway, it may be helpful for you
as Chairman to know that through the usual channels, there has been
discussion about that point. We are more than prepared and very happy
to sit until at least 10 o&#146;clock this evening if that would help
the Committee to avoid the problem that the hon. Gentleman has posed. I
thank my colleagues and hon. Friends in advance for
that.</div>
<a name="07011885000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000363"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> It would certainly help the Committee, but it
would be a blow to the new constituency of Hammersmith, because it is
expecting me to launch the new Hammersmith Conservative Association,
whose parliamentary candidate will take control of that seat, and whose
local authority has already reduced its council tax by 3 per cent.
after taking over from a hideous left-wing regime that taxed its
residents through the nose. But I digress. I should not want the House
to be deprived of the talents of the hon. Member for Bath or of the
Minister when the TV licence fee is
debated.</div><a name="07011885000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister said, the Bill is important but small. It is technical, but no
doubt it will give members of the Committee an opportunity to raise
some important issues. It is a great pleasure to see present so many
Members who contributed in such a distinguished fashion on Second
Reading. I exclude myself from that praise. Although the Bill is small,
it represents the biggest civil project in Britain&#146;s recent
history, as the Secretary of State herself has said. We will want to
probe the Minister on many of the details of how the scheme will
operate. Some issues will be raised through the amendments and others
will emerge as we debate the Bill clause by clause. I echo the
Minister&#146;s sentiment that there is consensus in the Committee
that the Bill is necessary, and we wish it a speedy
passage.</div>
<a name="07011885000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07011885000364"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Don Foster</b> (Bath) (LD): I, too, welcome you to the Chair,
Mr. Conway.</div>
<a name="07011885000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
looking forward to relatively brief deliberations on this important
Bill. The Minister says that it is not controversial, and in one sense
he is absolutely right. We saw on Second Reading that there is a great
deal of support on both sides of the House for digital switchover.
There is also recognition that, because the more vulnerable in society
will need assistance, data should be made available so that we can go
ahead with a package of help for such people. In that respect, the Bill
is not controversial.</div>
<a name="07011885000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, a
number of issues need to be raised, so it is important that the
programme motion should allow the necessary time for the debate to take
place. The Bill is about making available data for a targeted help
scheme, yet its scope is so limited that we will not have the
opportunity to discuss who is going to be helped by the scheme. We see
in the answers to a range of parliamentary questions that the number of
people who are to be helped appears to grow almost daily. At the
beginning of January last year, the Minister told us that 5 million 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div>people were going to be helped, and by the end of the year the figure
had risen to 7.1 million. Although we do not know who these people are
going to be, we are meant to be discussing access to data that will
enable us to assist them.</div>
<a name="07011885000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not told how the help is
going to be provided or by whom, how much it is going to cost or who
will pay. Perhaps that will be the subject of Government amendments
following the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement on Thursday
about the licence fee. Sadly, then, there are many matters with regard
to the targeted help scheme that we cannot discuss. That will make some
of our deliberations somewhat difficult.</div>
<a name="07011885000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the
limitations of the Bill, we have the opportunity to discuss some issues
that need to be sorted out&#151;for example, whether data will be
needed not just from the bodies that are listed in the Bill but from
others, such as local authorities, that provide information that
relates to people who will, we are led to believe, be helped by the
targeted assistance scheme. We will also be able to debate whether we
need to be clearer about the way in which information is provided, not
least to blind and partially sighted people; whether it is right for
the Bill to create an offence in respect of disclosure of information,
under which a person is deemed guilty unless he or she can prove
innocence&#151;a complete reversal of the normal procedure of
innocent until proved guilty; whether there should be a time limit on
the sharing of data, which will be particularly significant in the
current climate of debate about the Government&#146;s proposals for a
much wider data-sharing scheme; and whether more should be said in the
Bill about the targeted help scheme&#146;s being platform
neutral.</div>
<a name="07011885000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000365"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> It might be helpful to remind the Committee that
the Bill is not about the help scheme; it is about access to
information, about social security information and about the careful
handling of that information. I am sure, Mr. Conway, that
you will keep us in order in the course of our debates, but it is
useful to remember that the Bill is about access to the information
that will enable us to ensure that the scheme is
effective.</div>
<a name="07011885000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000366"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> I accept entirely that that is the scope
of the Bill, Mr. Conway, but my point was that that
is somewhat difficult for us. The Committee will be aware that what the
Bill says about the scheme is in clause 5(1) which says that
a</div><a name="07011885000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;switchover
help scheme&#146; means any scheme for the provision of help to
individuals in connection with digital switchover which is agreed
between the BBC and the Secretary of
State&#148;.</div><a name="07011885000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is all we
are told about the scheme in the Bill, yet we are being asked to debate
the provision of data on people who will be assisted by the targeted
help scheme when we do not have in the Bill any details of who those
people will be. That is why I hoped for a wider debate on the details
of the scheme. However, I accept that we cannot have that debate, that
the Minister is right, and that the Bill is limited in scope and will
be difficult to debate for the reasons I have given. The programme
motion gives us the opportunity to have a limited debate on that
limited range of issues, but, sadly, they are the only ones that can be
debated because of the limited scope of the
Bill.</div><a name="07011885000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000367"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I put the next motion, and for the
guidance of the Committee, when it suspends tonight is in my gift as
Chairman, but when it adjourns is in the gift of the Government Whip.
If we are still sitting at around 8 o&#146;clock, it will probably be
wise for us to suspend for dinner because we must bear in mind those
who serve the Committee and not just those who wish to take part in
it.</div><a name="07011885000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000368"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000369"></a>Mr.

Local authorities may, at the request of a relevant person, supply a
relevant person with information on persons registered as blind or
partially-sighted in their area for use (by the person to whom it is
supplied or by another relevant person) in connection with switchover
help functions.&#146;.</div><a name="07011885000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment stands in my name and those of my hon. Friend the Member for
Chesterfield and the excellent hon. Member for Wantage, whose first
appearance in his new post we look forward to with relish. I look
forward to a passionate speech from him in support of the
amendment.</div><a name="07011885000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said in
my opening comments about the programme motion that we had difficulty
in discussing various aspects of the Bill because we were not in a
position to discuss the detailed arrangements for the targeted help
scheme and, in particular, who is to be helped by the scheme. However,
the purpose of the amendment is to make provision for those who are not
registered on the Department for Work and Pensions database but who
might be eligible for assistance to be identified so that that help can
be given to them. It relates specifically to providing information in
respect of some blind or partially sighted people who will not be
covered by DWP data, which cover over-75s in receipt of disability
benefits. Those people will be covered by the data collection to which
clause 1 refers. My argument is that some people may not be covered and
we need an alternative source of information.</div>
<a name="07011885000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 5(1) states clearly that
the switchover help scheme simply provides help for individuals as
agreed between the BBC and the Secretary of State. Bizarrely, that
agreement will not come before the House for approval. It says nothing
about who those individuals will
be.</div><a name="07011885000332"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="07011885000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">To find out, we
have to look at the Department of Trade and Industry website or at
paragraph 7 of the explanatory memorandum for the Bill, both of which
make it clear that the targeted assistance scheme will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 7</div>help households in which one person is registered as blind or partially
sighted. We know, therefore, not from the Bill but from ancillary
documents that blind and partially sighted people will be helped by the
scheme. I am sure that the Committee will recognise that it is
important to have access to data about all the people in those
categories.</div> <a name="07011885000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was not
able to attend the Second Reading debate, because I was winging my way
to Australia to see how well England&#146;s cricket team would
do&#151;we all know the outcome of that&#151;but I have read the
report of it with interest. In it, my hon. Friend the Member for
Chesterfield, said that</div>
<a name="07011885000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;30 per cent. of blind and
partially sighted people who could benefit from the scheme will not be
identified by the Department for Work and Pensions
database,&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 18 December
2006; Vol. 454, c. 1194.]</div> <a name="07011885000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
he was correct. The Government do not keep a register of people who are
registered blind or partially sighted but who are not in receipt of
Government benefits; that information is held by local authorities. The
amendment is about enabling us to access the local authority data on
that group of people. Local authorities keep those data because, in
many cases, they seek to give blind and partially sighted people access
to civic facilities and additional assistance by way of bus passes,
blue badges and various forms of social service. Therefore, we know
that local authorities have the additional data that would be valuable
to us.</div> <a name="07011885000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could deal
with that situation in two ways. The first is to say to local
authorities, &#147;This is the scheme that we have in mind. Please
use your good offices to identify those people and notify them that
assistance is available to them, so that they can contact a central
body to access it.&#148; The second, which I believe is consistent
with the approach adopted in respect of other databases, is to enable
the body that has been charged with the delivery of the scheme to
access those local authority data
centrally.</div><a name="07011885000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is relatively simple, but its effects will be far reaching
for a large number of blind and partially sighted people who will
otherwise find that they are not being identified for the targeted help
scheme and could lose out.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000370"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> It is clear from the eloquence and passion
deployed by the hon. Member for Bath that he used his 48 hours on the
planes to and from Australia to incredible effect. We are grateful to
the English cricket team for having ended at least one, perhaps two,
test matches early to enable him to prepare such a passionate
analysis.</div> <a name="07011885000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
two fundamental points in the amendment. The first relates to the
stakeholders and partners on whom the company that will be established
to proceed with targeted help will be able to call for information. The
second relates to the criteria governing those who will receive help
under the switchover scheme.</div>
<a name="07011885000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was lucky enough to bump into
the Minister last night and to discuss the clause with him. As he will
no doubt make clear in his remarks, he recognises the importance of
working with local authorities when the Bill becomes law and when
digital switchover scheme is under way. As the hon. Member for Bath
pointed out, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div>the clause pertains particularly to those who are registered as
partially sighted or blind. Paragraph 5.22 of the digital switchover
help scheme documents, which are published by the Department on the
digital switchover website, says:</div>
<a name="07011885000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Each local authority
keeps a register of blind and partially sighted people living in their
area, but this information is not held centrally. We are exploring the
best way of how to contact blind and partially sighted about the help
scheme and dealing with the overlap with age/benefit qualifications
(around 70 per cent. of blind/partially sighted claimants will qualify
on age/benefit
grounds).&#148;</div><a name="07011885000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is quite
clear that the vast majority of blind or partially sighted people will
fall into the relevant category for the targeted switchover scheme, and
that the DWP does not hold that information. It is also clear that the
Bill makes no provision to allow local authorities to hand over the
information to the company that is responsible for digital switchover,
and must be amended. It is therefore extremely important that we
discuss the amendment and that the Minister explains in detail how he
expects local authorities to participate in the scheme, given the
technical, legal lacunae that prevent them from giving the information
to the relevant company.</div>
<a name="07011885000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bath made it clear that there is a need to debate who will
be targeted by the targeted switchover scheme. The Government have
issued a draft order, similar to regulations that were passed
under the Television Licences (Disclosure of
Information) Act 2000, in which the information that will be
made available by the DWP is set out. It includes the name, date of
birth, address and national insurance number of subjects, whether the
subject lives in a care home and whether the subject is dead. There is
other peripheral information, but nothing specific on who will be
targeted and which benefits they receive.</div>
<a name="07011885000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Disability Rights
Commission made a useful point in the briefing that I received for the
Second Reading debate. It pointed out that the DWP is planning to
target only those who have been registered as blind or partially
sighted, but the process of certification begins before registration.
Those who are certified as blind or partially sighted may also require
a great deal of help. The DRC also made the point that there are 74,000
visually impaired people in the UK who are neither certified nor
registered as such.</div>
<a name="07011885000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role of local authorities
extends beyond those who are blind or partially sighted. As several
hon. Members mentioned on Second Reading, local authorities are the
organisations closest to those who will need help. It would be utterly
sensible for the company that is responsible for targeting digital
switchover to have a dialogue with the social services under council
control, to discuss the sort of information that it may need, such as a
list of all the care homes in a local authority
area.</div><a name="07011885000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a tangential
point, perhaps when the Minister replies to the debate, he will talk
about the role that charities will play. No amendment has been tabled
on the need for charities to give information to the company that is
targeting help. From the information that the Government have released,
we know that the large charities are keen to help and will act as
digital ambassadors to their clients.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000371"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> The hon. Member for Bath was right to anticipate
the first appearance of the hon. Member for Wantage in his capacity as
Opposition spokesman on this subject. I hope that we will be able to
expedite our debates, while allowing proper time for relevant
discussion of the amendments. We might even make the kind of speed that
will allow the hon. Gentleman to make his Churchillian appearance in
Hammersmith this evening. I am equally conscious that if we are delayed
we will have to disappoint the people in Hammersmith&#151;or perhaps
spare them, but that is a point for
debate.</div><a name="07011885000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Chesterfield raised the issue of blind or partially sighted
people on Second Reading. We share his concern that a considerable
number of them will not be identified on the DWP database because the
information is held by local authorities rather than centrally. We have
worked closely with the digital television consumer expert group, which
comprises leading charities representing vulnerable people including
the Royal National Institute for the Blind, on how we should identify
those who are registered blind or partially sighted. Those aged 75 or
over will be identified from data held by DWP, but about 20 per
cent.&#151;approximately 50,000 or 60,000 people&#151;will be
identifiable only from data held by local authorities.</div>
<a name="07011885000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the consumer expert
group has actively supported the amendment. I have reservations about
its wording, but I pay tribute to the consumer expert group for its
contribution with the RNIB in particular. We recognise that allowing
local authorities to disclose information on the scheme would help
blind or partially sighted people by enabling the scheme operator more
readily to identify those who are eligible.
</div><a name="07011885000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading I
said that we were discussing with the Department of Health and the
Department for Constitutional Affairs whether and how to make provision
to permit local authorities to disclose the necessary information from
their register of blind or partially sighted people. The view of the
Department of Health is that because of data protection legislation,
local authorities would be unable to share that data with central
Government or other contractors. As such, blind and partially sighted
people would be put at a disadvantage compared with others eligible for
assistance. We are also discussing the matter with and seeking the
views of the devolved Administrations, who are also
important.</div> <a name="07011885000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
very sympathetic to the views of Opposition Members and of my hon.
Friends on this important issue, and we are actively engaged in
consultation to ensure that data on registered blind or partially
sighted people can be obtained by relevant bodies; however, some issues
remain to be worked though. The Government intend to continue those
discussions in the next few weeks, and I hope that at Report stage it
will be possible to bring back to the House the result of the
consultation process. We want to ensure that the needs expressed by
hon. Members on behalf of charities, the consumer expert group and
others are met and that we can agree a way forward that will satisfy
all members of the
Committee.</div><a name="07011885000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07011885000372"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): I think that there will be a
role for local authorities in the switchover process. It may be that
social services could get 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 10</div>involved to help people with any problems. However, as somebody from a
local authority background I wish to make the point that, although the
costs may be marginal, there could be a cost to local authorities.
Central Governments are good at saying, &#147;It is in the grant,
they can afford it,&#148; but during the consultation it would be
useful if realistic costs to local authorities were taken into account
so that they could, if necessary, be
compensated.</div>
<a name="07011885000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000373"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I acknowledge what the hon. Gentleman is saying.
It is worth remembering that in the present case the administrative
burden will not be particularly onerous. The problem relates to having
the power to share the information: the registers are kept; it is a
question of access to them. The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly fair
point, although whether it applies in the present case is moot. Again,
in the spirit of wanting to work with all hon. Members I will take
their comments on board. We will consider them and if it is appropriate
to measure those costs, although I think it probably is not, we will
bear that in mind when we bring back any proposals to the House on
report.</div><a name="07011885000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000374"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> I begin by thanking the hon. Member for Wantage
for his impassioned support for the amendment. He has clearly
demonstrated that he will make a fine figure of a man in his new
post.</div> <a name="07011885000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman may be relatively new to his post, Mr. Conway, but
you are not. You have chaired and served on many Committees of this
House, so you will be aware that often when a Government like an
Opposition amendment but do not want the Opposition to have the credit
for it, they try to persuade the Opposition to withdraw it so that they
can bring back their own, almost identical amendment, at a later stage
and claim the credit for it. It might be argued that that is what we
have just seen. But I genuinely do not believe that it is. I have
rarely heard a Minister say that he is very sympathetic, that he shares
our concerns and that an amendment deals with an important issue that
we must get right. I am delighted that the Minister said that. I am
delighted that he has been engaged in the consultation that I know
began long before the amendment was tabled. Clearly the Government are
taking the issue very seriously. We are grateful to the various
organisations that have provided the Government with
information.</div><a name="07011885000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister has given us an assurance that he will continue the
discussions to ensure that an amendment is produced that has a similar
effect to that of my amendment but deals correctly with the data
protection issue, I will be happy to withdraw my amendment, but before
I do so, I wish to say two things. First, I was slightly surprised when
the Minister told us that it was the Department of Health and not the
Department for Constitutional Affairs that was advising him about the
data protection issue. I hope that we will have confirmation that they
shared that
advice.</div><a name="07011885000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000375"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> It just demonstrates how joined-up the
Government are, that the Department of Health can offer that kind of
advice.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 11</div><a name="07011885000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000376"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> We have to be a little bit careful in that
respect. We may see on Thursday, when we have the statement on the
licence fee and learn the outcome of that battle, just how joined up
the DCMS and the Treasury are.</div>
<a name="07011885000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I want to thank the
hon. Member for Poole for his helpful intervention. While the Minister
may say that the costs for local authorities may be small, none the
less the burdens that actions by central Government are placing on
local government are increasing. Local government is under significant
strain and I would hate this to be the straw that breaks the
camel&#146;s back. I was grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
addressing that issue. I am also grateful to the Minister for assuring
the Committee that he would also look at this. He will no doubt comment
on it when he brings back an amendment on a suitable occasion. I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="07011885000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="07011885000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000377"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in
clause 1, page 1, line 11, leave
out paragraph
(a).</div><a name="07011885000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000378"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following amendments: No. 9, in clause 1, page 1, line 13, leave out
sub-paragraph (i).</div><a name="07011885000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.
10, in
clause 1, page 1, line 15, leave
out &#145;the BBC
or&#146;.</div><a name="07011885000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">No. 11, in
clause 1, page 1, line 18, leave out paragraph (c) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) the person or
persons duly appointed to manage and operate the switchover help
scheme.&#146;.</div><a name="07011885000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000379"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> Mr. Conway, I hope that as I explain
the importance of the amendment, you will not think that I am trying to
find a clever way to debate the details of the digital switchover
scheme. You will recall that I said in my remarks on the programme
motion that we did not know who was going to deliver the scheme; what
is clear is that we are unclear about what role the BBC will
play.</div><a name="07011885000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The excellent
Library briefing and the Department&#146;s excellently prepared
explanatory notes to the Bill contain little or nothing of the detail
of the BBC&#146;s role in delivering the scheme. Indeed, any
assiduous Committee member will have looked in detail not only at the
new BBC charter but at the agreement that accompanied it and came into
force on 19 December 2006. Such assiduous readers will have noticed in
section 39 of the agreement the following immortal
words:</div><a name="07011885000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The BBC
must comply with a scheme agreed with the Secretary of State concerning
the provision of specified help to specified categories of persons for
the purpose of enabling them to continue to view the UK Public
Television Services when and after they are affected by Digital
Switchover.&#148;</div><a name="07011885000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is it.
We have no detailed knowledge whatever of the BBC&#146;s role. We
know from clause 5(1) that the details of the scheme are to be agreed
between the BBC and the Secretary of State, but beyond that the
BBC&#146;s role is extremely murky.</div>
<a name="07011885000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would remove all
mention of the BBC as a relevant person under clause 1. If the BBC is
not to play a significant role, other than perhaps co-ordinating the
provision of the targeted help scheme 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 12</div>for digital switchover, it is unclear why it needs to receive all the
detailed data that the Bill will allow to be collected and shared. If
the BBC is playing a relatively minor, though no doubt important,
co-ordinating role, it could be argued that there is no need for it to
have data other than in aggregate form, so that it knows the total
number of people who will be affected and the numbers broken down by
the regions where switchover will
occur.</div><a name="07011885000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 5.1
of the DCMS digital help scheme summary says
that</div><a name="07011885000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the help scheme
will be managed and operated by a single organisation or a consortium
formed for the
purpose.&#148;</div><a name="07011885000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">That gives us
further reason to believe that the BBC will not be the body managing
and operating the scheme. With those two bits of evidence&#151;the
absolute silence about any details of the BBC&#146;s role and the
hint in paragraph 5.1 that the BBC will not be managing and operating
the scheme&#151;I surmise that there is no reason for the BBC to
receive all the detailed data to which the Bill will allow it
access.</div><a name="07011885000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000380"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I suspect that this amendment will not be received
by the Minister with the same joy as the previous amendment. It goes to
the heart of the Bill, and I support the remarks of the hon. Member for
Bath. In effect, the amendment asks why the BBC must appear in the
Bill. Ostensibly, the BBC has been put in charge of conducting targeted
help for digital switchover, but the Bill makes it clear and previous
experience with television licence fee administration shows us that, in
effect, it will not be the BBC we know and love that will conduct the
digital switchover; it will be a company formed specifically for that
purpose. As the hon. Member for Bath said, paragraph 5.1 of the
document from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
states:</div><a name="07011885000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
envisaged that the help scheme will be managed and operated by a single
organisation or a consortium formed for the purpose. The successful
supplier will need to demonstrate a strong track record of delivering
large customer facing programmes and with the logistics involved in
sorting equipment and delivering in-home assistance and
support.&#148;&#151;</div><a name="07011885000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">so we
know that it will not be Capita. The document
continues:</div><a name="07011885000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
successful supplier will also need to demonstrate a strong IT
capability&#151;</div><a name="07011885000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">so we know it
will not be a Government
organisation&#151;</div><a name="07011885000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for
the setting up and management of customer accounts tracking those
eligible through the scheme and linked with a contract centre designed
around and capable of meeting the need of older and disabled
people.&#148;</div><a name="07011885000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the things that concerns me is that there is no provision in the
Bill for the Minister to report back to Parliament on who will be
responsible for digital switchover. It would be extremely helpful to
the House, and right and proper, if the tender documents were made
available in the Library for hon. Members to peruse and if the Minister
regularly gave the House updates on what is happening. The House should
also have a chance to debate the selection of the organisation that is
ultimately chosen to conduct digital switchover. Given the
Government&#146;s track record of managing large-scale projects, it
is important that they should benefit from the input of hon.
Members.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div><a name="07011885000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Bath made clear, the information that we are discussing will
be disclosed by the Department for Work and Pensions, and potentially
by local authorities, which will identify individuals and households
meeting the eligibility criteria based on social security records. The
information will therefore be sensitive, but it will be disclosed
without the express or implied consent of the individuals concerned. We
believe that such information should be made available only where
necessary, and the clause fails that test. It is not necessary to put
the BBC in the Bill to make the scheme workable. In practice, the only
people who need the detailed information on individual households under
the scheme are those who are responsible for contacting eligible
people&#151;that is, the suppliers.</div>
<a name="07011885000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Bath said, the BBC only needs to see aggregated information
in order to administer the scheme. It simply needs to know the number
of households that are likely to be contacted in any given area so that
it can make proper accounting and budgeting arrangements. It does not
need to see the individual data. The help scheme will not be operated
or managed by the BBC, which is simply the overall supervisor of the
scheme, and it is extremely important that, as far as possible, we
restrict the distribution of the information.</div>
<a name="07011885000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we are debating the
organisation that will undertake the switchover, will the Minister,
when he responds to the amendment, give the Committee some indication
of how the digital switchover timetable is progressing? We are a mere
nine months away from the launch of the greatest civil project in
recent British history, in Whitehaven of all places&#151;a town whose
name that will be carved in stone for our grandchildren and
great-grandchildren when they sit down to watch digital television in
years to
come.</div><a name="07011885000084"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000383"></a>Mr.

about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s range of speaking engagements,
whether he is telling us that it is his intention shortly to promote
the Conservative interest in Whitehaven,
too.</div><a name="07011885000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000384"></a>The

tempted down that road, I remind the Committee that this is not a stand

fixed on the
amendment.</div><a name="07011885000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000385"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I was coming to the conclusion, Mr.
Conway. I will certainly be visiting Whitehaven, but I know that the
Minister has already accepted an invitation and I will let him go up
there
first.</div><a name="07011885000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000386"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> I have to say that this seems a very convoluted way
to organise targeted help. I am quite a fan of the BBC, but if one puts
the BBC next to whatever organisation is set up, I do not think that
the responsibility will be clear. One has to be able to answer the
question: who gets the blame and who gets sacked if things are not
being done properly? Will the BBC catch the blame? Are the Government
trying to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 14</div>insulate themselves from some of the unpopularity that will result if
things start to go wrong? There is a legitimate debate to be had about
whether the BBC should be specified in the Bill. I hope that the
Minister will reassure us that there will be a clear line of
responsibility, so that if things do not go right and delivery does not
happen, we shall not find that somebody was given a very big contract
worth a lot of money but we can do nothing about
it.</div><a name="07011885000334"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="07011885000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000387"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I am aware, Mr. Conway, of your
strictures on how far-ranging we can be. As to whether you would be
comfortable with my discussing the timetable for switchover, I suspect
that you would quickly rule that out of order, although I hope that you
would allow me to echo the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for
Wantage in recognising the significance of Whitehaven as we begin
roll-out. The name Whitehaven is already carved in stone, not least
because of the excellent leadership offered by my hon. Friend the
Member for Copeland. He has done extremely important pioneering work in
making sure that digital switchover roll-outs in the excellent way in
which I believe it
will.</div><a name="07011885000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues
raised by amendment No. 8&#151;and by the amendment group as a
whole&#151;are clear in terms of the purpose of hon. Gentlemen
opposite. The purpose may be deliberate, but I think that the
amendments are misconceived in terms of consequence, because of the
damage that they would do&#151;first, to the groups who will benefit
from the way that we intend to roll out targeted help and, secondly, to
the information access that is required and enabled by the Bill. Taken
together, the amendments would remove the BBC from all definitions of a
relevant person with whom the Department for Work and Pensions, the
Social Development Department in Northern Ireland and indeed the
Ministry of Defence could share social security or war pensions
information. Their effect would be to remove the BBC from the list of
bodies that can receive data, and hence make it much more difficult for
the BBC to play a central and important role in establishing and
funding the help
scheme</div><a name="07011885000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That issue is
fundamental and goes to the heart of the Bill&#146;s purpose. I have
listened carefully to what hon. Members have said and have been
cognisant of their concern, which is in part well intended. I say
&#147;in part&#148; because I think that there is also an element
present that would not be unhappy if it scuppered the
Government&#146;s timetable&#151;through Her Majesty&#146;s
Opposition. That wish is one that we have no intention of giving way
to. We do not agree with the view that the BBC should not be involved
in helping to establish and fund the digital switchover help scheme.
Nor indeed do we agree with the observations of the hon. Member for
Bath that because the help scheme is social policy the BBC should not
be involved.</div><a name="07011885000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may
help if I briefly outline why. The aim of the scheme is to help some of
the most vulnerable citizens with an area that is technical and
confusing for many of us, but particularly for many of the people in
the eligible groups. Accordingly, we believe that it is right for the
BBC, who are world leaders in the use of television technology and
which is a widely trusted organisation, to have a leading role in
running the scheme. Its operation is linked to the regional roll-out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 15</div>of switchover and to the timings of regional dates. There are obvious
links between the general communications needed to deliver switchover
and targeted communications that are crucial to the scheme. The scheme
will be most effective if fully integrated with the wider programme of
work, which is best done by linking it with the BBC&#146;s wider
responsibilities for building digital Britain. It is therefore right
that the BBC should take a leading role in making digital switchover
happen.</div>
<a name="07011885000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
worked closely with the BBC to develop the scheme, and I should like to
take this opportunity to thank and commend the BBC team who led the
development of the core requirements for receivers, which will ensure
that equipment meets the higher usability needs of those covered by the
scheme. We in government could not have done that by ourselves. Again,
it is a practical example of why it was right to ask the BBC to take a
leading role in this area. The scheme is integral to the digital
switchover
programme.</div><a name="07011885000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000388"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> I apologise for intervening on the Minister when
he is in full flow, but he has now said three times that the BBC will
play a &#147;leading role&#148;. It would help the Committee if he
agreed to specify the details and nature of that leading role. I did
not table the amendments to try to delay the digital roll-out; there
was no malicious intent. I was seeking to understand why the BBC needs
the data. After all, we are all concerned about data being made too
widely available. We should therefore limit the availability of data to
only those individuals and organisations that have a legitimate need
for them, in order to perform their function in delivering the targeted
help scheme. I am still confused about what the role of the BBC will be
and why it specifically needs the
data.</div><a name="07011885000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000389"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> It is important for the hon. Gentleman to
recognise the specific contents of the Bill before us. He has perfectly
legitimate concerns in this area and there will be other ways of
debating the issue. I shall therefore seek your indulgence,
Mr. Conway, and continue with my initial response, which may
allow me in part to satisfy the hon. Gentleman on the question that he
raised. I will come at the end of my remarks to the specific issue that
he raised.</div><a name="07011885000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">We first
proposed that the BBC should be responsible for helping to establish
and fund the help scheme in the BBC Green Paper in March 2005. We
clarified our proposals in the BBC White Paper in March 2006. The
provisions are set out in the new BBC charter and agreement, which came
into force on1
January.</div><a name="07011885000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The BBC
believes that it should be involved. On 15 November 2005,
Caroline Thomson, the BBC&#146;s chief operating officer, told the
Select Committee on Culture, Media and
Sport:</div><a name="07011885000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
very keen to ensure that everyone gets digital, including the most
vulnerable groups and that is one of the reasons why we have agreed in
principle with the Government&#146;s request to take part in the
targeted help scheme funded from the licence
fee.&#148;</div><a name="07011885000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
would remove the BBC from the definition of relevant persons with whom
the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div>for Social Development in Northern Ireland and the
Ministry of Defence in respect of war pensions could share social
security and war pensions information in connection with help scheme
functions. We believe that the BBC and the scheme operator will and may
need access to that information. The amendments would make it much
harder for the BBC to be involved in the running of the help scheme
and, as a consequence, make it much harder for the scheme to help
vulnerable people who may have difficulty in making the switch to
digital.</div><a name="07011885000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000390"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> The Minister is muddying the water further. In
addition to talking about a &#147;leading role&#148;, he has said
that the BBC will take part and has then gone on to say, rather
cryptically, that it &#147;may&#148; need access to the
information, rather than to give us an assurance. Earlier, the Minister
said specifically that the details were set out in the charter and
agreement. I have referred to the relevant section in the agreement. Is
the Minister telling me that there is more detail in the charter and
agreement that would help me and that I have missed? If so, could he
tell me where to find
it?</div><a name="07011885000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000391"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I am making it perfectly clear to the Committee
why the Government believe that the BBC should be able to have access
to the information. The BBC may well contract out some of the
day-to-day operations of the scheme. The hon. Gentleman made a number
of semantic points about a leading role, part role and so on, but under
the Bill we are enabling the BBC to do its job. It is right that it
does that job precisely because of what I said
earlier.</div><a name="07011885000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman perfectly legitimately took a different view from mine on the
matter from an early stage. Regrettably, the disagreement continues.
However, because he has a different view from the Government, it does
not mean that we shall change our position. We intend to continue to
work with the BBC and when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State
makes a statement to the House in which the details of the forthcoming
licence fee settlement will be set out and, indeed, by implication and
explication, the consequences of that for digital roll-out and targeted
help, the hon. Gentleman might find the answers to some of his
questions. In anticipation of that happening, he rightly probes away,
trying to glean a little more information here and there in advance of
the statement that we anticipate hearing from my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State. I am unable to satisfy his appetite on such
matters, so he will just have to wait a bit longer until my right hon.
Friend makes her
statement.</div><a name="07011885000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
about the scheme being funded from the licence fee and delivered by the
BBC has been debated extensively. We are willing to live with the fact
that, even if I am unable to convince Opposition Members that the BBC
should be involved in the way in which we are explaining, we believe
that it is the best way forward for the success of the scheme and
switchover if that is to work along the lines that we have outlined.
The general spirit of our proceedings has been one of consensus, but
the area currently under discussion goes back to a fundamental
disagreement between Opposition Members and myself at a much earlier
stage, so it is with regret that we cannot assist Opposition Members in
their wish to amend the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div><a name="07011885000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000392"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I hate disagreeing with the Minister because he
gets so upset, so I assure him that we shall return quickly to a spirit
of consensus. It might help the hon. Member for Bath if the Minister
could update the Committee on negotiations with the contractor who will
carry out the switchover scheme. I mentioned Whitehaven not simply to
have an opportunity to praise the outstanding efforts of the hon.
Member for Copeland, nor to flag up the Minister&#146;s imminent
visit there, but to point out that there are nine months to go.
Therefore, substantial negotiations must already have been completed
that the hon. Gentleman can now share with the
Committee.</div><a name="07011885000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000393"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I am sure, Mr. Conway, that in
respect of this specific set of amendments you would quickly rule me
out of order if I were now to go into detailed discussions about the
proposals for Whitehaven. I say in a sensible spirit of co-operation
with all members of the Committee that we want the scheme to work. It
is in the interests of everyone in this country that it works well and
I am happy beyond the Committee proceedings and the Bill to sit down
with all hon. Members and go through the proposals and, in so far as it
is helpful&#151;I am sure that it will be&#151;to outline how the
Whitehaven project will work. I do not want to take up the time of the
Committee doing so now because it would not be appropriate. However, I
am more than happy to sit down with the hon. Member for Wantage,
particularly if he wants to meet at 8 o&#146;clock this
evening in Hammersmith, and discuss the details of the project, explain
how we propose to roll it out and outline the advanced state of
preparedness that is taking place, not least because of the
co-operation and leadership offered by my hon. Friend the Member for
Copeland who represents Whitehaven and those who will benefit from the
switchover.</div><a name="07011885000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
said, I hope that members of the Committee can see that the amendments
probably have a different purpose from the genuine, noble inquiry that
is related to helping the most vulnerable in our community and that the
BBC is rightly recognised for the role that it will play in such
matters. It is essential that it and those who represent it will have
access to the information. It is therefore with regret&#151;I
genuinely mean regret&#151;that we will have to resist the amendments
if Opposition Members in extraordinary circumstances press them to a
vote.</div><a name="07011885000335"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

<a name="07011885000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000394"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> We have experienced this in the past. On this
occasion a Minister has implied dishonourable intent with his tongue
stuck very firmly into his cheek.
</div><a name="07011885000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although it was a
relatively brief intervention, the hon. Member for Poole went to the
very heart of what this debate is all about. He questioned the nature
of the relationship between the Government and the BBC in the delivery
of the targeted help scheme. He almost went so far as to imply that the
Government&#146;s intention was to set up a scheme in such a way
that, if it went wrong, they would leave the BBC to hang out to dry.
Were that the intention of the Government, I could perhaps understand
the vital importance of the BBC having access to all of the data to at
least make sure that every aspect of it was working in
detail.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 18</div><a name="07011885000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has failed to answer any of the questions that we have asked about the
nature of the role of the BBC in delivering the scheme. We have heard
that it is to play a leading role. We have heard that it is to take
part. We know from the agreement that it has to comply with the scheme
set out by the Secretary of State. We know from the Bill itself that it
has to agree with the Secretary of State on the detail of the
scheme&#151;an interesting juxtaposition, incidentally. We know
nothing, however, about what the BBC is going to do. The Minister has
not been able to tell me where additional information is provided in
the charter and agreement, so we are still left wondering why it is the
BBC needs access to this
information.</div><a name="07011885000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a
bit of hope because the Minister has implied that the Secretary of
State&#146;s statement on Thursday on the BBC licence fee will reveal
all this information. We are suddenly apparently going to discover all
of the details of the nature of the work being conducted by the BBC.
Since the Committee has the opportunity to be continuing on Thursday
afternoon, and if not then at Report stage, which will be after the
licence fee settlement statement has been made, we will have more
information then and perhaps we will have discovered what the precise
role of the BBC is. We will then have the opportunity to come back to
this particular issue.</div>
<a name="07011885000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not satisfied at all by
what the Minister has said, but I can see that I am not going to get
very far now. Maybe after Thursday lunchtime we will have more
information and perhaps I will have an opportunity to have another go
then. At this stage, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="07011885000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="07011885000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07011885000395"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): I beg to move amendment No. 1,
in
clause 1, page 2, line 1, after
first &#145;with&#146;, insert</div>
<a name="07011885000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;, and providing information in
formats accessible to visually impaired persons
to,&#146;.</div><a name="07011885000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is clear and self-explanatory. To be effective, the help
scheme will have to communicate effectively with older and disabled
people who are likely to qualify for help. To do so it has to contact
them in a way that is accessible. This amendment specifically requires
that the contractors will provide information accessible to all of
those relevant target groups. This is necessary to ensure that the
scheme is run according to the provisions of the disability equality
duty that came into force on 4 December 2006 as part of the Disability
Discrimination Act 2005.</div>
<a name="07011885000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some requirements of that duty
are that public sector bodies must promote equal opportunity for
disabled people and that, in doing so, they must take steps to meet the
needs of disabled people, even if those require giving more favourable
treatment than is provided to other people. The duty must therefore
clearly require the DCMS and the BBC, which are both covered by it, to
plan to meet the needs of disabled people in relation to digital
switchover.</div><a name="07011885000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
recommended that 12-point print is used as an absolute minimum standard
in all communications, but 14-point is much the best practice. That
will make it easier for the huge numbers of people who will have some
difficulty reading standard print to access information about the help
scheme. Among people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 19</div>with sight loss, 19 per cent. cannot read their personal mail, 39 per
cent. find it difficult to do so and a full 58 per cent. have
difficulty reading personal e-mails. Over-75s are twice as likely to be
unable to read their personal mail as those of working age. One
in 12 people become blind or partially sighted by 60 and by 65
that figure rises to one in every six. A total of 2 million
people in the UK have varying levels of uncorrectable sight loss and
experience difficulty reading standard print, hence the importance of
the amendment, which requires that all communication to those target
groups should be in accessible
formats.</div><a name="07011885000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
reasonable for initial correspondence to people who are registered
blind or partially sighted to be in a minimum of 16-point print,
although, ideally, it should be in 18-point. As well as being in large
print, initial correspondence should state that letters and information
can be made available in other formats, such as Braille, audio tape and
electronically. The format preference should be recorded by the
operators of the help scheme, who should then ensure that all following
correspondence is in the target audience&#146;s preferred
format.</div><a name="07011885000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that does not happen, recipients of the help scheme might not know, for
example, when a visit from a technician or other staff is to take
place, leading to missed appointments, negating the whole point of the
scheme and adding to the costs of trying to arrange repeat visits and
contacts. Those people might miss out on other important information
regarding the assistance being offered with the help scheme, what they
may or may not be entitled to, and so on. I suggest to the Secretary of
State that this important amendment makes it clear what are the
requirements on the contractors who are to deliver this important
assistance.</div><a name="07011885000119"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000396"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I support the amendment, which makes an important
point about the need to provide specific help for the visually
impaired. Indeed, when we debate my amendment later, which seeks to
write platform neutrality into the Bill, we will see that it is
important that the technology provided to people who need targeted
assistance for digital switchover is interactive, can be upgraded and
can provide the specific help that people with visual impairment
need.</div><a name="07011885000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier this
morning we were debating the BBC&#146;s role in providing digital
switchover help. I am surprised that the Government have decided to put
all their eggs in the BBC basket, because those of us who talk to other
broadcasters know that they are also advanced in helping vulnerable
groups, particularly the visually impaired. This amendment gives me the
opportunity to advise the Minister about Sky&#146;s services for the
visually impaired, which include a dedicated accessible service team
with a ring-fenced telephone number giving direct access to an adviser,
accessible TV listings information, disability awareness training for
all engineers and the availability of alternative
media&#151;including Braille, large print and audio&#151;to all
correspondents. As far as the technology is concerned, an easy-to-use
remote control device is also available. I urge the Minister to take
this opportunity to set out in specific detail the training that will
be given to the engineers responsible for targeted
help.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div><a name="07011885000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000397"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> Again, I am tempted to debate far and wide the
details of the help scheme. The hon. Gentleman is putting that
temptation before me, knowing full well that the Bill is about access
to information. None the less, he has made an important point, as well
as a good commercial on behalf of Sky television, to which, he might
wish to declare to the Committee, he is a regular contributor late at
night, providing us all with great amusement as he attempts to analyse
the newspapers.</div><a name="07011885000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment deals with an issue rightly recognised by all hon. Members as
important. It would be extremely unfortunate were we to go ahead with a
targeted help scheme that could not help people as fully as we intend.
In the best spirit, the amendment probes whether the legislation will
achieve its objectives as far as possible. Hon. Members are quite
rightly probing whether there may be a more effective way to achieve
them, but there is no difference between us on the outcome that we
want. The question is whether there is a better way of achieving
it.</div><a name="07011885000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
comments relate to whether the amendment will achieve its stated ends.
I must say at the beginning that I am advised that the amendment as
drafted might do less good than he intends. Drafting is always a
problem for Opposition Members, and where the Government can accept and
improve an amendment, it is a problem that we always wish to help with.
However, I hope if I give an explanation that the hon. Member for
Chesterfield will recognise why the amendment is
unnecessary.</div><a name="07011885000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
begin by outlining the amendment&#146;s effect. It would effectively
ensure that when the relevant person defined made contact with persons
who might be eligible for help under the switchover help scheme, he
would have to ensure that any information about the scheme supplied to
visually impaired persons was provided in formats accessible to them.
However, there is no need for the amendment in this case because of
existing duties under the Disability Discrimination Act.
</div><a name="07011885000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">In rising quickly to
his feet, the hon. Member for Wantage, who joined the hon. Member for
Chesterfield in tabling the amendment, might not have had the
opportunity last night to do his homework on the Act and discover that
the issues that he presented to the Committee are already set out in
the Act&#146;s duties and requirements. Provisions in part 3 require
service providers in providing their services and public bodies in
delivering their public functions to make reasonable adjustments to
enable disabled people to access those services and functions. Such
duties will apply to the relevant person when making contact with and
providing information to disabled persons who may be eligible for the
switchover help scheme.</div>
<a name="07011885000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light of that, I hope that
hon. Members will recognise that we are not for one moment trying to
water down or undermine accessibility for target groups. The Disability
Discrimination Act already establishes and imposes duties on individual
bodies in such a way that everything intended in the amendment is
already provided for in legislation, so the amendment would not improve
the
Bill.</div><a name="07011885000336"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000398"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> May I first make it clear that I do not associate
myself with adverts for Sky TV, an organisation to which I would not
want to lend my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div>name? Before I moved the amendment and the Minister replied, I wrote my
likely response. The first sentence reads, &#147;The Minister says,
and it might well be, that of course the information would be provided
in an accessible format because it is already required by law.&#148;
I made that point in moving the amendment. However, I know from my
experience that what is required in law under the Disability
Discrimination Act is not always followed through.</div>
<a name="07011885000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">From 2002-05, in the last
Parliament, I was my party&#146;s spokesman on disability. It is an
area I have taken a strong interest in since the last election. The
Department for Work and Pensions has a central role in dealing with
equality issues, but is often slow in producing White Papers, annual
reports and consultation documents in accessible formats, even though
it should be the foremost Department in ensuring that that happens. One
reason for this probing amendment was to press that
point.</div><a name="07011885000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this short
debate, we have at least put it on record that we absolutely and
clearly expect the contractors who end up implementing this scheme to
make every effort in the initial and subsequent contact that they have
with people to provide the information in accessible formats. They will
have to go out to the target group of up to 2 million people, some of
whom may, for example, have sight problems.</div>
<a name="07011885000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000399"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> Again, it is important for all hon. Members to
understand that legislation alone is not enough; it is about the spirit
with which we enter into the whole enterprise. I say to the hon.
Gentleman that we will see that in Whitehaven with the work of my hon.
Friend the Member for Copeland. We want this to work and we must ensure
that everyone who is in receipt of the information can access it,
regardless of disability. I give an undertaking now to the hon.
Gentleman that regardless of legislation, we will work with the charity
groups and with those helping target groups to ensure that the
information is available in a form that is accessible. I want to put it
on record that that really matters to everybody living in this country
regardless of political persuasion. Wherever people live and whatever
constituency they come from, this information must be made available in
a format that is accessible. We undertake to ensure that that
happens.</div><a name="07011885000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000400"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I thank the Minister for those repeated
assurances. I am sure that organisations such as the Royal National
Institute of the Blind and the Disability Rights Commission or its
future replacement, the Equality Commission, will in years to come
quote that in evidence if needs be, as will we. I beg leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="07011885000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000401"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> May I detain you, Mr. Conway, and the
Committee briefly to ask two quick questions on aspects of clause 1
that have not yet been debated? In determining the relevant people who
will be eligible for access to data, we note that subsection (3)(c)
states that a relevant person would be anyone carrying
out</div><a name="07011885000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any function
connected with switchover help functions.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 22</div><a name="07011885000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, that enables a very broad
definition of the number of people who might be helped. For example, a
very small aerial erection company might be contracted to put up one or
two aerials in a particular locality. It would clearly be carrying out
a function connected with the switchover help function and would be
given data about the people that it was expected to assist. However,
one assumes that it would not receive access to the wider data. I would
be grateful if the Minister could give some assurances in respect of
the way in which data will be given out at the minimum level and how it
will be ensured that people who get data receive only the minimum
amount that they need in respect of the function they are to
perform.</div><a name="07011885000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will probably reply that clause 3 should give me the comfort that I
need because it ensures that it is an offence for people to disclose
information that they are given without lawful authority. The Minister
may well tell me that there are a number of aspects of data protection
legislation covered in paragraph 9 of the explanatory notes and that
that should give me some assurance that data would not be given to
people who did not need them. In fact, having looked at those aspects,
I did not get the reassurance that I
seek.</div><a name="07011885000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like an absolute assurance from the Minister that no individual
or organisation covered by the clause will be provided with more data
than it needs for the purpose of carrying out the specific help
function that it is required to
provide.</div><a name="07011885000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1(4)
defines switchover help functions as, in paragraph (a),</div>
<a name="07011885000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the identification of persons who
may be eligible&#148;,</div><a name="07011885000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
paragraph (b),</div> <a name="07011885000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;making
contact with such persons with a view to the provision of such
help&#148;</div><a name="07011885000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">and, in paragraph
(c),</div> <a name="07011885000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the establishment
of any person&#146;s entitlement to such
help.&#148;</div><a name="07011885000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be
grateful for some clarification from the Minister, because the
explanatory notes tell us clearly who, in broad terms, will be
eligible. I have to rely on the notes because the matter is not covered
in the Bill. The last sentence of paragraph 7 of the explanatory notes
says:</div><a name="07011885000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Help
will be available free of charge for those who are eligible and in
receipt of pension credit, income support or income-based jobseeker's
allowance; others will pay a contribution towards the cost of
assistance.&#148;</div><a name="07011885000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
sentence is slightly odd compared with the statement on the Department
of Trade and Industry website
that</div><a name="07011885000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We will
charge a modest fee to
others.&#148;</div><a name="07011885000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">One is left
wondering how high the fees will be for other people. However, were I
to probe that matter, you would rule it out of order, Mr.
Conway. However, can the Minister give me an assurance that the aspect
of the switchover help function referring to the establishment of a
person&#146;s entitlement to such help includes establishing the
level of fee that they should pay, if such a fee is required to be paid
by such a
person?</div><a name="07011885000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000402"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I am pleased that we are making good progress. I
can see Hammersmith looming towards the hon. Member for Wantage, if he
so desires. Of course, whether he goes to Hammersmith this evening is
entirely in his hands.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div><a name="07011885000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have debated some of the
details of the clause in discussing the amendments. Clause 1 is
critical to the Bill: without it, the Bill fails. It is central in the
purposes that the Government have set out for access to information.
The clause provides the legal authority for the Department for Work and
Pensions, the Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland and
the Ministry of Defence to supply social security or war pensions
information to the administrator of the digital switchover help scheme.
It enables the DWP, the DSDNI and the MOD to disclose
information&#151;I am beginning to answer the questions asked by the
hon. Member for Bath&#151;for limited purposes only, that is, for use
in connection with switchover help
functions.</div><a name="07011885000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may be helpful to remind the Committee that there is extensive primary
legislation setting out the circumstances in which and to whom social
security information about individuals may be disclosed. Unauthorised
disclosure of such information is, and remains under the Bill, a
criminal offence under section 123 of the Social Security
Administration Act 1992. The provision in the Bill is very similar to
the one in the Television Licences (Disclosure of Information) Act 2000
that enables social security information to be provided to enable those
aged 75 and over to have a free television
licence.</div><a name="07011885000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind
Committee members that, under the Data Protection Act 1998, the
disclosure of the information in question must be necessary and, under
third party data protection principles set out in that Act, the
information must be relevant and not excessive for the purpose. It is
critical that hon. Members recognise that information is supplied on
the basis that it is necessary and proportionate to the
purpose.</div><a name="07011885000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000403"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> May I suggest to the Minister that that answer
would have been more helpful had it been given in his response to my
amendments relating to the BBC? If he is saying that there will be a
clear calculation of the minimum amount of data sufficient for the BBC
to carry out its role in switchover&#151;and, similarly, for the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport and my little aerial man in
some sub-region&#151;we might have made a lot of progress very
quickly.</div><a name="07011885000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000404"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I hope that we have made a lot of progress
quickly. I did not respond to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s earlier
probes on the BBC because I am quite sure that you, Mr.
Conway, would have ruled me out of order as it was not appropriate at
that point. I resisted being tempted by the hon. Gentleman putting the
amendment before me. It is sometimes difficult to resist temptation but
it was the right thing to do in this case if we managed to put on
record and remind hon. Members about the importance of information only
being passed if it is necessary and proportionate.</div>
<a name="07011885000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not only the safeguards
in the Bill on handling information that are relevant; provisions on
the handling of information covered by the Data Protection Act 1998 are
found in many other statutes and have an impact on the Bill. I
understand why hon. Members might wish to probe to ensure that those
protections are offered, but of course they are. Subsection (1)
provides legal authority to the Secretary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 24</div>of State and DSDNI to supply social security information to a
&#147;relevant person&#148;, as defined in subsection (3), for
use</div> <a name="07011885000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in connection with
switchover help
functions.&#148;</div><a name="07011885000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">as defined in
subsection (4).</div> <a name="07011885000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
have said, the clause is important. The hon. Member for Bath asked
about the &#147;modest fee&#148;. On Second Reading, the Secretary
of State said that the fee would be approximately &#163;40, but I am
happy to answer questions outside this Committee and to continue
corresponding with hon. Members. I wish to underline to hon. Members
that our purpose, and the reason for the Bill enabling information to
be derived from social security data, is to ensure that the targeted
help offered in the scheme achieves its ends. If we are able to improve
the Bill, either in the course of its passage through Parliament or
through guidelines and practice, we are open to doing so. We therefore
wish to enter into continued consultation beyond the Bill
itself.</div><a name="07011885000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000405"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> The previous debate was very enjoyable. I am
intrigued by the hon. Member for Bath&#146;s apparent obsession with
the erection of inanimate objects, but no doubt it took the debate
further.</div>
<a name="07011885000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have very
little to say on clause 2, but it would be useful if the Minister used
the opportunity during our debate on the clause to address a matter
that was raised on Second Reading. As far as I am aware&#151;I stand
to be corrected by the Minister&#151;in bringing war pensions
information into play the Bill differs from the Television License
(Disclosure of Information) Act 2000. As the Minister is aware, one or
two hon. Members made the point on Second Reading that war pension
information is more sensitive than social security information in the
context of disclosure. In Northern Ireland, for example, those in
receipt of a pension via the Ministry of Defence may not want their
neighbours or contractors to know about it. Will the Minister let the
Committee know whether any additional security measures are being put
in place to ensure that such information is well protected? I gather
that the Secretary of State for Defence has input into the Bill as a
consultee. I also understand that the Bill is permissive and that the
BBC and related organisations will not have the right to see such
information, so in that sense strong protection is already in place,
but I wonder whether the Minister could
elaborate.</div>
<a name="07011885000337"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="07011885000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000406"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b><b class="B"> </b>I will make two very quick points. First,
clause 2 states that the description of the information will be
prescribed by the Secretary of State and that that prescription will be
the subject of an order made by the Secretary of State. In other words,
the House will have the opportunity to debate the details of that
prescription and therefore the information that will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div>come from the data and to whom those data refer. I wonder whether the
Minister can explain to the Committee something that has been puzzling
me for a very long time. Why is the prescription&#151;a relatively
small issue&#151;to be the subject of an order when the description
and the detail surrounding the whole scheme and its delivery are not to
be the subject of such an
order?</div><a name="07011885000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
question, which I mentioned earlier, is simple. Will the Minister
update the Committee on the number of people who will be covered by the
data? He will recall his predecessor, the hon. Member for Stalybridge
and Hyde (James Purnell), telling the Department Culture, Media and
Sport Committee on 10 January
that</div><a name="07011885000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;what we are doing
is providing help to up to five million vulnerable
households.&#148;</div><a name="07011885000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
the 7 June report of the DCMS Committee
states:</div><a name="07011885000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
recognise some people will face practical issues in coping with
switchover. This is why we are setting up with the BBC a very
comprehensive programme of assistance to which 6.5million households
where one person is aged 75 or over, or where one person is severely
disabled, will be eligible.&#148;</div>
<a name="07011885000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 22 November, in a parliamentary answer
to me, the Minister himself
said:</div><a name="07011885000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
estimate that around 7 million UK households will qualify for
assistance&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 22 November 2006;
Vol. 453, c. 113W.]</div><a name="07011885000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
slightly bizarre given the number of households in which there may be
more than one eligible person. In another parliamentary answer from the
Minister on 19 December&#151;only a month later&#151;the
number of households that qualified for assistance had risen
to 7.1 million. Given that the number is going up by about
200,000 a month, can the Minister give us his latest estimate of the
number of people who will have to be helped by a scheme that will be
fully funded by the BBC&#151;totally unfairly&#151;out of the
licence fee payers&#146;
pockets?</div><a name="07011885000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000407"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> The hon. Gentleman deserves a medal for
temptation. He puts before me numerous opportunities to go far and wide
and journey through many areas. However, I am sure, Mr.
Conway, that you quite rightly will want to remind us that clause 2 is
actually very clear. It defines the key expressions used in clause 1.
The temptation is great to discuss at this stage how many people will
be covered and what parts of the UK it will refer to, but I think that
you would swiftly rule me out of order were I to respond, so I shall
resist.</div> <a name="07011885000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2
defines the key expressions used in clause 1, and provides a power that
we envisage will be exercised by the Secretary of State for Culture,
Media and Sport to define precisely the types of social security and
war pensions information that can be supplied. As such, clause 2 plays
the important role of allowing for the scope of information to be
defined in detail, rather than leaving it to the discretion of the
Department for Work and Pensions and scheme operators.</div>
<a name="07011885000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Wantage
raised an important issue that, as a former Under-Secretary of State
for Northern Ireland with responsibility for security, I am
particularly concerned about: whether a risk might be caused,
inadvertently or otherwise, to individuals in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 26</div>Northern Ireland as a consequence of being identified by the scheme.
Indeed, concerns about war veterans other than those from Northern
Ireland were raised by staff in my Department as well as by hon.
Members on Second Reading. As a result, officials in my Department and
others investigated to ensure that there is no possibility that
sensitive data will be released to a switchover provider. The Veterans
Agency of the Ministry of Defence was particularly conscious of the
risks to people in Northern Ireland, but it is satisfied that a
switchover provider should not receive any information that would place
a Northern Ireland security veteran at risk by identifying individuals
as ex-service personnel.</div>
<a name="07011885000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point raised by the hon. Member for Bath relates to the nature of the
legislation. The details of the secondary legislation mean that the
type of information that can be supplied can be widened or narrowed
depending on operational requirements, without the need for further
primary legislation. However, the type of information cannot be changed
at will&#151;it must be the subject of an order, which will be
subject to the negative resolution form of parliamentary scrutiny and
control. There is no intention to include sensitive personal
information in such orders. I hope that that has answered the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s questions.</div>
<a name="07011885000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000408"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> The Minister rightly says that the advantage of an
order is that the details of the data that are needed can be changed
from time to time, as circumstances change, without the need for
primary legislation. I understand that. However, he has not answered my
question. Why is it so important to have an order and to have the House
make a decision on any changes that may take place when the Government
do not think it necessary to have an order giving the House the
opportunity to have a say on the details of the scheme to which the
data relate? I do not understand why one matter should be subject to
the House&#146;s approval, and the other
not.</div>
<a name="07011885000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000409"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> What I have set out relates specifically to the
Bill, which is not about the whole scheme, but about the disclosure of
information. In so far as I can do so and remain in order,
Mr. Conway, I believe that I have answered the question
raised by the hon. Gentleman about why the capacity to disclose
information is dealt with in the Bill.</div>

Vaizey:</b> I know that you are a highly cultured individual
and film buff, Mr. Conway, so you may have come across the
film, &#147;Being John Malkovich&#148;. As the Committee
progresses, I am given to wonder whether the Minister has in his back
pocket a script for &#147;Being Derek Conway&#148;, as he seems so
able to anticipate your rulings before they are made. I hope that the
Minister does not anticipate a ruling that anything I say in debating
amendment No. 6 is somehow out of order.</div>
<a name="07011885000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the amendment is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000413"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I simply want to put on record that my
anticipation of what you might say about being in order, Mr.
Conway, comes merely&#151;I say this with great humility&#151;from
a position of deference and respect to the office you hold as Chairman
of the Committee. I have sought to anticipate you because I do not wish
to preoccupy you or allow you to tell us
off.</div>
<a name="07011885000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000414"></a>The

Gentleman&#146;s concern. Let us try to

<a name="07011885000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000415"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I was about to debate levels of humility. I yield
to no one in my humility before you, Mr. Conway.</div>
<a name="07011885000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our debate on clause 3 is about
the burden of proof. The Committee contains an extremely distinguished
criminal lawyer, my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth,
and with the greatest respect to him, somebody of perhaps even more
distinction, the hon. Member for Tooting, who is a former director of
Liberty. The Committee will be astonished if he does not have something
to say about the clause, which contains a reversal of the traditional
burden of proof. We are considering a butterfly broken on a wheel. The
clause uses a sledgehammer to crack a nut. This innocuous Bill of six
clauses contains an affront to years of traditional English, or
British,
liberties.</div><a name="07011885000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me set
the scene. Paragraph 28 of the explanatory notes makes it explicit that
the burden of proof is reversed in the Bill. It
states:</div><a name="07011885000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the person
charged has a defence if he can prove that, even though <i class="I">in fact</i>
the disclosure was made without lawful authority or was a disclosure of
information that had not previously been made public with such
authority, he<i class="I"> believed</i> that one or other of those conditions was
met, and had no reason to believe that they were not met ... In
principle, this reverses the burden of proof in this respect. In
criminal matters it is usually up to the prosecution to prove the case
beyond all reasonable doubt, but here the defendant must prove the
matters that go to make up the defence. The standard of proof is the
balance of probabilities. Such &#145;reverse burden&#146;
provisions raise issues under article 6 of the European Convention on
Human Rights that are discussed
below.&#148;</div><a name="07011885000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Below&#148;
means in paragraphs 38 and 39 of the explanatory notes. Paragraph 39
states:</div><a name="07011885000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
considered that clause 3(5) complies with article
6(2)&#148;</div><a name="07011885000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">of the European
convention on human rights. It
continues:</div><a name="07011885000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
European Court of Human Rights has held that article 6(2) does not
place an absolute prohibition on such &#145;reverse burden&#146;
provisions, but they must be &#145;reasonable&#146;. Clause 3(5) is
considered to be reasonable: the offence is an important one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 28</div>because it is one of the mechanisms that safeguards personal information
disclosed for the purposes of giving help with
switchover&#148;.</div><a name="07011885000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000416"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon.
Gentleman when he is in full flow, but he is straying into the terms of

almost certain we will come. He might find himself slightly ahead of
the game at the moment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000417"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> Your ruling could bring me to a crashing or
grinding halt, but, as I said in my opening remarks, I am to be guided
by you, Mr. Conway. I am a naive adolescent as far as my
experience on the Front Bench goes. If you tell me that I am out of
order in debating what I think my amendment does, which is reverse the
burden of proof, I shall happily be corrected by you and I shall
withdraw the amendment and debate the matter when the hon. Member for
Bath moves amendment No. 2. I seek your guidance, Mr.

<a name="07011885000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000418"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment No. 6 has
been selected, therefore it is perfectly in order to discuss it. All he
has to do is to keep his remarks on his in-order amendment to the
&#147;knowingly or recklessly&#148; bit. If he were to move on to
the bit that refers to amendment No. 2, he would not be in order. So,
knowingly and recklessly, Mr. Vaizey will continue.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000419"></a>Mr.

amendment attempts to avoid the potential problem of the reversal of
the burden of proof, which is raised later, and it does so effectively.
Given what the Minister has already said in this debate, I suspect that
he wants to ensure that help is offered to those in a vulnerable
position and that everything possible is done to ensure that
information is transferred to those individuals to assist them with the
switchover. I am sure he would agree that it would be regrettable if
anything fixed in the minds of those participating in that process were
to deter them from offering the maximum
assistance.</div>

may be prosecuted and subject to a criminal offence. That is not what
the Minister intends&#151;</div>

Member for Rugby and Kenilworth has helped him enormously? To summarise
the point that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth
made&#151;perhaps the hon. Gentleman can help to ensure that I have
got it right&#151;if the reverse burden of proof is to go ahead, as
the Government appear to wish, it is important that the Committee agree
to the amendment, as it would remove the possibility of people
unknowingly and un-recklessly, by error, handing over information. It
would be unfair if they were caught by the reverse burden of
proof.</div><a name="07011885000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000427"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I could not agree more with the hon. Gentleman.
However, I am now entirely in your hands, Mr. Conway. I want
to reverse the burden of proof, so I wish to address that point and
then to ask leave to withdraw my amendment and hand the Floor to the
hon. Member for Bath, if it is more appropriate to debate his amendment
to discuss the reverse burden of
proof.</div><a name="07011885000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000428"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am now confused about the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s wishes. He cannot withdraw that which has not been
moved. If he does not want to press his amendment to a vote, I will not
put the question. He is entitled to hear the Minister&#146;s reply,
if he wishes. He can withdraw the amendment when the Minister has
finished.</div><a name="07011885000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000429"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> Let me continue with my carefully worded remarks
on the reverse burden of proof, because they are enormously important.
I am tempted to yield to the hon. Member for
Tooting.</div><a name="07011885000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07011885000430"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Sadiq Khan</b> (Tooting) (Lab) <i class="I">indicated
dissent.</i></div><a name="07011885000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000431"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> In recalling my legal expertise, I remind the
Committee of an almost timeless principle, dating back to 1935, that it
is up to the prosecution to establish guilt. That is known as the
Woolmington principle, from the case of Woolmington <i class="I">v</i>. the
Director of Public Prosecutions. Officials were aware of that when
drafting the Bill, and I see them nodding their heads. The then Lord
Chancellor, Lord Sankey, described the presumption of innocence as the
&#147;golden thread&#148; running through the English legal system.
It is worth quoting his remarks in
full:</div><a name="07011885000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;while the
prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner, there is no such
burden laid on the prisoner to prove his innocence and it is sufficient
for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt; he is not bound to satisfy
the jury of his innocence... Throughout the web of the English
criminal law one golden thread is always to be seen, that is the duty
of the prosecution to prove the prisoner&#146;s guilt... No
matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the
prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common
law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be
entertained&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 30</div><a name="07011885000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a number of exceptions to the
golden rule: the defence of insanity, which is down to the defendant to
prove under the M&#146;Naghten rule, dating back to 1843; statutory
exceptions; and implied statutory exceptions. Any reverse burden of
proof, as appears in clause 3, is open to challenge, as the explanatory
notes make clear, under article 6(2) of the European convention on
human rights. The explanatory notes also make it clear that a reverse
burden provision will not inevitably give rise to a finding of
incompatibility. It is now well settled that, in deciding the issue,
the courts should focus on the circumstances of the case and strike a
reasonable balance between the general interest of the community and
the protection of the fundamental rights of the individual. That is
made clear in a number of cases, culminating in the case of Sheldrake,
decided in 2005.</div><a name="07011885000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
official Opposition submit that the reverse burden of proof in clause 3
is disproportionate. It is philosophically wrong for the defendant to
have to prove that he disclosed information without knowing that he was
doing so, or to prove that he was not reckless in doing so. It is also
unfair to the defendant in practical terms. When a defendant is brought
to court, the prosecution always has most of the cards stacked in its
favour, which is why in law the golden thread requires that the
prosecution prove the case. It is also hard to prove a
negative&#151;for the defendant to prove that he is not guilty of the
offence because he did not do it.</div>
<a name="07011885000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are several other reasons
why the provision is unfair. It is also important to make the point
that, although the explanatory memorandum says that it is proportionate
and right to include the reverse burden of proof in the clause, the
courts must ultimately make the decision.</div>
<a name="07011885000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000432"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman making the point that,
because of all the explanations that he has given about why the reverse
burden of proof is wrong if the Government persist, the
amendment&#146;s inclusion would be so crucial that the matter could
not be discussed?</div>
<a name="07011885000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000433"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I am making that
point.</div>
<a name="07011885000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000434"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I am sure the Committee will be relieved to hear
that I shall avoid the quagmire of amendment No. 6 and address my
comments to amendment No.
4.</div><a name="07011885000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 4 was
tabled to seek clarification from the Secretary of State about an issue
that I first raised on Second Reading. The contractors who deliver the
scheme will be provided with sensitive information about vulnerable
people with disabilities, such as partial sight, and about elderly
people. Those people could be exploited if the information were widely
available. It is important to restrict, limit and carefully guard
access to that information.</div>
<a name="07011885000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 3 implies that, although
it is an offence for the contractor to make available the information
for incorrect purposes, it would not be an offence if a relevant
person, such as a civil servant, a member of the BBC, or even a
Minister from the relevant Department, made the information available
to a contractor and misled them into believing that they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 31</div>could pass it to other people, who might then misuse it. The clause
implies that it would be legal to disclose it in that way.</div>
<a name="07011885000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is simple: would the
contractor be innocent if a relevant person in the BBC or in the
Department had passed information to them and misled them into
believing that they could legitimately spread the information further
afield, where it could be misused? That is it&#151;short and to the
point. Will the Secretary of State clarify whether it is an offence?
The clause seems to read that it is not.</div>
<a name="07011885000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000435"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I call Mr. Justice
Woodward.</div>
<a name="07011885000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000436"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I have been the subject of many elevations this
morning: &#147;Secretary of State&#148; was incredibly generous of
the hon. Member for Chesterfield, and now &#147;Justice&#148;. It
is difficult to recover one&#146;s lowly position as a junior
Minister with true equilibrium, but I shall do my best.</div>
<a name="07011885000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Wantage
took us on an interesting journey through his legal and philosophical
background. At the end of his exegesis, it was hard to understand why
he stopped practising as a lawyer, or indeed why he did not turn to a
career in philosophical reasoning, as he endeavoured to deal with the
question of negatives. Even if the way in which the points were raised
left a little to be desired, they are none the less important. The
Government should answer appropriately what the hon. Gentleman and the
hon. Member for Chesterfield have rightly opened up, and we shall take
the opportunity to do so now.</div>
<a name="07011885000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is essential that the
security of personal information is safeguarded. On that, I am sure
that all hon. Members agree. The clause is about detailing offences
committed if social security information is unlawfully disclosed, and
the amendments attempt to improve the position by providing those
protections and by ensuring that information is carefully handled. The
question is whether they do that. I shall argue that they do not. We
believe that the Bill strikes the right balance. That relates also to
precedent, which I shall come on
to.</div><a name="07011885000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 6
raises the question of whether we were right to make the offence in
clause 3 one of strict liability&#151;in other words, an offence
requiring the prosecution, in order to gain a conviction, to prove that
the defendant made the alleged disclosure without any particular state
of mind. Under the amendment, a person would be not guilty of
disclosing information without lawful authority unless he or she made
the disclosure &#147;knowingly or recklessly&#148;. I think that
that is what the hon. Member for Wantage was
saying.</div><a name="07011885000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment were agreed to, no offence would be
committed unless it could be proved that the offender either knew they
were disclosing information supplied under clause 1 without lawful
authority or was reckless in doing so&#151;in other words, they took
an unjustified risk. The purpose of the clause is to protect citizens
and prevent abuse, but we believe that the amendment would make it more
difficult to obtain justice if there was abuse. It would lessen the
deterrent effect of the offence.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 32</div><a name="07011885000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind hon. Members that the
objective of the offence is to help to ensure the security and
confidentiality of the information made available under the Bill and
the scheme. In that sense, I have every sympathy with the hon.
Gentleman. I just do not think, for reasons that I shall explain, that
the amendment would achieve those
ends.</div><a name="07011885000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000437"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> May I just clarify that I was chair, not director of
Liberty? Is not article 8 of the convention on respect for privacy
another problem here? If we were to pass the amendment, we might breach
that right of individuals not to have information disclosed
willy-nilly.</div><a name="07011885000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000438"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend, but I shall add
other reasons.</div><a name="07011885000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not think that the people who handle the information should take risks
with it. Let us imagine that an employee uses a laptop in a public
place and does not realise that personal information can be seen over
their shoulder or carelessly sends information to the wrong email
address, or puts the hard copy of information in an ordinary dustbin
without considering that an unauthorised person might retrieve it. It
would be up to the courts to decide, but it seems to me that none of
those people would necessarily have acted &#147;knowingly or
recklessly&#148; and so would not necessarily be convicted. In my
judgment, they would have been careless, which the Bill should deter.
When carelessness occurs, punishment should be
sought.</div><a name="07011885000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
4 applies only to the first offence in clause 3, not to the second:
that in subsection (2), which applies to employees, contractors and
subcontractors. It would be odd&#151;to say the least&#151;to have
different standards of proof for the release of information on the
basis of the organisation that a person works for. Clearly, that is not
what the hon. Member for Wantage
intended.</div><a name="07011885000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000439"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> To clarify, that is not what I intended. If it
were possible, I would move that amendment, but it is
not.</div><a name="07011885000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that I
was trying to make was that it should be down to the prosecution to
prove the elements of the offence&#151;that the defendant knew that
they were disclosing sensitive information, or did so recklessly. The
Minister is saying that any carelessness will make a defendant guilty.
That is the point that I so inarticulately put when I moved the
amendment. Someone could come up with numerous examples of
carelessness, such as leaving a laptop in a car while popping in to a
shop and having it stolen. It strikes me that the provision places an
enormous burden on employees and others dealing with such sensitive
information. It is wholly disproportionate to the information that
could emerge. Again, the simple point is that it should be up to the
prosecution to prove that an offence has been committed, and not up to
the defendant to try to find a way
out.</div><a name="07011885000339"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="07011885000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000440"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but
it is incumbent on those involved to take a great deal of care in the
handling of that information.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 33</div><a name="07011885000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000441"></a>Mr.

way?</div>
<a name="07011885000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000442"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I shall in a moment.</div>
<a name="07011885000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The following point refers in
part to a discussion on an earlier amendment about the information held
on a laptop. If someone has sensitive and comprehensive information on
their laptop, the Bill is right to put a
duty&#151;</div><a name="07011885000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000443"></a>Mr.

<a name="07011885000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000444"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I shall give way to my hon. Friend first, if the
hon. Gentleman can contain himself.</div>
<a name="07011885000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000445"></a>Mr.

up.</div>
<a name="07011885000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000446"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> &#147;Recover&#148; is the word that the
hon. Gentleman is searching for.</div>
<a name="07011885000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to place the
duty of care on that individual.</div>
<a name="07011885000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000447"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> I draw my hon. Friend&#146;s attention to the
parallels between the Bill and Parliament&#146;s view on health and
safety issues over the past few decades. The legislation includes
strict liability offences because Parliament has deemed it important
for employers to provide a safe place to work for their employees. I am
sure that the party to which the hon. Member for Wantage belongs raised
the same issues back then.</div>
<a name="07011885000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000448"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I am grateful to my hon.
Friend.</div>
<a name="07011885000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000449"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I am sure that, if a Conservative Government
introduced that legislation, those issues were raised by the party of
which the former chair of Liberty is a member. Will the Minister
confirm that there is no reverse burden of proof under the official
secrets Acts? It is up to the prosecution to prove the elements of the
offence. It is extremely odd that, if a Royal Navy commander were to
leave the details of the Trident nuclear deterrent on the back seat of
his car and they were stolen, the prosecution would have to prove that
he was reckless; whereas if an employee of an aerial erection company
left two addresses on the back seat of his car and they were stolen, he
would be guilty of an offence.</div>
<a name="07011885000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000450"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> Instead of risking delaying the Committee with a
discussion about the official secrets Acts, I shall write to the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="07011885000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000451"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div>
<a name="07011885000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000452"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> In a moment.</div>
<a name="07011885000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that we are striking
the right balance. A person who is clearly responsible for personal
information being disclosed without authority could be found guilty of
an offence, unless they can prove that the circumstances set out in
subsection (5) apply&#151;in short, that they made an honest but
reasonable mistake. That is fair to the people whose daily job involves
the handling of such information; but equally and crucially, it
safeguards the personal information 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 34</div>that they handle and is therefore fair to the person to whom the
information relates. I do not know whether that answers or anticipates
the question from the hon. Member for Bath, but I suspect that it might
do both.</div> <a name="07011885000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 4 also raises a number of key issues, but we are not persuaded that
another criminal offence is needed to deal with them. First, and
importantly for the hon. Members for Chesterfield and for Bath, the
provisions before us are similar to those in the Television Licences
(Disclosure of Information) Act 2000. No offence, such as that which
the hon. Gentlemen would like included in the Bill, exists in that
legislation. In so far as we are aware, the problems about which they
are concerned have not arisen. The same is true about the social
security legislation, which is the basis of clause 3. I am therefore
somewhat sceptical about the need for such an
offence.</div>

<a name="07011885000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000454"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> In a moment.</div>
<a name="07011885000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, a
new offence is unnecessary, because we can and must rely on the BBC and
the scheme administrators to draw up carefully legal documentation that
makes the contractors&#146; position clear to them. We must also rely
on the scheme administrators to reach an agreement with the DWP about
the security arrangements for safeguarding information. As I have said,
it is essential that the security of personal information is
safeguarded. However, that depends on effective data management
practices by everyone involved, backed up by a proportionate but
enforceable criminal offence to deter unlawful disclosure.</div>
<a name="07011885000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also mention the
offences in section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 that relate to
unlawfully obtaining, disclosing and selling or offering personal
data.</div><a name="07011885000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000455"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I apologise for being cruel to the Minister
earlier&#151;I was a little premature, but I was thinking of the
reshuffles.</div> <a name="07011885000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s argument seems to be that, if in two aspects of
Government&#146;s activity, such as TV licensing, the same loophole
exists in the legislation but he is not aware of its having been
abused, it is acceptable to leave that loophole open in a third piece
of legislation. That seems a strange
argument.</div>
<a name="07011885000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000456"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> It would be a strange argument if we felt that a
loophole had been opened. We do not believe that one has been opened,
because we have covered the very issues that the hon. Gentleman has
probed in his amendment. Therefore, before we put any new offences on
to the statute book, we need to examine how far existing criminal law
goes.</div> <a name="07011885000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">In consultation
with Government lawyers, I am assured that, in many instances, the new
offence that appears in the Member for Chesterfield&#146;s amendment
is unnecessary. If one person gives another misleading information with
the intention of making that other person disclose information without
lawful authority, it is quite possible that the first person might
already be vulnerable to prosecution. Depending on the exact 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 35</div>circumstances, he might be liable to be charged with being an accessory
or with inciting another person to commit the offence.</div>
<a name="07011885000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">These two important amendments
have been taken together. If we were not able to satisfy the underlying
concerns of the amendments put forward by hon. Members, we would want
to bring forward amendments ourselves. However, on the basis of the
advice that I have been given in my discussions with Government
officials and lawyers, we can reassure hon. Members that their concerns
have been met.</div>
<a name="07011885000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000457"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I return to my original arguments, and perhaps I
will have a chance to put them more articulately now that the Minister
has replied. The purpose of inserting the words &#147;knowingly or
recklessly&#148; would be to make it clear that the prosecution
should prove the elements of the offence carried out by a person
involved in disclosing information illegally. I have heard the
Minister&#146;s arguments and understand that he will resist
amendment No. 4, so I will not press it to a vote.</div>
<a name="07011885000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder whether the Minister
can confirm that it is open to the courts to override a reverse burden
of proof. The case of Sheldrake <i class="I">v.</i> the DPP makes it clear that
the courts will look at the circumstances to consider whether such a
burden is inappropriate. I am interested to learn that the Minister has
taken a great deal of legal advice. Would he waive principle and allow
the Opposition to see the legal advice that tells him that it is
appropriate to include a reverse burden of proof in such a
Bill?</div><a name="07011885000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000458"></a>Mr.

to the issue of the reverse burden of proof. However, we have had an
interesting debate about it already, so I do not intend to detain the
Committee for
long.</div><a name="07011885000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reference has
already been made to article 6(2) of the European convention on human
rights. It is worth reminding ourselves that it states:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 36</div><a name="07011885000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Everyone charged with a
criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty
according to the
law&#148;&#151;</div><a name="07011885000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">everyone.
The European Court of Human Rights has held that article 6.2 does not
place an absolute prohibition on such reverse burden provisions, but
that they must be reasonable. I confess that I am bitterly disappointed
that that was the court&#146;s judgment, but we must nonetheless
accept that that was its decision. That decision has sadly enabled the
Government to introduce a number of pieces of legislation that reverse
the burden of proof. Examples of that include the Protection from
Harassment Act 1997, the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 and, bizarrely,
the Patents Act 2004. There was an attempt to do the same
through what was then the London Olympics Bill, although we were
fortunately able to persuade the Government, after lengthy debates, to
change their mind, and that did not go ahead.</div>
<a name="07011885000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we are being asked to
accept that the offence under clause 3 is a reasonable case for using
the reverse burden of proof. That is the test that would have to be
made to the European Court if there were a challenge. The explanatory
notes say:</div><a name="07011885000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is considered that clause 3(5) complies with article
6(2).&#148;</div><a name="07011885000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
continue:</div><a name="07011885000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
3(5) is considered to be
reasonable&#148;,</div><a name="07011885000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">yet the
reason given is bizarre. It is that</div>
<a name="07011885000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the offence is an important
one&#148;.</div><a name="07011885000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should have
thought that the vast majority of offences were important ones. The
hon. Member for Wantage referred earlier in his excellent contribution
to&#151;what was the
legislation?</div><a name="07011885000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000461"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> The official secrets
Acts.</div><a name="07011885000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000462"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He asked
whether offences in respect of that legislation were serious enough to
carry the reverse burden of proof, but the Minister was unable to
respond. I consider murder to be an important offence, but we do not
use the reverse burden of proof argument for that. Indeed, the
comparison is between murder, where we do not have the reverse burden
of proof, and the offence proposed in the Bill, for which the maximum
penalty is two years. That offence hardly seems to be sufficiently
important to justify the reversal of the burden of proof. If the
amendment were accepted, it would remove the reverse burden of proof
and achieve what the hon. Gentleman wishes to achieve. However, rather
than outline why I think that is so important, I refer the Committee to
the remarks that he made a few moments
ago.</div><a name="07011885000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000463"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> It is essential that the security of personal
information is safeguarded. I am sure that all hon. Members are agreed
on that. Achieving that depends on good data management practices by
all involved, backed up by a proportionate but enforceable criminal
offence, to deter unlawful disclosure. Again, we believe that we have
struck the right balance in that.
</div><a name="07011885000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider the
following examples of unlawful disclosure. An employee discloses the
names and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div>addresses of people eligible for help, which are then used by a conman
to trick his way into somebody else&#146;s house. Other examples
include, for instance, a corrupt employee selling information that can
be used for marketing to a commercial company, an employee carelessly
discarding hard-copy lists of eligible persons or e-mailing them to the
wrong e-mail address and an employee giving a local newspaper details
of people who have received help under the scheme, so that the
newspaper can write a story about whether the scheme has failed. I hope
that hon. Members would agree that the employee in first two examples
would deserve to face a criminal court. However, there might be room
for more discussion about the second two examples, which would, of
course, depend on the
facts.</div><a name="07011885000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
function of a court is to investigate what exactly has happened and
judge whether a person deserves to be punished. We believe that the
Bill allows for the right degree of flexibility on a case-by-case
basis. It might therefore be helpful if I explain, for the benefit of
hon. Members who have tabled amendments in the group, how the clause is
intended to
work.</div><a name="07011885000340"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="07011885000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The prosecution
would have to prove that the defendant had disclosed social security
information supplied under clause 1 and had done so without having
lawful authority, as defined in subsection (6). It is not correct to
say, as some hon. Members have, that the burden of proof has been
reversed. The prosecution must prove beyond all reasonable doubt that
the main elements of the offence have been committed; only then do the
provisions of subsection (5) come into play. Rather than reversing the
burden of proof, subsection (5) extends the defences open to a
defendant by allowing him or her to bring many mitigating circumstances
to the court&#146;s attention: for example, believing that it was
okay as part of his or her job to help the press to report on the
scheme; thinking that it was already public knowledge that specific
people had helped with the scheme or that he or she had permission from
the individuals whose details he or she had released to do so; or being
told by a manager that he or she could release the
information.</div><a name="07011885000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course
we must be careful not to make it too easy for defendants to escape
conviction by being able to give spurious excuses that the prosecution
would find hard to disprove. It could be very difficult for the
prosecution to prove not only that an offence had occurred, but that
the perpetrator had definitely known that his or her actions were
unlawful. If potential wrongdoers realised that, unauthorised
disclosures would become more likely. Equally, it would not be right to
convict somebody who has an honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief
that the circumstances made their actions legitimate. Therefore, we
believe that it is better, in making sure that the offence is an
effective deterrent and fairer to people whose details have been
disclosed, to put the onus on the defendant to prove that he or she
really did believe that what he or she did was legitimate. The
defendant can explain to the court what they thought, what they knew
and what they had been told by their managers. They need only prove
that what they are saying is true on the balance of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 38</div>probabilities&#151;that is, that it is more likely than not to be
true&#151;which is a lower hurdle than the prosecution faces in
proving the main elements of the offence. Such a provision is not
uncommon and is consistent with the approach in the Television Licences
(Disclosure of Information) Act 2000 and in legislation that protects
social security information in the hands of the Department for Works
and Pensions, such as section 123 of the Social Security Administration
Act 1992.</div><a name="07011885000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bath mentioned article 6 of the European convention on human
rights. We are confident that the provision complies with the
convention. Article 6(2) requires that every person charged with a
criminal offence be presumed innocent until proved guilty. However, the
court in Strasbourg and the courts in the UK have ruled that there is
no absolute prohibition on provisions that impose a burden of proof on
defendants. States must confine any legal reverse-burden
provision</div><a name="07011885000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;within
reasonable limits which take into account the importance of what is at
stake and maintain the rights of the
defence&#148;.</div><a name="07011885000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Each provision
must be judged on its own merits and we believe that the provision in
the Bill is reasonable. The offence has the important purpose of
deterring the unlawful disclosure of personal information about
individuals. The penalty on conviction is significant, as befits the
need to protect personal information, but is not exceptionally severe.
Acquitting the defendant if there are extenuating circumstances is
right, but placing on him or her the onus of proving what he or she
believed at the time of the disclosure of information is also right,
not least because that defence relates to matters mainly within his or
her own knowledge. The prosecution would be placed at a significant
disadvantage if it was for them to prove that the defendant did not
believe that he was acting with lawful authority. That would weaken the
deterrent effect, which is an important part of the
offence.</div><a name="07011885000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light
of those explanations, we ask for the amendment to be
withdrawn.</div><a name="07011885000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000464"></a>Mr.
Foster:</b> The Minister has given us a lot of food for
thought. I am sure that we want to digest the words later. I therefore

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000465"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in
clause 5, page 4, line 9, after
&#145;switchover&#146;, insert</div>
<a name="07011885000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;, which must treat digital retail
television services and digital television broadcasting platforms
equally in respect of all aspects mentioned, including pricing, brand
names, availability and packages
and&#146;.</div><a name="07011885000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I very
much hope that the amendment is appropriately drafted for the remarks
that I intend to make in the remaining 10 minutes of the sitting. The
amendment is designed to make it absolutely clear
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 39</div>the BBC, or the scheme operator involved in targeted help for
switchover, ensures that the advice that it gives to those in receipt
of help is platform neutral, as the jargon of digital television has
it. As hon. Members will know, one is able to access digital television
through a variety of mediums. There is the set-top box, with the brand
name freeview; a satellite receiver, mainly through Sky, which I have
mentioned before, which also operates a subsidised scheme called
freesat; and cable, the dominant operator effectively being
NTL-Telewest.</div><a name="07011885000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are at present a number of difficulties with that wealth of choice
because freeview, which is the scheme that the BBC promotes, is, as one
might expect, the most widely used scheme. It involves no subscription,
merely the purchase of a set-top box. Also, pertinently, it has behind
it the massive marketing power of the BBC which regularly promotes
digital terrestrial television by the brand name freeview, whereas it
obviously does not refer to the opportunities to receive a programme
through Sky or NTL-Telewest. That obviously gives freeview a massive
marketing opportunity.</div>
<a name="07011885000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Government have made
clear&#151;from the point of view of the taxpayer, this is a sensible
point&#151;they intend to make available in the targeted switchover
scheme the cheapest possible form of digital television. That will be
through a digital set-top
box.</div><a name="07011885000279"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000466"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I do not know whether it would assist the hon.
Gentleman, but has he had a chance to look at the help scheme document
which we deposited in the Library before Christmas? It makes it crystal
clear that the help scheme will be operated on a platform-neutral
basis.</div><a name="07011885000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000467"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> That is made clear, but I fail to see how that can
be compatible with the fact that the help scheme will also be operated
on the basis of the cheapest option available, which has to be a
set-top box rather than a satellite receiver. Anyone who wants to
upgrade will have to pay an additional sum. Given that the Minister has
made that admission, no doubt he will have no problem with writing into
the Bill the need for platform
neutrality.</div><a name="07011885000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07011885000468"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jamie Reed</b> (Copeland) (Lab): One of the issues that has
emerged from the Whitehaven area in recent weeks and months is that
take-up of Sky has gone through the roof. That is an important point
when considering platform
neutrality.</div><a name="07011885000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000469"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> It certainly is. As there is an increasing
consensus that there is a need for platform neutrality I assume that
hon. Members will be keen to ensure that that is written into the
Bill.</div> <a name="07011885000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been in
correspondence with some of the operators other than the BBC, who say
that although they fully expect the Minister to say that an amendment
is unnecessary, that is not their view. They point to their experience
with the BBC, which is happy 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 40</div>to refer to digital terrestrial television by its well-known brand name,
freeview. The commercial operators who must compete against the BBC are
keen to see platform neutrality written into the
Bill.</div><a name="07011885000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000470"></a>Mr.
Woodward:</b> I hope that I can deal with amendment No. 7
relatively quickly. Its purpose seems to be to insert a legal assurance
into the Bill. The questions are whether that is necessary and whether
the clause is the right place in which to make that insertion. I
understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve, but I am not
sure that his amendment would
succeed.</div><a name="07011885000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition of digital switchover help scheme in the Bill is just
that&#151;a definition. It is neither workable nor practicable to
amend the definition by placing substantive conditions on the way in
which the scheme operates. Those conditions will, rightly, be included
in the scheme agreement with the BBC and in the various contractual
arrangements that will underpin the scheme.</div>
<a name="07011885000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am more than happy to offer
the hon. Gentleman assurances that digital switchover will be conducted
on a platform-neutral basis. The White Paper says that the Government
will continue to be platform-neutral in its public policy, and we have
reiterated that principle in relation to the help scheme. I have drawn
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to the digital help scheme
document, which was deposited in the Library before Christmas and which
sets that out
clearly.</div><a name="07011885000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our policy is
to support a wider range of digital platforms because that means more
choice for consumers. Digital switchover has always been about choice
for consumers&#151;not just choice of programmes and channels, but
choice of platforms. Our policies on the help scheme and on digital
switchover generally are built on the principle of platform neutrality.
The amendment would do nothing to add to that well established policy.
As the clause is about definition and because it is neither workable
nor practicable to amend the definition in a way that places
substantive conditions on the way in which the scheme operates, I ask
the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="07011885000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07011885000471"></a>Mr.
Vaizey:</b> I hear what the Minister says, and I understand
that he will resist the amendment. I do not intend to press it to a
vote, but I want to reiterate a number of
points.</div><a name="07011885000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that the document published by his Department makes it clear that
the scheme will be platform neutral. He may be referring to paragraph
5.25 of that document, but it is merely words and makes it absolutely
clear that if someone does not take a digital set-top box, but takes an
integrated system, a satellite system or a cable system, they will be
required to pay the difference between the cost of a set-top box and
the cost of those slightly more sophisticated systems. On any analysis,
that is not an equal choice and I cannot see how it can be reconciled
with what any hon. Member would assume is platform neutrality or,
layman&#146;s terms, a level playing
field.</div><a name="07011885000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we debated
an earlier amendment, the Minister referred to the obvious point that
the Bill must comply with disability legislation. Many of the
organisations involved in advocating the rights of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 41</div>disabled groups say that the basic set-top box will not have the
interactivity and technical complexity to access the sort of services
that many people with severe disabilities, particularly visual
impairment, require. I urge the Minister to accept the spirit of the
amendment and to ensure that the most vulnerable people in our society
have a genuine free
choice.</div><a name="07011885000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
